Every new pc I owned, every operating system I installed, had to have Half-Life ready to go. Had my original disk shattered while moving to a new house about 11 years ago. A little part of me died that day. I'd still have the same goosebumps if I get to hear that lambda alarm sound during install that checks your sound driver.

Já fiquei muito admirado desde a primeira vez que joguei em época de lan house. Claro que o foco era o CS, mas Half-Life tinha o seu espaço reservado nas minhas horas pagas. Jogo de enredo muito complexo e misterioso. É difícil de entender completo o enredo zerando só uma vez. Fiz questão de comprar esse game agora nos tempos modernos para zera-lo mais uma vez e assim com a cabeça de hoje em dia conseguir entender melhor sobre a história. Sobre o gameplay ele é direto e com alguns pequenos loadings para carregar o restante do cenário. Jogabilidade é muito boa, por isso justificando o sucesso de CS. Pra mim, gráficos não é problema e não tenho isso de não jogar games antigos por causa de gráfico. O jogo tem uma certa dificuldade mesmo jogando no médio por conta do nível de HP baixo em alguns trechos deixando ele desafiador. Recomendo que salve o seu progresso manualmente antes de alguma grande batalha ou partes de riscos, pq se você morrer nesses pontos, o jogo vai te levar bem atrás tendo que fazer muita coisa tudo de novo kkk.\n Half-Life... um jogo que te deixa com várias perguntas, um jogo que te faz jogar prestando atenção em cada detalhe, um jogo que te permite fazer ''escolhas'' como salvar ou não alguém e assim em diante...  1998... um jogo desse em 1998... realmente é um marco no mundo dos games. Ainda tenho esperanças de um Half-Life 3, pq história pra contar, ainda tem muita. \n Quem é G-Man? Ou melhor... o que é o G-Man? Qual o seu propósito? Porque ele faz o que faz?  São perguntas que só são respondidas em teorias pela internet.\n Bom... é isso. Com certeza recomendo para todos que curte essas histórias que te faz pensar, que curte FPS e principalmente para os amantes de CS. Pq foi daqui, de Half-Life, que surgiu um dos maiores fenômenos dos jogos de tiro em primeira pessoa.\n Obrigado pela atenção de todos.\nNOTA: 8.5/10","timestamp_created":1531324941,"timestamp_updated":1534943374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43466764","author":{"steamid":"76561198355293121","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":782,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":782,"last_played":1531525610},"language":"english","review":"     1","timestamp_created":1531323479,"timestamp_updated":1531323479,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43465744","author":{"steamid":"76561198811843402","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2034,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1658569551},"language":"turkish","review":"nonstanji yaşatacak güzel bir platform bence oyun uzun silah çeşitliliği çov ayrıca türkçe yamayı kurmanızı öneririm","timestamp_created":1531320088,"timestamp_updated":1531320088,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535452306270599365","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43463599","author":{"steamid":"76561198382560194","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":304,"last_played":1636365601},"language":"schinese","review":"怎么说呢   好好的一款射击游戏硬是被我玩成了恐怖游戏   幸好猎头蟹不是即死的不然画面太美\n难度很高.......  操作手感很飘~~~~~~    手残噩梦............","timestamp_created":1531312038,"timestamp_updated":1531312038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43459936","author":{"steamid":"76561198259285147","num_games_owned":357,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":574,"last_played":1606630579},"language":"english","review":"good game but no despacito 2 in soundtrack.","timestamp_created":1531296121,"timestamp_updated":1531296121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43458956","author":{"steamid":"76561198021252986","num_games_owned":234,"num_reviews":335,"playtime_forever":15,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15,"last_played":1531208915},"language":"russian","review":"Первая часть half-life лично для меня оказалась не столь интересной, как вторая, ещё с достимовских времён.

I can remember where to go and what I needed to do in the past areas pretty well, but this one had me turn around a few times and go back towards something, in retrospect, that was super obvious I had missed the first time around.\n\nThe fps aspect is okay.

The storytelling is based on the environment and on the excellent gameplay, the soundtrack is amazing and the levels are very well designed. There are a lot of good mods that will keep the players busy after completing the main story, the multiplayer is also alive with couple hundreds players online all the time.

Are not beautiful, infact, horrible but that doesn't mean I won't keep on playing it, because If I started playing it in the early morning, I must finish the game in the same day, or I'll never forgive myself, and I can finish the game in a few hours no worries.\n\nTo those who are interested in FPS, this one is a VERY old FPS, so don't expect much, and if you're looking for a Fast Action game, there can't be much at the start, but mostly you might come across a few enemies or just a pack of them, and there will be a lot of Navigating in this game, just incase, if you are looking for a Story-Related game, THIS game is a good one.\n\nBecause it has ended for a while, but it Continued in Half-Life 2, and it's Episodes. But, the last Episode of the game was left the community on a cliff hanger, the whole Half-Life Community was so disapointed and upset about it, everyone is still waiting, for the Half-Life 3 to come out, or even Half-Life 2: Episode 3 or come out, one of'em.

Today we still see Valves games as some of the best  with games such as Portal 1 and 2 and Counter Strike and Team Fortress still being relevant to this day. I can see how this game use to be revolutionary for it's time for not using cutscene for example to narrate a good story. However concering this steam version, the Quake engine seems very outdated and the game is buggy forcing me to look online for solutions for glitches that should not be in a game and were keeping me from progressing in the story. I think it's a damn shame for a game of the reputation where I was looking really forward to playing and experiencing all of the Half Life story and possibly be part of the crowd wshing for HL3. I guess I will just resume in watching some online game play of it and then continue with HL2.","timestamp_created":1531070922,"timestamp_updated":1531070922,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43404887","author":{"steamid":"76561198801453039","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1651236546},"language":"english","review":"guud","timestamp_created":1531068877,"timestamp_updated":1531068877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43403944","author":{"steamid":"76561198256747732","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":436,"last_played":1501249165},"language":"russian","review":"ЭТА ШЕДЕВР!!1!1!1!1!","timestamp_created":1531066264,"timestamp_updated":1531066264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43403632","author":{"steamid":"76561198828727776","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1658088942},"language":"turkish","review":"Bende bunun 1.5 sürümü vardı.(İnternet kafe kopyası)\nEFsane bir oyun.
