Killing Floor.... was soll ich nur dazu schreiben??? Erst mal die Erklärung: Killing Floor ist ein Egoshooter, aus dem Jahre 2010, dass uhrsprünglch als Mod für Unreal 2004 entstanden ist. \" Nun gehts in die Heise Phase... viele Fragen sich warum sollte ich Killing Floor holen wenn ich auch L4D(2) haben könnte. Klar kann man auch sagen Killingfloor hat keine \"Story\" bzw. tick schlechtere Grafik. Das stimmt auch bedingt, nur ist Killing Floor ideal für Leute die gerne in einer Gruppe spielen. Und nun die Vorteile die Killing Floor bietet. Da wäre zum einen die möglichkeit das man Killing Floor mit bis zu 6 Spielern offiziel spielen kann, und auf manchen Servern mit bis zu 40 Spielern. Dabei skalliert Killing Floor die Gegnermenge nach Anzahl der Spieler, und Spawnt je nach Truppe verschiedene Monster Typen Gruppen um denn Spieler aus der Ruhe zu bringen. Dazu gibt es noch einen Sandbox Modus in dem man einstellen kann wie viele Mops Spawnen sollen und welche Typen an Monstern. Hinzu kommt das man mehrere Klassen auswählen kann, die alle ihre speziellen Boni haben. Diese können mit erfüllen von Aufgaben wie etwa \"Macht XY Headshoots.\" oder \" Heilt so und so oft Spieler\" leveln, um diese Boni zu steigern und neue Freizuspielen. Die Runden spielen sich wie ne mischung aus L4D(2) und CS, da man pro Kill und Abgeschlossene Welle Geld bekommt das man bei einem Trader, gg Waffen eintauschen kann. Dabei gibt es aber eine Limitierung sodas man genau Abwegen muss wann man welche Waffe kauft und wann man eine Lieber verkauft. Nun kommen wir aber zum Thema \"Story\" an sich gibt, bzw gab es nur denn \"Wellen/Survivor\" Modus, allerdings gibt es mehrere verschiedene Mods und Maps für das Game, darunter auch Map's mit einem Story modus. Und diese haben es teilweise insich. Im großen und ganzen kann ich jedem Killing Floor empfehlen der gerne mit Freunden spielt und es Knackig Hard mag.  \n\nMfg.

This game isn't like the hugely popular Left 4 Dead series but instead you are made to kill the hordes to advance to the next wave of monsters. Killing Floor doesn't rely on a story because there really isn't one but what makes this game shine is its co-op aspect and classes (perks as they are called in the game.) There are several original perks that serve a special task for the team and can range from your old fashioned gunner to a melee beserker, medic to help heal, and even a support class to help weld up doors to slow down the hordes. \n\nWhile Killing Floor is tons of fun with a bunch of friends, there are some glitches and bugs with the game. One of the things I've noticed is that a lot of the servers don't show up under friend's server info in Steam thus making it hard to join your friend. Another problem that I've run into that's more of a nitpick is that some of the custom modded servers are severely glitchy and cause crashes more often than not. But that doesn't mean that Killing Floor is a bad game. It really is a blast to play with a ton of your friends rather than playing solo. If you can, buy this game when it goes on sale because it is one of the games that goes on sale often when Steam does one of its special sale events. Overall, I rate this game an 8.5/10.0.","timestamp_created":1362459108,"timestamp_updated":1362459108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"582812","author":{"steamid":"76561197972443524","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":50333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":49722,"last_played":1604113656},"language":"english","review":"People have compared this game to Left for Dead.

I can play it and it almost doesn't overheat mine. If I put my fan next to my computer it can go a solid 10 fps. The graphics looked pretty good when I saw my friend play on his computer. The game itself is also awesome. They have added many new maps and weapons over the years and they will likely continue this. You can win this game pretty easily if you don't lose.","timestamp_created":1361574287,"timestamp_updated":1361574287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5597338","author":{"steamid":"76561198052584080","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":39998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39646,"last_played":1657428448},"language":"english","review":"10/10 at least 500 of these hours were from when I was in high school- community's pretty dead now, but I am completely blinded by nostalgia and won't let that stop me from achievement hunting this relic","timestamp_created":1361570795,"timestamp_updated":1632244351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6475851","author":{"steamid":"76561198067113779","num_games_owned":383,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":5893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5489,"last_played":1634227315},"language":"english","review":"theres loads of mods for this game and its a great coop suvival game","timestamp_created":1361478149,"timestamp_updated":1361478149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1068457","author":{"steamid":"76561197985812708","num_games_owned":938,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":48,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48,"last_played":1361520000},"language":"german","review":"Ist eher meh.
