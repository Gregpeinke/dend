There is also a sequel to this game comming out in 2015, there are also various trailors for Killing floor  but talking about that would be going off topic. I will be talking about alot of the game features and you may not have time to read all of it or you might just not want to, you can skip to the final paragraph to read the final verdict. \n\nKilling floor is a zombie wave base survival game. You can play solo, or co-op with up to 6 other players. There are 5 difficulties you can play on - Beginner, Normal, Hard, Suicidal and finally Hell On Earth. There is a large variety of maps to play on, and you can also download many more maps on the steam work shop. There are seven different classes you can play as, as you play the game there are different challanges to do for each perk, which when completed will level up your perk. The highest level you can get a perk to is level 6. At a level 5 and 6 perk, you spawn with a weapon unique to the class you as. For example if you are a berserker you will spawn with an axe, where as if you were level 1-4 you would spawn with what everyone else who is level 1-4 spawns with. Some classes even allow you to spawn with a protective vest at level 5 or 6. The seven classes you can play as are the Field Medic, the Support Specialist, the Sharpshooter, the Commando, the Berserker, the Firebug and Demolitions. All these classes play in different ways.\n\nThe gameplay is based around surviving waves on enemies, and each wave there are more enemies, and at some higher waves better enemies spawn. After a wave is completed you have a minute to a minute and a half (depending on the dificulty) to get to a trader and buy weapons or ammo. You can change the number of waves from short, medium, long or custom. Short game consists of 4 waves on enemies, and then a fifth wave which is the boss wave. A medium wave has 7 waves of normal enemies, and then an 8th wave which is the boss wave. A long game has 10 rounds of normal enemies and then an 11th wave which is the boss round. After you kill the boss on the final round you will be awarded with an achievment (if it is the first time you have completed that map on every difficulty exept beginner) and even if you are dead you will still get the achievment. \n\nThe graphics in this game are not the best, but these graphics were good for their time, let me remind you this game was made in 2005. You can alter the graphics with various options from the menu which do improve the looks of this game. \n\nThere are 10 enemies in this game. You may think they are zombies but they are in fact specimens, they are failed experimental clones. The 10 specimens are called the Clot, Crawler, Gorefast, Stalker, Bloat, Husk, Siren, Scrake, Fleshpound and the boss from the final wave - The Patriach. The clot is the easiest of the enemies but has the ability to grab you (unless you are a high level berserker), this can be bad in close quaters situations or when you are being swarmed. The crawler (as you can imagine it crawls) is a small black thing with multiple legs and its main attack involves it jumping at you, making it a hard target to shoot. The gorefast, is a red enemy who has a blade in one of his hands, if you let him get to close to you, he will rage and run at you super fast and he can do some serious damage. The Stalker is a female enemy who goes stealth and strikes you from behind, if succesful it can do alot of damamge. The bloat, is a big fat green/yellow guy and one of his attacks if vometing, this poisons you and deals you damage over time, not a long time but it can still be dangerous, he also soaks up quite a few bullets but if you get head shots on him and can be a quick kill. The husk has a husk fireball launcher (a weapon the pyro can buy), he shoots at you from far, but he still tries to walk close to you, if he gets close to you, he will use his melee attack and hit you. The siren is a female enemy who walks fairly slowly but get close to her and you wont hear the end of it, her main attack is screaming, this muffles you visition and does you alot of damamge at higher difficuilties, she should definity be one of the first enemies you try to kill if you are kiting. The scrake looks like a butcher with a hockey mask, he has a chainsaw and if you get to close to him, he will go into a rage mode and run really fast, he can be really deadly if you dont stun him. The fleshpound is the hardest and most deadliest enemy not including the final boss. Up to three fleshpounds can come at once which is really bad. Fleshpounds are much like scrakes or gorefasts, if you get to close to ther fleshpound he will go rage, he will go from the colour yellow, to the colour red and he will charge at you really fast, he also has alot of hit points. \n\nThe final enemy is the Patriach, he is also the boss for the final round (other monsters also spawn on the final round while the patriach is healing). He has many attacks, he can shoot a rocket at you, he can shoot is arm gun at you, he can melee you and he can also go stealth (which he does alot). He will be in stealth alot but if you damamge him with a fire weapon you can see the flames moving around in the shape on him, which indicates to you where he is. He has alot of hit points and the best stratgy to kill him is to be the demolition class and place pipe bombs at the entrancers to doors, but make sure he cant see you are he will shoot and posibily detonate the pipe bombs. \n\nCo-op can be played with up to six other players, but if you play on modded servers i have seen one with up to 32 players. If more players join the game more enemies spawn and the enemies get slightly harder, but if you want to win some games and are not a very experienced player, i recomend to look for a server and play co-op to get use to the game. In co-op you can share guns with team mates and share money, by share i mean you drop them and then your team mates pick them up. You can not revive team mates so if you die you will spawn at the end of the round. \n\nWeapons are class specific, but you can find weapons scatered around the map along with ammo and if your lucky a vest. The weapons you buy will be cheaper if you are a higher level in the class you are playing as. Some weapons have an alternet shoot. For example if you have a medic gun you can shoot uneing the alternate shoot mode and if you shoot at a team mate you will heal them. Or as a berserker with melee weapons you can stun enemies, for exaple you can stun a husk by using the alternate attack. \n\nMy final verdict for this game is a 9/10. It has amazing co-op, a deep class/perk system, a wide variety of enemies and guns, so many maps, maps on the steam workshop, the ability to play solo, 5 different dificulties, lots of achievments, a challanging boss (on harder difficulties), collectibles hidden within maps, different skins which you can buy or get from achievments, custom servers. All in all it is a great game and i totally recommend you buy it, or atleest watch a video to see if it peaks your interest :)","timestamp_created":1419650171,"timestamp_updated":1419653685,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552585721015930176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13627326","author":{"steamid":"76561198134307744","num_games_owned":269,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":456,"last_played":1482108960},"language":"english","review":"one of the best zombie co-op games i've played! \n10/10 would kill zombies again!","timestamp_created":1419649630,"timestamp_updated":1419649630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13627274","author":{"steamid":"76561198166940942","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":584,"last_played":1525222536},"language":"spanish","review":"buenisimo\n","timestamp_created":1419649434,"timestamp_updated":1419649434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13627097","author":{"steamid":"76561198168465199","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14264,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":386,"last_played":1432749930},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente juego sin lugar a dudas...\n\nContiene grandes efectos tanto visual como auditiva lo cual da una mejor resolución al juego.\nContiene una gran apertura de armas entre ellas; escopetas, snipers, pistolas y se puede añadir tanto mapas como armas en el juego desde la Workshop.\n\nLo recomiendo!","timestamp_created":1419648796,"timestamp_updated":1419648796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13626976","author":{"steamid":"76561198098218122","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":708,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":638,"last_played":1443275787},"language":"english","review":"damn good game","timestamp_created":1419648415,"timestamp_updated":1419648415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13626068","author":{"steamid":"76561198112302598","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":512,"last_played":1413574420},"language":"english","review":"Awesome Game!","timestamp_created":1419645336,"timestamp_updated":1419645336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13625979","author":{"steamid":"76561197999960276","num_games_owned":300,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":21,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1319785200},"language":"french","review":"De la grosse merde.","timestamp_created":1419645014,"timestamp_updated":1419645014,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13625737","author":{"steamid":"76561198144423325","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":768,"last_played":1450040927},"language":"english","review":"Good Game","timestamp_created":1419644034,"timestamp_updated":1419644034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13625398","author":{"steamid":"76561198166067007","num_games_owned":270,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":353,"last_played":1480131196},"language":"english","review":"everybody should own this game and should plan on purchasing Killing Floor 2.

Recomendo sim, vale cada centavo.\nNota: 9,0","timestamp_created":1419605037,"timestamp_updated":1419605037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13612090","author":{"steamid":"76561198045013540","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":18660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1298,"last_played":1642301845},"language":"english","review":"This game made me British\n\nDOSH/10 Would become British again","timestamp_created":1419603920,"timestamp_updated":1419603920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13611167","author":{"steamid":"76561198136481774","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1159,"last_played":1525764760},"language":"russian","review":"ОТЛИЧНАЯ ИГРА ДЛЯ КОМПАНИИ С ДРУЗЬЯМИ","timestamp_created":1419600549,"timestamp_updated":1419600549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521786689758300781","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13610849","author":{"steamid":"76561198121331766","num_games_owned":339,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":8210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":949,"last_played":1650458357},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1419599276,"timestamp_updated":1632250771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509713947772979736","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13609149","author":{"steamid":"76561198072826812","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":15060,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7127,"last_played":1542458454},"language":"russian","review":"Замечательная игра )))","timestamp_created":1419592959,"timestamp_updated":1419592959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469798654317855835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13607795","author":{"steamid":"76561198115598660","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4450,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1589,"last_played":1558812910},"language":"english","review":"I love this game im addicting black ops zombies don't have nothing on this","timestamp_created":1419587137,"timestamp_updated":1419587137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13606971","author":{"steamid":"76561198046047170","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1645681132},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy bueno!!

Что касается одинчного режима здесь дела обстоят совсем плохо , играть в него скучно и весь интерес к игре проподает . Зато  в мультиплеере игра оживает на глазах . Также можно отметить многообразия разного оружия которое придётся по вкусу даже самому привередливому игроку . Конечно у игры есть и минусы , такие как  количество игроков на сервере их всего шесть , хотя это с легкостью решают сервера игровых сообществ на которые влезает до 40 человек  но статистика на этих серверах своя , что не может не печалить . Поскольку игра вышла в 2009 году велеколепной графики ожидать не стоит хотя она тут и не нужна , игра выезжает на геймплее .","timestamp_created":1419568837,"timestamp_updated":1480003497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13603396","author":{"steamid":"76561198040087332","num_games_owned":327,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":87645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50221,"last_played":1607811935},"language":"spanish","review":"A pesar de ser del año 2009 este juego continúa estando muy vivo, siempre suele haber disponibles varios servidores para jugar en el modo cooperativo y en cualquier dificultad, y debido a sus múltiples opciones de modo de jugabilidad es muy difícil que se nos pueda hacer repetitivo, pero por si acaso llega esa extraña situación la propia compañía ha tomado ya medidas al respecto.\n\nCoincidiendo con Navidad, Halloween y parte del verano, veremos que los enemigos se modifican completamente y toman una nueva apariencia relacionada con los acontecimientos de esas épocas del año.\n\nAdemás podremos desbloquear personajes completando logros específicos de los eventos. También la compañía aprovecha estos acontecimientos para añadir nuevos mapas y DLC de armas y personajes. Y, aparte de lo hace la propia compañía para evitar la rutina también tendremos la opción de jugar en alguno de los muchos servidores custom que existen donde veremos modificados mapas enemigos armas... Y por si esto fuera poco también podremos encontrar miles de artículos gratuitos en la workshop de steam para modificar algunos aspectos del juego a nuestro gusto.\n\nPor supuesto que este juego incluye exactamente 252 logros de steam, y al igual que en la gran mayoría de los juegos con logros algunos son muy simples y otros solo podrán ser superados por los mejores jugadores, La suma de todos los factores de este juego lo convierten en si no el mejor, uno de los mejores videojuegos de la historia dentro de este genero.\n\nLo mejor:\n\n-> Diferentes modos de juego \n-> Perfecto equilibrio entre las difcultades\n-> Practicamente imposible que se vuelva aburrido\n\nLo peor:\n\n-> Personajes con la misma voz.\n-> En el modo multijugador estamos expuestos a que se unan jugadores novatos y nos estropen la partida.\n-> La banda sonora puede resultar un poco repetitiva.\n\n-martt","timestamp_created":1419564662,"timestamp_updated":1419564906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz7epwsoCdKTyMw=="}
