I will take you through some pros and cons, to show what is great and not great.\n\nPROS:\n\n-This game is funny as sometimes i would burst out in laughterl.\n-Amazing gameplay. The portal gun creates so many things that you can do.\n-Fantastic puzzles. The sheer amount of creativness in this game is sick. Some puzzles is very simple, otheers complicated.\n-Amazing voice actors. Freaking Jk.Simmons voices a character!\n-More than one soloution to puzzles. (In most of them)\n-It is longer than the first one.\n-Mods so the game can always be played.\n-Amazing story. It is a very fun, and well written story, this game has. \n-A good concept.\n-Portal two is the of the thre games where i have watched, the outro.\n-Reasonable price\n\nCONS:\n-I am really bad at puzzle games, so this weren´t a problem for me, but the game might be a tad short, if you are a skilled puzzle game player.\n-Sometimes i think that it is a bit tedious when you stop doing the test chambers, and come out in these big massive rooms.\n-Long ass loading sceens and a lot of them\n\nOverall Portal 2 gets a 9.5 for me. I would recommend this game to EVERYONE EVER. It is without a doubt, on my top 3 games of all time list.","timestamp_created":1449406095,"timestamp_updated":1449407534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19524783","author":{"steamid":"76561198163494650","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":224,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1450031846},"language":"german","review":"Portal 2 ist ein super Spiel.

But every little bit of it is worth it for the ending...\n\nEdit:\nThis is my update 5 years later. Since first playing this game in 2015, I have played a lot of different PC games and the Portal games still continue to be my favorite games of all time. Valve did an amazing job (as usual) with the story and mechanics of these games. At this point, there is honestly no excuse for not having played these games. They can run on pretty much any PC and when they're on sale they cost about as much as a Starbucks cup of coffee. Portal can be casually beat in 1.5-2 hours, and Portal 2 takes about 8-10 hours. Please just play them, its worth your time I promise.","timestamp_created":1449334546,"timestamp_updated":1607901129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19504990","author":{"steamid":"76561198101495470","num_games_owned":551,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":346,"last_played":1614927946},"language":"brazilian","review":"To gostando muito, é  o primeiro Portal que jogo,é desafiante e legal por ter esses portais..

Puzzles(enigmas) incríveis, jogabilidade muito boa, gostei muito, e se a pessoa terminar a campanha e quiser algo mais, ainda tem a oficina do jogo que lhe permite criar fases e jogar as fases das outras pessoas, ou seja, criatividade e possbilidades beirando ao infinito. Os elementos do jogo são muito bem empregados, basicamente você vai usar portais em puzzles com lasers, caixas e muito mais coisas, tudo em função dos portais. Quando o jogo é jogado em coop(coperação) a complexidade aumenta 1000%, os puzzles ficam muito mais interessantes e difíceis, além de ser divertido jogar em dupla. Roda em computadores muito fracos.\n\nPONTOS NEGATIVOS: Jogabilidade do personagem restringida apenas à movimentação tridimensional, ao uso de armas de portais(apenas 2 portais por jogador) e também à possibilidade de segurar objetos, poderia ter mais coisas que o personagem poderia fazer, porém ainda sim dá pra fazer bastante coisa só com isso, acredite. Visual do cenário pobre, o que deixa o jogo muito mais objetivo e \"fechado\", além de mais fácil também, porque em um cenário todo branco, fica mais fácil de notar as coisas, eu sei que tem a ver com a história e tudo mais, porém tem trechos do jogo onde nem tudo é branco, e poderiam usar aquele contexto para fazer fases diferenciadas.
