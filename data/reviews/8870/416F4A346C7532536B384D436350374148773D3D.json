I was afraid it would turn out to be just another Bioshock (Big Daddy, Big Sis, now what?). I also thought that the huge values of ammo everywhere I read about would just make this game even more dumb and boring then the previous ones. I'm glad it didn't come to that (there are some place in story where you have to play sort of efficiently). \n\nSo I'm pretty pleased with this game. In a point of a view, this game is still a Bioshock. The approach, \"lore\", guns, vigor (or \"magic\" if you prefer :) ), everything has the same feel. The one thing that really surprised me was the story - I haven't felt like this in previous Bioshocks (the stories there felt like something sewed up on last minute to get the \"shooter\" some sence). Also the ending is quite touching (nothing original really, but i wasn't expecting that... still you have that feeling you know what might be coming, but you're not sure until it does, so it's a \"good feelin\"). \nThere're some bugs yes, but nothing gamebreaking (got stucked 1 time in scripted event, but the checkpoint restart helped). \nSo yes, I liked this game and I do recommend it.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nAudio (music, ambient, voiceacting): 8/10\nStory: 8,5/10\nGameplay: 7/10\n\nTotal: 8/10\n\nReally worth the money and the time.","timestamp_created":1387972307,"timestamp_updated":1387972827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8272388","author":{"steamid":"76561198001014227","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1387296194},"language":"german","review":"dayum!","timestamp_created":1387971713,"timestamp_updated":1480087692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8272381","author":{"steamid":"76561198062222986","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":561,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":325,"last_played":1412348895},"language":"german","review":"*______*","timestamp_created":1387971695,"timestamp_updated":1387971695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8272324","author":{"steamid":"76561198024479164","num_games_owned":339,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":971,"last_played":1649941623},"language":"english","review":"I would have to say this is probably the greatest game I have ever played.

One of the best i've seen. However this is by far it's strongest point. The gameplay is soso and the story also soso (it's a bit too fantasy for me) I must say the game didn't seem very innovative at all or unique as far as gameplay went. Hugely overrated in my opinion. The fact that it got a 94 on metacritic baffles me. That kind of score gives the impression that the game is basically going to rock your socks off. Just didn't happen for me. I litterally felt i over paid for this game when  i bought it about 6 months after it's release for 75 percent off or more. It just didn't do it for me. Like another reviewer said it starts off really strong for about the first 15 min. With all it's visual awesomeness and Imersion. However almost imediately after the fighting starts it quickly reveals the gameplay to be very primitive. After having played through the whole game i realized i hardly ever even used the vigors which really didn't even add any fun to the game. Just a necessity sometimes if you're playing on hard and there's a group of enemies all shooting at you. All the vigors are basically stuns. Crows, swarms enemies with crows and they flail around like being swarmed with bees for a couple seconds. Bronco Bounces them up if i recall correctly. You have some electrical shock thing that stuns them. I mean almost all of them basically functioned the same way just a different theme and some are more effective than others. I found that first one you get with the cartoon picture of a devil to be completely useless other than when you first get it. Man i could just go on and on about things that weren't very well designed as far as gameplay is concerned. The fact that you can only carry two weapons with very limited ammo seems well really fucking stupid if you spent all your money upgrading the weapons you think are best then run out and have to pick up a really shitty weapon and just unload it on one of the weaker enemies faces only to find he's STILL NOT DEAD GOTTA RELOAD AND SHOOT HIM SOME MORE IN THE FACE. Seriously any and every COD or BF game that i've played and i've playe d most of them was more fun than this game. Yet i don't think there has been a single COD or BF that has been rated this high. So i have to conclude that this game gave all the critics boners just because it's bioshock and it looks pretty and they liked the story whch is kinda stupid. *SPOILER ALERT* +_[[[Mr dewit is Comstock who travels back in time to steal his own daughter...]]]_+ Man that's fucking stupid writing in my opinion. One of those really dumb parodoxes. Really any time a story has time traveling to the past i don't know how anyone can take it seriously especially when they travel to a time where they not only existed but they interact with themselves.

Enough so that I would not recommend this game to most players.\n\nBioshock Infinite holds a scary resemblence to Assassin's Creed (the first one) not in the sense that the setting or story are the same, but both have a great story and terrible gameplay. Like in Assassin's Creed, Bioshock Infinite has you doing the same things in the same scenarios over and over again while trying to switch it up by adding new elements to the same system. This repetitive style of development is completely transparent after your first handful of encounters and while not even halfway through the game, you can tell there is no end in sight to the repetition. In order to get through the plot, one has to hack and slash one's way through the dull gameplay; an uphill battle from which I chose to retreat from after about a third of the way into the game.\n\nI applaud both Bioshock Infinite and Assassin's Creed for their efforts in storytelling, as it's a quality that is severely lacking in the video game industry and rarely explored. The Assassin's Creed team learned from their mistakes and hit a homerun with their second installment, Assassin's Creed II. Hopefully the Bioshock team will also learn from theirs and create a game that can tell a riveting tale as well as engage the player. However, Bioshock Infinite simply does not cut it.","timestamp_created":1387943592,"timestamp_updated":1387943592,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497299015522003174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8266156","author":{"steamid":"76561198013392389","num_games_owned":536,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2501,"last_played":1379749533},"language":"english","review":"It's a great game. Some fans of the previous Bioshocks might be a bit put of because the system and setting of the game are a bit different, and it's kind of non-canon even though there are references here and there. They added a shield system and got rid of those syringes for healing, and there are now upgrading stations for health, mana or shields hidden throughout. There are a few other gameplay changes, essentially simplifying and streamlining everything. Some people might view these as dumbing it down and succumbing to popular conventions, but I thought it was actually a welcome change. The story is absolutely mind blowing, but I've noticed that at least some of the fan base is divided on the ending. I thought it was brilliant, albeit really tough to follow if you weren't really on the ball with studying backstory throughout and whatnot. If you are willing to invest in the story, it will reward you. That aside, Elizabeth, your sidekick and companion throughout the game, is very real and I genuinely came to enjoy her company. She's one of the most relatable and enjoyable characters I've seen in games in a good while. A word on Columbia, the setting of the game; I absolutely LOVE it. I love designs from in and around that era, and I enjoy the departure from the gritty, dark atmosphere of Rapture. Despite its surface cheeriness, it belies a city governed with corruption and a storm of revolution brewing. I say definitely pick this game up, it will be worth your while whether or not you liked the previous two.","timestamp_created":1387942634,"timestamp_updated":1387942634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493920981884002686","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8266085","author":{"steamid":"76561198017057530","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1032,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":697,"last_played":1545759348},"language":"english","review":"THIS GAME IS GOOD\n\nBUY IT\n\n!!","timestamp_created":1387942307,"timestamp_updated":1387942307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8265934","author":{"steamid":"76561198110670175","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":615,"last_played":1489551596},"language":"english","review":"Great game!\n","timestamp_created":1387941644,"timestamp_updated":1387941644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8265561","author":{"steamid":"76561198010639967","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1073,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1073,"last_played":1387910316},"language":"english","review":"Im a little behind on the times, but this was a great game.

Від місцевих пейзажів подеколи перехоплює дух, так і завмираєш на мить… милуєшся і думаєш – ось так би виглядав рай земний. Музика гармонійно доповнює дійство на екрані, вона підносить BioShock на високий культурний рівень.\nНеосяжно глибока - в голові паморочиться від сюжетних поворотів, від морально-етичних, філософських, релігійних, психологічних, наукових посилів авторів. Головні персонажі справжні, живі, цікаві. Елізабет – це окремий Всесвіт, від якого не відірвати погляд… який зачаровує.\nBioShock Infinite цікава не лише з естетичної точки зору (не була б вона грою) - ґеймплей не дозволить вам сумувати, оскільки він різноманітний, динамічний, завжди варіативний, з дещицею додаткових занять на дозвіллі.\n\nЦе найяскравіше, що потрапляє в очі і залишається у пам’яті, хоча впевнений, що гурмани і естети зможуть розповісти про цю гру ще багато всього хорошого. А недоліків суттєвих не помічено, та й зовсім не хочеться їх шукати.\nЗрештою, краще скуштувати і оцінити цю страву самому.\n\nАплодисменти і подяка розробникам!\n","timestamp_created":1387917799,"timestamp_updated":1387917799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581749081611633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8259552","author":{"steamid":"76561198029448510","num_games_owned":455,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":879,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":811,"last_played":1458236541},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I've EVER played.
