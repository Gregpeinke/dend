It tries very hard to have the same impact, but the problem is that overall it's a collection of too many ideas (anarchism/communism vs the industrial magnate, the parallel universe theory, quantum physics supporting a city (lol), and various metaphysical/supernatural elements). No idea is given enough focus that it deserves and characters get forgotten pretty quick. The first two games had the strength of building the characters throughout the whole game. Elizabeth is also incredibly disappointing: her voice lines are canned and repetitive (what, this little lock? I'll give it a whirl) and she is not a character so much as a car that drives you from plot univers to plot universe. The overall writing is quite silly (\"Wait a minute, that card.....\" and \"Aren't you going to ask me it??\" \"what?\" \"My little finger!\"). So in my view, the plot and story and dialogue and overall feel of bioshock infinite is subpar.\n\n\n\nHOWEVER. That means that I look at Bioshock Infinite as a combat game and nothing more. People have criticized it for being a two-gun shooter with regenerating sheilds, and it's true. But it is without a doubt one of the finest two-gun shooters ever created. \n\nThe vigors are a massive upgrade from Bioshock 1 and 2, and make up for the lack of gun choice. You are instead encouraged to move around the arenas, scavenging weapons from enemies to keep up variety, while hitting enemies with every tool on your belt with the vigor combinations. Every one is useful in some way, and on my playthroughs I usually rotated between 4 or 5 in almost constant use. \n\nThe level design and overall aesthetic is fantastic. It's a floating city, enough said. The combat arenas are really a step forward in FPS design, with the rails and platform design making the arenas feel huge and vertical. Infinite definitely influenced other fast-paced shooters in this regard. Jumping off a rail, shooting somebody with lightning, blasting a crowd into the air, then dashing halfway across the map and exploding 5 levitating targets is an incredible feeling. Learn how the gear system works and how to combine vigors best and you'll feel like god. While there's a bunch I think this game got wrong, the combat is top-notch and that's why I love this game.","timestamp_created":1502687973,"timestamp_updated":1502688576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34228872","author":{"steamid":"76561198192732371","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1239,"last_played":1532135645},"language":"schinese","review":"流程太短QWQ，有个几百个小时的过程就差不多了","timestamp_created":1502686766,"timestamp_updated":1502686766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34227025","author":{"steamid":"76561198283498293","num_games_owned":458,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":823,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":740,"last_played":1638703659},"language":"schinese","review":"生化奇兵无限是我玩过的fps游戏中最富含深度的作品了，\n他没有太过出色的射击手感，选择并不多样的枪械，\n但是其曲折迷离的剧情以及十分出色的友军AI还是赚的了好评\n这部作品无疑是当下快餐游戏中的清流\n伊丽莎白，她真是太棒了♂","timestamp_created":1502676597,"timestamp_updated":1502676597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34223236","author":{"steamid":"76561198025155283","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1362,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1362,"last_played":1502659076},"language":"brazilian","review":"Eu quero uma tatuagem desse jogo!

By those merits alone, this game is a bit of a modern classic.\n\nHowever, being an exclusively single player game, it leans heavily on its writing and storytelling. The writing plays out like Brian the Dog heard of multiverse theory one day and immediately started writing depressing (yet surprisingly ultra violent) sci fi stories. There is this sense of dreary, self-loathing moralizing, which would be fine, if it actually went anywhere. The characters seem to have relatable elements on the surface but inevitably descend into a long-winded fallibility trap that is exhausting, aimless, stale, and unrewarding. None of the choices the player makes have any significant impact on the outcome.\n\nThe main game ending, while controversial, was not a dealbreaker; it actually seemed like it might be setting up the DLCs to resolve some of the self contradictions. Unfortunately, the DLCs play out so poorly, it actually ruins the whole experience leading up to them and it just makes the previous issues all the more ridiculous.\n\nIt doesn't sound like there will be any more Bioshock games, but hopefully Kevin will hire some writers for his next project.\n\nIf you haven't already picked this up, wait for deep discounts ($5 for the game and all DLCs).","timestamp_created":1502358498,"timestamp_updated":1502358498,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.449387073516845703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34142011","author":{"steamid":"76561197993423160","num_games_owned":583,"num_reviews":170,"playtime_forever":1110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1110,"last_played":1407638413},"language":"turkish","review":"Bitmesini istemediğiniz o mutlu anlar olur ya, işte bu oyun onun gibi birşey ;) İndirime girdiğinde, DLC lerini mutlaka alın.

As motivações do personagem principal não são claras no começo do gameplay, mas ao desenrolar da história tudo vai se explicando aos poucos. E não é pre-requisito jogar Bioshock 1 e 2 antes, uma vez que a história não tem nada a ver com os outros.\n\nInovação seria uma ótima palavra para definir esta obra de arte. Uma obra que conseguiu se desprender dos jogos anteriores, sem perder a essência do que o faz ser um BioShock.\n\nCom acontecimentos bem anteriores ao primeiro jogo da franquia, tomando lugar em 1912, BioShock Infinite conta a história de um homem afundado em dívidas (Booker Dewitt), contratado para resgatar uma garota (Elizabeth) na cidade voadora de Columbia.\nAs tramas envolvendo a cidade, desde sua criação até seu governo atual, são extremamente bem desenvolvidas, mostrando o lado preconceituoso, hipócrita e ganancioso de um homem (tema já abordado anteriormente na franquia).\nRepleto de ação muito boa, com jogabilidade fluída e combate incrível, apesar de repetitivo em certas partes. O fato de o jogador poder carregar apenas duas armas, faz com que se pare para realmente analisá-las e aumenta a tensão em combates.\nMesmo com a jogabilidade extraordinária e suas mecânicas divertidíssimas envolvendo os aerotrilhos, o foco principal é dado ao enredo e aos personagens. A história é sensacional, mexendo com fendas espaço-temporais e realidades paralelas. Tem uma trama super complexa e bem trabalhada, com revelações emocionantes, fazendo o desfecho ser de arrepiar.\nHá, durante o game, pequenas ações dadas às escolhas do jogador, mas estas não influenciam em nada ao seu decorrer, o que é uma grande pena, mas não tira, de modo algum, o brilho desta obra.\n\nBioShock Infinite é emotivo, essencialmente bem desenvolvido, inovador, extasiantemente lindo (em questões visuais, principalmente), com cenários bem modelados, e é com certeza um dos melhores jogos que eu já joguei.

In a way, Rapture was the lead character in the original Bioshock, and it could be argued that Columbia is the same for Infinite. Visually, it is even more awe inspiring than Rapture, and I often found myself stopping just to look around and take it all in. Its not just cosmetic though, Columbia is fascinating to learn about, and just like Rapture its not as idyllic as it seems, though I obviously won't ruin the details.\nWhat this game tends to be praised for the most though is its story, and it thoroughly deserves to be. The player controlled protagonist Booker DeWitt is well acted by Troy Baker, and his personal story is full of depth. The supporting protagonist Elizabeth is in my opinion the best supporting character, or 'follower' in any video game; both in terms of her role in the story and the way she works in the game itself. As a follower, Elizabeth is a breath of fresh air. She's interesting as a character sure, but she also finds you ammo, health, and salts (the new EVE) right when you really need them. You are never required to 'escort' her, and she has no direct role in combat. Elizabeth also moves around the world realistically, never getting in your way and reacting to events and points of interest in the world. The characters are excellent all around.\nThe actual gameplay itself is fantastic too. Gunplay feels fluid and accurate, and the variety of guns is on par with the original game. It is unfortunate though that gun upgrades don't provide a visual change like they did in Bioshock, but on the other hand there is way more variety. 'Vigors' replace the plasmids of the previous two games, though they work the same. The vigors of Bioshock Infinite are a lot more interesting though. Some are just reworked plasmids, but there are multiple ways to use each of them, and all in all they are very fun to use.\nThe only negative things I could say about Bioshock Infinite are nitpicks. The lack of visual representation for the gun upgrades, and fact that you can only carry two weapons at once rather than a whole arsenal are the only things I can think of, and they are really inconsequential. I do not believe that a perfect game exists, and for me at least, a 10/10 is not a perfect game, but a game that is absolutely unmissable, and considered a masterpiece. Bioshock Infinite succeeds in everything it sets out to do. For me, it even tops the original Bioshock, and any game that can do that is a masterpiece.\n\nAn essential game for any gamer's collection.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1502238863,"timestamp_updated":1508725544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34113480","author":{"steamid":"76561198329087095","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":931,"last_played":1502857219},"language":"english","review":"OK.

As a Bioshock game, it's quite a letdown.\n\nTo be short, the game takes after a completely different setting than the previous games before. It's much brighter, outside, and while the graphics and visuals look beautiful, there's a lot less to explore in the game. The map structure is much more linear, which isn't horrible, but there is far less backtracking and hidden secrets in the maps compared to the previous titles.\n\nThe AI is just laughable while they stand around shouting and waiting for you to approach them. On lower difficulties their aim is shoddy and on high difficulties they are still decently easy to defeat. The AI isn't all that exciting, there are more tasking than they are challenging. \n\nElizabeth herself is a decent companion to have by your side. She doesn't do much though. Need ammo? She'll throw you some. Low on money? She's like a walking Meowth always coming up with more cash out of nowhere, but it's a nice plus nontheless. Her ability to tear placements within the map is rather a good idea in the game. It changed up some of the gameplay helping you to have an edge in some situations.\n\nThe weapons are really a big letdown to me. You can ONLY carry 2 weapons with you at a time, and it takes some of the fun out of the gameplay. The upgrades are still nice to have but they are expensive, leaving you a limited number of times you'll ever upgrade in-game. On top of the 2 weapon limit, you don't get to experience the other weapons and the potential they have as much, especially as you progress through the game. Lack of ammo was an issue in some parts of the game, possibly an issue since I was being liberal with my ammo at times.\n\nThe vigors (esentially the plasmids from the first 2 games) are decent, and rather interesting for combat. While a good portion of them aren't that great for most combat uses, I almost found myself playing the whole game without even needing to use them. They felt as if they were just there to make combat slightly more interesting. Essentially, it wasn't a bad thing, they are needed for very few places in some of the maps, but nothing more.\n\nLastly this story is just so fucking dull and boring. Literally, long-story-short, the story ends with you saying \"That's it? That's the ending?\". And while is does end on an unexpected note, it's nothing noteworthy. That's sometimes how some \"political\" storylines in games work. They shit out these bland stereotypes and characters that are so predictable with no reasoning for their motives.\n\nIt's not a horrible title, but it lacks core elements that made the previous games worthy and gave them replayability. I have not played the DLC's myself, honestly, I don't want to play the high price tag for them. I recommend getting this game ONLY when on sale if you are REALLY wanting to know how the series comes to a close.\n\nThere was also a lot of rather interesting content that was cut from the game before its final release. I feel if they would've stuck with some of the content from the original trailers and playthroughs, I might be more optimistic about this game. It's rather stunning what kind of transition it went through.
