Gordon Freeman no se mueve con tanta fluidez y realismo como se pueda mover tu personaje en Battlefield. No se trata solo del movimiento, factores típicos del género como el retroceso de una ametralladora o la lentitud con la que recargas una escopeta son apenas visible o directamente inexistente en esta saga.  No llega a los niveles de incomodidad de un Fallout, pero tampoco se acerca al hiperrealismo de Metro2033.\n\nEste juego, no obstante, brilla por otras virtudes. El viaje que realizamos junto a Freeman a través de los distintos escenarios del mundo es simplemente sublime. La ambientación de Ciudad 17 es maravillosa, mostrándonos una distopía inspirada en los relatos Orwellianos, con las constantes tensiones entre la Resistencia y la Alianza, la brutalidad policial y el desasosiego de una población oprimida.\n\nJuegablemente el juego se caracteriza por un interacción con el escenario muy bien lograda y unas mecánicas, además de fabulosas y originales, muy bien implementadas. Los tiroteos  a pesar de ser rápidos, requieren de cierta estrategia. Los enemigos son inteligentes y el juego siempre busca la manera de tenderte una emboscada. Los momentos de acción son magníficos por que abundan y están muy bien diseñados ya que nunca sabes realmente con lo que te vas a encontrar; la monotonía es nula.\n\nPero Half-Life 2 es más que simplemente un juego “redondo”. La historia juega un papel fundamental, es memorable y muy interesante. Pero sobre todo destaco los personajes, que son entrañables y muy carismáticos. Half-Life 2 es superior a un antecesor, es un juego único y para mí una joya del shooter y del medio en general.\n","timestamp_created":1437177747,"timestamp_updated":1518736431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17098899","author":{"steamid":"76561198062157645","num_games_owned":235,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":3185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2231,"last_played":1600089188},"language":"italian","review":"Half-Life 2 è un videogioco sviluppato da Valve, seguito del primo leggendario Half-Life (1998), uscito nel lontano 2004.\nAncora oggi, a più di dieci anni dalla sua uscita, regala emozioni e un coinvolgimento incredibili. Insieme al terzo capitolo della serie di Doom, il primo FarCry e GTA San Andreas (e molti altri titoli) ha contribuito a rendere l'anno in cui è uscito uno dei migliori della recente storia videoludica.\nVeniamo agli aspetti tecnici:\n- La grafica è ottima per il tempo e su PC molto gradevole ancora oggi, con qualche problema di texture solo da vicinissimo ma effetti nel complesso ottimi; il comparto tecnico in generale è ottimo, il sonoro è sublime e la fisica è superlativa, come in nessun altro FPS: la Gravity Gun è ormai simbolo della saga e gli impieghi che se ne fanno in questo titolo sono molteplici e appaganti. IA eccezionale, tra le migliori, soprattutto per quanto concerne i nemici.\n- Il gameplay è a dir poco perfetto, con una risposta dei comandi perfetta, un comparto shooting solido e anche piuttosto vario, diverse armi tutte ottime e una discreta varietà delle situazioni. I problemi di lieve \"legnosità\" delle parti platform del primo HL sono qui completamente risolti.\n- Longevità: il parametro è soggettivo, io ci ho messo circa 15/20 ore a portarlo a termine, considerando però tantissime perdite di tempo e qualche morte stupida; la seconda volta che lo si gioca, per conquistare tutti gli achievement, verosimilmente non si superano le 12-15 ore; io direi che a difficoltà difficile dura tra le 10 e le 15 ore stando larghissimi, ma si può finire anche in 7 o 8. Nel complesso, comunque, la longevità, soprattutto la prima volta che lo si gioca, resta ottimale per il genere FPS.\n- Storia, trama, personaggi. Tutto sublime. Personaggi ottimi, compreso il nostro protagonista (che non parla mai) Gordon Freeman, ma soprattutto chi gli ruota attorno. Ottima trama, straordinaria la narrazione fatta durante lo sviluppo del gioco, che dà l'idea di un unico grande livello continuo che si sviluppa di seguito. Evitate il doppiaggio italiano, per il resto il voice acting inglese è ottimo e i sottotitoli tradotti abbastanza bene. \n\nIn generale, si tratta di un capolavoro assoluto, con diverse genialate in giro e qualche parte un po' lenta e forse eccessivamente elaborata, che spezza un po' il ritmo.\nComunque, resta il miglior fps mai creato e uno dei migliori videogiochi in assoluto di sempre.\n\n10/10\n\n-------------------------------------------- FOR \"NON-ITALIAN\" WIEWERS-----------------------------------------\nEpic masterpiece of videogames history.\nNot so long (10-15 hours) but very very epic: nice graphics, nice physics and great gameplay; beautiful characters and good voice acting; very good AI (better than average games today).

Half Life was said to have given direction to the FPS genre and after playing it more than 10 years after it's release, I understood why. HL2 is basically an expansion to the Half Life universe and like its predecessor, HL2 has a number of outstanding gameplay elements that make it relevant and a must-buy for FPS addicts.\n\nHL2 adopts excellent voice-acting and graphics. The AI, as advertised, are also an eye-opener whereby both friendly and hostile units assess danger instead of just charging into ridiculous situations and suicide. This makes higher difficulty settings a worthy challenge. You start with your trusty, signature crowbar and as you progress, you collect a variety of weapons that makes gameplay even more customisable and interesting. Last but not least, like in Half Life, HL2 does not have the 'big giant arrow' most modern games adopts that directs you to the next objective, and yet it was very intuitive and enjoyable.\n\nCan't wait to start on Episode 1!\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1437018196,"timestamp_updated":1445767069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17070538","author":{"steamid":"76561198141240164","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1075,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":708,"last_played":1551851570},"language":"english","review":"If you buy this game good for you but you will have hard time waiting for half life 3.\nPlease gabe JUST DO IT...

After actually finishing it, more than 10 years after its release, I have to say that this might be better than every other FPS out there, except for DOOM, 'cuz DOOM is fuckin' awesome. Great story, decent visuals (even in today's day and age), and immersive physics based puzzles, make Half-Life 2 one of the best single player experiences to date.

Lots of variety in map design (desert, prison, sewer, battle field, overrun town, etc) \n\nWeapons - throughout the entire game you are collecting weapons so close to the end you have around 10 different wepons and more ways to kill people, unfortuntely the enemies get harder so a couple of weapons become obsolete. A new weapon in the history of video games is also intoduced which alows to manipulate gavity and throw objects.\n\nEnemies - the enemy AI can be good at times (throwing grenades in door ways before running in, advancing when you retreat), but it has faults (not taking cover when injured or reloading, little or no teamwork). Enemies always spawn in certain places at certain times (some areas enemies respawn which I hate). The enemies also get harder (with different enemy types) and get better weapons throughout the game.\n\nGame mechanics - with every chapter comes a different scenario, you'll do loads of things like\n- turret defence(loved)\n- running from enemies\n- driving a dune buggy\n- avoiding death traps\n- controling minions(loved)\n- sewer surfing\n- throwing stuff at zombies\n- blowing up hovercrafts \n- controling a squad(hated)\n- etc\n\nplot - not very interesting, most of the game has you traveling so not much of it is character or plot development. the ending level and scenes is very good which leave the game open for a sequel (*cough* half life 3 *cough*) and DLC (episode 1 & 2). also be sure to look for secrets like the blue man which apears throughout the game (I only found him 3 times).\n\ninteresting, intriguing and innovative 8/10","timestamp_created":1436948609,"timestamp_updated":1448279314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508896768093109131","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17055103","author":{"steamid":"76561198169529470","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":688,"last_played":1592246999},"language":"spanish","review":"De los mejores juegos que he jugado, por no decir el mejor, descargue el demo y no esperaba mucho de un juego del 2004 pero poco a poco, mientras iba jugando mis expectativas fueron deztrosadas por este juegazo!!! tendra tiempo, pero aun asi esta a la talla y es mejor que muchos juegos actuales.\n10/10 :`)","timestamp_created":1436934447,"timestamp_updated":1436934447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17052715","author":{"steamid":"76561198033722263","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":688,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":68,"last_played":1582244972},"language":"brazilian","review":"Falar sobre Half-Life 2 não é difícil, não consigo ver outro jogo que consiga me fazer sentir tão bem jogando, foi um jogo que marcou minha vida, e com certeza por muito tempo será meu favorito, recomendo e muito, todo mundo deveria conhecer esse clássico!","timestamp_created":1436919048,"timestamp_updated":1436919048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17052439","author":{"steamid":"76561198107004724","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1425876248},"language":"russian","review":"Великолепная игра.
