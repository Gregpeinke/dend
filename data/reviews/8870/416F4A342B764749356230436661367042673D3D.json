It is also not a reboot or anything else of that sort. It is a completely standalone game with its own original story. The BioShock name is merely a concept of unique gameplay mechanics and engrossing narrative themes. Please, keep this is mind.\n\nThat being said, BioShock Infinite is worth its weight in terms of gameplay and story. The combat is much faster and more action-packed, the story is more narrative-driven but just as complex as the original BioShock. Furthermore, the game ends in a mind-blowing way and is able to close up all the threads of the narrative quite nicely. That is, if you pay attention to everything that goes on within the game. And you do need to pay attention. Even so, what makes the ending and the game great is the high value of discussion that comes from its themes and its closure. \n\nBioShock Infinite is a game that clearly doesn't need multiplayer in order for it to hold ground. The Singleplayer is so engrossing that it merits many different playthroughs since you will get a different experience each time you play.\n\nSo, tired of the claustrophobic ocean depths of Rapture? Rocket into the sky to the flying city of Columbia! You won't regret it. :)","timestamp_created":1364949554,"timestamp_updated":1364949554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3137296","author":{"steamid":"76561198018053305","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1398126242},"language":"english","review":"I played this game as Soon as it came out on steam and i didn't stop till i beat it. I loved this game soooo freaking much. 10/10 I've never felt more immersed in a game as i have with this game. Everything is so beautiful and the that you want to stop and take a look around at everything there is to see. You don't wanna miss a bit of anything while playing as Dewitt. The story line is amazing as well and it really does feel like you were thrown into such a different world while at the same time you're on a mission to save someone. At the same time you come to have develop an attatchment to your companion Elizabeth, With breath taking scenery, a great story line, amazing gaming action and fighting scenes and a trustworthy friend who fights along side you. It feels like you're in control of the main character in a movie rather then a game. It's truely a wonderful experience and i recommend this game to everyone.

The first time I saw Columbia... it was just as powerful as seeing Rapture.\n\nGameplay wise, this game is a lot of fun. While it doesn’t do a whole lot to innovate combat-wise, it is just as enjoyable as the original Bioshock. Every battle is different, fun, engaging, and requires you to vary your tactics. A good sized arsenal consisting of shotguns, handcannons, pistols, sniper-rifles, assault-rifles, and carbines await for you to use. All of the guns feel fantastic to use, and the enemy variety will keep you switching strategies.\n\nAccompanying the guns are vigors. Special powers that allow you to do various crazy things like set enemies on fire, pull them closer in a tide of water, send out a murder of crows to deal damage and distract them, and even catch bullets and throw them back.\n\nThe battlefields themselves are open and varied, allowing for experimentation. There are also many sections that have sky-rails, that allow you can hook onto and fly around the area while shooting enemies, climbing buildings, and enacting a death-from-above sky-hook to the face.\n\nElizabeth is another factor in the combat. She's your companion during the game, and is actually incredibly useful in a fight. She knows how to take care of herself so she doesn't get in the way, while actually helping the player. \n\nLow on health? She'll toss you a first aid kit. Low on ammo? Occasionally she'll toss a gun your way. Low on salts and can't cast vigors? She'll find some.\n\n\nAs awesome as the gameplay is, the real heavy hitter is the story. I won't say much in order to avoid spoiling anything, but the story is emotional, well paced,  and has incredible characterization and development, with Elizabeth being one of the best characters I have ever gotten to know, and some of the most unexpected twists I have ever seen.\n\nThis storyline had me crying towards the end. It is incredibly powerful, incredibly moving, and deeply emotional. It will tug your heart-strings, and make you experience a wide range of emotions as you progress, up until the last few hours where I was reduced to a puddle of tears. If you finish this game without feeling some sort of emotional response, you need to head to a doctor and make sure you aren’t dead.\n\n\nFantastic gameplay and a storyline that stands tall above any other in the genre, Infinite a must play. Just make sure you have a box of tissues nearby.\n","timestamp_created":1364936552,"timestamp_updated":1364936552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501342535018920898","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1077045","author":{"steamid":"76561197986038119","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1073,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1073,"last_played":1365750000},"language":"english","review":"Just completed Bioshock and it was pretty average to be blunt. \nA lot of work has gone into the artwork to complement the Bioshock universe. Without telling you anything about the story, or too much of the mechanics, I will concentrate on the overall experience and the core of the FPS adventure. \n Unfolding the game is actually the main draw, both in terms of the story and advancements to your tools and skills. As mentioned it's average as both an FPS and a generated world. I will mention  the core story touches on issues within society, but I don't think they are taken far enough. The game loses some of the creepiness generated in earlier Bioshock games partly because of this. The crazed residents of rapture are replaced by droids and thugs which also detracts.\n \nThe graphics at first seem dazzling, but a lot of bloom hides the fact not a lot is going on. The streets, bars, infact any place with life, actually just feel hollow. People go about their business but at times it all feels like robotic mannequins repeating movements with no thought to your involvement. \nTheres very little to do, very seldom do you interact with the cold lifeless beings that should be adding a pulse to the world. Sidequests are almost non existent and whether you can actually be bothered to do them will cross your mind. I found myself running around through empty areas encountering easy combat, looking in bins for treasure. \n\nHmmm, there must be more to it surely, but apart from the driving story and the addition of the \"skyhook\", a rail you can ride, there's nothing to do. The open spaces feel confined, as there is seldom anything worth visiting outside of the main path. The AI is dreadful. Bioshock 1 & 2 had the advantage of less open spaces and the poor AI there just seemed to behave with more intelligence with less options open to them. Enemies will run towards you and then run back to where they started depending where you stand. \nThere's only one way to play it and is usually through the front door guns blazing. Unlike Dishonored (by ex Bioshock devs), where there is so much choice to how you solve a situation, here, your plasmids (and skyhook) will grant you some experimentation but thats it. The core story touches on issues within society, but I don't think they are taken far enough. The game loses some of the creepiness generated in earlier Bioshock games partly because of this.\nNot particulariy large (12 hours) and I'd advise playing on hard. It's ridiculously easy. I remember Ken Livine, when he created my favourite sci-fi horror of all time, System Shock 2. Here, he's compromised to the masses and because of that I feel wanting after exiting the game.  I expected more from a man of this calibre. \n\nWould I recommend? Yes, but I'd pick it up on sale. As a similar game type, I'd opt for Dishonored.

An AI character who is capable yet vunerable and IS ACTUALLY USEFUL! I miss hacking, i miss the mini game, it feels like it is missing little choc chips to finish it off. The base is amazing but it did need more. Customization wasnt as good, or as adaptable (instead of plasmid slots you have clothes) which are a bit dull. You dont need ADAM just money (which spoils the thrill of getting special currancy) upgrades were linear and simple rather than mad and fun (i loved the orignal because all my upgrdes made the wrnech into the best in game weapon). \n\nThat said the story is the best I have seen in a game for years, less choice than I would have liked and not really any true karma elements but interesting (the added bits were really worth listening too). The story is well thought out and well paced. Characters develop and are 3D with faults and flaws. The main character can be a bit of an arsehole and it is refreshing to have a complex main character rather than a dull 2D hero. \n\nOverall its very good, not the best game I have played but up there.

El guión es increíble, jugará con tu cabeza hasta que te replantees cada punto de la historia. La banda sonora se adapta a la perfección, tanto si estamos en combate como si no. Puede que no tenga los mejores gráficos de su generación en cuanto a potencia y texturas pero el conjunto es precioso, en parte debido al excelente uso de la iluminación. Elizabeth es útil y no molesta durante el combate. Además, se le coje muchísimo cariño debido a las conversaciones que matienes con ella, su personalidad, sus reacciones, su expresión... Historia increíble y llevada a la perfección, con final de los que dejan tus sesos desparramados por la pared. Yo por lo menos necesité consultar foros y pensar bastante para tener bien clara la resolución final. Ambientación perfecta (qué decir de Columbia cuando ya vimos lo que Irrational Games podía hacer con Rapture) y jugabilidad divertidísima.\nComo pegas: no hay mapa y sólo puedes llevar dos armas a la vez (hay que intercambiar).Además me gustaba lo de llevar botiquines y jeringas de EVE, pero es un problema personal e insignificante, apenas lo he notado. \n\nEso sí, antes de lanzarte a comprarlo piensa en qué tipo de jugador eres: si te gustan los juegos con una historia muy densa en los que el guión es la base de su calidad Infinite es para tí sin duda. Si por el contrario prestas mucha atención al gameplay y la historia y personajes te la pelan, si vas a pasar de las grabaciones que encuentras por Columbia o no vas a hacer caso a conversaciones importantes y muy rebuscadas por momentos mejor ni lo toques. Bioshock Infinite es una joya de la que hay que disfrutar poco a poco, sin prisa, parándote a explorar cada rincón y prestando atención a cada palabra que se dice.\n\nValoración personal: 10/10. \n\nConclusión: ya estás tardando en comprarlo es un JODIDO JUEGAZO. Trabajos como este son los que me hacen pensar que los videojuegos son arte.Me dejo mil cosas en el tintero sobre Infinite pero no es plan de alargar más una review de Steam. Sólo mira su puntuación en Metacritic, tanto revistas como usuarios dejan claro que estamos ante una historia que se recordará durante mucho tiempo.","timestamp_created":1364931109,"timestamp_updated":1364931109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54703831672668457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2022775","author":{"steamid":"76561198001076877","num_games_owned":1054,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1150,"last_played":1396719160},"language":"english","review":"Having played the first 2 games in the series (loving the first and having strong feelings for the second), I came to Bioshock Infinite with unfairly high expectations which were still promptly laughed at and surpassed. I spent 15 hours exploring the game's world and they were 15 of the most enjoyable gaming, or even just fiction, hours I've ever had. To go that length of time without a weak moment and constantly keeping up the desire for the next part of the story is damned impressive.\n\nThe world itself is imaginatively designed and stunningly brought to life. My PC isn't the highest spec, but the game still ran smoothly on ultra settings, and that truly is a sight to behold.\n\nThe characters are all well voiced and animated to a stage where your suspension of disbelief is never broken by some jarring/simplistic motion or unnatural sounding lines. Elizabeth is particularly well done and, by the end of it, you will find yourself caring for her. Either that or you are a hollow and cold person, and I would not care to meet you, sir. Even though she is never directly attacked in combat I found myself always trying to put myself between her and the enemy.\n\nThe game-play itself is solid. The guns all feel suitably different and you will quickly find your own preference and be scraping the money together for the appropriate upgrades. The same is true for vigors (equivalents of plasmids in the first two games). The 'Murder of Crows' vigor was a particular favourite for me. Some of the fights become incredibly chaotic and force some pretty quick movement out of you. The new ability to hook on to lines and zoom about whilst shooting before launching at the nearest enemy and taking his head off helps here as well as making you feel like an absolute bad-ass.\n\nThe real stand out for me though is, without question, the plot. Whilst this was also true for the first two games, Bioshock Infinite takes it to a whole new level. There is no way I'm going to ruin it for you here, please just go and enjoy it for yourself! I will say however, to reiterate my second paragraph, that this game competes rather handsomely with some of my favourite tv/movie/novel experiences, and there aren't many other games I could say that for. Many RPGs have books or scrolls you can go around reading for additional snore. Sorry, I meant lore. As with the previous two games however, Bioshock is the exception with the audio diaries being something that you will actively hunt down. The tapes you pick-up give you such interesting insight to characters or, in some cases, don't seem to mean much at the time but later on suddenly make other things click and help bring the story together.\n\nOverall, I would have to rate it as a 9/10, dropping a mark only because 10/10 would sound unrealistic and because there were a few occasions where, whilst trying to jump out the way of rockets, I found myself stuck on invisible walls. That was still no where near enough to really damage the experience.

Un modello di società perfetta nella quale gli uomini possano vivere pacificamente e idillicamente? Oppure un ideale, qualcosa di irrealizzabile? O, forse, la domanda più sensata è: può, questa, durare nel tempo? Il concetto di utopia è effettivamente molto antico, dai ai tempi dell'antica Grecia, nonostante il termine risalga al XVI secolo, momento in cui è stato coniato da Tommaso Moro: gli umanisti, in opere come l'Arcadia di Sannazzaro, hanno sottolineando le perplessità e le contraddizioni insite in questo concetto. Lo sa bene Andrew Ryan, fondatore di Rapture, che volle \"realizzare l'impossibile\": una città subacquea, la cui società, ispirata dall'ideologia liberale, si sarebbe dovuta slegare dall'etica, dalla religione e dalla politica, facendo in modo che ogni abitante della stessa, \"col sudore della propria fronte\" potesse esprimere in tutta libertà le proprie potenzialità. Chi ha giocato a Bioshock però saprà bene che la sua utopia, presto, si trasformerà in distopia e il caos e il delirio saranno gli elementi che porteranno alla decadenza di questa \"gloriosa civiltà\". Irrational games, dopo circa un lustro, ha sviluppato un nuovo capitolo di questa serie: Bioshock Infinite. Ci troviamo nel 1912 e gli USA, ormai divenuti una grande potenza mondiale, decidono di costruire una città sulle nuvole, una nuova utopia, sfruttando le nuove grandi scoperte scientifiche e tecnologiche. La trama narra le vicende di Booker Dewitt che, a causa di alcuni debiti di gioco, viene inviato a Columbia per recuperare una ragazza di nome Elizabeth, rinchiusa sin da piccola in un luogo non ben identificato. Ken Levine, a capo del team si sviluppo, ha creato un'ambientazione di buona qualità e il level design riesce, in alcuni casi, a stupire per la sua grandiosità. Inoltre, la colonna sonora di Infinite è discreta, senza contare poi l'ottima qualità del doppiaggio in italiano. Il gameplay è molto simile rispetto ai precedenti capitoli: si tratta di uno sparatutto in soggettiva in cui utilizzeremo, oltre alle canoniche armi da fuoco, dei \"vigor\" che sono delle peculiari abilità magiche con cui potremo, ad esempio, incenerire oppure fulminare i nostri nemici. È inoltre presente un sistema di crescita del personaggio che ci permetterà, attraverso la raccolta di denaro o di potenziamenti, di migliorare il nostro alter-ego per renderlo più efficiente in combattimento. Nonostante una buona quantità di pregi, però, questo nuovo capitolo presenta anche dei difetti... Non si può usare salvataggio manuale e i checkpoint sono molto distanti e, qualora volessimo uscire dal gioco, spesso, saremo costretti a ripetere sessioni lunghe anche più di venti minuti. Il gameplay, rispetto ai precedenti capitoli, è stato semplificato e reso meno \"accattivante\" ed in generale sembra un \"more of the same\" rispetto agli altri due episodi della saga. Inoltre, nonostante io non abbia avuto problemi di sorta, il gioco, a tre giorni dal suo rilascio, presenta numerosi problemi di ottimizzazione su diverse configurazioni: il Vsync è mal implementato e diversi giocatori riscontrano fastidiosi problemi di stuttering; poi, la qualità delle texture non è molto elevata per gli standard odierni (nonostante tecnicamente il titolo sia più che sufficiente) e c'è una forte ridondanza nei modelli dei png. Sono, poi, presenti degli errori gravissimi nella scrittura di alcune frasi in lingua latina. Nonostante questi (e altri) difetti, Bioshock: Infinite si presenta essere come un acquisto consigliato per tutti gli amanti della serie ed, in generale, tutti coloro che amino gli sparatutto in soggettiva con una trama e un'ambientazione di spessore. Ve lo dico sinceramente, non ci saranno personaggi del calibro di Sander Cohen o del dr. Steinman (Elizabeth è, a mio parere, una figura sopravvalutata, insieme a tutti i \"nemici\" presenti nel gioco), nè concetti dall'immenso spessore filosofico (come quelli espressi da Eleanore in Bioshock 2) ed il fascino di Rapture, rimane inarrivato e, probabilmente, inarrivabile. \nVoto 7,5","timestamp_created":1364899255,"timestamp_updated":1385669800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509874820709228516","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"366019","author":{"steamid":"76561197969719708","num_games_owned":666,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":56,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56,"last_played":1364886000},"language":"english","review":"Terrible, repetitive game.

Als draufgängerischer Privatdetektiv Booker DeWitt werdet ihr von euren Auftraggebern, zwei Streithähnen in Regenuniform, zu einem alten Leuchtturm gebracht, der eingefleichte Bioshock-Fans an die guten alten Zeiten in Rapture erinnert. Kleiner aber feiner Unterschied: Statt 1956 schreiben wir das Jahr 1912 und statt mit der Tauchglpck auf der Grund des Meeres, geht es mit einer Rakete in den Himmel. Ein rasantes Abenteuer beginnt, euer Auftrag: Finde das Mädchen, Elizabeth genannt, und bringe sie nach New York, um deine Schulden zu tilgen. DeWitt hegt eine dunkle Vergangenheit, die ihn im Laufe des Spiels einholfen wird. Über den Wolken, angekommen in Columbia, einer Art selbstbetitelter \"fliegender Arche der Neuzeit\", beginnt der Spieler seine Reise durch diese Utopie, gegründet auf den beiden Rs: Religion und Rassismus (nichts Ungewöhnliches für diese Zeit). Schnell verwandelt sich diese Utopie jedoch in eine Dysopie: Nachdem Booker Elizabeth findet, sie aus ihrer Gefangenschaft im Monument der Stadt (einer riesigen Engelsstatue) befreit, befindet sich das ungleiche Pärchen auf der Flucht. Während dieser Flucht stoßen beide immer wieder auf bedeutende Persönlichkeiten, die die Gesellschaft über den Wolken zusammenhalten oder mit HIlfe von Waffen auseinanderbrechen will. Darunter auch die Luteces: Ein verrückt wirkendes Pärchen, Quantenphysiker und immer zur Stelle, wenn der Weg aussichtslos scheint. Merkwürdige Vorkommnisse häufen sich, bishin zu Zeitrissen, die Elizabeth mit einer mysteriösen Kraft öffnen kann. Bioshock Infinite eröffnet somit eine völlig neue Welt der Absurdität, welche aber in sich geschlossen und am Ende wirklich sinnvoll, in jedem Detail geplant und durchdacht scheint. PSychologische Ansätze Freuds treffen auf Quantenmechanik, Gesellschaftstheorie und der Stellenwert der Religion wird in Frage gestellt. Wie weit würde die Menschheit gehe? Wie sehr ist eine Gesellschaft bereit Verantwortung an einzelne Menschen (Politik? Propheten?) abzutreten? Was ist der Sinn des Lebens? Was kommt nach dem Tod? Doch vorallem liefert das Spiel eine sinnvolle Erklärung für die Aussage: \"Alles ist eins. Alles was ist, war und wird immer sein.\" Paare man all dies, mit einem wirklich 1-A Charaktersystem, einer wirklich guten Alternative zu gängigen Shootern und Cutscenes, die einwandfrei in die Spielsituation passen, erhält man den neuen 2k-Games Titel: Bioshock Infinite. Für mich eine emotionale und tiefgründige Achterbahnfahrt über den Wolken (im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes). Empfehlenswert für Leute, die gutes Storytelling, verknüpft mit ausgewogener Action und tiefgründigem Sinn suchen. Desweiteren empfehlenswert: Bioshock und Bioshock 2 - die großen Vorgänger, wovon der erste Teil als \"bestbewertetster Shooter alles Zeiten gilt\". Ebenso schwere Story, aber ein ebenso dramatisches Ende. Und für Fans des aktuellen Titels: \"Bioshock: Minds in revolt\", das Ebook zur Vorgeschichte des neuen Titels.","timestamp_created":1364897669,"timestamp_updated":1385419428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1657581","author":{"steamid":"76561197995985473","num_games_owned":1546,"num_reviews":219,"playtime_forever":1659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1652,"last_played":1407426828},"language":"english","review":"A true masterpiece in regards to storytelling that greatly improves upon the gameplay of its predecessors.
