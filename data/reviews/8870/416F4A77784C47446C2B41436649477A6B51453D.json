As a fan of the first game and its unique environment, I skipped over the second game at first to play this one, and I'm glad I did. The game mechanics were vastly improved and expanded to include really neat Vigors that help you combat your way through citizens of Columbia who are not too pleased to see you, and you'll find out why. The storyline has twists and turns and keeps your attention as you fight your way to Comstock, the man, the myth, the legend. The graphic environment of this game is wonderful and true to the time period, and even when enterable shops didn't have items, I couldn't help but look around at the little details that were put in. I didn't find gameplay overly difficult and the amount of ammo laying around makes it almost impossible to run out completely unless you're going ham on enemies, which some of them feel like you have to. Overall, this game was very enjoyable to play and experience.","timestamp_created":1513088746,"timestamp_updated":1513088746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38254892","author":{"steamid":"76561197964619116","num_games_owned":1513,"num_reviews":100,"playtime_forever":2026,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2006,"last_played":1534766876},"language":"english","review":"BioShock Infinite\nby Irrational/2K Games\nGenre: FPS\nRelease: March 15, 2013\n\n-----\n\n\"Will the circle be unbroken, by and by... by and by? Is a better home awaiting in the sky, Lord, in the sky?\"\n\nThe last whole chapter in the BioShock series so far, Infinite has us taking to the clouds in the Edwardian era (1912, actually), as the last great expression of American exceptionalism shines like both a shining jewel… and a blinding light.\n\nYou are disgraced Pinkerton Detective Booker DeWitt. You’ve run up a bunch of debts in your life, and now the bill is coming due. Fortunately, an enigmatic pair, a brother and sister named the Luteces, employ you for one final job…\n\n“Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt!”\n\nRosalind and Robert send you to the floating city of Columbia, to retrieve a young woman by the name of Elizabeth. She’s apparently being held captive somewhere in the city. Seems a very simple job…\n\nIt turns out to be anything but. Elizabeth is being used in a very dark manner. See, she has very special powers; she can generate what have come to be called tears in the fabric of reality. From gateways to the past or the future, to wholly original scenarios of her own imagining – if she can think it, she can open a tear to it. Her power is such that her very existence is used to power much of Columbia!\n\nWell, her captor, Zachary Hale Comstock, is the Founder (and the leader of the Founders faction!) of Columbia, and he won’t be letting Elizabeth go without a fight. His minion, or pet, the enigmatic Songbird, is strangely (and quite familiarly, for those who’ve played the first two games!) pair-bonded to Elizabeth…\n\nAnyway, this is a GREAT FPS, with a more linear story in the vein of BioShock 2, than the freely backtracking form of the first game. When you liberate Elizabeth, she can help you during the many pitched battles in the game, throwing you health, ammo and even new weapons when you run low. She can pick locks, giving access to secrets! And in some instances, she can cause new items to come into existence to assist in the tougher battles!\n\nThe other prominent faction in Columbia, besides the Founders, is the Vox Populi, run by Daisy Fitzroy. She and Vox represent the lower classes, while the Founders are the upper. A power struggle between them exists, much like between Columbia and the rest of the world – Columbia ‘emancipated’ itself from the United States at some point in the past. The Founders believe they are superior in all ways to the Vox and that they must be crushed, just as they wish to forcefully bring their light to the rest of the world.\n\nFor the rest of this intriguing story, you’ll just have to play the game! I highly recommend it to all FPS fans, as well as those who loved the first two games as I did!","timestamp_created":1513078640,"timestamp_updated":1513078640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38252596","author":{"steamid":"76561198287501259","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4305,"last_played":1523090210},"language":"english","review":"It's very nice FPS with compelling and finished story and good DLCs which expand the story or the FPS scenarios.

Yes! \n\nIs it a good Bioshock? Nope, at least not in all aspects.\n\n\nBioshock Infinite manages to capture your attention immediately with its stunning visuals, story and setting. You're an action hero guy with 20% more backstory trying to find a girl in a floating city around the year of 1900. Art, sound, visuals and voice acting are all top notch, even in 2017. \n\nThe well dosed story unfolds masterfully before and around you while playing through the game, some will like it, others not, but the ways it is conveyed count as a plus for me.\n\nThe bummer is, however, that Bioshock Infinite is absolutely boiled down gameplay-wise. Randomly distributed gear around the world make it impossible to have something like a build, weapons are all just firearms and explosives (I miss my spear gun), the only good thing are the powers, called vigors here, that also lack the depth Bioshock players are used to.\n\nLet me give you an example here: In bioshock 1, which was the more basic game in terms of powers, you were able to build for fire and electrical damage, enhancing your powers and certain ammo types (yes, every gun had 3 ammo types that opened up completely new ways of combat). You could even build for basic stealth or  melee only, you could hack and manipulate security systems, set up ambushes or simply troll enemies by charming a big daddy to stomp them into the ground.\n\nOne more thing, there is no manual save system, you have to rely on the horrible, frustrating checkpoints that the game gives you, which really ruin the free-roam-ish parts of the game on higher difficulties.\n\nThe only thing you can upgrade in Bioshock Infinite are the guns and powers, the gear items do not really enhance them, only provide situational bonuses that are mostly based on RNG, like x% to deal fire damage to an enemy on a melee strike. This might be a consequence of the many revisions they made for the game, but they don't really add much.\n\nIf you like a good story, you will get one, but if you like to influence the story, better go replay bioshock 1 and 2. Infinite railroads you through the whole game, you cannot revisit old levels, and every playthrough will likely feel the same. The choices you are given don't really affect the gameplay or outcome.\n\nSo, if you want a rather conservative shooter with a good story and fluid gameplay, get this game, now! \n\nIf you want an RPG-shooter mix like the precedessors have been, you will not find a real bioshock here, but still might have if you go into the game without too many expectations in terms of gameplay and variety.\n\nI gladly hand this game 8/10, for being immersive, well constructed and making me want replay it once in a while.","timestamp_created":1512763829,"timestamp_updated":1512851906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38159433","author":{"steamid":"76561198262602671","num_games_owned":469,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":1994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1043,"last_played":1547901437},"language":"russian","review":"К этой игре очень сложно подобрать слова которые могли бы описать всю красоту в ней происходящего.

Really don't think it's worth its full price at the time of writing. \n\nBioshock 3 is VERY eager to get you into the meat of things. I don't have a strong background into the series but am familiar with its style, and more importantly, its philosophy, and it was quite obvious for me that a newcommer will have a difficult time adjusting to what's coming. This is due to the game's poor beginning. As an idea, what Bioshock 3 wants to achieve works well, but it does so after you've been introduced to story, settings, characters, significant events, conflicts, ect. After all of that, it is an enjoyable experience, not altogether smooth, but quite fun, nonetheless. While they've clearly made a good effort to portray both main protagonist and his companion as living, breathing humans, the way they jump on the adventure together is almost comical to me. It feels like they just needed a glance at each other, and they're all buddy buddy, and if there is some sort of disagreement, they work it out so quickly, they can contest for couple of the milenium. This is quite significant, because it's where the story is weak, and the portrayal of complex characters--thin. I probably would pick flack for that, but it would have been a lot better for the game if it had a choice/consequence heavy dialogue, DA:O type of thing. Together with attitude system, and heck, maybe even skill tree for Elisabeth's snenanigan. The thing tries to sell itself as a FPS, but it isn't. Head shots don't mean a thing, and enemies are very innacurate from afar, while up close, they turn into hit-scans, but more for that later on. Reason why I bring this up: If the game wanted to be a FPS, it should have implemented a different play-style. It does try to be orriginal, fresh and innovative...not unlike it's predecessors I suppose, but it doesn't really bring anything new to the table...much more like it's predecessors. Hence my reason for saying that the game should maybe have utilized a more rpg-heavy dialogue system. Another benefit of such a system would have been that the main protagonist may not have come across as such a mediocre...Rambo...What kind of a guy is that, that can wreck total havoc on a team of fully armed, trained soldiers, with the support of a minigun-wielding robot, and be touched to the depth of his soul by a girl suddenly bursting into (quite fake) tears, all the while having put war, death and his late wife behind him. Bleh! Or what about the girl herself, who makes friend with the first suspicious guy that comes flying through the ceiling of her house, learns that she has been living in isolation from the world and has been observed as a test subject all her life, only to emergy as a happy-go-round Merry Sue literally 5 minutes later...I mean, the reason behind all of this is that Bioshock 3 is so eager to push you into the action. It wants to give you all the vigours, all the weapons, all the upgrades, money, ect., and then throw waves of quite bullet-spongy enemies in front of you. But what about the characters themselves?! Clearly, there has been so much effort into making them good. But because the game wants to pace like a first person shooter, it sort of tries to compress too much of what is going on within their personalities into too little a space. You can't really do that with anything that you want to look human, methinks. The result is this comic impression that I already mentioned that I have about both of the main protagonists. The game plays best with all of that stuff behind you, and DeWitt and Elisabeth just plowing through the futuristic districts of Columbia, unlocking stuff, having small chat, sharing thoughts and impressions, looting lots of loot, shooting lots of enemies, placing lots of tears into place. Then everything comes together. But geez...this thing looks kind of amateurish when it tries to explain things to you.\n\nI mentioned that it tries to sell itself as a first person shooter, but it really isn't. I don't mind how the game tries to approach it's combat, but I think that out of desire to simplify things, it comes up with a rather mediocre and repetitive experience as a result. You can aim weapons, but that is rather pointless. Not only are the majority of the iron sights useless, because of the cartoony art style of the game--thus, making the iron sights in question too large and impractical to be used, but there really isn't a difference in accuracy when we talk about near, far, crouching, jumping, flying, cover, running. Almost all enemies have some sort of neat mobility movement(skill), either a long side-step, or a jump, but you, playing as DeWitt, have nothing of the sorts. You feel like a slug, to be honest. Some weapons can stun enemies, and thank god for that, because when you're fighting multiples in tight spaces, you really cannot have another advantage at your disposal, other than spamming stunning vigours or using weapons that stun-lock them. When in the open, you can stand from afar and pick them one by one with long range weapons(hip fire works better than aiming for that, save the sniper rifle and rpg!), and you will be perfectly fine, because the majority of enemies aren't smart enough to look for cover quickly and/or do an automatic miss from a certain distance onward, with the bizzare exclusion of the granade launcher users, who tend to have that annoyong bot accuracy, but those projectiles move slow, so it's ok. Too many bullet sponges for comfort, to be honest; ammo is plentiful, so it's not too bad. More like a bit annoying when you do a 3 bullet burst at somebody's naked noggin, and they still charge you in for melee strike. Not too bright, but oh well...Bioshock! The combat is at it's best when it's giving you plenty of options to bring in allys with tears and have a lot of mobility freedom with those neat air rails. When you can quickly change positions and disoirient enemies with robots of your own, the combat feels varied and dynamic. Tight spaces and insides of buildings are honestly annoying, and kind of underwhelming, because you don't really have got an advantage when having the initiative. You can't sneak and everybody automatically knows where you are once you open fire.\n\nGraphically the game is mediocre. It does a good job in areas of importance, but neglects a lot of details. There has been a real effort to add a lot of detail to the world, but, perhaps, it was done in a sort of a rush. You will see a lot of low res textures and blocky models, something that other, earlier games don't come even close to. The larger monitor you have, the worse it's gonna look, lol. Effects aren't that good, either. The best model I know of so far is Elisabeth herself, and she looks best when in the dark, LOL! I am not kidding. I know it sounds derogatory...Game has a bit of an optimisation issue with loading areas and such. Nothing major. Don't know why they just didn't add more loading screens. \n\nWhile on headphones I was able to appreciate the sound, but when not plugged in, it ended up resembling static noise. I am not very technical when it comes to hardware and what it can give you, but other titles sound a lot better when not on headphones, with added details when plugged in.

You know that feeling, at the end of a great book or movie or TV show or whatever, and for a moment you wonder \"wait, is it really over?\" And then you try to convince yourself that it's not, and you try to find any way at all to fill that sudden void. I don't know, maybe that feeling's new to you. Play Bioshock Infinite to feel it, I guess.\n\nRewind. I had heard of Bioshock, knew it was some kind of x-punk techno-fantasy kind of world known for rich story and character development. I never picked it up though because, well, sometimes the time just never feels right to pick something up. I started with Infinite off a whim. The first ten minutes took my breath away. And I spent the next several hours trying to get it back and failing, all the way until the credits rolled their way across the screen.\n\nThe music is beautiful. The scenery is beautiful. The dialogue is beautiful. There's a bonding between the setting and the plot that I can't fully explain. I guess this is what people mean by \"immersion.\" Turns out you don't need some avatar you create to be fully immersed, no, all you need are characters you empathize with, who grip you by your mind, your heart, your soul, who rocket into your life from a different world and fade away just as abruptly.\n\nInterlude: the gameplay is technically well-done. I'm not one for FPSs generally, I mean, I'll play one but I'm not very GOOD at it. I wasn't very good at this game either but if Bioshock Infinite does one thing well gameplay-wise, it's offering the player choices. Do you want to run into every encounter guns-blazing? Do you want to stay back and judiciously use spells (ahem, vigors) to crowd control? Do you want to swing around a giant skyline raining bullets from on high before flipping down and sticking the landing with a spinning gear-shiv to the face? Mix and match to your heart's desire. Bioshock Infinite is a series of FPS set pieces with several options per encounter, although I'd say that once you find your groove, it's pretty easy to lock yourself into one way of doing things. Aside from combat, there's a minor exploration component, and this is where the game struggles just a little maintaining its shimmering veneer of immersive world-building. If all you had to do was walk around and explore the beautiful world the creators made for you, that would've been perfect, but for whatever reason the developers insisted on sticking in \"collectible bonuses\" in little nooks and crannies out of the way of the main plot to reward people for wandering like an aimless lunatic and digging through trash cans. Well, nothing's perfect.\n\nThe thing is, this game would be worth playing if it didn't have any gameplay at all. I'm serious. Just experiencing it completely passively would have been enough to make me feel similarly to how I feel now. But there's a certain extra factor gained by the interactivity afforded to the player. The stakes feel real. And Elizabeth, one of my favorite \"companion\" characters in a long time, by a long margin, feels like a real friend who you want to protect. Like someone with whom to laugh, to live, to cherish every passing moment because you know, one moment, it'll all be over, but God only knows what you'd do without her.\n\nLook, all of this was just to lend some substance to the review so that it'd make sense to you, who has never played the game. But in the end Bioshock Infinite left me with a hole in my heart, and that's what I really felt was worth saying.","timestamp_created":1512650027,"timestamp_updated":1512650027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38127577","author":{"steamid":"76561198305391193","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":745,"last_played":1512649101},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏中的“命运石之门”\n剧情丰富，女主伊丽莎白形象塑造的很成功\n游戏中所表现的很多地方都值得我们深思\n例如：种族歧视问题，阶级问题，封建与革命问题，责任问题，宗教问题\n上一次让我这样怅然若失的结局，可能还是COD 6吧\n真的很喜欢的一部作品","timestamp_created":1512649944,"timestamp_updated":1514371206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38122717","author":{"steamid":"76561198435481281","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1450,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":835,"last_played":1581802100},"language":"spanish","review":"me gusto la verdad","timestamp_created":1512630235,"timestamp_updated":1512630235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38121139","author":{"steamid":"76561198115652087","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":526,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":474,"last_played":1609381519},"language":"koreana","review":"재밌어요.\n그래픽 좋아요.\nDLC도 재밌어요.","timestamp_created":1512623445,"timestamp_updated":1599986430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38119854","author":{"steamid":"76561198149864802","num_games_owned":227,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":991,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":991,"last_played":1516659666},"language":"russian","review":"[quote]\n[quote=Элизабет] Всегда есть маяк.

Фыр-фыр.[/url][/code]\n\nОпустим игровой момент и затронем тему мироздания. Нет утверждений и потверждений создания мира, есть теории, законы, правила. Теория бесконечной численности параллельных миров, с бесконечным числом различных действий. Почему мы не можем вмешаться в свою судьбу, чужую, и изменить что-то, взяв из другого, альтернативного мира? \n\n[h1][b]Завязка и сюжет :[/b][/h1]\n\nНаш главный герой — Букер [spoiler]\"Комсток\"[/spoiler], вполне наглядное подтверждение тому, чего делать не стоит. Но у всех путей исход один, поэтому все наши действия давно предрешены, даже вмешательство уже предрешено, измена чего-то давно предрешена в другом мире. Так, что же тогда делать? Все довольно просто. Не быть как Букер в своем мире, человеком, который опустившись до дна, решил продать свое дитя. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1223395793\nВ игре весьма запутанный сюжет, что может оттолкнуть большинство геймеров, ищущих красивый шутер, но суть этой истории актуальна и сейчас. Нужно жить ради близких, ради своего будущего. Ведь человек сам строитель, разрушитель, и никто другой, кроме него. \n\nСама по себе игра привлекает взор не только историей. С первых шагов в Колумбии бросается эта потрясающая графика. Голубое небо, мягкие лучи солнца, словно мы \"застыли\" в этом дне. А когда мы бродим по летающему городу, то понимаем, что оказываемся в будущем, но в стиле 80-90-х годов. Конечно, так оно и есть (действия происходят в 1912), но внимательно изучив записи по ходу игры, можно понять, что большинство разработок взято именно из будущего. \n\n[h1][b]Геймплей :[/b][/h1]\n\nПройдемся по огромному городу. Нас встречает множество различных магазинчиков: бакалеи, цветочные, фото-салон, бары и клубы. Все веселятся, проводят ярмарки. Гуляя по барам, мы можем услышать этот эксцентричный и заводящий джаз, сразу может вспомниться серия игр как Fallout. От этого просто захватывает дух.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1223109911\nИмеется здесь множество видео, аудио хроники. То есть, мы можем полностью узнать историю города, о Пророке. А так ли хорошо живется тут? Мы успели заметить странных людей в белых халатах. По ходу сюжета мы узнаем о том, что есть и противники у Комстока, есть люди, желающие свободы, прав. На минуту можно будет почувствовать дух дикого запада. Наделенная силами Элизабет будет нам помогать в сражениях, открывая различные разрывы во времени. Также, есть одно уникальное изобретение - интересные напитки. Выпивая их, человек получает супер-силу! Огненные шары из рук? Легко! Электричество? Без проблем! И они сыграют неплохую службу нам.\n\nОтмечу разнообразие оружия, ведь это тоже важно в шутерах, не стрелять с одного пистолета. Дробовики, снайперки, автоматы, гранатометы это все есть. И конечно оружие можно модифицировать! Кстати, как и напитки. Наша напарница и в этом подсобит, то монетку найдет, то патроны. Девушка хоть куда. \n\n[h1][b]Развязка :[/b][/h1]\n\nДумаю, проработаны даже самые маленькие детали. Даже номера банковских ячеек. Не просто размытое изображение с предпологаемыми цифрами. Задумка и воплощение летающего города, обоснованная теория, а не просто \"Мы вот сделали так, поэтому летает\". Мертвые среди живых, причем понимающие это. То есть, мне просто не к чему придраться. Идеальности и не может быть, но \"очень хорошо\" бывает. Поэтому, данная игра одна из очень и очень хороших во всем плане.  \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1227946838\nИ кого же из всех героев мне больше жаль? Букера? Элизабет? Увы. Мне было очень жаль Соловья. Верную и преданную птичку, стремившуюся защитить своего друга... Пусть и предавшего его. \n\n[b]Общая оценка: 10/10[/b]\n\n[code][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/foxinwgame]Группа лисички ^.^[/url][/code]","timestamp_created":1512618260,"timestamp_updated":1525584926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":74,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.793626546859741211","comment_count":26,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38119330","author":{"steamid":"76561198215515827","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1109,"last_played":1558137674},"language":"english","review":"Kept staring at elizabeth's t i t s to be honest.\n\nSome people may be detered by the politics in this game, however  its not as bad as you think.
