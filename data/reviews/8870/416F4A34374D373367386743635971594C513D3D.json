A pesar de todo esto el juego esta muy bien, sigue contandonos una historia sobre una ciudad autónoma, en este caso en vez de ser submarina es flotante, dónde ocurren sucesos varios que definirán su campaña como una de las mejores que nunca habrás visto en un videojuego, incluso te olvidarás de los prejuicios que le dabas al juego por abandonar \"Rapture\". Por si fuera poco Tiene 2 DLCs (2 Episodios=1 Historia \"nueva\") que nos aportan una campaña adicional que nos envia de vuelta a Rapture, cuando esta estaba en sus mejores momentos y como llega a convertirse en una ciudad abandonada y oscura (lo que veiamos en BioShock 1). Además a pesar de haber perdido el modo multijugador que nos otorgaba la 2ª entrega de la saga (BioShock 2) esta última entrega cuenta con un modo competitivo online, disponible através de un tercer DLC (el primero que sacaron) que consta de un modo ordas con distintas opciones y niveles.\n\nEn definitiva, para mí ha sido un juego muy bueno, que me ha enganchado con su apasionante campaña que realmente engancha (como todos los juegos de esta saga), y espero con impaciencia ver donde se desarollará la proxima entrega ¿bajo tierra?¿quizá en el espacio?¿o en otro planeta?estas dos ultimas estarían muy bién. ;)","timestamp_created":1409003510,"timestamp_updated":1409003510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11865234","author":{"steamid":"76561198043838667","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1477090514},"language":"russian","review":"Ну что я могу сказать : плохая графика и анимация , скучный и однообразный геймплей ... и однако моя любимая игра. \nБиошок инфинит - лучший сюжетный боевик со времён Half life 2.

Лично для меня сюжет был сложен, пришлось покурить пару форумов, чтобы разобраться в концовке.\nПлюсы:\n- Графика\n- Сюжет\n- Геймплей \n\nМинусы...чесно говоря даже не знаю что можно отнести в минусы, игра сделана добротно, стоит не дорого, проходится с удовольствием, может только рисовка на любителя...но если в начале сюжета рисовка кажется очень красочной и позитивной то по ходу сюжета она становится все мрачнее раскрывая свою красоту.","timestamp_created":1408976871,"timestamp_updated":1408976871,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11860543","author":{"steamid":"76561198004736382","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":731,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1505066894},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game , if you guys like bioshock its more of the same but with cool storys thats what a like about it ! \n10/10","timestamp_created":1408975158,"timestamp_updated":1408975158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11860497","author":{"steamid":"76561198043623055","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":583,"last_played":1425987330},"language":"german","review":"Sehr gut","timestamp_created":1408974936,"timestamp_updated":1408974936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504292070865631104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11860096","author":{"steamid":"76561198125520596","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":847,"last_played":1541650497},"language":"turkish","review":"çok güzel bir oyun herkesin almasını tavsiye ederim","timestamp_created":1408972549,"timestamp_updated":1408972549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56886899471282959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11859868","author":{"steamid":"76561198044232137","num_games_owned":849,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":352,"last_played":1625657224},"language":"russian","review":"а симулятор бомжа педофила с наклонностями маньяка клептомана неплох","timestamp_created":1408971040,"timestamp_updated":1408971040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482695192098617554","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11859708","author":{"steamid":"76561198021916215","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":999,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":925,"last_played":1484160818},"language":"german","review":"Ich bin echt sprachlos!\nSeit langem habe ich kein so gutes Spiel mehr gespielt.\nDie Story ist atemberaubend und packt einen von Anfang bis Ende.\nMan sollte sich auf keinen Fall spoilern lassen und das Spiel mit seiner wunderschönen Landschaft und Atmosphäre einfach auf sich wirken lassen.

It brings alot of originality to the table aswell however i did find that i could run the game using basically 2-3 weapons and 3 of the powers with a few exceptions but it still allowed for a varying playstyle to choose but this may have been down to that i played and completed this during a single seating so i was in the same mindset of using single shot powerful weapons such as a carbine etc. That said i would say without a doubt the reason i played this in a single seating was because i found this game so beautiful and gripping so i always wanted to know the result of what i was doing furthermore i also found the protaganist and the second character to be very believeable throughout the game as though everything fell into place and this can be said for every character more or less due to the build up and what i can only refer to as 'the oh-damn' moment and if you play through this game you will realise the exact moment i am talking about.","timestamp_created":1408918781,"timestamp_updated":1408918781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11853028","author":{"steamid":"76561198047350224","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":6143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6025,"last_played":1455602401},"language":"english","review":"Play on 1999 mode and it will feel sufficiently challenged and satisfied, this may be a lot more linear than Bioshock but it is actually more difficult. Combat is the #1 strengh and emphasis of this game I would easily give it a 10, its what makes the game challenging. the enviroments are perfect for fighting enemys and at times really hard, which will cause you to think carefully about what weapons you choose (via upgrades) aswell as vigors. Peoples expectations are what caused bad hype for this game, but i can assure you that all that negative hype is all lies. There are a variety of Weapons to choose from, which makes each playthrough immersive since you wont ever have enough money to upgrade everything, that is where a lot of thinking will be done: choosing the right weapons and vigors to upgrade (my favorite is sniper rifle fully upgraded, and vigor would be untertoe). The only downside to this game is the linearity, You will always be progressing forward through each level rather than searching for items in a large area (level) such as bioshock; instead the certian areas of each level will be cut off from use depending on the check points you pass. The only 2 levels that arent so linear Are Soldiers field and Emporia (right after you take multiple trams to get to emporia) These 2 levels are classic bioshock examples the rest take you through one section after the next cutting you off from goin back to search for more items. This game is all about combat and is mainly focused on challlenging the player wich is this games most immersive quality.","timestamp_created":1408918281,"timestamp_updated":1408918281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482316911220550537","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11852893","author":{"steamid":"76561198054003063","num_games_owned":388,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":718,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1500244646},"language":"brazilian","review":"top","timestamp_created":1408917502,"timestamp_updated":1408917502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11852831","author":{"steamid":"76561198004714307","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1184,"last_played":1540832691},"language":"french","review":"Et voilà, je viens de voir la cinématique de fin de Bioshock Infinite et... je dois dire que l'expérience de jeu a été géniale de bout en bout.

DIe malerische Stadt Columbia, die mir nun endlich auch greifbar im Gegensatz zu Rapture wirkt verstärkt die malerische Atmosphäre. Besonders die spätere Entwicklung des Himmelsparadieses gefiel mir sehr gut. Einzig negativ ist die etwas knapp ausgefallene Anzahl an Charkterdesigns der Nebenakteure und die Tatsache, dass das Spiel auch ein Ende fallen negativ auf.\nZusammengefasst ist Bioshock Infinite jeden Cent und noch mehr wert, ist für mich der beste Egoshooter und eines der besten Spiele überhaupt und dient hoffentlich als Ansporn mehr Spiele der Art zu entwickeln.","timestamp_created":1408916850,"timestamp_updated":1408916850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11852641","author":{"steamid":"76561198050731782","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":106,"playtime_forever":915,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":915,"last_played":1475236318},"language":"english","review":"Would I recomend this game? I feel it's one of those game where it really depends on each person.\n\nGame looks nice. No problem controls or gameplay. I don't dislike the game but it's not my top favorite. Though \"run, shoot, run shoot.\" Gets reallly tiring after a while (for me). Not sure why I was not tired in Bioshock 1 and 2 since it kind of the same thing as well. I feel there was not mutch exsploring...even though you can walk around town but there where not mutch secret hidden room hardly or extra things. It can kind of get boring over time unless you enjoy just shooting around. What happen to things from the first and second game to find hidden room and trigger thing with your powere? Like melt ice and use eletric to open broken doors and things. You do that almost only at the begening of the game and that is it. You use your power to just fight off the badguys and on items..like puddles etc... As for me I like a mixure of things to do. The art is nice. Story line is intersting. It's not a bad game but it's nothing special.... What I thought it would be...all the hype for nothing :(. I would still play it though to complete the Bioshock series I suppose. The reply value for me is very low unless I'm in the mood but as for Bioshock 1 and 2 I rather reply them again. \n\nI also got the DLC.

The game starts as something dark and twisted and ends up as something darker and even more twisted,  that is what I adore about it.  Bioshock isn't linear, it is constantly shaping itself into something different and unique.  However the story did get a tincy bit tricky to follow towards the end but will leave you thinking for a good few hours.  Appart from the exceedingly great story, the shooting mechanics were quite fun to use.  Start with some gun play then mix in a little paranormal powers to dispatch your foes in a manner of fun ways.  Unfortunatly I did find the ADS key binded a little weird for a shooter, but that could just be personal preference.  There are many RPG mecanics too, such as the upgrade vendors, these help you progress through the game a bit easier.  After reading the review I have written I feel all I really wanted to say it.....
