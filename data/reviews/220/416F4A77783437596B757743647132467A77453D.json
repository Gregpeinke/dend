You are greeted by no other but the head and culprit of all and with that the games main antagonist. You don't know this yet though. Instead you move on, not really knowing what to do and where to go, talking to the many people. Slowly you begin to get a sense of what is going on and it makes you feel uncomfortable. But you don't have much time to think of that as suddenly you are being chased.\n\nNot only do you have this uncomfortable feeling sitting in your neck at all times possible but you cannot cope with anything to get rid of it because you are constantly on the run. You are not given the time to fully understand what is happening and that makes the entire situation even better as everything is very well explained but it is still left in a sense of mystery that only uncovers more and more as you play through the game.\n\nYou are finally on the river and you know they are still after you. But you manage to not only escape but even defeat the gunship at the end. And throughout the segment you keep finding these small as well as bigger set pieces. Small rebel outposts, some overrun, some destroyed, others under siege and others again are no longer in use. And of course you find one bigger set piece where there are combine o'plenty. But something I noticed about all these places is that none of them made me feel like \"I finally found other people\" or \"Oh I am not alone here\".\n\nBecause, the truth was that I was alone regardless of who I met. I either had to push on and move towards my goal or had to fight my way through which left bodies for the player to see and feel that they just killed more people. And the places I fought through are places that were once in use by humanity. You get the sense that this place holds a mystery, a story but you will never find out what that story is. And neither can you find another person. And if you do find someone, it's likely not going to be a friend.\n\nIt makes you feel more and more uneasy. The world you once knew is still somewhat the same but here you are, as a human, no longer welcome. As a free spirit, a free thinker. You hope that you find others here or there but every time you find combine or the undead. And it doesn't get any better once you reach Black Mesa East.\n\nHere you are, the first time under other people. The people you know you can trust and you work with to fix everything.Finally it seems like everything is going to be fine and you will be under other people but alas the game is pulling it away right under your feet. You are being attacked and that at full force. You have to go to Ravenholm as the only way out and fight your way through an abandoned Rebeltown that is now only populated by the Undead and a local Priest.\n\nThis man however is just another survivor who has lost hope for everything and is now just fighting for his own life and to \"free his flock\" as he would put it. He even addresses the undead as former friends he once knew. And at the end, he leaves your side ensuring your safety on the other side of the gate while moving on by himself knowing that his fate is sealed but instead of cowering in fear, he laughs while he shoots the undead.\n\nAnd now as we move on we finally get onto Highway 17. And oh man, do I have to tell you something about Highway 17 as it's probably my favorite section of the entire game. This entire section is... It's hard to really put it into words.\n\nOnce again the section is like the River. You find many different places, small as well as big. Houses along the road but all of them ruins and empty. Or filled with various dangerous entities. Some hold small control points for the combine, others house the rebels and they use it as a base. But you still can’t help but feel lonely. It doesn't matter that the world has just placed people next to you with the same goal as you. You still feel like something isn't right.\n\nAnd the fact that you are still being hunted only hammers this point down even more. How are you supposed to feel like you are fighting together with others against a common enemy when you are constantly on the run, having to leave behind others so that you may survive while you have to also fight through everything at once?\n\nBut we are still on Highway 17 and that brings me on to my favorite set piece in this section as well as this entire game. The railway bridge. Everything about this section is perfect. How that bridge is towering over everything, how you are first introduced to its scale by seeing it from afar and then of course by having to traverse the broken catwalks right under it. Plus the small houses to the side of it also make it feel like there was a story here at one point. People had settled down here for a reason. Now, of course, it's all abandoned but there were people here.\n\nIt is a story you will NEVER see. You will never feel. You will never hear about or read about or know that it happened. But it COULD have happened. Just like the people who had once settled here, this place has history. It has a story. And yet you will NEVER uncover it.\n\nYou can feel the loneliness in these places. Places where there should be other people but aren't because you are just not here in the right time. You have been torn out of your own and you were placed in the future due to the Gman. You are still coping with the fact that the world you knew is gone and that you are now in a world that is so hostile towards you. And both of you, as in Gordon and you as the player, can very much relate to this.\n\nYou both knew this world. What it felt like. How it looked like. What it should be like. And yet it isn't and will never be like that anymore. The world you knew is gone, the people you knew are gone. All hope is lost and you are all alone by yourself. And the more you keep on going the more you find out that the world you are fighting for is practically dead if it wasn't for the rebels who are still alive and kicking.\n\nAnd even as you get back into the City for the final Assault, you once again are met with fights for your live. You are constantly switching to being on the run and fighting onward until you finally get to the Citadel and face the big bad himself. And once again you do not get to enjoy the victory, you do not get to find a way out. You do not get to save the people that fought by your side. Because once again Gman takes you out of the picture before you can really get used to the people around you and the world he had placed you in.\n\nEssentially Half Life 2 has you visiting its world, a world you should know, as a stranger. You can NEVER get used to it as you are constantly on the run. You cannot stop once and actually GET what has happened. It makes sense in your head, it makes sense overall. But you cannot truly GET it. Because the world won't let you. And that is why I always look back onto Half Life 2 as one of the best post-apocalyptic games that we will ever get.\n\nMany games nowadays that feature a similar world, either give the player too much freedom or not enough of it. You are either given an entire world to explore while you should follow the story or the set pieces are mainly in use for the story itself, aka missions and that's that. Half Life 2 is the perfect mix of both, giving the player enough freedom to explore the world at their own pace but giving the player still a sense of direction that lead them through the story overall. There are countless of smaller places the casual player likely will never find because why explore the place?\n\nI tell you why: Cause that's a medkit right there. Right inside that ruin over there where someone died a long time ago from the Antlions who crawl all over the place. Or maybe they died due to a bulletwound. Maybe they tried to hold out there and starved while hoping that other rebels would come by this place and find them as they themselves got lost. Who knows. I don't and neither do you.","timestamp_created":1564464125,"timestamp_updated":1564465834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.744877159595489502","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54366891","author":{"steamid":"76561198148585964","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":985,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":980,"last_played":1567274621},"language":"spanish","review":"el hombre correcto en el lugar equivocado  provocara que este sea uno de los mejores juegos de la historia","timestamp_created":1564461867,"timestamp_updated":1564461867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54366807","author":{"steamid":"76561198379214070","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":958,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":954,"last_played":1602892143},"language":"english","review":"I like how the it seems like they focused on the plot less than the graphics so it runs so smooth and I can have a lot of fun.

A little overrated too. One reason I give it this kind of rating is because it's seen by the community as some masterpiece. And yes I do understand that it's 2019 and this game came out in 2004 and I would completely agree that it was a masterpiece back then because it lifted PC gaming with the gameplay and something different. But playing through the story seems a little stale and the same thing occurring. In most of the levels I'm shooting planes and helicopters (died most of the time). Killing the same Combine soldiers, even though you fight against zombies, and the monster \"bosses\" seemed a little easy. I like Valve as a company, I think they helped shape PC gaming very well, great games and great developers (yes and Gabe Newell). I kind of regret not playing Half Life and the expansions first as the games story felt hard to follow (but it is possible to play the second without playing the first). I plan on playing Lost Coast soon and possibly the first one. Maybe episode 1 and 2 but haven't decided. Overall this game is a unique and good one for PC gamers, a classic indeed, and heck mods are all over for the game including a specific game made for it called Garry's Mod. Pick up Half Life 2 and see how you like it, it's only 10 dollars and possibly cheaper when holidays come around.","timestamp_created":1564442360,"timestamp_updated":1564517738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54362209","author":{"steamid":"76561198449040974","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":5437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3857,"last_played":1643597159},"language":"english","review":"Quit reading reviews to stall for time so you don't have to buy the game, just buy it already!","timestamp_created":1564433203,"timestamp_updated":1564433203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54362093","author":{"steamid":"76561198409107595","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1054,"last_played":1564432539},"language":"english","review":"fun. you should get it.","timestamp_created":1564432632,"timestamp_updated":1564432632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54361523","author":{"steamid":"76561198829655760","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1545,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":858,"last_played":1653148595},"language":"brazilian","review":"acho que Half-Life foi um evolução gigante em 1999, e de novo, Half-Life 2, que fez exatamente isso.\n\neu não duvido que Half-Life 3, também seja.","timestamp_created":1564430057,"timestamp_updated":1564430057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54361213","author":{"steamid":"76561198213366789","num_games_owned":316,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2170,"last_played":1561665369},"language":"hungarian","review":"Szeretném azzal kezdeni, hogy a belső nézetes lövöldözős játékok nem állnak közel hozzám, viszont a Half-Life 2 egy mestermű.

Destaca particularmente en la gráfica y el desarrollo del motor Source, pero también hay que mencionar que la narrativa se vuelve más interesante y las mecánicas de juego características de HL1 son llevadas a un nuevo nivel.\n\nEn primer lugar, el trabajo en el motor de juego es digno de alabanza. Esta creación original de Valve ha dado sus frutos en texturas frescas y bien hechas, modelos flexibles, IA más apta y la introducción de nuevos vehículos que el jugador puede usar a su antojo. Por si fuera poco, HL2 tiene un variado equilibrio de paisajes donde se desarrolla el gameplay y la historia: ciudades, alcantarillas, autopistas y pueblos desiertos son parte de la multiplicidad novedosa que ofrece el juego. Una podría decir que el aspecto gráfico se ha vuelto una de los más potentes e influyentes sellos de la saga Half-Life de este siglo (basta mirar otros juegos de Valve post 2004). Sin embargo, debo decir que no me convencen tanto la existencia de los ragdolls, ya que si bien son una versión limpia de los cadáveres, hay veces en que se ven tontos y fuera de contexto. Al menos están ahí para reírse un rato.\n\nEn cuanto a la historia, es de destacar el giro argumental tomado al final de HL1. Aunque extraña, la historia toma sentido a medida que se avanza en el juego, y es de hecho bien interesante. Los personajes claves de la saga son realmente introducidos en esta secuela (algunos incluso aparecieron antes en HL1), y el argumento se siente casi como una novela (no esperábamos menos de su guionista, Marc Laidlaw), con un gusto a la novela de Orwell, 1984.\n\nAunque el gameplay sigue la misma premisa de HL1, se siente diferente por las nuevas mecánicas y armas remasterizadas. Esto no se siente desbalanceado ya que, como pasa en HL1, las armas más poderosas son desbloqueadas mientras más se avanza en el juego y más difícil se vuelve el combate. Es de destacar la pistola de gravedad, una herramienta divertida y flexible que puede ser usada como un arma. De hecho, esta es quizás tan ícono de HL2 como lo fue la crowbar para HL1. Sin embargo, debo decir que una de las mayores decepciones del gameplay es la mecánica del poder auxiliar. Por el hecho de que usa la linterna, oxígeno y esprint al mismo tiempo (todos igualmente útiles), empaña la experiencia bastante y en general es bastante molesta.\n\nRecomiendo este juego para aquellos que disfrutaron del buen HL1 pero quieren probarlo en un nuevo nivel, con nuevos entornos y mecánicas. También ofrece un completo nuevo mundo para la creación de mods, renovando su potencial de rejugabilidad constantemente.","timestamp_created":1564272163,"timestamp_updated":1653099264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54329944","author":{"steamid":"76561198078163603","num_games_owned":341,"num_reviews":75,"playtime_forever":523,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":362,"last_played":1658741302},"language":"french","review":"A quand le 3 ? \n\n\n\n\n\n:)","timestamp_created":1564268336,"timestamp_updated":1564268336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54329794","author":{"steamid":"76561198832552417","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":176,"last_played":1605587444},"language":"english","review":"It should be a requirement for you to play this game before you're considered a gaming hobbyist","timestamp_created":1564267416,"timestamp_updated":1609753618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54328955","author":{"steamid":"76561198304718590","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":381,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1563894009},"language":"french","review":"Alors la c'est un le plus grand classique en terme d'histoire, de combat et de puzzle ( énigme) auquel j'ai jamais joué.

Sure, it may have been different when it first came out - at least in terms of some of what the game engine could do - but that's just it: it feels like more of an exposition of what could have been possible than a finished product.\n\nThe first hour or two builds up a lot of great atmosphere and tension, but after that it just sort of peters out and turns into another generic FPS experience. I know a lot of you are probably thinking \"well, Half-Life 2 probably hasn't aged well when compared to modern games\" which is true, but again I never really thought it was all that great to begin with. Like I said, after the first 1-2 hours of play, it turns into another \"shoot bad guys, flip the switch, get to here\" kind of game that just feels like production was rushed to meet a deadline. Which is unfortunate, given that it could have been much, much more interesting and enjoyable considering what the engine can do compared to other games of the time.\n\nThe gunplay is another aspect of the overall \"average\" nature of HL2. You have your standard FPS set of weapons: Crowbar (melee), pistol, SMG, assault rifle, shotgun, rocket launcher, grenades - the crossbow was neat and the gravity gun was fun, but again that felt like more of a gimmick to demonstrate the physics engine than a game changing weapon. The enemy AI doesn't help matters, since they pretty much run at your firing and don't seem to react much to being fired upon or being shot.\n\nDon't even get me started on the vehicle sequences: they are wayyyyyy too long, ruin the pacing, and feel like filler material.\n\nBy the time I got close to the end of the game I was playing it just for the sake of completing it once again and didn't really enjoy it as much as I felt I should have. Again, HL2 just feels kinda like a really long demo for a game (Half Life 3) that was never made.\n\nThen, upon completing the game, I was once again slapped in the face with a piss-poor ending as a reward.\n\nOverall: Save the world from aliens FPS, ho hum. Basically Quake with a gimmicky physics engine. 6/10\nGames like this make me with Steam had a \"Meh\" recommendation. I gave it a \"Yes\" only because it's slightly above average for 2000's first-person shooter games. I found other period games, such Halo and Red Faction, to be more enjoyable - and they are both several years older.","timestamp_created":1564116894,"timestamp_updated":1564425253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54297340","author":{"steamid":"76561198351214658","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":731,"last_played":1564374102},"language":"english","review":"Game is from 2004. Was a wee lad who barely knew what a PS2 was or what vidyagaems were in general. After comparing this to other games from the same year (Doom 3 for the most part) i'd bet this was the most important of the year. It contains the best human facial animations of the year (which modern games completely neglect in pursuit of melting your ram), it's voice acting, and story telling is f u c k i n g god tier. I'm still amazed that very few developers use Valve's little formula for story telling, but who knows what the future holds for us. Weapon models are good enough for what they are, the shotgun and obviously the gravity gun are the standout armaments of the arsenal. Mod support is extremely good. Graphically it was cutting edge in 04, and holds up extremely well. 9/10 not a fan of the boat sections.\n\nFinal note tho: I hope valve just announces that Half-life 3 isn't in development. My expectations would be astronomical, and Gabe swims in a huge enough pile of Steam money and CSGO case key sales that he doesn't have to even make games for dosh. Please tell your thoughs to me in the comments.","timestamp_created":1564110842,"timestamp_updated":1564110842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54293939","author":{"steamid":"76561198344001016","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1954,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1333,"last_played":1564645881},"language":"english","review":"Half life 2 could be best fps game.","timestamp_created":1564091850,"timestamp_updated":1564091850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54293896","author":{"steamid":"76561198049270050","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":713,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":713,"last_played":1564091219},"language":"english","review":"A classic.
