The structure is also very similar to HL: you come to work, ZOMFG! accident, aliens, then soldiers, then you're on the alien world, you come back, and mess about with teleports while obviously being had by scientists.\n\nI think this add-on completely missed out on developing the alternate view point. It did absolute *nothing* to show you the HL events from a point of view of a security guard. You were just like Freeman, trying to GTFO from Black Mesa!\n\nSurely an armed security guard at a secret advanced research facility has some sort of protocol for such events that happened? Even the titles that flash at the start say equipment is first priority, personell is secondary, and personal life is of low priority, yet the only thing you're meant to care in the game is your own life.\n\nA great way to spin this add-on would've been to follow just that recipe: first you try to save some equipment but then realize it's a hopeless and stupid thing to do; we have to evacuate people! Whoever you're helping however are gunned right and left by soldiers and at the end, you're forced to abandon your job ethics, abandon your morals, and fight for your own life.\n\nAfter the first 5 minutes of the game, the only thing different from this and original HL is that you can't use H.E.V. chargers.

Well I wish there was a mediocre button cause this game ain't bad, but it isn't good either. Compared to Opposing Force this adds nothing to the original game. No new weapons, horrible level design and incredibly short. This expansion  is really nothing special and it pains me to say that. The gameplay isn't even fun this time as this time it revolves around jumping puzzles and not so much around gun fights. This expansion is also really easy compared to Half Life as there is no threat standing in your way. The game is still fun enough for you to finish it but it is very disappointing. Overall there is not much to say about Half Life: Blue Shift. It's not a bad game but it's not good compared to Opposing Force and Half Life.

You play as Black Mesa security guard Barney Calhoun and it’s a parallel story with Half-Life but short. It’s not that good and I’ll explain why. If you remember from my previous review, Half-Life: Opposing Force featured a decent amount of new content for Half-Life. Now this game is like the opposite were there is no new weapons, NPCs, or weapons but instead just a new 90 to 120 minute campaign just slapped onto the original Half-Life game. However this game does feature the new HD pack, where it basically takes existing models, weapons, and weapon sounds and replaces them with newer, better looking ones. This addon also can be used with the original Half-Life and expansion Opposing Force but that’s really not a big deal for this review. I also noticed that the HD models have washed out looking textures on them for some reason compared to when using them in other Half-Life games. As for the gameplay and everything, it’s really the exact same game but with recycled textures and new maps for the single-player campaign (no multiplayer included). For 2001 this game was just bland by this point especially with titles like Halo hitting the XBOX back in the day. However if you can pick-up this game cheap on steam then get it because it’s certainly not a bad game but nice to play through Half-Life again with a new campaign.","timestamp_created":1433356728,"timestamp_updated":1433356728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16155919","author":{"steamid":"76561198136130981","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":99,"playtime_forever":60,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60,"last_played":1432975380},"language":"polish","review":"Super gra Polecam !!!!","timestamp_created":1433337295,"timestamp_updated":1433337295,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16124727","author":{"steamid":"76561198083038046","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1487374620},"language":"english","review":"Blue shift is a great game to get if you are thinking of trying a half life game.\nIt's short and sweet, I would even say play this before any others, it gets you\nready for the bigger games.","timestamp_created":1433201576,"timestamp_updated":1433201576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16104705","author":{"steamid":"76561198065236835","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":10949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":532,"last_played":1574927790},"language":"english","review":"Buy Opposing Force","timestamp_created":1433101519,"timestamp_updated":1433101519,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.442062973976135254","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16073623","author":{"steamid":"76561198057298622","num_games_owned":429,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":178,"last_played":1432347646},"language":"turkish","review":"Half Life'ın 2. eklenti paketi.

Half life: blue shift was originally meant to be part of the Dreamcast version of Half life just like how Decay is for the PlayStation 2 version but unfortunately before the production of the Dreamcast version began Sega announced that they would be discontinuing the Dreamcast, so Gearbox ported Blue shift over to the PC. Half life: blue shift also was the first expansion to include the HD content which was meant to be for the Dreamcast version originally. What the HD content did was that it replaced things such as the MP5 for a higher quality assault rifle and it replaced some NPC models as well, in my opinion i don't really like the HD models so i have turned them off in the options menu.\nThe story\nIn Half life: blue shift you play as a security guard called Barney Calhoun who was later used has a main character in Half Life 2. Before the Black Mesa incident Barneys job was to protect the equipment and personnel within area 3 of Black Mesa but when the incident happens your main goal is to escape the facility.\n\nThe pros of Half life: blue shift\n- Good story that fills in the gap of the Half life story line\n- The game has some very good level design\n- The AI was very good for its time and still is since they react to different thing such as if you wait near a door the marines will throw in grenades\n- You have to interact with NPC's in order to progress through game, this is good because your not just opening doors like you did in the original Half life\n- There are decent puzzles and they evenly spaced out in the game\n- The game is very enjoyable including the combat even though enemy's can seem like they can take several rounds in the head\n\nWhat is bad about Half life: blue shift\n- One of the most obvious things is that nothing new was really added to the game such as weapons, enemy's etcetera\n- The game is very short only taking me around 3 hours to complete and that was without doing the tutorial section of  the game\n- I found that the game was easy even though i was playing on hard\n- some times i got stuck on the environment such as in between boxes or on the walls located in Xen\n\nOverall Half life: Blue shift is a very good game but does have a few issues but they don't affect the game too much since the game is very enjoyable, also even though the game is very short it is also very cheap so you do get what you pay for. I do recommend getting this game if you like any Half life game or just generally like old school first person shooters like doom, but if that is the case then you would of most likely would of played a Half life game.","timestamp_created":1432474722,"timestamp_updated":1432474932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15982629","author":{"steamid":"76561198094334788","num_games_owned":285,"num_reviews":110,"playtime_forever":1295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1108,"last_played":1639068539},"language":"polish","review":"about that beer i owe ya","timestamp_created":1432472816,"timestamp_updated":1519055076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471698105335235596","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15975845","author":{"steamid":"76561198087643416","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":119,"last_played":1519169099},"language":"spanish","review":"Un poco flojo, pero mejor que otros juegos. 8.5/10","timestamp_created":1432434349,"timestamp_updated":1432434349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15973047","author":{"steamid":"76561198041003240","num_games_owned":1019,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1431828622},"language":"english","review":"[b]Pros[/b]\n+Still looks and feels like a Half-Life game/story.\n+You finally find out which random security guard is Barney Calhoun.

No new weapons, enemies, etc. I mean, there's a new character, so I guess that's something...\n-[spoiler]The closest you get to a final boss is making sure the teleporter doesn't explode or whatever.[/spoiler]\n-There's a REALLY annoying bug where, if you die and respawn by clicking one of the mouse buttons, your weapon will constantly fire off until you click the mouse button again. I'm not sure if there's a fix for this or even if it's just me, but just be wary of that.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nOut of all of the entries in the Half-Life franchise, this is probably the least impactful. In fact, I'm willing to bet there have been mods for Half-Life that both continue the story in its own way and left more of an impact to the player. That being said though, this expansion isn't bad by any means. Just not quite as good as other games in the series.\n\nIf you want this game, I'd recommend buying one of the Half-Life complete packs if you don't have a large number of the other entries. You'll get the other entries and save money overall in the process.\n\nScore rating: 6.5/10","timestamp_created":1432418153,"timestamp_updated":1637867946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536784708499908447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15967747","author":{"steamid":"76561198191291079","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1446802662},"language":"russian","review":"Отличный, но короткий аддон к легендарной игре Half-Life!

This time around we play as a security guard called Barney Calhoun. He is mute and plays exactly the same as our last protagonist Gordon. If it wasn't for people calling you by your name you would have no clue you are supposed to be a completely different character.  The same goes for the levels, enemies and weapons. There is zero new enemies or weapons, in fact there are less weapons in this game. Levels themselves are very much like base Half Life, nothing special but definitely of the quality same quality and takes a bigger focus on action. A slight nick-pick I have is that the melee weapon is still a crowbar like the engineer Gordon  instead of a baton that would be far more suited toward a security officer. \n\nThe first thing you will notice starting up the game is that the user interface is now blue instead of orange like the main game. It is probably done to remind you that you are a security officer but has no other effects. The main change is that you no longer refill your “armor” via the wall mounted H.E.V system since you do not have that suit. Instead you scavenge around for usable security armor sets to refill your armor count. One big difference is that unlike the main game this now has a few unique npcs with their own personalities and motives instead of the original's endless army of generic clone npcs. You will also catch a few glimpses of Gordon Freeman from time to time but will never interact with him.\n\nBlue Shift is an expansion pack that plays it very close to home. It has very few changes from the base game and adds nothing new other than a few characters. This is a pretty safe dlc to skip as nothing very important happens story wise. It is more of a four hour adventure for those seeking more of that Half Life experience. In that regard it is a pretty solid dlc if you do not mind the lack of anything new to see. So if you fit that description you will find your fix here but for everyone else this is a by the books dlc that can easily be passed on if you had your fill of Half Life with the base game.","timestamp_created":1432181643,"timestamp_updated":1432181643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15915966","author":{"steamid":"76561198025267413","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":213,"last_played":1432138148},"language":"italian","review":"Sicuramente piu' corto e piu' semplice di Opposing Force, ma ci sono diverse anche piu' divertenti del predecessore.\nAd ogni modo, si poteva fare di meglio, sopratutto il finale, il peggiore dell'intera saga di Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1432138350,"timestamp_updated":1432138350,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15883177","author":{"steamid":"76561197972283295","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1117,"last_played":1455896761},"language":"english","review":"Nice short Hal Life story extension.\nThe textures are pure, as well as the animation of the enemies.\nBut the story is solid, entertaining and there are bits I had to play multiple times because were really tough.\n\nI liked it.","timestamp_created":1431938607,"timestamp_updated":1431938607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15857318","author":{"steamid":"76561198160341292","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":239,"last_played":1580668504},"language":"english","review":"This game feels rather short, but that's how it feels after you just know every spot in Blue Shift.

Сейчас узнаете почему.\n\nВо-первых, данная игра не так длинна, как [i]Opposing Force[/i]. Тут не начнёшь скучать спустя час игры, потому что всё самое важное выражено в всего лишь нескольких локациях по сравнению с бескрайними и некончающимися просторами в [i]Opposing Force[/i]. Во-вторых, сюжет выглядит куда интереснее, чем в других аддонах. Одно дело — когда играешь за героя, который пытается исправить ситуацию, а другое — когда играешь за героя, который не хочет в этом участвовать и ищет пути побега.
