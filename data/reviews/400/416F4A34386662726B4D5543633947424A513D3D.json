Обычно описания получаются длинными благодаря тому, что акцентируешь внимание на недостатках. Здесь недостатков нет, и потому довольно сложно много и долго о чём-то рассказывать.\nПервое и главное - это атмосфера. Она великолепна. Здесь в полной мере передано ощущение того самого заброшенного исследовательского комплекса. Звуки, цвета, такинственные надписи на стенах - в это нужно играть, чтобы прочувствовать.\nВторое - озвучка. Уверен, что на английском языке она ещё лучше, но русские переводчики успешно справились. Конечно, речь идёт про ГладОС и все эти замечательные шуточки, которые давно стали классикой.\nТретье - сам игровой процесс. Конечно, сам по себе он не вызвал бы никаких особенных эмоций, но здесь он отлично вписывается в атмосферу. Причём он не слишком тяжел, мне не приходилось подолгу залипать на одном месте - уровни выверены очень аккуратно, как раз между удовольствием от прохождения и раздражением от сложности прохождения.\nИграть всем в обязательном порядке, это шедевр. 10 тортиков из 10!","timestamp_created":1398089657,"timestamp_updated":1428067771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475836008787155151","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9889014","author":{"steamid":"76561198121707948","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189,"last_played":1442188758},"language":"english","review":"Very fun, very simple, physics are nice, and the humor is great.

Um zu ihm zu kommen braucht man schon an einigen Stellen ein bischen mehr Grips als es vorher der Fall war. GlaDOS dann noch unter Zeitdruck zu besiegen ist auch nochmal eine Herausforderung für sich.  Manchmal bleibt man zwar für längere Zeit an einer Stelle hängen, aber man sollte nicht gleich aufgeben und die Komplettlösung angucken.\n\nGLaDOS spricht mit sehr viel Humor, ist aber auch manchmal auch ziehmlich ernst und beleidigend. Kleine Easter Eggs sind, wie zum Beispiel eine Präsentation über \"Black Mesa\" und andere Spiele, natürlich vorhanden.\n\nDie Grafik ist im etwa so, wie bei anderen Spielen von Valve, aber mir zumindest reicht die Grafik vollkommen aus. Das einzige, was besser hätte aussehen können wäre der Hauptcharakter, aber den sieht man in dem meisten Spielen, wo man nicht in der 3rd Person spielen kann,  sowiso nicht (es sei denn, man hat einen Spiegel oder ein Foto). \nDie Sounds sind auch absolut klasse gemacht. An einegen stellen sind sie ein bischen nervig, aber was will man in einem Labor erwarten? \n\nEs hat sehr viel Spaß gemacht, das Spiel durchzuspielen und ist deshalb mehr als nur empfehlenswert.

Mis impresiones:\n\nLo primero, por si alguien tiene dudas acerca de la mecánica de juego: Es un juego enteramente de puzzles. Quiero decir, que cuando acabas el puzzle 1, a continuación pasas al puzzle 2, y luego al puzzle 3... y así hasta el final. No es como otros juegos que son en plan aventura, donde van intercalando los puzzles con otros elementos, como puedan ser exploración, diálogos...\n\nEl juego no tiene una historia-argumento \"per sé\", pero sí que tiene un contexto o un mínimo de hilo conductor que te mantiene el interés para seguir avanzando y no dejar el juego.\n\nY respecto los puzzles en sí. Si tenéis visión espacial los puzzles son pan comido. La dificultad de éstos, o por lo menos la dificultad que yo he tenido para avanzar, ha sido en aquellos puntos donde hay \"saltos con inercia\" (con uno del final estuve más de 1 hora intentándolo), y en otros sitios donde cuenta tu habilidad más que el ingenio (tanto medir con precisión los teletransportes, como ejecutarlos con rapidez).\n\nEn esencia, los puzzles son una combinación de estos factores: ingenio, visión espacial, habilidad y rapidez en la ejecución de algunos teletransportes.\n\n- Lo que más me ha gustado: su concepto de jugabilidad, el tramo final, y el final. Y a parte, lo ingeniosos que son los puzzles.\n\n- Lo que menos me ha gustado: que no son puzzles ENTERAMENTE de ingenio. También cuenta la habilidad. Factor coordinación, y factor tiempo, también son importantes... Y quería (me hubiera gustado) que sólo fuera de pensar XD\n\nSi no sois muy habilidosos con el teclado o el gamepad, os atraganteréis en algunos puntos, pero a la fuerza de intentar los saltos, y midiendo tiempos, al final sale. Yo lo he jugado con gamepad, pero para algunos puntos en concreto donde me atasqué en algún salto, tuve que usar el teclado y el ratón, porque con gamepad me era imposible.","timestamp_created":1397960857,"timestamp_updated":1397961161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9874405","author":{"steamid":"76561198113338970","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":145,"last_played":1588262238},"language":"english","review":"Short but sweet.","timestamp_created":1397939601,"timestamp_updated":1397939601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9869967","author":{"steamid":"76561198107894246","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1491,"last_played":1412184311},"language":"french","review":"Ce jeu est génial tout simplement :)","timestamp_created":1397908023,"timestamp_updated":1397908023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9868565","author":{"steamid":"76561198054613298","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":767,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":750,"last_played":1452152650},"language":"spanish","review":"Uno de los mejores juegos de la historia, si no lo has jugado, no tardes mas :D","timestamp_created":1397895936,"timestamp_updated":1397895936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9867714","author":{"steamid":"76561198115436583","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":385,"last_played":1594178314},"language":"english","review":"Its a game","timestamp_created":1397887545,"timestamp_updated":1397887545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9866719","author":{"steamid":"76561198076848337","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":967,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":922,"last_played":1513522120},"language":"english","review":"Portal is a puzzled based game that uses the use of portals to complete a puzzle/level.

While it is possible to play PORTAL 2 without playing the original, you really don't get the sense of \"Hey I seen this before!\" or \"Oh I remember this trick I did back in one puzzle\" Yes there would be times you would find yourself lost and confuse on a puzzle, I would only suggest looking for playthroughs on youtube as a real last resort, I have done this for one puzzle and it did lose abet of magic for me playing a new game the first time, but it was still awesome to play first hand.","timestamp_created":1397678883,"timestamp_updated":1397678883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9832923","author":{"steamid":"76561198087860749","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":385,"last_played":1474525777},"language":"french","review":"Un jeu cool avec des graphisme sympa et un robots genial, à jouer d'urgence.","timestamp_created":1397658248,"timestamp_updated":1397658248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9831894","author":{"steamid":"76561198102765620","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":177,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":177,"last_played":1398523055},"language":"french","review":"[b][u]Appreciation générale :[/u][/b] [b]★★★★☆[/b]\n\n[list]\n\t[*][u]Solo :[/u]\n\t[list]\n\t\tAppreciation : [b]★★★★☆[/b]\n\t\t[*]Très bon jeu, mais dommage qu'il ne dure pas plus longtemps.\n\t[/list]\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1397648841,"timestamp_updated":1430553639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9829443","author":{"steamid":"76561198075360516","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":172,"last_played":1397126454},"language":"russian","review":"Покупайте,не пожалеете","timestamp_created":1397620055,"timestamp_updated":1397620055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9829135","author":{"steamid":"76561198080616044","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":402,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1540434559},"language":"english","review":"Great game for the price, even though its really short.","timestamp_created":1397615623,"timestamp_updated":1397615623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9828209","author":{"steamid":"76561198048564154","num_games_owned":1005,"num_reviews":171,"playtime_forever":283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1616786312},"language":"english","review":"This is a great game with a lot of puzzles which may seem impossible but are easy when you figure them out.

Also when they die they try to reason with and they say \"I don't hate you, or \"no hard feelings?\".

Instead of being able to lift and launch items with the Gravity Gun, you get a neat, a possibly more useful, device known as the Aperture Science Handheld Quantum Tunneling Device, mostly referred to as a Portal Gun. Wow, Valve must like futuristic guns... Anyway, this device can fire a blue portal (left-click) and a red/orange portal (right-click). These portals are spacially linked, so, in simple terms, place something in one portal and it'll exit out of the other. Throughout the game, you are guided through various chambers, which require the use of the Portal Gun, by an automated feminine voice, which belongs to the CPU of the entire facility, known as Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System, or GLaDOS for short. The voice seems to desire to help you, promising you a portion of cake in the end, but can you really trust this machine? With great gameplay, intriguing mechanics, an epic final battle, and an extremely popular credits theme, this game is downright amazing, and I recommend it to any puzzle fanatics or gamers in general. The game only has one flaw: It is rather easy.","timestamp_created":1396643300,"timestamp_updated":1396643300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9726196","author":{"steamid":"76561198127599991","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":797,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":704,"last_played":1398436864},"language":"english","review":"One of the many great games designed by Valve, great gameplay and impressive graphics for a game designed in 2007. \nVery clever dynamics and laws of physics, would reccomend this game for people who like to solve puzzles and take on tough challenges.\nHowever, the story needs to be more developed rather than just a few testing chambers.\n8/10","timestamp_created":1396642027,"timestamp_updated":1398264688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9724918","author":{"steamid":"76561198060139827","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":344,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1489323310},"language":"english","review":"This game is tight.
