Unlike many series, Portal 2 is many times better than Portal, which is pretty awesome. It is the best puzzle game ever made, according to most people on the internet, and anyone who has played it can't dissagree with taht opinion. Even the negative reviews say things like \"Why are you looking at the negative reviews on the best game on steam?\".\n\nIn Portal 2 we see the return of Chel, the character from Portal, who teams-up with Wheatley, a second AI robot, apart from GLaDOS, in order to help him take down GLaDOS.\nThe story is set after the events of Portal and also after the events of Half-Life 2, with many elements from Portal (1 and 2) to appear in Half-Life (1 and 2). \n\nSummarizing, this is yet another masterpiece from Valve, the best puzzle game ever made and the second best game ever made, following Half Life 2.\nIt is an amazing experience and i recomend it to anyone.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1452283791,"timestamp_updated":1452283791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20403926","author":{"steamid":"76561198110747396","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1167,"last_played":1513947982},"language":"spanish","review":"Portal 2, como su antecesor, se basa en superar puzles para ir avanzando en la historia.

Los dialogos y la historia son geniales y si prestas atencion puedes apreciar la gracia y 'genialidad' que tienen, yo me rei bastante jugando.\n\nEn cuanto a jugabilidad, es simple como ya he mencionado, aun asi tiene la profundidad suficiente como para incorporar nuevas mecanicas para los puzles durante la mayor parte de la historia principal. Si lo que te preocupa es si no sera demasiado dificil pues no lo es, se que hay gente a los que les cuesta percatarse de como completar desafios een algunos casos pero mi experiencia personal fue muy fluida; apenas me quede atascado durante todo el juego(aun asi si eres un poco lentito te puede costar algo).\n\nNo requiere mucha potencia para correr el juego en fps decentes y como carece de accion intensa(casi siempre) pues con que tu te sientas comodo es suficiente.De todas formas hay gran diferencia entre la principal opcion grafica(matizador) en alto o muy alto que en medio o bajo, asique a ser posible recomiendo por lo menos alto.\n\nEn definitiva por el precio merece la pena si te gustan algunas de las caracteristicas principales del juego, principalmente los dialogos son el punto fuerte en mi opinion.

I do recommend this game Steam. Everyone does, the amount of sickness that is in this game is 100%. You should deffinetly buy it and i suggest you play the singleplayer. My thoughts are that this is good for your brain, its a conusing, fun, and funny puzzle game, (like, really funny.) You might see a guy with a valve on his head but don't excpect any scary stuff in this game. Lol.\nI'd rate this game a solid 90% because its kinda confusing sometimes and maybe annoying, but its way better than the first one, trust me. It might be 15 dollars, but you can still get it if its on sale, Anyways, you get a portal gun which creates blue and orange portals, everyone might know that except beginers that haven't played Portal 2 or 1 Yet. Try the Co-Op mode and go crazy with your friends testing with ATLAS and P-BODY. Those are the 2 main Co-Op characters and they both get different portal guns, the portal of P-Body is Yellow-ish and red i believe, and Atlas has Blue and Cyan portals.\n\nAnyways, this game is amazing. Absolutely love it, my favorite character is Wheatley and GLaDOS and the turrets because they're so cute. I hope you guys agree with this review and it was really 'thanks and have fun'-ish. So yeah.

Portal 1 i 2 to po prostu kwintesencja idealnej gry. Pokazują, że żeby gra była świetna nie trzeba grafiki z kosmosu, milionów postaci czy otwartego świata o powierzchni pierdyliardów kilometrów kwadratowych. Ta gra, oraz jedynka otrzymuja ode mnie 11/10, ze znaczkiem jakości. :)","timestamp_created":1452157498,"timestamp_updated":1452157498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20369869","author":{"steamid":"76561198209742483","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1451724646},"language":"russian","review":"Прекрасная игра !\nПравда в коопе ГлаДос пытается вас посорить :D\nСюжет просто пушка\nИгра стоит своих денег!","timestamp_created":1452155685,"timestamp_updated":1452155685,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20369832","author":{"steamid":"76561198268246892","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":463,"last_played":1453556029},"language":"english","review":"Better Than COD","timestamp_created":1452155538,"timestamp_updated":1452155538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20369809","author":{"steamid":"76561198273800862","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":385,"last_played":1514995300},"language":"russian","review":"Develops logic","timestamp_created":1452155454,"timestamp_updated":1452155454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20369458","author":{"steamid":"76561198067481191","num_games_owned":491,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":523,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71,"last_played":1616231898},"language":"schinese","review":"决定先写一篇评测，因为这是一款非常优质的游戏，游戏本身实际上已无需我多加以赘述，开始每次训练完成后被拆解，我只是心中有点怪怪的，直到后来真实任务里，结束后直接被炸掉才真的感觉真尼玛反乌托邦。","timestamp_created":1452153415,"timestamp_updated":1452153415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20369414","author":{"steamid":"76561198146392099","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":62,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1560040355},"language":"english","review":"this i a puzzle game that tries too hard to be funy but is not funny at all","timestamp_created":1452153207,"timestamp_updated":1452153207,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.266258060932159424","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20369130","author":{"steamid":"76561198100872577","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1592,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":335,"last_played":1622487325},"language":"german","review":"Portal an sich ist ein Sehr Gutes Game , sowas sehe ich ehrlich gesagt nicht oft\n\n+Trotz seines Alters eine erstaunliche Grafik\n+Es macht immer wieder Spaß die einzelnen Räume zu lösen\n+GLaDOS beleidigungen als Kartoffel ;D\n+Die Gele bringen abwecheslung zum lösen\n+An sich ein sehr Gutes Spiel \n+Das Ende war sehr Spannend \n+Aperture Science Enrichment Center war auch relativ Lustig und erschreckend was aus dem Testgelände geworden ist\n\n\n-Wheatly(schreibt man den so?) ist sehr Nervig , auch wenn er zur Story beiträgt\n-Speichert keinen COOP Modus!\n-Pay2get für den COOP Modus\n-leider zu wenige Eastereggs D;

It corrects all the faults in Portal (namely brevity). Though I should really say \"fault\", singular, because that's the only one.
