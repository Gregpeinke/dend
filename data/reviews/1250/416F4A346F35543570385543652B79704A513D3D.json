However, this game has some serious cons. One being the fact that there is zero challenge to leveling your class, unless clicking your mouse while looking at an enemy is hard for you. \"Do damage with shotgun based weaponry\" is kind of a \"no shit\" when it comes to getting better shotgun specialist perks. Granted i dont know what else you could do for it, so maybe it isnt terrible. BUT the difference between easy and normal difficulties is absolutely ridiculous. Imagine going from easy on L4D2 to somewhere in between hard and expert. The combat is also somewhat boring. \"Oh look, a clot grabbed me\" \"hey another clot grabbed me\" \"hey i got hit\" \"hit again\" \"hit\" \"hit\" so on and so forth. Why does it seem to impossible to evade damage? And then we get to the barricades... *sighs*. This would have been an AMAZING concept... if there were any nearby windows, holes in walls, etc. to take care of the blundering corpses outside the goddamn door. The DLC is an absolute waste of time in my opinion. Sure, i could buy a unique skin, but why? I can simple play the guy nobody picks because everybody buys DLC characters. The weapons are also pretty meh altogether. Its shotgun or no-gun til about wave 9-10, then grab the fireball laungher and win automatically. Grenades are ok, but they could use a much bigger blast radius. Zed time (only to me, may be fun or cool to you) is entirely frustrating. It seems to proc ONLY when im in the middle of a reload, and lasts for about 1 second. Fun. All in all, if you enjoy zombies so badly you want them in your town, buy this game. If you're just looking for an actiony, decent leveling system kind of game, like i was, look elsewhere. This game gets 5/10 to me.","timestamp_created":1397969422,"timestamp_updated":1397969422,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500462114810943604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9876993","author":{"steamid":"76561198080244308","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2060,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":559,"last_played":1456982630},"language":"english","review":"It's a fun game if you have nothing to do.

Каждая следующая волна включает в себя увеличенное количество обычных и появление особых противников. После окончания волны игроки бегут к Торговцу (англ. Trader) в магазин, в котором осуществляется покупка различного вооружения и экипировки. Убивая врагов игроки получают деньги, а также накапливают опыт, переходя на следующие уровни перков. Чем больше игроков в команде, тем больше противников нападает на них и тем сильнее особые противники. Матч заканчивается тогда, когда игроки уничтожают босса игры, который идёт после всех волн.

Подкрепелено все это иногда выходящим бесплатным конктентом, таким как: карты (светлые и тёмные, открытые и закрытые, просторные и компактые, со сложной архетектурой и попроще), персонажи и оружие связанные с празднованием рождества/хеллоуина/лета (недавно добавленный режим с задачами есть пока что на двух картах). Платный же загружаемый контент предлагает в основном новых персонажей и оружие (по большей части являющиеся рескинами имеющихся в общем доступе). Музыка грамотно дополняет творящееся на экране мясо. Присутсвуют несколько классов персонажей, их прокачка. Покупка оружия и прочей экипировки происходит между волнами,а возможность заваривать и отваривать двери добавляет оборонительный элемент. Веселья так же добавляет включающееся при определённых обстоятельствах замедление времени, превращяя игру в симфонию насилия. Сюжет как таковой присутсвует, но подаётся в стиле Valve (надписи на стенах, описание карт и персонажей, диалоги местного босса), а так же на вики (при желании можно проникнуться сюжетом и на ней). Играть рекомендую с друзьями, ну или хотя бы с адекватными случайными игроками. Преесться может, но перед этим вы успеете провести несколько десятков часов полных веселья, командной работы и страха поражения в самую неподходящую минуту.
