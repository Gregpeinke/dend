[u]Graphics[/u] [i]9/10[/i] (I liked the first version of [i]Left 4 Dead[/i] too much. Although, I've been playing the '[i]big update[/i]' version of that game for hours. I prefer the first version for two important aspects. The first aspect is [u]the proposal of a narrative without text, without notes, without collectables files[/u]. Of course, the game has a complex and detailed story. The story of the game is proposed through images placed inside each campaign. The second aspect is about the creation of the game characters. The four characters are well made, from the lines of dialogue to the unfolding of the story in each campaign. The purpose: the four must stick together to survive. In fact, this game has a very raw story, with many details and a tragedy as a denouement of story to those four survivors, or rather three survivors.) \n\n2. [u]Playability[/u] [i]9/10[/i] (I can't describe enough about the playability. The controls are basic and easy to operate. You‘ll take items needed to survive. But yes, [i]you can find many bugs and glitches in the whole game[/i]. One more thing, [spoiler]something that has remained in the game is the chance to observe the feet of the characters[/spoiler]. A detail that was lost in the second game. Just as it has happened with some items and HUD of the game.)\n\n3. [u]Music and FX[/u] [i]7/10[/i] (The soundtrack is intended for only special enemies, hordes and the existence of the metal version for the Tank. Many times you‘ll hear ambient sounds. Or some parts with tension music, like the climax of game. In my opinion, in the game has worked more on the ambient music and enemy sounds than the soundtrack. Different from the second game, where prevails a more complex development of music.)\n\n4. [u]Duration[/u] [i]8/10[/i] (Originally, the game had four campaign. It can be said that it has a considerable duration, although the game seems short but with many details of the story and narration for the characters. Each image is an easter egg that is related to another game, or offers some details of the famous disease called the [i]green flu[/i]. [spoiler]You can speedrun and forget about the narration of the game, like it never mattered[/spoiler]. Subsequently, two more campaigns were added: [i]Crash Course[/i] and [i]The Sacrifice[/i]. Both campaigns are good. If you haven't played it, I won't say the possible outcome of the game. By the way, something that I liked a lot is the posters of the game. Each campaign has its own poster and design. For cooperative or solo mode with various difficulties. Versus and Survival maps have been added and one map has been highlighted: [i]The last stand[/i].)\n\n[h1]Recommendation:

пути.","timestamp_created":1607023374,"timestamp_updated":1613117719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81542748","author":{"steamid":"76561199083708740","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":340,"last_played":1608232784},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogue\n","timestamp_created":1607022424,"timestamp_updated":1607022424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81538159","author":{"steamid":"76561199015494001","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":393,"last_played":1657082038},"language":"english","review":"good
