They have a few other classes as well like the classic Medic class or Assault class which focuses on assault rifles. They add in very cheap \"4 Character Packs\" that allow a more variety characters to be seen. The enemies are essentially failed clones that went beserk in Great Britain, and each map has a little nifty history as to what happened to it.
