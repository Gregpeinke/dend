The game takes place entirely in a large advance lab facility called Aperture Labs. Half-Life fans might be familiar with that name as it was mentioned as Black Mesa's competitor in Half-Life 2: Episode 2. Confirming that the game is set in the same universe except focus on a different protagnogist. The main protagnogist is a woman named Chell who is a test subject for Aperture Labs. She awakens in her cell and is greeted by an AI named GlaDOS, who is like a female version of the Hal 9000. GlaDOS monitors Chell throughout the area she is confined in and soon is given instructions to participate in a series of tests in various obstacle courses with only a prototype \"portal gun\" as a tool to progress the tests. The portal gun is a highly advance device that shoots out two different rifts of portals: blue and orange. Anything going into the blue portal comes out of the orange portal and vice versa. As Chell goes on her trek of countless obstacles, she eventually discovers that there is something not right about the lab as the windows of the upper floors where the lab staff would normally be present are not there as the spectators and wonders if anyone is stationed at the lab than her. The game offers the same gameplay and layouts as the Half-Life games do except in this game you play as a heroine and the only weapon of choice is a portal gun which you have to use to your advancetage when dealing with various dangers. The puzzles are very well thought up and sometimes appear to be cryptic but there is a solution if you put your mind to it. Portal would go on to being an iconic game in the same level as Counter Strike & Half-Life. Anyone who loves those games will enjoy this game to the core.","timestamp_created":1463026538,"timestamp_updated":1463026538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22920933","author":{"steamid":"76561198027024990","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":471,"last_played":1460898521},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games ever concieved.

The game isn't just a puzzle game, though. It has an interesting storyline, too. [spoiler]The ending of the game makes you wonder, \"Well, what happens next?\"[/spoiler] I bought both Portal and Portal 2 in a bundle, expecting that I would want to play the second game too, and I was right! Lots of people play only Portal 2 and not Portal, but I would highly reccomend playing Portal before even opening Portal 2.

I've never been very good at puzzles, and Portal is a game solely centered on solving \"tests\" in the form of cognitive interaction with the environment. However, upon purchasing the game and playing it for about a half hour, I was hooked. The first time you play through the game the puzzles are confusing and hard figure out (at least in my case). But after playing through a handful of times, they get progressively easier and display simple yet illusive formulas. They aren't just simple \"place a cube here and continue to point B\" challenges, but levels that make you think for a second before making a move. Often times a full understanding of what's around you is required to progress forward, and that's valuable in a game like this. When you beat an especially hard puzzle, you get an amazing feeling of success that pushes you forward until you finally beat the game and can reflect on what you just completed... And then play it from start to finish another ten times.","timestamp_created":1462057925,"timestamp_updated":1462057925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22731202","author":{"steamid":"76561198264451824","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":351,"last_played":1489262557},"language":"english","review":"My Brain!!!","timestamp_created":1462052265,"timestamp_updated":1462052265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22725113","author":{"steamid":"76561198111845788","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1507802735},"language":"english","review":"This game is such a joyful, challenging, and downright fantastic game to play.
