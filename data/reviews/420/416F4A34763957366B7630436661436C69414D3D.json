The end to my favorite series of all time... It was a long, grueling journey, from Black Mesa, to CIty 17, to the now well known, White Forest. Everything has been leading up to this moment, will you be able to handle what comes next? What Gordon, Alyx, and Dog endure? \n\n   This game has a very rustic feel to it, traveling through rusty old cars, old mine shafts, and even the underground unkown, taking place in the middle of a big forest. It has a much different feeling than the rest of the series, a more open uncertain feel to it. A more cold, lonely feel... And knowing that this is it... For now... makes the atmosphere  the ever much colder.\n\nTLDR: Fun game. don't play unless you've played Hl1, Hl2, Hl2 E1, Then play Alyx

Se notan muchas ideas muy buenas, una trama igual de buena, y un final muy amargo, sabiendo que hace ya 17 años que estamos esperando la resolución de esta joya.\n\n Su historia, en los 2 casos, continúa inmediatamente después de lo visto en el final. Episode 1 una es la continuación directa de Half Life 2, mientras Episode 2 continúa con lo sucedido en Episode 1. Ambas tramas y personajes son igual de geniales y misteriosos como se vio en el juego base, pero hay que añadir un mérito: La trama se siente mejor llevada. Su duración es inferior al juego en sí, pero entre los 2 conseguiremos casi la misma cantidad de horas, todas muy disfrutables. Hay unos excelentes finales, en el caso de Episode 2, dejando ese final tan abierto, que todavía falta cerrar. \n\n En cuanto al apartado gráfico, a pesar de ser prácticamente el mismo juego y motor, se ven algunos cambios (Más especialmente en Episode 2). Cosas como la iluminación, líquidos, efectos y detalles de enemigos han sido levemente mejorados. Lo que más mejora son sus escenarios, puestas en escena donde se aprovecha aún más ante lo visto anteriormente; el motor Havok, dando momentos más espectaculares y de mayores dimensiones. \n\n Jugablemente, es casi idéntico a lo visto en el título base, con una gran diferencia y cosa que logra resaltar y destacar: La variedad de situaciones es inmensa, llena de nuevos vehículos, enemigos, escenarios y algunas pequeñas mecánicas que funcionan de maravilla y hacen que realmente se sienta un potencial creativo del estudio. Cada momento es muy distinto a otro, y a diferencia de Half Life 2, prácticamente tanto todas las escenas en interiores como exteriores se sienten únicas y diferentes entre sí. \n\n El elenco de voces sigue siendo el mismo, con el añadido de un par de personajes, nada mas. La música vuelve a ser poca y en momentos muy puntuales, pero como antes fue visto, es muy rítmica y le da un toque aún más especial a ese combate único. \n\n Sin duda, si has jugado Half Life 2, estas partes del título son indispensables. Son en todos los apartados igual de buenos que lo visto en el juego, pero con un mucho mayor amplitud de situaciones, mejoras a la hora de llevar la trama, y finalmente, un derroche de creatividad e ideas en todo momento. Espero que, algún día, podamos ver el final de esta excelente aventura.","timestamp_created":1637209561,"timestamp_updated":1637209561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102968741","author":{"steamid":"76561198182747731","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":259,"last_played":1638132505},"language":"english","review":"pog
