The story telling is done amazingly well, making it feel like most of things happening would happen even if you weren't there. Every weapon has a purpose and the right time to use it, while the shooting mechanics are basic, the part that makes them fun is making a strategy before going into a battle, you really have to think about what you're doing. Xen is garbage, it's boring and just acts as a way to add an hour or two onto the game.

I first tried it in high school, and found the experience frustrating, but recently I've been playing all the Half-Life games, and while I do enjoy the puzzles and physics in Half-Life 2 and its episodes, there's just something about this game that has me coming back every time. Even after playing the remake Black Mesa, I still think Half-Life 1 is one of the most unique experiences I've ever had with a video game. The only complaint I have about this game are the final chapters in the Xen dimension, but it seems everyone else has the same feeling, and anyway the rest of the game makes up for that flaw tremendously. If you have the time and the money, I would recommend getting this game because while it is over 2 decades old, a lot of the elements that were revolutionary in its time are still very enjoyable now.","timestamp_created":1604597392,"timestamp_updated":1604597392,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78774980","author":{"steamid":"76561198286772190","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1862,"playtime_last_two_weeks":15,"playtime_at_review":443,"last_played":1660516636},"language":"english","review":"i

Half Life was valve's debut title, but this is no rushed, poorly made, mess of a game, no, not at all. Half Life is one of the most revolutionary and fun shooters that I have played in a good while, and while it's graphics are dated, I still recommend it over Black Mesa because of the map layouts feeling better with more comfortable enemy AI. This game is so good in fact, that a twitch series parodying this game blew up and now my profile pic is from that series. While that series uses Half Life: Source, I do not recommend that version since HL: Source was clearly rushed with many bugs and glitches. Overall, it takes a while to get used to this game, but when you do, it feels like an adrenaline rush of an adventure. Now before I go, I do want to mention the combat in this game. The combat in Half Life feels great, but not everybody will like it. The combat in Half Life uses strategy- wait, wait stop, stop walking away.\nWhen I say strategic, I mean that the combat has you revisiting encounters to see what works and what doesn't, and while it sounds boring, it's what makes the game shine. The combat in Half Life is better than any other fps I've played with it's over powered, but low ammo weapons like the \"Tas Cannon\" and \"Gluon Gun\", to the more simple weapons, like a machine gun that also fires grenades, or an alien that you shove your hand into, which makes you able to shoot smaller aliens that are like little homing missiles. This game is crazy, and while people poop on the ending area, Xen, I got past it pretty quick, and while it was boring at times in Xen, the rest of the game was one of the best fps games I have ever played.\nI absolutely recommend this game, and it's only $10, but wait for the summer sale, so you can get the half life complete bundle for about $17 or less.
