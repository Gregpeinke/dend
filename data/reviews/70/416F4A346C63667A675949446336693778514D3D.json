It feels like you are experiencing something nobody else could comprehend. The lab environment is almost other worldly, full of strange rooms and surrounded by locations that fill you with questions.\nThe idea of scientists accidentally unleashing alien creatures into this world is a great concept. But I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed when it was revealed they already visited other worlds and even experimented on the creatures before the incident. Gotta admit it would be cooler if this was for the first time they opened this sort of portal, maybe accidentally, or they didn't realize it could be filled with dangerous creatures.\n\nThe alien designs and their combat styles are great. I must say they spooked me through the whole game. One of the reasons is a perfect sound design. It really does sound alien and very uncanny, especially houndeye. Even when I didn't consider them to be very dangerous, they still made me feel uneasy just because of the noises they made.\nI feel like this game did its best to be scary without trying too hard. Maybe the older graphics contributed, I do have to say I feel like the graphics just fit this game perfectly. I would say it's very ingenious design-wise, they knew what they could create and chose the best possible setting.\n\nGameplay-wise, there were some parts the game could get a bit challenging, but that's one of the best things about older games – not expecting the player to be a total dumbass. Also, clearing the challenges was satisfying, because the story was interesting and I just wanted to see more. The aliens got progressively stronger, constantly bringing new enemy types, and I really enjoyed that. I do have to say I preferred battling the aliens than H.E.C.U. though. They just got a bit boring after some time.\n\nThere's a wide variety of weapons and I think they were all well-balanced as I constantly swapped them around. Getting some alien weaponry was cool as well. The hive-hand was super fun to use, even thought it sometimes murdered some guard I needed to progress.\nI just really enjoyed this setting of you travelling through this giant mysterious facility, meeting random people from time to time, trying to figure out what's going on, resolving issues and progressively realizing you aren't just trying to save yourself from aliens, but from god knows what.\n\nEnding it off in the alien world was a great finish. Once again, a great atmosphere, well designed otherworld. Meeting the big boss aliens like Gonarch or the Nihilanth was exciting, even though the final boss wasn't as hard as I expected. But it was still a great and satisfying ending, and I wish it truly ended there. Supernatural ending for a supernatural game. I played it for the first time two weeks ago, I cannot stop thinking about it, and I would rather pretend it doesn't have a sequel, which I played after.\n\nAlso, bullsquid is the best creature. Why there's no official bullsquid merch is beyond me.\n","timestamp_created":1658075037,"timestamp_updated":1658075037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118964475","author":{"steamid":"76561198290909827","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":201,"playtime_at_review":1090,"last_played":1660499318},"language":"brazilian","review":"Best FPS ever. play","timestamp_created":1658074050,"timestamp_updated":1658074050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118962876","author":{"steamid":"76561198889969829","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":879,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":879,"last_played":1657141669},"language":"english","review":"Gordon we forgot snacks","timestamp_created":1658071858,"timestamp_updated":1658071858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118960573","author":{"steamid":"76561199021591398","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":118,"playtime_at_review":239,"last_played":1660403620},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1658068772,"timestamp_updated":1658068772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118959934","author":{"steamid":"76561198334732826","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":167,"playtime_at_review":1004,"last_played":1660502251},"language":"brazilian","review":"[h1] Envelheceu como vinho !

Você descobre como se faz as coisas e não precisa de alguma seta pra te dizer, você procura onde se esconder, você é Gordon Freeman. Quase tudo nesse jogo é perfeito, e em gráficos que hoje em dia não são a mesma coisa que eram em 98, mas ainda sim são confortaveis de se ver. Nada é perfeito, e esse jogo mostra isso em suas partes de plataforma, não que sejam ruins, já que da um charme pro jogo, mas essa é a parte que eu menos curto, mas não é nada impossível e até que em certas partes seja bem divertido conseguir fazer um pulo certo. \nUm outro ponto do jogo, que vale se destacar, é como ele sabe que o jogador vai sofrer em certas partes, e isso é um excelente acerto no desing dos levels do jogo. Existem partes em que você fica desesperado, achando que vai morrer ou perder todo o progresso depois de uma parte bem complicada, mas sempre vai ter alguma munição ou vida em momentos pós batalha que o jogo sabe que vai ser difícil.\n\nEnfim, joguem esta perola que até hoje é polida, seja pelos fã que fazem remakes do jogo, ou pelo tempo que fez de Half Life um clássico, mas que ainda continua tão jogavel e surpreendente como foi em 98.","timestamp_created":1658067941,"timestamp_updated":1658068469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118959568","author":{"steamid":"76561198195164329","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1657986301},"language":"brazilian","review":" Don't bother reading the reviews, Gordon is a highly trained professional","timestamp_created":1658067464,"timestamp_updated":1658067464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118959524","author":{"steamid":"76561199172470295","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":179,"last_played":1658082324},"language":"russian","review":"такое себе, пздц скучная","timestamp_created":1658067400,"timestamp_updated":1658067400,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.402476787567138672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118959378","author":{"steamid":"76561199187361224","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":124,"playtime_at_review":727,"last_played":1660519120},"language":"english","review":"the game is a classic and revolutionary","timestamp_created":1658067157,"timestamp_updated":1658067157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118959053","author":{"steamid":"76561198358530078","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":7372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":483,"playtime_at_review":5502,"last_played":1660556287},"language":"ukrainian","review":".","timestamp_created":1658066678,"timestamp_updated":1658066678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118958881","author":{"steamid":"76561199238491644","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":717,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1657953959},"language":"english","review":"What more needs to be said?

to preface my experience with this game. I was not alive before this game came out so it really means nothing to me. No nostalgia, no real knowledge of why this game is considered so great.\n\n             --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game does not hold your hand. I made a new game and immediately realized that the game has no identifiers for things you can interact on. So, you have to look up what your key binds are in the settings. This is just flat-out poor game design. You have just loaded a new IP from a new developer, so you’ll have no clue what the mechanics and nuisances of the game. They should have small pop-up notifiers to indicate that a button is pressable, a scientist is interactable, or that a door can simply be pushed open. Yes, this is a problem, you can’t tell whether a door wants you to push a button, push it open (by rubbing up against it), or wait for the sensors of automatic doors.\n\nDozens of times I sat wondering where I should be going, so I just end up wandering (and wasting resources). Sometimes this will lead to the proper areas, others not so much. Many times, there is a small hole in the wall, or a vent that needs to be bashed in order to proceed. These so called “hole in the walls” do not look obvious, in fact they look like a clipping texture or a dev didn’t get the wall moved down just enough. \n\nThings such as tunnels have a pretty serious problem with you getting stuck on them. Even when your not in tunnels you could run up against something the wrong way and be trapped on it. This has resulted in probably a dozen reloads.\n\nHit detection was pretty abysmal, which I guess I should expect from a game made in 1998. But there was one instance where I unloaded a M4 rifle (all 50 shots) into a soldier’s head from point blank range. Believe me when I tell you that the crosshair on the center of the head and it did nothing… 50 shots and none of them seemed to register. At that point, I knew to hop off the game for a little.\n\n             --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of my gripes out the way I must commend the games creativity. The Gauss and Gluon guns were really cool to use for the first time. In general the weapon diversity is pretty great considering the release date. The mob diversity would still put modern games like Destiny to shame. Each one has its own mannerisms that distinguish themselves from another.\n\nHonestly, it’s worth a try at $0.99 USD. Just keep in mind that some of the game doesn't hold up to modern standards. It doesn’t mean it’s a bad game, it just needs a little patience. \n\nSomething I don’t have…","timestamp_created":1658039569,"timestamp_updated":1658039923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118941323","author":{"steamid":"76561198221435852","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":715,"last_played":1658036672},"language":"english","review":"Great game, can be confusing but overall it's a fun game","timestamp_created":1658036838,"timestamp_updated":1658036838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118940730","author":{"steamid":"76561198197877646","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":110,"last_played":1607157955},"language":"english","review":"gorgon freshman","timestamp_created":1658035664,"timestamp_updated":1658035664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.743812203407287598","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118939879","author":{"steamid":"76561199136235250","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":64,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1658357416},"language":"english","review":"i am way too invested into the lore of this game","timestamp_created":1658033930,"timestamp_updated":1658033930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118935949","author":{"steamid":"76561199229979516","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1207,"last_played":1651834704},"language":"english","review":"I wanted so badly to like Half Life. I really, really did. But I just can't. And it has nothing to do with the graphics, the clunky aiming, or the ridiculously loud audio. It has to do with almost the entire last third of the game.\n\nThe first problem: Helicopters. Helicopters are just the f*#$ing worst. They have high health, and deal SO much damage. And when introduced, they, for whatever reason, are put in a spot with minimal cover. AFTER you fought your way past a horde of soldiers which you likely took a lot of damage from and lost a lot of ammo dealing with. Every time a helicopter shows up, it is either in a small area with little cover, or a large area with no cover. There is almost no in between. And the first two or three encounters, they do not give you the rocket launcher yet. They only weapon that could effectively damage them. (Side note: When introduced, they are introduced in an area where you have to swim in a large pool of water with a shark alien thing. An area that give you no ammo for the crossbow, the only weapon that can hurt them.)\n\nProblem two: Levels past the facility (as in the section just before you see the first 'copter) began to get cluttered with enemies, and the levels began to get... worse. It felt like Valve started to run dry on ideas after that point and just kinda slapped random levels together and dropped in enemies for the sake of not boring the player. They aren't repetitive but just annoying. The puzzles at times made no sense, enemies were in really annoying places, etc etc. \n\nProblem three: The entirety of Xen. There is not a SINGLE good thing I could say about Xen. But I can say plenty of bad;\nOne- They introduce a new enemy type out of nowhere. Flying aliens that shoot little balls at you. They aren't that bad alone, but for some reason, Valve decided to shove them in areas that are cramped and full of enemies. Or if they aren't cramped spots, they are in areas that have no way of dodging them. Like say a floating platform with no where to run to without losing all your health. They are often shoved in places full of vortigaunts, a high damage high range enemy. (There's a section that is a cramped, tiny hallway full of egg things that if shot, release heavy enemies too along with vortigaunts, which is a horrible spot and I hope whoever made it regrets it for eternity). Also they are floaty, and while their projectiles are slow, they often can't be focused on and will catch you off guard.\nTwo: The levels. The levels are just so stupidly laid out. They are frustrating, confusing, and overall unclear. A lot of areas are tightly compacted and full of enemies.\nThree: The gonarch fight. Nothing to really say here. Confusing and annoying. That's it.\nFour: The bossfight- The boss fight is horrible. There is no way around it. It is horrible. The boss (I am honestly not in the mood to look up the name) teleports you around to different areas. Areas with enemies that can waste your ammo. Killing it took me like an hour (granted, this is my fault. I didn't realise you had to destroy the crystals. I had just gotten off the anxiety trip that was the last like two hours so I wasn't thinking clearly) and once I did figure it out, it was still frustrating to deal with the summoning of the flying pricks constantly, and the never ending teleporting.

başlasam bilemedim. Benim için yeri çok ayrı bir oyun. Baktığın zaman düz Arcade FPS işte diyorsunuz ama çıktığı yılı baz alırsak nasıl bir devrim yaptığını daha iyi anlayabiliyorsunuz. Öncelikle incelemeyi çıktığı yılı baz alarak yapacağımı belirtiyim.\nSenaryo:\nSenaryo bakımında Half Life bir hikaye anlatmıyor. Buna hikayeden daha çok Lore denir. Oyunu tabi ki bir hikayesi var ancak, konuşmayan Ana karakterle bunu anlatması pek olası değil. Daha çok izlediği hikaye anlatma yolu çevresel hikaye anlatımı tekniğinidir. Yani efenim karakterin gözünden gördüğünüz olaylar ve Npclerin ağzından çıkan 1 - 2 kritik cümleyle anladığımız kadarı... E nedir bu hikaye peki? Black Mesa Araştırma tesisi çalışanı ana karakterimiz dilsiz optik M.I.T mezunu Doktor Gordon Freeman'ın, Xen ara boyutundan getirilmiş bir kristal üzerinde yapılan deneyde hayatta kalan çalışanlardan biri olarak Xen yartıklarının istilasında hayatta kalmasını konu alan yaklaşık 7 saatlik bir olay. Deneyde kullanılan makinanın kapasitesinin üstünde çalıştırılması sonucu Xen ara boyutundan dünyamıza portallar açılmaya başlar. Karakterimiz ise ilk başta yüzeye çıkıp kurtulmayı dener ancak tek ümitleri olan \"KAHRAMAN\" Amerikan ordusunun olayları örtbas etmek amaçlı tesiste çalışan bilim adamlarını avladığını görünce Lambda adı verilen bilim adamı takımına doğru yol alıp, Portalların kaynağı olan NIHILANT adlı varlığı yok etmeye doğru ilerleyen macerasını konu almaktadır. Detayını artık oynayarak görürsünüz(Ne kadar detay verdiği tartışılır.). Gerçi yıl olmuş 2022 hala oynamayan oyuncu varsa da ayıp etmiştir hani.","timestamp_created":1657923630,"timestamp_updated":1657923630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118872707","author":{"steamid":"76561199077396512","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1659554856},"language":"brazilian","review":"very nice","timestamp_created":1657921223,"timestamp_updated":1657921223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lcfzgYIDc6i7xQM="}
