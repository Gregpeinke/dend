At the time of writing (June 19, 2011) I read of rumors of DLC which should put more levels in it, so that should increase some replay value. The SDK was released too so people are making their own levels. But for now, nothing solid as of yet, but replay value has the potential to be increased.\n\nThe single player game is very good, incorporates the usual humor found in the first game while the puzzles itself are good. Valve expanded on the plot and it's very engaging and there's a lot of new stuff to learn about in the Portal universe. Puzzles are also great fun.\n\nCo-op is a nice addition and is really fun if you play with a friend, personally I haven't played online with other strangers so I can't comment what the online playerbase is like in this game. But if with a friend, then it can provide lots of fun.","timestamp_created":1308473653,"timestamp_updated":1308473653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"169372","author":{"steamid":"76561197964009814","num_games_owned":441,"num_reviews":339,"playtime_forever":602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":602,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Note: I am waiting for someone to play the coop levels who have NOT yet played them.  So it looks at this point that will be a future sale that I purchase for a freind.\n- This game is awesome.  Rather than compare it to Portal one, I'll treat as a standalone title.  \n\nI enjoyed this game a lot.  It is almost 100% platform jumping, critical thinking, and physics puzzles.  I've played almost all of the FPS puzzle games and this one ranks pretty high.  The humor is fairly good and occasionally laugh out loud.  The game makes you feel smart when you finally figure out a puzzle.\n\nThe single player only takes about 6 hours or less to beat.  Some of the levels are fun to replay, but the negitive side is that a majority of the travel type levels are boring and linear in problem solving.  A good chunk of the game is only able to be solved on one solution, compared to other FPS puzzle games that generally allow you to create your own method.\n\nI heavily recomend it if you liek this sort of thing.","timestamp_created":1308420887,"timestamp_updated":1308420887,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"189870","author":{"steamid":"76561197964660674","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1651,"last_played":1539705397},"language":"english","review":"Not buying this game is insane!!!","timestamp_created":1308410368,"timestamp_updated":1308410368,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4480495","author":{"steamid":"76561198037831770","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7832,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5010,"last_played":1589069683},"language":"english","review":"Best ending ever.","timestamp_created":1308386307,"timestamp_updated":1308386307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3932364","author":{"steamid":"76561198029296076","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":975,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":975,"last_played":1337065200},"language":"english","review":"O MELHOR JOGO DE SEMPRE!!!","timestamp_created":1308359430,"timestamp_updated":1308359430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"475063","author":{"steamid":"76561197970905823","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2684,"last_played":1625723693},"language":"english","review":"Better than the first.

The graphics are a bit dated but it still looks pretty good. And the puzzles aren't as difficult as the ones in the first Portal. Still enjoyed it very, very much. The story was cool (with a couple of vague backstories, if you look for them), the voice acting excellent (had a few laugh out loud moments) and the gameplay, well, it's pretty much the same as Portal 1, except that you now have gel that speeds things up and gel that bounces. Because of the many different elements you now have at your disposal there are definitely a few puzzles that require some deep thinking (hey, I didn't say all puzzles were easy :)). The co-op mode has its own puzzles that are just as fun. But it also has a downside; there are a few moments that require twitch shooting, meaning you have to react really fast if you want to make it to the end.

If you don't read further, read this:\nBuy it.  It's your kind of game.  You'll love it.\n\nMy biggest complaint - Throughout the entire game I felt the nagging dread that it might end too soon.  This is partly because I was too aware that I didn't want the euphoric gaming experience to end.  Also largely to blame, though, is the plot, which rests constantly on the brink of ultimate catastrophe.  And while it givies the sense that things could end at any time, it DOES make for an unusually exciting puzzle game.  I took around 11-12 hours to complete the single player game, but it felt like only 3.
