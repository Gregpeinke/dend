Ее можно спокойно пройти за один раз, попутно изучая локация, как в общем у меня и получилось... Ну очень короткая игра, я думаю она не стоит своих денег.

You are a test subject from Aperture, and your task given by Glad0s (you’ll love her), is to “survive” all the test phases, by which you are promised Cake, delicious cake.

It's a game that has almost redefined the FPS /puzzle as we now know it and has paved the way in innovation for many games since.\nBuilt off the backs and scraps of half-life and set within its universe, Portal follows the path of Chell as 'volunteer' test participant at Aperture Science Laboratories, who is guided through a series of test chambers by the omnipresent voice of GLaDOS, your host and possible captor.\nUsing the unique ASHPD you create interconnected, inter-dimensional portals, linked in order for you to past instantaneously from one point in space to another. The premise is difficult to describe but so simple and enjoyable you'll be flinging yourself around the cold, clinical chambers in no time.\nThe unique and unnerving tie between Chell and GlaDOS, the quirky puzzle-***-shooter nature of the game and the cute yet dangerous claustrophobia of the environment have made Portal an instant success and has allowed to companion cube to replace the hearts of many now hardened fans of the game.\nPortals success comes mainly from its unique perspective and gameplay, its quirky and lovable characters (if you don't feel a minor pang as a turret dies and confesses \"I don't blame you\" then you may very well be an android) and it's surprisingly immersive storyline - which at little over four hours of solid play time - claims a fuller and more thoughtful plot than most Hollywood movies.\nFans of Half-life with spot the odd minor nod and essentially Chell plays like a pacifistic Gordan Freeman, both being dropped into bizarre scenarios and plowing through their environments uncovering their own story as they go.\nCouple all this with the loving dedication of fans who have provided us with a myriad of mods to extend the Portal game life and the imminent arrival of Portal 2, you really need to get aboard this game as soon as soon as is humanly possible and get ready to fffling yourself...fling into space.","timestamp_created":1519241956,"timestamp_updated":1519241956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40283820","author":{"steamid":"76561198079450558","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":29,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29,"last_played":1411662571},"language":"english","review":"\"===[ :heart: Player Bases: ]===\n☐ Kids\n:ballot_box_with_check: Everyone\n☐ Casual players\n☐ Pro players\n☐ Hackers\n\n===[ ☼ Graphics: ]===\n☐ Potato\n☐ Really bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ OK\n:ballot_box_with_check: Good\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Masterpiece\n\n===[ $ Price/quality: ]===\n:ballot_box_with_check: Full price\n☐ Wait for sale\n☐ Average\n☐ Refund it if you can\n☐ Don't do it\n☐ Free\n\n===[ :biohazard: Requirments: ]===\n☐ 90' PC\n☐ Minimum\n:ballot_box_with_check: Medium\n:ballot_box_with_check: Fast\n☐ High end\n☐ NASA computer\n\n===[ ☼ Difficulty: ]===\n☐ You just need 2 arms\n:ballot_box_with_check: Ez\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Hard (first few hours)\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n\n===[ ۞ Game time/length ]===\n☐ Really short ( 0 - 2 hours)\n☐ Short ( 2 - 8 hours)\n☐ Few hours ( 8 - 12 hours)\n☐ Long ( 12+ hours)\n:ballot_box_with_check: Endless\n\n===[ ♬ Story] ===\n:ballot_box_with_check: It doesn't have\n☐ Still better than Twilight\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Fantastic\n\n===[ § Bugs ]===\n☐ Game itself is one big BUG\n☐ Bugs destroying the game\n☐ Lot of bugs\n:ballot_box_with_check: Few Bugs\n☐ You can use them for speedrun\n☐ Nothing\n\n===[ ✦ Others: ]===\nMultiplayer: YES\nSingleplayer: NO\n\nAll in all, well worth it.
