The gameplay stays mostly fresh throughout the game. The use of the skylines, chaining vigors, and the new array of weapons allows you to take out enemies in a vast amout of ways. And the storyline exceeds the feelz felt in the previous games. It is brain teasing and captivating until the very end.

Your mission is to find and retrieve this girl, who is locked in this giant monument house thing. Turns out, she can open and close space time rifts. Things start getting crazy. Going through the campaign is a joy, as well as finding and using all the weapons, powers, rifts, and collectibles. Graphics is a huge plus, as I was literally dumbstruck by the amount of detail that was put into this. Rain seeps through the cracks of the pier, light blooms off of appropriate objects, and the particles of the salt recharge machine are glorious. Gameplay is standard run and gun, but you can use vigors to pull enemies in, float them up, electrocute them, light them up, catch their own bullets and throw them back, and skyrails to move wherever they take you and strike from above. I completed this in 10 hours on normal. 1999 mode, which is extra hard, is added after completing the campaign. The sense of scale is amazing, but it can get you lost at times, even though the game is primarily linear. One more downside to this game is that the ending had me questioning if it was an actual ending, I felt that it took the Borderlands 2 ending route, (people who have played both should know what I mean). By all means, buy it, but I'd wait for a sale, as i feel anywhere from $30 to $10 is a good price for the amount of content alone.","timestamp_created":1388884601,"timestamp_updated":1388884601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8563991","author":{"steamid":"76561198049436351","num_games_owned":358,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":1249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1197,"last_played":1410455260},"language":"german","review":"Der Shooter mit der besten Geschichte überhaupt, der schönsten Spielwelt, die Musik ist einfach nur genial und zieht ein noch mehr in das Spiel hinein und die Kämpfe machen Spaß..... was will man mehr?\n\nNebenbei eines der wenigen Spiele, welche ich jemals vollständig durchgespielt habe.\nDaumen hoch für die Bioshock-Reihe!","timestamp_created":1388884366,"timestamp_updated":1492460587,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8563958","author":{"steamid":"76561198049269963","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1034,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1034,"last_played":1388883365},"language":"english","review":"Great game overall.

Mouse control is ridiculous, you can't set mouse acceleration properly, you can only enable or disable it. Mouse sensitivity is clucky, since you can't callibrate mouse acceleration. The result is terrible mouse control and horrible aiming. If this weren't enough, there are lots of action events you must use during combat, like a separate key for melee attack, so you have to constantly swap your fingers from WASD to other keyboard keys, like V, J, Z etc... it's as if developers were drunk when they designed this gameplay.","timestamp_created":1388875632,"timestamp_updated":1388875632,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464684009552001953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8561608","author":{"steamid":"76561198021524674","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":317,"last_played":1438543731},"language":"english","review":"itss a koll, yu get to killd the robots","timestamp_created":1388875154,"timestamp_updated":1388875154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8561472","author":{"steamid":"76561198073493919","num_games_owned":247,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1456573306},"language":"english","review":"Quite Possiblly the best game i have ever played, The storyline of the game is all around amazing, Booker dewitt is one\nof the best characters ever thought up of, Elizabeth is better then the whole game combine and i sinserly request you buy this game","timestamp_created":1388874448,"timestamp_updated":1388874448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8561407","author":{"steamid":"76561198052048631","num_games_owned":484,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":447,"last_played":1388923085},"language":"russian","review":"10/10\n\nСоставляющая пострелять выполнена хорошо,новые оружие не дает заскучать и энергетики вносят огромное разнообразие в геймплэй.\n\nТакже радуют персонажи и красивые декорации в виде города/завода/трущеб....\n\nНо самое главное тут сюжет,конец просто бесподобен.После прохождения ты задумываешься и вспоминаешь, что ты узнавал по мере прохождения и складываешь все в одну большую картинку.Как в пазле.И вот когда этот пазл собран ты осознаешь всё.Этот момент великолепен.","timestamp_created":1388874147,"timestamp_updated":1388874147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8560917","author":{"steamid":"76561198080796324","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":580,"last_played":1472494084},"language":"english","review":"I'm only 3 hours in and i am experiencing the exact same feeling i had playing the first one but in a different setting.
