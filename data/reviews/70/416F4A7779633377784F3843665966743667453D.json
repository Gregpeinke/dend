Terrible experience\nMy backstory with the game:\nI tried to play half-life several times, but never got far. I remember the further i went into the story before black mesa was like the first time you meet the big fella that you electrocute and that's it.\nWhen i got black mesa i finally gave the game another chance and got even further to chapter 13 approximately. Until i really got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and abandoned the game.\nWhat i feel\nRight now im stressed, this game is so bad i had a worse time playing it than other competitive games i've tried (and this is not even a comp game is a SP game!). Its overall a terrible experience for a few reasons i proceed to ennumerate:\nPros:\n-The Graphics are awesome compared to the original half-life.\n-the sounds are great.\n-The music is great.\n-Scenarios are great.\n-Allied AI its surprisingly effective unlike HL.\nAnd that's every good thing the game has.\nCons:\n-Extremely long, played 8 hours and got like 6 chapters to go (wouldnt be so bad if)\n-Enemy AI has the aim of a csgo pro player\n-Some areas are extremely difficult if you get tagged to low hp and hit a save point.\n-Tedious gameplay, terrible plataformer\n-Worst story ive seen so far in a game, a scientist that's involved in an experiment that fails and kills zombies, monsters and militars, that's it, nothing more deep than that, some CoD's have better story writing.\n-Every second is painful, every single one, every death is unfair and every section is hell\n-(Informative) I had to use noclip and godmode several times to avoid wrecking my pc, i used noclip when falling from a high plataform on chapter 10, not a big deal, but then had to use godmode in \"surface tensions\" bc i got stuck in a savepoint with 6 hp against 5 soldiers (clearly impossible, even if i killed the first and healed, 4 come after me) and the chopper on surface tensions as well. Also the game for some reason wouldnt start an event that would make a door open so i had to use noclip as well.\nFinally, my game crashed, and i gave up trying to play this boring ♥♥♥♥\n\nI just think this is an extremely overrated game, that for some reason was thought to be one of the best of all time, when its just one more generic shooter, maybe decent in 1998 but not more than that, 6 years later legends like GTA: San Andreas adn Cod4: Modern Warfare were released, being clearly better in every story aspect than this.\nSorry H-L lovers, someone had to say it, this game is ectremely\nOverrated\n\nScore: 4/10\n\nPd: This also applies to Half-Life (being overrated and unfun)","timestamp_created":1578623345,"timestamp_updated":1578623345,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.382165610790252686","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61601416","author":{"steamid":"76561198126021166","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":557,"last_played":1587488729},"language":"english","review":"Very Good Game, Game Design is Great, Valve knew exactly when to challenge the player and when to provide armor/heals.

из первых моих игр в которые я поиграл. Хоть первая часть и является классикой мне больше понравилась вторая. Лично мне кажется что 1 халва немного затянута и в некоторых моментах довольно скучна. Иногда я даже забрасывал игру и возвращался спустя недели, а то и месяцы. Но тем не менее я очень полюбил сюжет франшизы именно с этой части. Игра классная и я рекомендую её пройти.\n","timestamp_created":1578581663,"timestamp_updated":1629712701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61573186","author":{"steamid":"76561198280649481","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":535,"last_played":1590326118},"language":"spanish","review":":0","timestamp_created":1578578197,"timestamp_updated":1578578197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61570616","author":{"steamid":"76561198081785834","num_games_owned":659,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":1132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1655767287},"language":"latam","review":"Lo he jugado miles veces, tanto su campaña, como multijugador, admito que esa gran mayoría de veces lo descargue pirata, pero si encuentras en oferta el pack de half life no dudes en comprarlo, disminuyamos la pirateria.

I've personally beaten HL:Source since I had a problem with this one, but I plan to beat the original as well. The protagonist is amazing, he doesn't even have to talk to make you interested in his story. The story unfolds as you play, no cutscenes and very little dialogue compared to modern games. The ending feels very rewarding. \n","timestamp_created":1578569269,"timestamp_updated":1578569269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61565053","author":{"steamid":"76561198085615994","num_games_owned":1186,"num_reviews":92,"playtime_forever":648,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":648,"last_played":1576889927},"language":"italian","review":"Mi sono innamorato di questo gioco provandolo su un vecchio pc con windows xp facendomi prendere dalla nostalgia. Comprato su steam e provato sul mio pc con windows 10 funziona senza problemi. Seguire il corso del racconto mi è piaciuto molto e ritrovarmi già dall'inizio in laboratori e in un'atmosfera molto film di fantascienza anni 90 è stato il colpo di grazia per me. Ho giocato l'intero gioco praticamente in due giorni o poco meno e sicuramente si può portare a termine in meno tempo, siccome ho trovato difficoltà con alcuni livelli in cui sono rimasto bloccato anche per mezz'ora.. e qui arriviamo alla difficoltà. Sicuramente è un gioco vecchio stampo e la sfida che il gioco ci pone è in alcuni punti ardua. Ci sono molti \"puzzle\" e a dire la verità sono anche ben elaborati e richiedono inventiva. I nemici sono ben caratterizzati e l'ia è furba. Diciamo che da questo gioco mi aspettavo molto meno, ma in realtà, anche in confronto alla sua età, regge il confronto ancora oggi (non tenendo conto della grafica).","timestamp_created":1578564218,"timestamp_updated":1578564218,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyc3wxO8CfYft6gE="}
