This game really makes you realize how much Jason Brody, Booker Dewitt, and every other major fps protagonist since owe the man with the crowbar, Gordon Freeman.

Grenades fly a bit better, dead bodies can make strange shapes on the floor, that is it.\n* A bit better graphics. Lighting in Source is very good.\n\nWhat makes me to recommend original HL over it? \nBugs, of course. These bugs do not make this game unplayable, but experience is much worse.

Below that is the ragdoll deaths if you're a scientist-killing lunatic like me :). But on it's own, it barley offers any new content. If you like the HD models from the HL:S, then the best thing to do is to turn on HD models in the video settings of the Original 98' game, because it seems like it's literally the same thing.

The story was great, the action was interesting and challenging (especially since I played on Hard mode) and the changing environments help out immerse yourself in the world. I like the concept of the suit being the reason Gordon survives all the shit that's thrown at him and I really like the idea of an alien invasion. I loved the buddy system of having a scientist or police guard follow you through the levels, even though I always got mine killed on accident.\n\nThough, I do have some gripes with the game. (Again, this might be because I played HL:S, not the original. Maybe the original has these issues fixed, which would be counterintuitive, but who knows. I have been told that the original with a certain mod makes it a whole lot better, so that might just be what I need to do.)\n\nFor one, I counted three times where I managed to softlock myself. I don't remember exactly where, but it happened. As a first-time player, this was a bit worrying. I shouldn't have been able to softlock myself to the point where I had to enable noclip just to get back to where I was, and the first time this happened it was because I didn't know where to go and took a path where I thought would take me further in the level when it simply... didn't. There were also a lot of bugs here and there that kind of ruined the immersion. Installing the HD pack simply deleted all the sounds for your primary weapon for some reason? A silenced shotgun completely took me out of the game. Also, the autosave feature, while nice, really threw me for a loop if i ended up being in a loading zone with no health. In most cases, the enemies would kill me instantly. There was even a point where I tried to rush through a level only to die right past a loading zone, meaning that I had enemies on both sides of me while I had 10hp left. Keep in mind that this was in the beginning chapters, where I shouldn't be struggling so much. I was essentially forced to quicksave on my own every time I could catch a breath so I don't get stuck like that. Also, the music wasn't good, but that's more of a personal thing.\n\nNevertheless, considering how old this game (at least the original) and how monumental it is for Valve and video games in general, especially with Source, I can see why this game was considered amazing. It's not my cup of tea, but I'll attribute the issues I have with it more to the game's age and port, especially considering that I think HL:S was simply a re-skin of the original. I'm going to keep playing through the HL franchise and see how much improves with each installment. After all, I got the Half Life pack, so I might as well play everything :) . I heard HL2 is miles better so we'll see!","timestamp_created":1595016451,"timestamp_updated":1595016650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72854298","author":{"steamid":"76561198321146804","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":314,"last_played":1635627307},"language":"english","review":"Broken, barely remastered, you're better off using it as a \"DLC\" for GMOD, so just play the Original version but if you want to actually play a remastered version of Half-Life then get Black mesa which even has dynamic lighting and also yes it does run on Source engine\n(if you use a Intel GPU then change the dxlevel to 95 because Shader model 3 isn't supported on Intel GPUs)\nbut it's atleast more playable than Hunt down the freeman","timestamp_created":1595010674,"timestamp_updated":1595010766,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72830453","author":{"steamid":"76561198868776736","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1597330359},"language":"russian","review":"БАГИ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nТЕКСТУР\n\n\n\n\n\n\nОТРАЖЕНИЕ\n\n\nГОВНО","timestamp_created":1594975740,"timestamp_updated":1594975740,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72828720","author":{"steamid":"76561198297723745","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":907,"last_played":1576693109},"language":"english","review":"Half-life is actually a pretty good game.
