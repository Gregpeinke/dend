Dnes jsem se rozhodl celou tuto recenzi přepsat a hlavně vyjádřit názor na tento v opravdu velkých uvozovkách \"remaster\". Remastery by měly mít dvě základní vlastnosti. Zaprvé by měly vylepšit a opravit základní dílo a zadruhé by neměly přidat do díla nové, do té doby neexistující, problémy. A ani jedno tato hra, ve své době prezentovaná jako remaster, nedělá. Grafika je mimo několika detailů identická, akorát někdy díky přidaným odleskům vypadá hůř, a nových chyb je tu požehnaně od levitujících vědátorů až po epileptické obrazce v některých lokacích.

Unfortunately, what it attempts to achieve falls flat in execution.\n\nI won’t lie though, there are some positives for owning and playing Half-Life Source\n+ Better light reflections from weapons\n+ Better water, in texture and transparency \n+ Some areas have better lighting\n+ Ragdolls\n+ Prop physics\n+ More console commands to play around with\n+ And the ability to use it’s assets in Garry’s mod, including Maps, Weapons, NPCs, and Props\n\nBut there are many negatives\n- This is only a Half-Life 1 port, so no official Opposing Force or Blue Shift campaign is available\n- You can’t play any Half-Life 1 mods with HL Source unless they were ported over, which many aren't.\n- Some areas have worse lighting than before\n- Some reflections look bad and out of the artstyle\n- Newer updates have broken lighting in a few areas\n- Longer loading times (about 10 times longer than normal Half-Life believe it or not)\n- Quick saving might freeze the game for 5 to 20 seconds\n- It’s buggy (Final boss kept crashing the game and had to noclip to complete it)\n- Death Match has it’s own EXE file\n- And many of the advantages Valve could have used with Source aren't used and feels more like a copy and paste job.\n\nOverall, HL:S is a mediocre remaster of the original Half-Life, adding a few neat extra lighting and ragdoll elements at the cost of stability, longer loading times, and not using the lighting elements well all the time. And the amount of mods available are very lacking compared to it’s younger brother.\n\nStick to the original Half-Life. I would only recommend getting HL:S if you're buying it from the “Valve Complete Pack” Bundle and use it’s assets for Gmod. If you want a modern remake of Half-Life, then Black Mesa is something you might wanna look into. Black Mesa actually uses tons of the advantages of using Source, as well as changing level geometry for a whole new experience.
