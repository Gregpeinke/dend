I had to replay the entire 4rth chapter up to this point constantly watching her to make sure everything worked out. it did the second time and luckily the 4rth chapter was a lot of fun to speed run the second time through. Chapter 5 is also fun until...\nSPOILERS... (just btw)\nBOSS FIGHT: The final boss is a stalker, thats fine except the mechanics of the fight work agansit the fight making it harder then is should be. The gun you use during this fight is the RPG which homes in directly on where you mouse is pointed, since the stalker is constantly shooting you only giving you small intervals to shoot and aim at it. However when you go back into cover the rocket moves right towards your cover killing or seriously injuring you, this happened to me 5 times. Also while i didnt have any trouble with this the window where you can shoot and aim at the stalker is really small which may give you problems.\nSPOILERS +RANT OVER\nOverall slow start band end boss
