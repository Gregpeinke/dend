It's so fondly remember for the best parts of it, and for good reason. Unforeseen Consequences, We got hostiles, and Surface Tension are some of the best levels. Each provide their own fun challenges and lighten up on you when need be. On a Rail is debatable in its quality, the puzzle is frustrating, but once you pass it, it's more fun. Blast pit also provides a fun challenge, but the gimmick runs dry fast sometimes. Now for the infamous Xen levels, the really, really bad ones. At that point? Either find cheats and play it like that or delete the game and get Black Mesa or something.

Most of these enemies i really like, such as the Soldiers.\n\nThe Soldiers are really fun enemies to fight, they can run about, shoot you with Rifles and Shotguns, Throw grenades, Use Turrets, and come down from Helis!, alone they are quite weak, but working together while focusing on you can make them a tough threat!\n\nThere's also another enemy I really like in this game!\n\nThe bullsquid is a Xen creature that can shoot out projectiles and charge at the player, but what i really like is the way you can deal with them. Bullsquids have a odd mechanic that allows them to smell things like meat, they can also be distracted by it and go eat it, which allows the player a chance to go through them. I also like how they will try to kill other xen creatures such as the annoying headcrabs ( Which i'll get to later ) which shows how even though they are enemies in a video game, they will still hunt xen creatures like some kind of predator.\n\n\nBut there's one enemy in this game i got a few problems with,\n\nThe headcrab is one of the most annoying enemies i've fought in a video game, they will leap at the player and take a decent chunk of your health, and though they can be killed and avoided easily, the level design is what makes them such a problem. They commonly spawn in dark vents that you can't see in, and sometimes they'll be waiting behind some boxes, Hell they can even be teleported in sometimes at random, which is real annoying.\n\nWeapons: There's a good amount of weapons in the game, that all can be useful. I usually reserve my pistol for headcrabs and houndeyes, and use my shotgun on the vorts, there's still plenty more weapons, such as the many kinds of explosives, and alien weapons that can be good to use against the enemies.\n\nLevels: There's plenty of levels in the game, which are mostly good, except for some like On a Rail, which is quite annoying for someone who's just played, but going through it again isn't that bad. The levels all have a nice layout for players to go through, with many tight and closed up areas, with boxes or areas to get behind, along with some nice enemy placement.\n\nHowever, the level design goes to shit as soon as you enter the final levels,\n\nF U C K I N G X E N : Xen is by far the worst part of this game, the levels are large, and take advantage of one of the worst parts of half life..Platforming, it just doesn't work, not only do you easily take fall damage, but your character is really slippery, which is mostly fine since you'll mainly be in combat in the game, but when platforming becomes a main focus!?\n\nFUCK\n\nOne thing i also dislike slightly is how they messed up some of the enemies here\n\nThe vortigaunts: These guys are a pretty simple enemy, they charge up a high damage attack that you can't be avoided in a open area, but the player can avoid it by going behind cover quickly, which is good to do normally, since most of the levels are in areas with lots of cover, but in xen most of the area's are open, so you'll just get hit by the vorts bolt.\n\nXen also has something else aswell,\n\n\nBOSS FIGHTS: There is a \" boss \" more early in the game but i consider it more of a level that you have to go through rather then a boss.\nBut anyways, now onto the ACTUAL bosses, which i consider really annoying and bad\n\nStarting with:\n\nThe Gonarch: This bitch is one of the worst bosses in gaming i have ever faced, and i'll tell you why.\n\nThe first stage is the most fine, it tells you what it can do, and you can avoid it's attacks with general ease\n\nThe second stage though is pretty annoying, since now there's a large hole in the way that you can easily fall into, and if you manage to get on a ledge there, A PISS SUCKLING HEAD FUCKER will jump right out and get eat a nice chunk of your health. Another thing i dislike about the gonarch, is that i don't feel like i'm ever doing damage to it, it feels like i'm trying to shoot a moving wall  that spawns mini headcrabs and occasionally hits me aswell as shoot jizz to attack\n\n\nThen there's the third stage, which is almost broken.\nThe gonarch is supposed to jump down into a arena like spot, but instead that ballsacked bitch just stood there waiting for me to jump down, and since it was in a cave it could shoot its cum at me (Which btw, does a fuckton of damage) and hit me to K.O me. Due to this i had to load over and over again, until it finally got down.\n\n\nNow onto the final boss, which is not as bad:\n\nThe nihilanth: A giant fetus with a metal butt plug up it's ass. Fitting boss i'd say for the end of the game, The nihilanth is a boss that is...OK\n\nFirst you have to shoot some crystals so it doesn't heal(Which a new player probably wouldn't know, and just assume the crystals to be scenery) and then you have to shoot it a bunch until it's head opens up\n\nThe nihilanth has two attacks, the first being an attack in which it shoots a bunch of purple projectiles, \n\nAnd then there's the second, which i think can be annoying if your new.\nThe nihilanth can shoot a giant green portal, which teleport's you to an area, that you have to get out, this area includes some enemies aswell as ammo for your weapons. So, what's the big deal?\nThe problem here is that if you don't know you can go behind the large pillars to stop the green portal, then GOD FUCKING HELL it's sucks ass to go back to the same area's again and again, for fucks sake i want to fight the boss!\n\nBut playing through this again would likely be more easier, so it's not that bad,\n\nThen there's the part where it's head opens up and you gotta shoot it, the problem here is that now you need to go on these floating pads, which can't decide if they want to shoot you up to his face, or up the nihilanths fetus ass. which is the one thing that i believe ruins the fun of the fight, but aside from all that, i think it's an okay boss ( Hell of a lot better then the moaning headcrab milf )\n\n\nIn general i think this game is really good, even though the last few levels kinda suck, and The gonarch is satans ballsack visuallised it's  a real good game!","timestamp_created":1615596848,"timestamp_updated":1615597632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88328034","author":{"steamid":"76561199013817466","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":722,"last_played":1643414290},"language":"english","review":"g","timestamp_created":1615590660,"timestamp_updated":1615590660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88327814","author":{"steamid":"76561198337666752","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":8272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1868,"last_played":1655073499},"language":"english","review":"how

Una experiencia retadora tanto para habilidad de apuntado como para descifrar los puzzles que plantea el juego, mucho prueba y error, disfruta del recorrido sin apurarte a completarlo, que la recompensa del final lo vale.\n\n9.5/10\n","timestamp_created":1615512714,"timestamp_updated":1615512714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88272188","author":{"steamid":"76561198309084385","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":637,"last_played":1638314017},"language":"english","review":"MY GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!","timestamp_created":1615509373,"timestamp_updated":1615509373,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88268967","author":{"steamid":"76561198354756590","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":759,"last_played":1615500444},"language":"polish","review":"Drży ze strachu czerń kozacza\nDęba stają osełedce -\nKniaź Jarema się nawraca\nPrawosławnej wiary nie chce\nZłe przeczucie piersi dusi;\nChłopom -

This automated train is provided for the security and convenience of employees of the Black Mesa Research Facility personnel. Please feel free to move about the train or simply sit back and enjoy the ride.\n\nThe time is 8:47 AM. Current topside temperature is 93 degrees, with an estimated high of one hundred and five. The Black Mesa compound is maintained at a pleasant 68 degrees at all times.\n\nThis train is inbound from Level 3 dormitories to Sector C Test Labs and Control Facilities. If your intended destination is a high-security area beyond Sector C, you will need to return to the Central Transit hub in Area 9 and board a high-security train. If you have not yet submitted your identity to the retinal clearance system, you must report to Black Mesa Personnel for processing before you will be permitted into the high-security branch of the transit system.\n\nDue to the high toxicity of material routinely handled in the Black Mesa compound, no smoking, eating, or drinking are permitted within the Black Mesa Transit System.\n\nPlease keep your limbs inside the train at all times. Do not attempt to open the doors until the train has come to a complete halt at the station platform. In the event of an emergency, passengers are to remain seated and await further instruction. If it is necessary to exit the train, disabled personnel should be evacuated first. Please stay away from electrified rails, and proceed to an emergency station until assistance arrives.\n\nA reminder that the Black Mesa Hazard Course decathlon will commence this evening at nineteen hundred hours in the Level 3 facility. The semifinals for high-security personnel will be announced in a separate Secure Access transmission. Remember, more lives than your own may depend on your fitness.\n\nDo you have a friend or relative who would make a valuable addition to the Black Mesa team? Immediate openings are available in the areas of Materials Handling and Low-Clearance Security. Please contact Black Mesa Personnel for further information. If you have an associate with a background in the areas of theoretical physics, biotechnology or other high-tech disciplines, please contact our Civilian Recruitment Division. The Black Mesa Research Facility is an Equal Opportunity Employer.\n\nA reminder to all Black Mesa personnel: Regular radiation and biohazard screenings are a requirement of continued employment in the Black Mesa Research Facility. Missing a scheduled urinalysis or radiation check-up is grounds for immediate termination. If you feel you have been exposed to radioactive or other hazardous materials in the course of your duties, contact your Radiation Safety Officer immediately. Work safe, work smart.
