Not really \"dislike\" but \"somewhat annoying\"\n- Times when the merchants are wandering around randomly. Finding the same merchant again is a pain.\n- Horses steer like they're brain-damaged. Sometimes will veeer off to one side and suddenly you can't steer anymore.\n- Horses again. You can't ride down a hill, but you can get off the horse and call it down the hill. WTF?\n- Some of the quests are incredibly obtuse, relying more on luck and happenstance than on deliberate planning.\n\nMajor bugs:\n- The crashing. Especially after saving a few times, it'll just crash on my system. No response from either Steam or the \"official\" game support.\n- The dialog. Only looking at some videos did I realize there was supposed to be dialog! Totally not working on my system. I only get the text, but everyone is silent.\n\n\nDefinitely worth the buy. Now if I could just convince Steam to let me have the Strategy Guide I paid for. It's DLC, but it refuses to install.

I didn't keep up with the hype and the marketing for this game, and it was because of a YouTuber called ProJared and his review of this game that I bought it, mainly to see if it was as bad as he said it was. And - surprise, surprise - he was right.\n\nTwo Worlds, according to ProJared's Review (be prepared to see ProJared's name come up a LOT in this \"review\"), was going to put another game - The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion - to shame. Needless to say, it didn't even come close to matching Oblivion in anything. And I'm going to prove it.\n\nThe game starts off with the Main Character and his twin sister, Kira, riding through the rain. Kira is injured, and falls off the horse. Here is where one of the many problems of Two Worlds starts to show. First off, the voice acting. It's God-awful. Every single voice actor - well, with an exception or two - is bad. Every line of speech is forced, no emotion is in the dialogue and even worse, the text in the game looks like it was written by someone trying to emulate Shakespeare.\n\nThe story for this game is simple. As the Main Character goes to look for a shelter that he and Kira can stay in for the night to keep out of the rain, Kira gets kidnapped. About six months later, in the first village you're in (I don't remember what it was called, just more proof of how bad this game is) you recieve a letter telling you that your sister is alive. After reading the letter, the village elder gives you your first quest, the traditional cliché quest at the beginning of most RPGs out there: clear a cave of monsters. You do that, you come out of the cave which is really a temple, and when you're through with that task, some guy from the first village tells you that some \"hard warriors\" have come looking for you. After that, you find the man who kidnapped your sister - Gandohar - and he tells you to go and meet his master Reist in the Goat's Cave. You meet Reist, and he tells you to go and talk to Gandohar. Refresh my memory, why did I need to go in there again? Anyways, speaking with Gandohar reveals that he \"claims\" that he wants to help Kira, and to do that, he needs you to go and collect four treasures representing the four elements: Fire, Wind, Water, and Earth. There's also a fifth piece that binds them together just like that ring from Lord of the Rings. And apparently, only the Main Character and Kira can touch the key and nobody else can, similar to the Vampire Killer whip from the Castlevania franchise. That's really all I can say about the story, because I pretty much quit playing after that.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is somewhat similar to Oblivion, but they somehow managed to screw that up. When you're fighting anything in this game, and I mean anything, it all basically amounts to a button masher swinging wildly at everything around you, and I mean everything. There's no surefire way to be sure that you're hitting something other than the blood that shoots out of enemies, and the punch sound that accompanies trying to hit something with a steel blade that clearly is there to cause bruises rather than draw blood, but whatever.\n\nThe graphics here are a mixed bag. The character models and everything look awful, to the point where they would barely pass as PS2 graphics, and they're animated so poorly. The lip-synching is also terrible, which makes Godzilla movies look masterful. However, and this is what I mean by the graphics being a mixed bag, is that not everything looks terrible, the enviroments are kind of nice. I can admit that.\n\nThe music sounds like your typical midieval sword & sorcery-style RPG, with light tunes when exploring, heavy tunes when in danger, things like that.\n\nAll in all, I have to say that it's a damn shame this game didn't quite live up to the hype, because it shows great potential that could have easily put The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion to shame, but they let their ambitions and a clichéd story along with awful gameplay get in the way of it all. Also, the voice acting was really disappointing as well. Still, hopefully they learned their lesson with this game and made Two Worlds II MUCH better, but I'll be going into it expecting the worst.","timestamp_created":1461258514,"timestamp_updated":1461258514,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529022812843322754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22519706","author":{"steamid":"76561198164154931","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1041,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1041,"last_played":1461074942},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая РПГ.

You can stack spells so they will get better but there is only one mage that sells spells( I heard there are 2 or 3 but I didn't found them). \n\n- Kinda stiff animations and unrealistic but I JUST LOVED when I  1-hit guys with the crit animation, that thing is timeless. It's also kinda hard at the beggining. Try to use two handed weapons since you can get all 4 hits with that, with one handed you can get just 2/4 hits(unless you put our enemy in a corner)\n\nATMOSPHERE & STORY\n\n-Extremely bad voice acting, it's not even the kind you can make fun off. Some of the main storyline characters sound ok tho.\n\n- Little to no atmosphere,  combat soundtracks play in the middle of the town??? and sometimes no music at all...people look braindead.

So gings mir auch. Mein Gedanke beim Kauf war in etwa, dass man für den Preis nicht so viel falsch machen kann. \n\nLeider fällt es mir schwer, außer dem Preis irgendetwas positives zu finden. Ich versuchs trotzdem mal:\nAm Anfang des Spiels gibt es eine durchaus vernünftige Questdichte und die Belohnungen sind auch noch irgendwie sinnvoll.. Ganz cool fand ich die Tatsache, dass man Waffen und Rüstungen stapeln und somit verstärken kann.\nAn dieser Stelle bin ich mit dem positiven Teil fertig.\n\nKommen wir zum Negativen. \nDieses Spiel besitzt absolut keinen roten Faden. Man wird in eine \"Story\" reingeschmissen, die in einem Satz erklärt ist. \nDie Quest sind zum größten Teil wahl- und zusammenhangslos, was durch einfach völlig verwirrende Questkarte unterstützt wird. Dazu gibt es hier massenhaft Bugs. Dazu kommt, dass es ab einem gewissen Punkt quasi keine Quests mehr gibt. Man kann 100 Jahre über die Karte rennen, 3000 Wölfe und anderes Getier mit einem Schlag töten, 5000 Alchemiezutaten einsammeln und dabei nicht einen Quest finden. Einige Quest brechen random ab, weil die beteiligten Personen von Orks gekillt wurden, die die Stadt überrannt haben... Dazu fällt mir irgendwie nix ein.\nWeiter gehts mit dem Skillsystem. Mit einem Wort: Einfallslos. Und, bemerkenswert: Es gibt nen aktiven \"Skill\" gegen berittene Gegner. Und ich hab nach 37h Spiel noch keinen berittenen Gegner gefunden. Na gut, vielleicht liegts auch an mir... \nDann kann man sich noch bei verschiedenen Gilden beliebt machen. Auch hier suchen wir irgendein System vergebens.

А теперь к отзыву:\nМне сложно назвать эту игру хорошей или плохой. Вообще, если бы здесь была нейтральная кнопка, как в \"Кинопоиске\", я бы такой же отзыв и оставил.\nПлюсы:\n- Атмосфера. В ней хорошо читаются нотки Обливиона, с его красивыми, светлыми и приятными пейзажами, но в то же время, в ней есть много своего, необычного, чего в других играх я пока не встречал.\n- Разнообразие и разносторонность. Выбирать есть из чего, при этом, этого не настолько много, чтобы я мог потеряться.\n- Саундтрек. Приятный.\nМинусы:\n- Сюжет. Возможно, я его плохо изучил, но для меня он показался скучным и непонятным.\n- Баланс. Мне сложно назвать сбалансированной игру, в которой всего за пару часов можно стать неубиваемым мужиком, сносящим всё на своём пути. Конечно, Morrowind подобным тоже страдает, но там есть, куда идти дальше.\n- Анимация. Возможно, это моя придирка, но как-то я чувствую себя неловко, когда все персонажи, кроме главного героя, умеют говорить, не открывая рта. \nНесмотря на минусы, игра вышла вполне достойной, так что я рекомендую её тем, кто устал от классики, вроде The Elder Scrolls или Готики.","timestamp_created":1458832702,"timestamp_updated":1458832702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47032475471496582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22018944","author":{"steamid":"76561198120271063","num_games_owned":617,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":1946,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1772,"last_played":1460048462},"language":"english","review":"The first hour of playing this game leaves you with a poor sensation of what it is.

Die Antwort lautet ja und nein. \n\nTwo Worlds entführt, oder besser versucht, den Spieler in eine offene Fantasywelt. Sobald man nach dem lieblosen Intro auf diese Welt losgelassen wird und zum ersten Mal die riesige Karte sieht, denkt man sich: Wow was man da alles machen kann. So ging ich also ins erste Dorf, holte mir genretypisch erste Aufträge ab und bereiste die Welt. Am Anfang wurde ich von so einigen Gegnern ins Jenseits befördert, der Frust hielt sich allerdings in Grenzen, auf Grund der Spielmechanik der Wiederbelebungspunkte. \nDie Hauptstory ließ ich erstmal außer Acht, was sich als sehr gut Entscheidung heraus stellte. So hangelte ich mich von einer Quest zur nächsten. Was mir Anfangs noch Spaß machte, wurde bald zur Pflichtübung in der Hoffnung, die Quests würden irgendwann besser. Dem war leider nicht so. Keine Spannung oder Ähnliches. Das ganze ging dann sogar soweit, dass ich unbewusst eine ganze Questreihe löste ohne dafür je einen Auftrag bekommen zu haben. Das merkte ich allerdings erst als ich mich der Hauptstory zwecks Alternative wieder zu wandte. \nDoch auch diese war nicht der Rede wert, dabei bin ich dünne Hauptstorys gewohnt. Am Ende muss ich sagen, bin ich enttäuscht von Two Worlds, denn es geht auch anders und es ist meiner Meinung nach auch nicht so schwer. \n\nNehmen wir die Welt. Sie ist so riesig, aber nur die Hälfte davon ist wirklich irgendwie genutzt. Die andere Hälfte ist nur da um Gegenstände für die Hauptquest zu besorgen. Halt es gibt eine Stadt, in der man auch was erledigen kann, aber nur bis zum nehmen des Hauptquestgegenstandes. Danach hat man auch nur noch die Feinde zum niederkloppen. \nLeider schaffen es alle Quests nicht, die Welt einen erkunden zu lassen und auch so besteht kein Bedarf daran. Zu schnell hat man genug Geld, Ausrüstungsgegenstände und Erfahrungspunkte. Mir ist tatsächlichen Schleierhaft, wie man das so uninspiriert machen konnte, denn bis zum Erscheinen gab es einige Spiele, die es besser gemacht haben.\n\nVon technischer Seite kann man sagen, dass die Grafik ganz in Ordnung geht, die Soundkullisse nett ist und die Sprachausgabe hätte besser sein können. Die Sprecher wirken nicht besonders motiviert und sind auch nicht zahlreich. \n\nTja kann ich das Spiel empfehlen? Sagen wir es so. Wer The Elder Scrolls gespielt hat, sollte einen Bogen um Two Worlds machen, denn er wird nur enttäuscht werden, so belanglos ist das Spiel für ihn. Alle anderen, die sich für Openworldspiele interessieren, können bei einer Rabattaktion bedenkenlos zuschlagen, weshalb Two Worlds von mir auch einen Daumen nach oben bekommt.","timestamp_created":1457182265,"timestamp_updated":1457182265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52627098560333252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21562221","author":{"steamid":"76561198116320536","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1630179415},"language":"russian","review":"нормас","timestamp_created":1456829952,"timestamp_updated":1456829952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21423085","author":{"steamid":"76561198001240991","num_games_owned":596,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":3548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1096,"last_played":1614137621},"language":"english","review":"So bad its good.

I find no advantage between classes.  If you can't swing a weapon (warrior), you aren't going to last long.  Magic doesn't do more damage, and I find it usually does significantly less.  Yes, there are places you can steal if you are a thief, but making money isn't hard, so you are giving up your ability to fight by building the steath skills.  Storyline isn't very complex.  Quests from one dude feel about the same as a quest from anyone else.  Quests don't add much to the game's feel either.  You just have an alternate reason to run around and kill everything you see.

It has a huge open world, no monster respawning, even the leveling system and the effects of some spells just remind me of Gothic 3. But it just made the same mistakes as the creators of the third Gothic, it just somehow lacks in storytelling and I just cannot get immersed into its world, maybe it is just something that happens with such a huge world. Personally that was also the case for me with Oblivion and Skyrim.\n\n<beginning_of_a_personal_nostalgic_note>\nI really miss the days of playing Gothic 1 and 2, because they had relatively small worlds and a band of NPC friends (funny I still remember even some of their names after over 8 years - like Diego, Fester, Milten, Gorn).\nAnd it is not just because of the voice acting, let's be honest the voice acting in gothic 1 and 2 wasn't perfect.\n</end_of_personal_nostalgic_note>\n\nYeah and as for the weapons it reminds me a bit of Borderlands. There is a ton of weapon and armor models with more or less randomly generated stats + enchantments, so the final effect is, that there is practicaly an infinite number of their variations. That turns most of the progress into that weapon-stat game, where you will never have the best possible weapon or armor, there is always something stronger that can be generated by the all-powerful RNG.\n\nVerdict:\nI think the \"mixed\" summary that it has as of the day I wrote this review fits it well. So if you liked Gothic 3 get it, you will not be dissapointed it is almost the same in terms of gameplay.

I bought the game for $1.29. It's barely worth that, in my opinion. The voice acting is terrible, the combat is boring, the story was uninteresting, the starting lore is contrived and unoriginal, and riding horses is glitchy and annoying. But its worst offense: it felt like a chore. The only upside to this game is that the environment looked pretty nice, for its time.\n\n3/10","timestamp_created":1452994049,"timestamp_updated":1452994089,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523507475852966309","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20571255","author":{"steamid":"76561198040687103","num_games_owned":449,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":444,"last_played":1452995243},"language":"english","review":"One of my best memory in rpg gaming has to be Morrowind and how I \"broke\" the game to become an almighty flying God who could destroy an entire city with a single spell.\n\nTwo worlds won't let you do that but it's the kind of game that is so imbalanced that you can become an invincible killing-machine.\n\nI like that they won't limit you, RPGs which try to balance their world with abstract rules have it wrong, Two Worlds and Morrowind made it great!\n\nYes the story is boring, the characters are stale and the voice acting ridiculous but you can break it and that is worth gold!","timestamp_created":1452981989,"timestamp_updated":1452981989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542546391487121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20567173","author":{"steamid":"76561197985560815","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":21,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1452969644},"language":"english","review":"Poor game.
