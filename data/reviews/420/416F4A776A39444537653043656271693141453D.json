Die Spielreihe kann man vor allem in das Genre des Ego-Shooters einsortieren, allerdings besitzen diese Spiele auch eine Vielzahl an Rätsel-/Puzzle-, Parcours-/Jump 'n Run-, als auch Adventure-Elementen. Da neben dem Erledigen von Gegnern, auch Hindernisse unter komplexe Situationen bewältigt, wie auch verschiedenste Rätsel gelöst werden müssen, um beispielsweise Türen zu öffnen oder Sprengfallen zu deaktivieren. Die Handlung, wie auch der Stiel von \"Half-Life\" ist sehr an Science-Fiction angelehnt.\n\nWie ich bereits leicht angedeutet habe, führen die Standalone-Erweiterungen die Handlung von \"Half-Life 2\" weiter. Die erste Erweiterung namens \"Half-Life 2: Episode One\" knüpft dabei unmittelbar nach den Ereignissen von \"Half-Life 2\" an. Da eine Trilogie aus den Episoden geplant wurde, wirkt es ebenfalls so, dass die einzelnen Erweiterungen zusammen ein vollwertiges Spiel darstellen sollten. \"Half-Life 2: Episode Two\" beginnt daher genau an der Stelle, wo \"Half-Life 2: Episode One\" aufgehört hat.\nNämlich mit der Explosion der Zitadelle, vor der Dr. Gordon Freeman, wie auch Alyx Vance flüchten mussten um zu überleben. Obwohl die Protagonisten es erfolgreich geschafft haben mit einem Zug aus der Stadt \"City 17\" zu fliehen, war die Druckwelle der Explosion so stark, dass der Zug entgleist. Nun sind sie in der Wildnis ausgesetzt, wodurch das Zurückkehren in ihre Basis erschwert wurde. In einer verlassenen Hütte, gelingt es Alyx erneut Kontakt zu ihrem Vater Eli Vance und Dr. Kleiner aufzunehmen. Während des Gesprächs erscheint ein neuer Charakter namens Dr. Magnussen - einen weiteren überlebenden des Black-Mesa-Vorfalls - der sich für die jetzige Problemsituation spezialisiert hat. Denn durch die gewaltige Explosion der Zitadelle, entstand ein zweiter \"Portal-Sturm\". Der erste \"Portal-Sturm\" wurde bei der Explosion der Forschungseinrichtung Black Mesa (Handlung von \"Half-Life\") ausgelöst, wodurch es den Combine gelang die Erde zu besetzen. Nun vermutet Dr. Magnusson, dass die Combine die Situation für sich nutzen wollen um ein \"Superportal\" zu ihrer Heimatwelt aufzubauen, um noch mehr Truppen auf die Erde zu schicken. Um dies zu verhindern, arbeitet der Widerstand an eine Waffe, mit der sie das Portal schließen können. Damit dieser allerdings funktioniert, benötigen sie den geheimen Zugangscode, der sehr wahrscheinlich in den Unterlagen und Aufzeichnung der Zitadelle verzeichnet ist, die die Protagonisten kurz vor dessen Explosion entwenden konnten. Aus diesem Grund müssen Alyx und Gordon nun so schnell wie möglich zur Basis zurückkehren.\n\nMeine Persönliche Bewertung nach meinen Kriterien:\n\nStory 84,75 / 115\nGameplay 26,75 / 40\nGrafik und Gestaltung 14 / 25\nSound 14,25 / 30\nAtmosphäre 17,25 / 20\nSonstige Besonderheiten 13,25 / 20\n\nIn den Punkten Gameplay, Grafik, wie auch Sound ist die Erweiterung \"Half-Life 2: Episode One\" identisch mit dem Hauptspiel. Daher liegt der Fokus bei den Standalone-Erweiterungen auch bei der Handlung.\n\nDie Erweiterungen \"Half-Life 2: Episode One\" und \"Half-Life 2: Episode Two\" besitzen leider ein sehr identisches Konzept, wodurch beide Spiele inhaltlich nicht sehr herausstehen. Das Ziel von Episode One und Episode Two welches angestrebt wird, ist \"einfach nur\" das Zurückkehren zu Dr. Eli Vance. Aus diesem Grund können die Episoden aus meiner Sicht auch leider nicht mit der Handlung des Hauptspiels \"Half-Life 2\" mithalten. Auch wenn es sich hierbei \"nur\" um Erweiterungen handelt, und diese in der Regel weniger Content besitzen, finde ich es trotzdem etwas schade. Dies liegt allerdings vor allem daran, dass die (volle) Trilogie - zum jetzigen Standpunkt - nie erschienen ist und dadurch eine Menge Potenzial verloren ging.\nIch persönlich finde allerdings, dass diese Erweiterung hier: \"Half-Life 2: Episode Two\", inhaltlich dennoch stärker als \"Half-Life 2: Episode One\" ist. Dies liegt vor allem an das spannungsreiche Ende dieser Erweiterung.\n\nWie bereits erwähnt ist meine Vermutung ja, dass die geplanten drei Episoden vollendet ein \"vollständiges Spiel\" samt Inhalt darstellen sollen. \"Half-Life 2: Episode Two\" endet sehr abrupt an dem Höhepunkt der beiden Erweiterungen. Daraufhin wird eine kurze sequenzielle Einleitung in die dritte Episode eingeleitet, die wie bekannt bisher nie erschienen ist. Dies hat die \"Half-Life\"-Fans zutiefst enttäuscht. Doch fast 13 Jahre später gab es mit \"Half-Life: Alyx\" doch noch eine Hoffnung für die Fans, die zwar die Handlung dieser Erweiterung nicht unbedingt fortsetzen, doch ein Beitrag für das \"Half-Life\"-Universum ist.\n\nAuch wenn ich selber sehr enttäuscht über die verschollene Episode bin, da die gesamte Spannung, der gesamte Inhalt und der gesamte Aufbau der ersten beiden Erweiterungen einfach so verschwendet wurde, kann ich dennoch diese Erweiterungen, wie auch das Hauptspiel \"Half-Life 2\" weiterempfehlen.\n\nWer dabei \"Half-Life: Alyx\" interessiert ist, da dies zum jetzigen Standpunkt das aktuellste Spiel der Reihe ist, soll definitiv vorher die gesamte \"Half-Life 2\"-Spielreihe spielen, da inhaltlich besonders auf \"Half-Life 2: Episode Two\" eingegangen wird.","timestamp_created":1572732424,"timestamp_updated":1620205810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56318100","author":{"steamid":"76561198398564315","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1646485897},"language":"russian","review":"настольгия","timestamp_created":1572723531,"timestamp_updated":1572723531,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56316027","author":{"steamid":"76561198932842981","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":2026,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1050,"last_played":1647864868},"language":"russian","review":"гордон закрой же отсек","timestamp_created":1572722245,"timestamp_updated":1572722245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56304794","author":{"steamid":"76561198152735364","num_games_owned":320,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":320,"last_played":1572715566},"language":"english","review":"nice. ended on a cliffhanger though. when's episode 3 coming?","timestamp_created":1572715628,"timestamp_updated":1572715628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481481492519378662","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56304606","author":{"steamid":"76561198871570076","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":501,"last_played":1572715382},"language":"german","review":"Typisch Half-Life: Toller und kurzweiliger Ego-Shooter","timestamp_created":1572715531,"timestamp_updated":1572715531,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56295361","author":{"steamid":"76561198131687333","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1589184560},"language":"polish","review":"tak","timestamp_created":1572710572,"timestamp_updated":1572710572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56278497","author":{"steamid":"76561198028836315","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":336,"last_played":1572706705},"language":"russian","review":"хорошо","timestamp_created":1572701795,"timestamp_updated":1572701795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56276488","author":{"steamid":"76561198798952352","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1056,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":939,"last_played":1585931655},"language":"english","review":"This game is so good.

What did I think of it? Meh. Perhaps an unpopular opinion, but even after not playing a Half-Life game in years I was bored at certain points of the gameplay. The story was AWESOME, following the events of Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, however there are a lot of parts I felt were somewhat filler. The game in length doesn't stand up to HL1 or HL2, but it definitely beats the length of Episode 1. The beginning was interesting, however you will be annoyed with bland enemy killing, especially if you've played the other games already before this. Some of the environments are beautiful, and I was conflicted because at many times I really enjoyed this game. Of course you will get to see the infamous cliffhanger ending of why fans are begging for a Half Life 3 to come out, but this game is probably good for one solid playthrough. There is a HEFTY part in the beginning of this game where you are crawling through tunnels over and over again, and I was tired of shooting at the same enemies very quickly at this point. After that, there is a longer section where you fight the zombies from the last game. I was a fan of the fun Half Life 2 level \"Ravenholm,\" but the zombie killing in HL2: EP2 is honestly nothing like that mission. Its boring. Been there, done that, I've seen it for many hours before loading this game. New fans might be more impressed with the physic dynamics and gameplay, but previous HL2 players should know what to expect. Thankfully, towards the mid-end of Episode 2, things do pick up and the world becomes more interesting. There are larger and more varied areas to battle in, and a different assortment of enemies. If you can push past the first hour or so, it will be a much more pleasant experience. This is a first person, flagship PC shooter that is a staple of PC gaming, and if you haven't finished the Half Life Story (to this point), then it might be worth your time to play it just to see where the characters end up and how the series left off. Overall not bad, but not excellent either. Like I said, a one and done experience that may make you yawn at some parts, while making you smile and have a good time at others. A good buy if you want to have items for an add-on in Garry's Mod or if you want to finish the complete the franchise. There were actually some \"silent protagonist\" parts that lasted upwards of an hour where I had to listen to a podcast to keep me playing because I was so bored..you may want to look up a summary or a YouTube lets play instead. On a final note, the achievements can be relentless! Use console commands, Steam guides, and save files if you intend on chasing them!

Muchos tiroteos poco recordables y poca historia.\n\nAunque sin duda el negativo va por la no culminación de la saga, ya que este juego deja la historia inconclusa para un episodio 3 que Valve faltando el respeto a sus propios aficionados se ahorró.
