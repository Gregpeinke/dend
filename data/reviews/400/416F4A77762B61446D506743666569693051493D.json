[/h1]\n\nSince its origins, Valve has been dedicated to developing first-person shooter (or FPS) games of great fame due to their great stories and quality, however, along with the release of Half-Life 2 Episode Two, a title based on Half-Life, but in a completely different genre, Puzzles. Title which is known as Portal, which is recognized as one of the best titles of its genre which meant a before and after in it.\n\n[list]\n\n[*] Like everything produced by Valve after the release of Half-Life 2, Portal makes use of the well-known Source graphics engine, in this case a somewhat refined version after its use in the Half-Life 2 chapters. Both the art like the design itself of the entire title, in addition to being well worked, it creates its own and recognizable identity so much so that despite the years it remains among the most recognized along with its sequel. Specifically, the design isn't that wonderful either, but I think the game didn't need to have such developed or complex art, even more so considering the context in which everything unfolds. Where it really stands out is in the setting, Source has always provided unsettling environments, and this is not the case, giving you the feeling of being watched or that something is not right.\n\n[*] During specific points if some bugs or failures were highlighted, but in general they were extremely scarce, actually there are many more than I have witnessed in it, but for the most part they are obtained by performing VERY specific tasks or already de facto using the command console (don't lie to me, who hasn't used it) so you could say that the Source engine did a good job.\n\n[*] I think that something that everyone who does not have much idea about this saga or this particular title might think is that its plot or history is either very meh, or directly does not have it, and neither are my intentions to pass high spoilers, but yes that It has a plot, and despite being one with such a simple approach, its execution was well crafted and clean enough that it left me in tears after finishing it 2 days after Christmas. The plot and the antagonist have a really brief and somewhat rough development at first, but unexpected and very good, to the point of having the ability to doubt your actions or a certain action that you are about to do or have done, all this within of a simple cake and puzzle solving game. Another well-implemented factor was the great information that the environment gives you in relation to the story, just like Half-Life, the more attention you pay to the smallest details, the more sense the story will make, so don't hesitate to take the time necessary to investigate a certain scenario that caught your attention.\n\n[*] The main reason why both this title and the saga are known is for very obvious reasons, the use of portals as a response to solving puzzles and other riddles, something that despite being somewhat \"common\" today , it was a before and after in the creative point of puzzle games, taking very simple maps and giving you the freedom to use what is inside (which is not much either) but with the minimum difference of being able to use portals in your favor . The difficulty scale is fine, it does not seek to be a difficult game, focusing more on being a well distinguished experience than on requiring skills (beyond the puzzles that can leave you with brutal pain but that is not the point) but it has its difficulty peaks and at the same time has extra complex maps for those who are smart with other challenges such as limited portal uses, finishing maps in less than a specific time, among others.\n\n[/list]\n\nPortal was personally completely unexpected in itself, and even more so coming from Valve. But despite all this, it really was a unique experience, somewhat brief, but that knew how to take full advantage of its extension and capabilities, developing an unexpectedly deep and mysterious story along with the use of innovative mechanics for the genre, resulting in quite unique gameplay. which defined the saga.","timestamp_created":1615851011,"timestamp_updated":1657208294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88507120","author":{"steamid":"76561198265061432","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":541,"last_played":1615851388},"language":"english","review":"this

Set this aside.\n4) Beat the shortening and sugar together until they are fluffy. Add the eggs an vanilla and beat thoroughly.\n5) Slowly beat in the flour mixture, occasionally alternating with the buttermilk. Beat until combined.\n6) Pour the batter into the cakepans.\n7) Bake for about 35 or 40 minutes (or until a a fork or a wooden pick comes out clean when inserted into the cake. Let the cake cool completely. The cake will be easier to cut if you keep it in the fridge for a few hours before cutting.\n8) After the cake has cooled, cut each layer in half (horizontally) to make four total layers. Sprinkle the layers with the 1/2 cup of Kirsch.\n9) Drain the canned cherries in a colander to remove most of the juice.\n10) Beat the whipping cream with confectioners' sugar until it thickens to desired texture.\n11) Put a small amount of the cream/sugar mixture aside for garnish. Mix the cocoa powder into the remaining majority of the whipped cream frosting.\n12) Place one cake layer on the serving dish you wish to use. Spread about one 6th of the whipped cream on the layer, and strew a third of the cherries on top of the whipped cream.\n13) Add the second cake layer on top of the first. Spread one 6th of the whipped cream on the second layer and 1/3 of the cherries on top.\n14) Add the third cake layer. Spread 1/6 of the whipped cream on that and add the remaining cherries.\n15) Top with the last cake layer. Frost the top and sides of the cake with remaining frosting.\n16) Use a potato peeler on the chocolate to create thin shaves. Gently pat the chocolate shaves on to the sides and top of the cake, completely coating it.\n17) Use the whipped cream you set aside earlier to place eight small circles around the top of the cake. Place your non-stemmed maraschino cherries on each one.\n18) Place white candle in the center and light. \nCongrats, you have made a cake!\nnow play the goddamn game already","timestamp_created":1615755457,"timestamp_updated":1615755457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88447483","author":{"steamid":"76561198337475379","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":617,"last_played":1597970414},"language":"spanish","review":"Indescriptiblemente bueno.","timestamp_created":1615755225,"timestamp_updated":1615755225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88446646","author":{"steamid":"76561198216883533","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1755,"last_played":1658423570},"language":"english","review":"FUN GAME!","timestamp_created":1615754184,"timestamp_updated":1615754184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88445966","author":{"steamid":"76561199003114305","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1593429593},"language":"english","review":"the cake is a lie ._.","timestamp_created":1615753261,"timestamp_updated":1615753261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88441142","author":{"steamid":"76561198810028916","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46,"last_played":1626370135},"language":"russian","review":"замечательная игра, некоторые уровни трудные, хотя может это я глупый","timestamp_created":1615747170,"timestamp_updated":1638887287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88441062","author":{"steamid":"76561199119294322","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":211,"last_played":1615790862},"language":"russian","review":"Игра топ, но озвучка на русском ужасна\n","timestamp_created":1615747056,"timestamp_updated":1615747056,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88439895","author":{"steamid":"76561199033698149","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":257,"last_played":1615745601},"language":"russian","review":"быстро проходится .чтобы понять весь сюжет надо поиграть в 2 части как и я .сюжет имба .всем советую не пожалеете","timestamp_created":1615745683,"timestamp_updated":1615745683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88438705","author":{"steamid":"76561199036777820","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164,"last_played":1594307923},"language":"spanish","review":"Haces click y salen portales.

Il est très fun à jouer et à rejouer; les énigmes sont très fun, la manière dont elles sont construites sont très intelligentes et collent parfaitement avec le scénario (chose que l'on voit particulièrement vers la fin du jeu). Le jeu n'est pas très long mais offre une certaine rejouabilité avec les maps avancées, les défis (limite de portails, limite de temps et limite de pas, bien que ce dernier ne soit franchement pas très bien fait), ainsi que les succès. Au final, le jeu était très fun à finir à 100%, et je le recommande à tous ceux qui aiment les jeux vidéos, peu importe leurs préférences, ils passeront un bon moment!","timestamp_created":1615718640,"timestamp_updated":1615718640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88416521","author":{"steamid":"76561198835454195","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":351,"last_played":1614239475},"language":"schinese","review":"神","timestamp_created":1615717972,"timestamp_updated":1615717972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88414418","author":{"steamid":"76561198082440617","num_games_owned":435,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":339,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41,"last_played":1657964849},"language":"schinese","review":"Amazing!!","timestamp_created":1615714879,"timestamp_updated":1615821379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88413837","author":{"steamid":"76561198305473534","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":939,"last_played":1647644251},"language":"english","review":"fuckin pogchamp","timestamp_created":1615714006,"timestamp_updated":1615714006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv+aDmPgCfeii0QI="}
