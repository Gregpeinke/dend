I really like the story line (Fighting against an oppressive future world government, to return back to true freedom, in my nutshell summary.). It struck me, that this could be a great translation into a movie, IMO. The other episodes to Half-Life 2, are equally well done. Since I have ditched other consoles, except for patiently waiting for the Steam Boxes (Waiting with bated breath.), going full Linux, I can tell you so far on 3 different rigs (all Linux), this game runs/performs like a dream.\n\nI for one am glad VALVe is taking time to get the Steam OS and the Steam Boxes right, better steady and right, than quick and a mess. Who knows...as a lot of folks are waiting for Half-Life 3, maybe a release spotlight on the Steam Boxes?! I am sure if done proper, it will sell massively. :) But I digress, back to HL2 at 75% off currently (12-30-14) it is a steal. You  shall not be disappointed with the game, IMO. YMMV, cheers.

İlk bilgisayarımızı almışız. Dandik bir bilgisayar olmasından dolayı en kaliteli oynayabildiğimiz oyun ilk Half-Life (o da zaten o zaman için tüm zamanların en kral oyunuymuş) idi ki o da Software Mode ayarında; yani görüntü kare kare. İlk oyunu en az 5 kere bitirdim, abim bitirirken izlediklerimi eklesen 15, canım sıkıldıkça aklımdan ilerlediklerimi eklesen bi 25 falan eder. Nereden ne çıkar ezbere bilirim. Keşke 2. oyunu yapılsa diyordum. Yapıldığını öğrendiğimde çalıştırabilecek teknolojimiz yoktu. Uydudaki oyun kanalı Game Network'ta oynadıklarını izlerdim. İlk oyunda sadece kutuları kaldırabiliyorken bunda bir silah yapmışlar her şeyi kaldırabiliyorsun; ilk gördüğümde çok şaşırmıştım. İlk oyunda raylarda gidiyorduk; bunda araba ile istediğin gibi.\n\nBu oyunun oynanabileceği teknolojiye geçen sene sahip oldum. Çıkışının üzerinden 10 sene geçmiş olmasına rağmen günümüz oyunlarından hiçbir eksiği yok. Adamlar yapmış. Sağ üstte 96/100 yazıyor ya hani; oradaki 4 puanı nereden kırmışlar bilmiyorum. Gordon Freeman yine tek kelime etmiyor, yemiyor, içmiyor ama çok iş yapıyor: Öldürüyor, yaralıyor, hopluyor, zıplıyor. Ama üzerine aniden saldıran headcrabler veya başka yaratıklar nedeniyle bizi hoplatmayı da ihmal etmiyor.\n\nNeyse işte oyun çok iyi. Al oyna. Ama ilk oyunu oynadıktan sonra. Önce gör bakalım bu dünya nasıl bu hale gelmiş, Gordon işe kaçta gitmiş...\n(Half-Life 3 çıkmaz anlarım da Episode 3 çıksın bari lan. 3'e bu kadar mı karşı bu Valve...)","timestamp_created":1419937211,"timestamp_updated":1419937211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":103,"votes_funny":20,"weighted_vote_score":"0.88788837194442749","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13710578","author":{"steamid":"76561198047731281","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1009,"last_played":1419936041},"language":"english","review":"I spent 3 years to complete this game.

Still, there is a reason the second game in this franchise is considered by many to be one of the greatest games of all time, and after so long, I finally get the hype.\n\nGraphics are slightly dated, but hold up to this day, especially with mods and all the HD texture packs, you'll find it has about the same level of visual fidelity as Portal 2, a game released in 2011 for god's sake! Story and audio are all passable, not exceptional, but above average.\n\nWhat really does it for this game though, is of course the game play, which should be the most important aspect of any game. To start with, I find it really hard to like first person shooters, this is the only exception besides Portal which isn't really a shooter to begin with, but what this game does is incorporate tonnes of physics into the shooting, which makes for a whole tonne of fun.\n\nTo give you a sense of what I mean, I think I spent half the game using a crow bar and a gravity gun.","timestamp_created":1419930003,"timestamp_updated":1419930003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13708774","author":{"steamid":"76561198069095116","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2832,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2744,"last_played":1430167284},"language":"brazilian","review":"Você é um P.H.D que usa um pé de cabra e uma arma anti-gravitacional para matar aliens.
