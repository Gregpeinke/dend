Хорошо против него работают гранаты, и взрывы вообще, особенно это полуавтоматический гранатомёт М32. Хорошо работают полуавтоматические дробовики с коробчатым магазином. Если вы хотите выжить в борьбе против отбивальщика - вам нужно иметь или такой дробовик, или что-то взрывчатое, совмещая это с гранатами его можно убить. \n\nНа волнах на которых появляется отбивальщик лучше всего свалить из узких помещений, где он может появится перед вами внезапно, и где вас могут зажать другие враги. Не находитесь у него в поле зрения долго, иначе он будет вас атаковать, скрывайтесь от него.\n\n***\n\nКак выполнить достижение \"Горячее веселье\"? (убить 25 горящих врагов с арбалета), лучше всего делать это в команде. и мочить тех кого подожгли ваши напарники. Если так нельзя - возьмите навык \"поджигатель\" (для скидки), и купите траншейный дробовик, на следующей волне возьмите навык \"техник\" (для увеличения веса) и купите арбалет. Стреляя в основном в берсеркеров, в толстяков и хасков с дробовика - добивайте их с арбалета, если они загорелись.\n\n***\n\nВ игре есть следующие достижения: \"Мы всех догоним\" (убить из Винчестера без перезарядки 3 рождественских сталкеров), \"Лови гвоздь\" (убить 4 Сталкеров в одной игре из Гвоздевого дробовика), \"Экономный\" (убить 4 монстров одним выстрелом из охотничьего ружья), \"Спецназ (убить 12 Зомби из пистолета МК23 без перезарядки), а так-же \"Макароны с мясом\" (убить 12 монстров, истратив полный магазин боевого дробовика, т.е по 2 монстра на выстрел), эти достижения лучше выполнять в одиночном режиме на нормальной сложности, так вы быстрее заработаете на оружие, и никто не будет мешать вам убивать монстров.\n\n***\n\nДостижение \"Лесоруб\" (15 врагов за одну атаку топором) подразумевает 15 врагов за одну волну, а не за один удар, так-же как и достижение \"Хирург\" (8 врагов ножом за одну атаку), \"Жонглёр\" (бросить 5 различных единиц оружия второго уровня за одну атаку), и прочие подобные достижения.","timestamp_created":1399630368,"timestamp_updated":1646997835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522293031215667725","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10059679","author":{"steamid":"76561198074981166","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":545,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":110,"last_played":1483780426},"language":"russian","review":"скажем нормальна гра\n","timestamp_created":1399622874,"timestamp_updated":1399622874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10058947","author":{"steamid":"76561197988994736","num_games_owned":2711,"num_reviews":159,"playtime_forever":392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":353,"last_played":1438061004},"language":"english","review":"Picked this game up a couple of year ago.

Not enough games emphasize team-play like this one does. There are 7 perks you can play as, and all serve a specific purpose and have their own priority targets. On the lower difficulties it's not that important, but on the higher ones you really need a balanced team to make it through. Each of these perks can be levelled up, giving you several bonuses which make the game generally easier. It's also an addicting mechanic that more survival/horde games should have. The soundtrack kicks so much ass too. I also really like the developers because they do something special every holiday, like releasing a new map and adding a new unlockable character. But there are also thousands of custom maps and other mods made by the community to use. The game goes on sale with a huge discount so often, and you get so much value and content for your money.\n\nIf I have one complaint about this game the way it is now, then it's that it doesn't look as dark and scary as the original mod did. The maps looked a lot darker and really seemed like how places would look during a scenario like this. It had a better atmosphere, in my opinion. The new maps just look too clean, but they are designed better in the sense of enemy spawn points and being able to survive on them.","timestamp_created":1399546818,"timestamp_updated":1481031805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555212855339050293","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10050798","author":{"steamid":"76561198072343544","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":209,"last_played":1373361161},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun sağlam olmuş, bazı eksikler var, buglar var.
