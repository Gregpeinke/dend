I really really love this game and the characters feel so alive and dynamic. The world-design is beautiful and is extremly vibrant and therefore such a direct contrast to the dark and eery rapture. I say \"almost\" as great because I can't really decide. Bioshock 1 had this magical feeling, which Bioshock infinite doesnt deliver. But that doesnt make it bad. I prefer the characters a lot over the original Game and seeing the development of Elizabeth is so heartwarming but also heartbreaking. It offers one of the best plottwists in game history and the music is a masterpiece for sure.

I was excited to get into this one at first because I saw an overwhelming positivity, but as it turns out, it is nothing more than an overrated game.\n\nThe game can be described as an arcade shooter in which you linearly progress from area to area, killing brain-dead AI even on hardest difficulty, and repeat all over again. There are very few boss fights and even those are lackluster due to the superior 'guns-blazing' playstyle as there isn't much punishment to dying. \n\nWith regards to the story, it has to be one of the most idiotic and incoherent plots I have ever seen in the past decade. It is not uncommon for games which try to explore the concept of parallel universes / multiverse to end up getting lost in their own plot and leaving behind numerous story loopholes and inconsistencies. \n\nIf you look at the game objectively after finishing it, you will notice that it greatly suffers from sacrificing / deducting actual gameplay elements for the sake of forcefully delivering a story. That would have only worked if the atmosphere and story were actually great. A simpler and more straight-forward story with less pointless chatter, actual gameplay such as more boss fights and more fun weapons, would have worked much better for Bioshock Infinite. \n\nOverall, I don't think that the game is absolutely atrocious, there is still some entertainment value to be gained from it, but its excessive marketing made it way too overrated. I would only recommend getting it on a big sale.","timestamp_created":1635634515,"timestamp_updated":1635634515,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481751829385757446","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101917013","author":{"steamid":"76561198418508543","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":318,"last_played":1636152093},"language":"schinese","review":"Art is amzing!","timestamp_created":1635630297,"timestamp_updated":1635630297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101916428","author":{"steamid":"76561198394310168","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":132,"last_played":1611483225},"language":"turkish","review":"evet","timestamp_created":1635629643,"timestamp_updated":1635629643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101914117","author":{"steamid":"76561198979618393","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":382,"last_played":1635571865},"language":"schinese","review":"我最喜欢的复古未来风格的游戏，虽然结局很凄美但是还是很值得玩","timestamp_created":1635627060,"timestamp_updated":1635627060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101912564","author":{"steamid":"76561198195935613","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1635625379},"language":"turkish","review":"I CAN NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT.","timestamp_created":1635625405,"timestamp_updated":1635625405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101911245","author":{"steamid":"76561198882350769","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":10359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5159,"last_played":1653252439},"language":"brazilian","review":"não","timestamp_created":1635624061,"timestamp_updated":1635624061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101910401","author":{"steamid":"76561199007402722","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":905,"last_played":1637612858},"language":"brazilian","review":"ow... que coisa foi essa que eu joguei. olha, simplesmente perfeito, a jogabilidade, a história, tudo. bate de frente com titanfall 2, portal 2, little nightmares 2 e hollow kinght.","timestamp_created":1635623226,"timestamp_updated":1635623226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101908970","author":{"steamid":"76561198852843784","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":746,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":746,"last_played":1635611926},"language":"english","review":"IF HAD TO REVIEW THIS GAME IN 1 WORD, IT WILL BE \"THE BEST OF THE BEST\"...

Ayrıca Polt Twist senaryosu ile sizi şaşırtacak ve asla unutmayacaksınız.\n\n","timestamp_created":1635551610,"timestamp_updated":1635551610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101847617","author":{"steamid":"76561199213775772","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1902,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":714,"last_played":1653385504},"language":"russian","review":"Не оценивайте игру по обложке,по началу может показаться что она лайтовая,гламурая и всё такое,первое что для меня стало неожиданностью-кровяка и треш,по которой игра может посоревноваться с Дум,второе сюжет и особенно концовка.Оптимизация 10/10,не смотря на масштабность происходящего ничего не тупит,не лагает.Игру советую,но предупреждаю,концовка может ввергнуть в тихий,продолжительный шок,хотя сцена после титров даёт даже некое утишение","timestamp_created":1635551251,"timestamp_updated":1635551251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586660385131835938","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101841353","author":{"steamid":"76561198126185092","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1329,"last_played":1622500371},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1635543093,"timestamp_updated":1635543093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101841268","author":{"steamid":"76561197990856469","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":782,"playtime_at_review":2064,"last_played":1659820890},"language":"english","review":"My hats off tho the BioShock Artists, Writers and Producers.
