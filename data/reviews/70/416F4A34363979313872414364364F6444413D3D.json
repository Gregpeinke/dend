I consider it the best piece of work ever made due to personal reasons. This game, along with 3 certain friends (we don't really talk anymore but I hope you guys are still doing good these days) I made on Sven Co-op shaped who I am today. Going back brings me memories and good feelings. The fact that Valve finally made a new installment known as Half-Life: Alyx finally completes a chapter in my life. This franchise is the most important piece of media and no matter what anyone says, I'm glad the series was created and I'm glad Alyx came out after all these years. Thank you Valve again. You helped save my life with your games AND gained my respect once again with your newest game.\n\nApril 16th 2019:\n\nThank you Valve for making this game. It really has affected my life and many others in a great way. My childhood wouldn't be the same without the game, it made me really happy.

Looking back, I can't express how much I appreciate this game for what it has done for me on a personal level.\n\n Even past the more nostalgic moments, it's still a damn good game. If you have never played it, do yourself a favor and BUY IT. I mean the game is over 20 years old and still holds up in terms of pacing, game play, and story. It really will always have the title of being a masterpiece, especially for what it represents in gaming. On sale, it literally sells for a DOLLAR. I really could go on about this game and even nitpick parts I don't really enjoy today but I'll just leave it here. Half-Life is one of the greatest games ever made, and you need to play it if you haven't.\n\nOnce again, even with Valve 100% not being the same company at all, obviously, since they don't even make games anymore, thank you for everything you've done especially with this game right here.","timestamp_created":1311484948,"timestamp_updated":1611562351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2558190","author":{"steamid":"76561198009288156","num_games_owned":550,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":1,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":86400},"language":"french","review":"Le 1er Half-Life, un incontournable pour tout fan de la série.
