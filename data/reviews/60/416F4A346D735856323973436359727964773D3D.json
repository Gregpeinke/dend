There is not a game in this world that comes close to the tight controls, amazing score and outstanding visuals this game has to offer.

I’m not sure if it’s a meme because it was an unpopular Valve game or because of its absurdity, but the latter is why I actually like it. Ricochet is a game where there are a bunch of small platforms floating in nothingness with boosters along the sides that shoot you to other platforms. Your character is equipped with disks that you can throw and, upon hitting a wall, wall ricochet off. If the disk hits a player, it’ll knock them back. The general idea of Ricochet is to knock other players off of these small, floating platforms with your disks. While this is the idea, I think myself and many other people find it much more effective to decapitate people instead. To do this, you right click to use up all three disks you have “loaded” to send out one disk that will instantly kill whoever it touches. So what happens most of the time is people try to get point-blank to guarantee the insta-kill. This can be fun in its own right, though, as there are sometimes goose chases on all of these platforms with launchers and other times where people try to long-shot the insta-kill disk. Other times you might be chasing someone and they turn around and hit you instead. It’s simple, zany fun for the shortish sessions my friends and I sometimes have.\nOf course, that’s the thing about Ricochet. You probably aren’t going to find anyone online, so you have to get your friends to play…which can be a tall order depending on who you’re asking. This game really only serves a purpose as a game you recommend playing out of nowhere and, if people agree, it can be a fun time for half an hour. I wouldn’t pick it up for $5 ever, but if it’s on a big sale, maybe pick it up and experience ~Valve

The music is made by the great John William and it is awesome compared to it's other soundtrack. The game is full of content like: Not being able to play cause nobody fucking plays it, having a huge urge of fisting a dead crocodile and wanting to hang myself in my bathroom.\n\nThe story is very simple, you have to kill the people but there is no people that play the game so you can't complete the story so you have to die in your inside.  When there is people, they just reck you cause they are ex Quake pro player and they have just been dumped so they want to make people feel like looser playing this game.\n\nBut seriously there is not enought people to play and the abondance of DLC require to have a good experience is just bad.\n\nI'll r8 this game 8/8.","timestamp_created":1495337145,"timestamp_updated":1495337145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474092572927474976","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31853577","author":{"steamid":"76561198070551229","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":92,"last_played":1574839062},"language":"english","review":"Is it worth $5?
