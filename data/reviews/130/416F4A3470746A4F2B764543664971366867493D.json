И как бы так сказать оно очень фиговое. И тут даже не виноват изящный opposing force, просто она какая-то скучная. Если сравнивать с прошлым dlc то намного меньше оружий (точнее те же что и в халф лайфе, только меньше), нет новых механик и новых монстров кстати тоже нет. Ну это кароче намного хуже чем opposing force. Только история немножко выдвигает дополнение вперёд.\n\nСюжет. Нормальный сюжет. Он неплох для дополнения. И это единственный плюс для этого dlc. Вообщем я то поставлю 6, но вспомните что было в opposing force. Ладно там не история рулит. Кароче 6/10.\n\nГеймплей. Как я и говорил в 2 раза хуже прошлого дополнения. Да! Если прошлое было в 2 раза лучше оригинальной игры, то это хуже и орига и 1 допа. Ну добавили хотя бы 1 новую механику или одного-двух новых существ. Ну тут же даже до 3 не дотягивает. 2/10.\n\nГрафика. Как я говорил графика хорошая для седых годов. 9/10.\n\nЦена. Ну я не знаю что сказать. Вроде норм, но зная какая она короткая и отстойная по геймплею я бы дал ей 50 рублей от силы. Кароче наверное 4 заслуживает.\n\nПерсонажи. Тоже на самом деле неплохо, но всё равно тухленько и скучно. 4/10.\n\nВот такой вот доп. Opposing Force остаётся для меня одним из самых лучших дополнений в мире. Что сказать про blue shift? Вообщем если так посмотреть на подведённые баллы, то оценка принципе неплохая. Но ПО МОЕМУ МНЕНИЮ геймплей всегда решает в играх, а он тут отстой. Ну в смысле это тот же шутер, но кастрированный. Судите вообщем сами. Не кого ни слушайте и делайте выводы своим умом.

And unlike it, Blue Shift doesn't introduce new enemies and weapons, and the set-pieces are definitely low-key, so it feels like simply more Half-Life rather than any significant contribution to the franchise. \n\nStill, more Half-Life is never a bad thing. You're still getting 3 to 5 more hours of shooting, puzzling, and exploring, except now as Barney Calhoun. There are brand-new scenarios and environments, some neat puzzles that don't just copy the monster-in-a-room template from the original Half-Life, and plenty of intense fighting against the Marines. \n\nIf we're comparing the two Gearbox add-ons, I'd say Opposing Force is still better, because it's more ambitious and is ultimately a meatier adventure, but it's got some issues: it kind of drags near the end, as it strings together too many epic gunfights against bullet-sponge enemies, and forgets to switch things up and give you a breather, which is what the original Half-Life excels at. Blue Shift, on the other hand, is much better paced and never gets boring. Of course, it never attempts anything on the scale of the first two campaigns, and --again-- adds no new content, just iterations on the Half-Life gameplay loop. But its relatively short length and quieter puzzle-oriented sections do make Blue Shift an excellent cool-down game, if you've already gone through Half-Life and Opposing Force. Also, Blue Shift does have the best Xen levels in classic Half-Life, and there's a welcome lack of bosses, which aren't really Half-Life's strength (thought I didn't mind Opposing Force's final boss). So, for fans of the franchise, it's not one to skip.","timestamp_created":1589066444,"timestamp_updated":1589066444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68849752","author":{"steamid":"76561198048928536","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":523,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":523,"last_played":1589034641},"language":"english","review":"Short but yet immersive. This is a great complement to the story of Half-Life letting you know a few more details around the incident and Freeman itself. Of course it might look shorter however the experience is pretty solid and feels more rapid. I would give it a 8/10.
