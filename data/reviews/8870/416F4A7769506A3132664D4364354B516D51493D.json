Advirto que tudo aqui se baseia em minha experiência individual.\n\n[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]\nBioshock Infinite possui uma gameplay parecida com os outros jogos da franquia, batalhas que se desenvolvem através de tiroteios e “poderes”, que em BI se chamam “Vigores”, e não mais “Plasmídeos”, como nos outros títulos, na prática são a mesma coisa. Existe também um sistema de lock picking e outro de abertura de fendas entre dimensões, que só podem ser usados quando o protagonista estiver acompanhado de Elizabeth. A exploração não é um ponto positivo, o jogo é bem linear e a ausência de um mapa fez falta em vários momentos durante a gameplay.\n\n[h1] GRÁFICOS [/h1]\nOs gráficos do jogo são originais e bonitos, que são muito bem aplicados quando em sintonia com a maravilhosa ambientação Steampunk que o jogo apresenta.\n\n[h1] SOUNDTRACK [/h1]\nAlém de casar muito bem com a temática e ambientação, a soundtrack não vai muito além disso, ela consegue criar ótimos momentos de tensão e intensificar a imersão do jogador no universo apresentado. \n\n[h1] HISTÓRIA [/h1]\nAqui as coisas complicam, no começo, parece um jogo completamente distante daquilo que os títulos anteriores criaram, mas ao decorrer da gameplay é possível sentir que você está jogando um Bioshock, entretanto, visualmente não é.\n[spoiler]Somente no final que se descobre que BI se passa no mesmo universo que os outros dois jogos. E são nas DLC’s que toda a história se completa e tudo se interliga, e você se sente satisfeito por ter jogado uma ótima história mas, ao mesmo tempo sente o vazio por ela ter acabado.[/spoiler]\nOs personagens são incríveis e bem desenvolvidos, principalmente Elizabeth, que vai de uma princesa presa em seu castelo, uma menina boba e sonhadora, até se tornar uma mulher corajosa, madura e convicta daquilo que quer fazer.\n\n[h1] CONCLUSÃO [/h1]\nO jogo é muito bom na maior parte dos pontos a serem abordados, um FPS diferenciado e com elementos que deixam a gameplay mais interessante, ótima ambientação e soundtrack à altura. Achei apenas um erro o final da história estar disponível apenas através de DLC’s. Contudo, analisando o geral, o jogo é uma experiência diferente e intrigante. \n\n[i] Obrigado pela atenção!

Recommend playing on Hard because Normal is a cakewalk if you make use of all the weapons and powers at your disposal.","timestamp_created":1596528168,"timestamp_updated":1596528168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73737030","author":{"steamid":"76561198372653179","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1167,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1167,"last_played":1596096908},"language":"brazilian","review":"O melhor,mais profundo e mais detalhado enredo dos 3 jogos da franquia, a melhor jogabilidade e gráficos \nO jogo peca é na dificuldade(pq é \"facil\") ,tem um final unico e não há inimigos marcantes e tão facinantes quantos seus antecessores, eles no geral são bem genéricos...\n\nMas o enredo é tão bom que você nem liga pra esse defeitos\n\nzerei a franquia e digo que vale apena joga os 3 jogos !!","timestamp_created":1596527859,"timestamp_updated":1596527859,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73736422","author":{"steamid":"76561198107612622","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":546,"last_played":1522568260},"language":"english","review":"Why are you still looking at the reviews, go buy the game","timestamp_created":1596526823,"timestamp_updated":1596526823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73736144","author":{"steamid":"76561198370862788","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":587,"last_played":1596525238},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情好啊","timestamp_created":1596526278,"timestamp_updated":1596526278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73736045","author":{"steamid":"76561198990427732","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":756,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":709,"last_played":1597292932},"language":"koreana","review":"ㅅ1발 개띵작","timestamp_created":1596526066,"timestamp_updated":1596526066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73735462","author":{"steamid":"76561198851081029","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":542,"playtime_at_review":1291,"last_played":1660448794},"language":"spanish","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1596524792,"timestamp_updated":1596524792,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73734501","author":{"steamid":"76561198375782673","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1174,"last_played":1606701927},"language":"brazilian","review":"otimo jogo","timestamp_created":1596522459,"timestamp_updated":1596522459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73733646","author":{"steamid":"76561198315532814","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1247,"last_played":1578561823},"language":"koreana","review":"'시간'과 관련된 스토리가 인상적인 게임.\n\n다소 '깜놀'연출이 있으므로 공포게임을 즐겨하시지 않는 유저라면 기피할만한 요소라고 생각합니다.\n\n스팀 도전과제 깨기를 즐겨하는 유저라면, 매우 아쉬운 도전과제(무슨 총으로 50킬하기 등등 다소 억지스러운 도전과제가 많이 분포되어 있다)\n\n이 게임이 호평받는 이유가 '스토리' 이므로 자신이 1)'생각없이',  2)'자막 안 읽고' 게임을 진행하는 부류의 유저라면 별로라는 생각을 할 수 있습니다.\n\n","timestamp_created":1596520519,"timestamp_updated":1596520519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73732801","author":{"steamid":"76561197997050459","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1071,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1071,"last_played":1596494706},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite more than realizes the potential of this series. As a shooter, it's good but the story and characters are where it really shines. \n\n[u]Gameplay:[/u] this is fairly typical shooter stuff, nothing groundbreaking but it's solid. There are plenty of standard FPS weapons (shotgun, pistol, magnum, rifle, RPG, etc), most of which feel good to use and can be upgraded multiple times. Beyond that are your Vigors, this game's version of Tonics. These range from letting you shoot flames or lightning to abilities that let you levitate enemies for a short period of time or create a shield that absorbs incoming damage. The most useful by far though is Possession, which not only allows you to temporarily control turrets and automatons, but enemies too. Melee combat is the same \"whack someone in the back of a head\" deal you've seen before. But that's not the primary purpose of your melee tool, the Skyhook. With it, you're able to grapple onto freight hooks to reach higher areas, zip around on rails that crisscross through the sky, and launch yourself onto enemies for a takedown kill. The amount of mobility this thing provides almost makes the game feel like Dishonored lite, and it's pretty fun. \n\n[u]Story:[/u] unlike the first two games, you do not play as a silent protagonist. You're put in the shoes of Booker DeWitt, a private investigator who has been tasked with finding a girl in Columbia, a floating city. No more crawling around soggy, dimly lit buildings on the ocean floor. Columbia is a beautiful city, full of color and old-timey charm, which makes it all the more disturbing when you realize it's not an idyllic utopia. The girl you're meant to find, Elizabeth, looks like a Disney princess and is being held captive in a tower. Together, you'll have to escape the city as it descends into chaos. Thankfully, saving her does not entail escort mission after escort mission. Not only is Elizabeth charming, she's more than capable of taking care of herself. While she doesn't get directly involved in combat, she will throw you recovery items and ammo, as well as help out in other ways that I won't spoil. On the topic of spoiling things, I won't go into any more detail on the story lest I ruin it. It's an amazing story, but don't expect a fairy tell ending. Elizabeth may look like a Disney princess, but this world is far from cozy. \n\n[u]DLC:[/u] There are technically three DLCs for this game, but it's really just two. The first is Clash in the Clouds, which is basically just an extended challenge mode with exclusive maps. I don't care about challenge modes but if that's your thing, you'll probably like it. The real meat of the DLC is in Burial At Sea, which is divided into two episodic parts. The gameplay is more of the same good stuff, but I can't get into any of the story without heavy spoilers. All I'll say is that [spoiler]you'll be returning to Rapture[/spoiler] and it beautifully ties the story of Infinite into the first Bioshock.\n\nAll in all, Bioshock Infinite is a fantastic game and well worth playing, even if you didn't like the first two games (I don't much like the first one).","timestamp_created":1596518592,"timestamp_updated":1596518669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73732602","author":{"steamid":"76561198338460709","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":948,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":948,"last_played":1596448588},"language":"schinese","review":"久闻伊丽莎白大名，近日玩后不禁拍案叫绝，人物形象很饱满，难度也不高（dlc较难，尤其第二章基本不敢硬刚），可惜的是布克和伊丽莎白都是悲剧收场，令人哀叹","timestamp_created":1596518092,"timestamp_updated":1596518092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73731344","author":{"steamid":"76561199041533865","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":593,"last_played":1610341383},"language":"spanish","review":"Un grandioso gameplay que amplia lo que mostró el primer juego, la historia se mantuvo firme e interesante durante toda mi partida, aún así casi al final de mi experiencia empezé a sentir los encuentros repetitivos, pero por suerte el juego logró no cansarme y dejarme con un gran sabor de boca y un final que te vuela la cabeza.","timestamp_created":1596515211,"timestamp_updated":1596515211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73731171","author":{"steamid":"76561198356994731","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1596514772},"language":"schinese","review":"不，我两者皆是","timestamp_created":1596514801,"timestamp_updated":1596514801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73730119","author":{"steamid":"76561198308808085","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":414,"last_played":1589833061},"language":"english","review":"So I want you to picture every weird time travel/alternate dimension episode of any Star Trek series you've ever seen.

Тут этой динамики и заливаловалова горы противников сначала с рельсы, потом с пулемёта, потом закидывания пары гранат в толпу, сопровождая всё это адское удовольствие использованием кучи разных абилок, параллельно жахаясь хилками и хакая дроны защиты и турели, а потом прекрасного залета во врага с бура и высверливания всего говна из него просто нет. Игра позиционирует себя как шутер, однако реально годного геймплея шутера она просто НЕ ДАЁТ. Плюс разрабы просто НАГЛО РАСТЯГИВАЮТ ВАШУ ИГРУ, добавляя ключики, которые открывают сундуки исключительно позади вас. Например, чтобы открыть первым ключом ящик, вам придётся пробежать ВСЮ ЛОКУ НАЗАД (ну это просто пиздец).\nНо всё же разрабы постарались с сюжетом и прорисовкой Элизабет, чтобы у всех детей аж слюнки текли.
