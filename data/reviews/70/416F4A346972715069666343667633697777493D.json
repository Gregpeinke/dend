There are no interesting characters, the controls have a little slipperiness (likely trying to simulate how you can't just STOP walking in real life), and the gunplay got pretty boring afterward. \n\nIt has 0 replay value, but if you want to know the story behind Half-Life, just pick up Black Mesa.

Мужик с ломиком выносит весь комплекс [/h1]\n\nЯ думаю, тут даже не надо представлений, ибо эта игра (Которая мне и ровестник ещё) является одной из самых культовых игр всех времён, которая изменила жанр шутеров на года вперёд. А в принципе и перейдём к обзору, сея шедевра\n\n[h1] Геймплей [/h1]\n\nЭто самая лучшая часть данной игры. Конечно она скопирована с Quake (Разработчики ведь и изменили движок Quake), но доработанный до совершенства. В своё время игры сочетающий в с себе сборник из экшена со стрельбой и головоломками были редкостью (Если не исключением). В игру была добавлена физика, благодаря которой стало возможно двигать объекты. Поднимать их ещё нельзя было, но пододвинуть ящик для того, чтобы забраться на уступ - уже было возможно. Также в игре представлено большое количество оружия. Есть и обычное оружие, как великая монтировка, пистолет, дробовик и пр. Есть экспериментальные образцы, такие как Тау-пушка, являющаяся чем-то наподобие гаусс-пушки, а есть Фотон-пушка (В простонародии - пылесос), который расщипляет всю живность на атомы в течении пары секунд. Есть даже инопланетное оружие в виде рукоулья и снарков, которые будут интересным дополнением к инвентарю Гордона\n9/10\n\n[h1] Сюжет [/h1]\n\nКто-бы там не говорил, а сюжет по мне самая слабая часть игры и она являет собой именно геймплейный опыт.\nКратко можно описать так. Есть в Аризоне правительственный исследовательский комплекс \"Чёрная Меза\", где персонал, как создаёт новое снаряжение для военных, так и изучает инопланетную жизнь и технологии, с которыми учёные столкнулись после создания технологии телепортов. В один день из-за доставленного образца в виде кристалла случается каскадный резонанс, который оповещает о полномасштабном вторжении пришельцов. Здесь-то и пытается главный герой в лице Гордона Фримена исправить ситуацию. И по сути - весь сюжет игры основан на том, как Гордон предпринимает попытки остановить вторжение, пока ему это не удаётся с очередного раза. Поэтому, несмотря на то, что я фанат Half-Life - сюжет для меня тут второстепенная цель. Он хорош, но не более\n6/10\n\n[h1] Графика [/h1]\n\nКонечно, сейчас таким никого не удивишь, но в то время - это был писк технологий и эстетики. Несмотря на то, что игра была очень камерной и действия происходят, в основном, в стенах комплекса - это выглядит на уровне. К тому-же всё было сделано в 3D. А это при том, что почти все игры того времени лишь частично использовали такой функционал - придерживаясь логики спрайтов и рисованных фотов. Да, эра 3D уже подходила, но Half-Life была одной из пионеров, которые продвинули данную идею в массы\nИ да, чтобы там не говорили про HD репак, но он мне по нраву, так как добавляет деталей на персонажей и оружие, исправляет некоторые недочёты с графикой, а также меняет ПП MP5 у военных на логичную винтовку M16, которую и выдавали в те времена всем военнослужащим США. Единственное - самка снарков в обычной версии выглядит лучше, чем в HD репаке\n9/10\n\n[h1] Саундтрек [/h1]\n\nКейли Байли очень хорошо постарался и у него вышел прекрасный образец сочетания электроники и инструментального рока. До сих пор очень по нраву некоторые его композиции из официального альбома игры, такие, как Drums And Riffs или конечных Credits. Если выразиться просто, то альбом выдался на славу, с композициями,которые почти всегда на своих местах и которые можно переслушивать часами\n8/10\n\n[h1] Онлайн [/h1]\n\nА здесь он есть до сих пор. Сервера держаться и даже модифицируются. Есть и PvP-сервера, так и кооп-прохождения карт. Но поговорим об официальных и основных режимах. А по сути - он один: Бой насмерть, где игроки поодиночке или в команде стараются набрать большинство очков при помощи оружия из игры, которое раскидано по карте или выпадает из игроков при смерти.  в своё время - это была не новая штука, ибо она была скопирована с Quake (Ибо движок GoldSource - модифицированная версия движка Quake). Но несмотря на это - онлайн очень интересен для игры. Во-первых - Half-Life чуть медленней Quake, а значит чуть легче в обучении. Во вторых - разнообразие карт, а их больше, чем даже в Quake 2. Ну и последнее - разнообразие оружия, чего в Half-Life представлено в большем количестве. Так что советую для ознакомления\n8/10\n\n[h1] Вердикт [/h1]\n\nHalf-Life до сих пор показывает, что у старика ещё есть порох в пороховницах. Даже сейчас, спустя столько лет в игру очень приятно играть, сервера многопользовательского режима хоть и не заполнены под завязку, но на них до сих много игроков. Игру я советую всем, особенно любителям быстрых шутеров, так как игра позволяет развивать большие скорости при помощи фишек движка. В остальном-же первая часть навсегда будет игрой, которая изменила игровой мир\nОбщий итог: 10/10","timestamp_created":1611016846,"timestamp_updated":1626125155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505649745464324951","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84948671","author":{"steamid":"76561198870906211","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2937,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1557,"last_played":1647743889},"language":"english","review":"One of the best first-person shooters I've ever played!\nSure, it doesn't have the best graphics but it has a fantastic story line.","timestamp_created":1611015573,"timestamp_updated":1611015573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84948211","author":{"steamid":"76561198352346016","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":721,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":530,"last_played":1611024642},"language":"english","review":"the platforming makes me want to eat sand\n","timestamp_created":1611014751,"timestamp_updated":1611014751,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":68,"votes_funny":60,"weighted_vote_score":"0.718872785568237305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84947859","author":{"steamid":"76561198074088375","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1613248421},"language":"english","review":"Really fun, great story an crap.","timestamp_created":1611014064,"timestamp_updated":1611014064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84946698","author":{"steamid":"76561198960746554","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5555,"last_played":1611575180},"language":"czech","review":"nice\n","timestamp_created":1611012114,"timestamp_updated":1611012114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84946092","author":{"steamid":"76561198945746887","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":3847,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3297,"last_played":1645155567},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1611011237,"timestamp_updated":1611011237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84935115","author":{"steamid":"76561198956790263","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1145,"last_played":1611009448},"language":"english","review":"yes.","timestamp_created":1611009564,"timestamp_updated":1611009564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84933612","author":{"steamid":"76561199126969055","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1494,"last_played":1613869762},"language":"english","review":"The game is as good as people said it was.

If you somehow you haven't even heard of Half-Life or the series as a whole on a platform like Steam, then clearly you truly have been living under a rock, and have a hell of a lot to catch up on.\n\nIt's masterpiece of its time, but is extremely dated when playing it in the modern era. Obviously while graphics shouldn't define the gameplay and story of a game, it's very clear nowadays it's a game that when it came out, was revolutionary in the way it looked and acted. Even with that said, Half-Life is a game full of story telling, and people would happily argue it was a turning point for not just all story driven games, but the way a game should feel, act and play out. A timeline of games being Before Half-Life and After Half-Life. \n\nYou can look anywhere on the Internet and see it is full of videos going over the vast and deep lore of the entire Half-Life franchise, speculations, anticipation for new games, lost projects, speedruns and so much more.\n\nThe game is less than £10, and even though it may seem a smidge bit pricey for a 22 year old game, it's a must play to understanding a structural foundation for the games you love to play today.\n\nOne thing however, while the new Black Mesa game may look more promising to play, running on the Half-Life 2 source engine, with more up to par graphics, you must play the original first. The dialogue, references and general information will not make sense unless you play the original 1998 version.\n\nHalf-Life was a game that took the world's attention, and helped lay the foundations to the games you love and admire today.","timestamp_created":1610935242,"timestamp_updated":1610935242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559050261974334717","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84881924","author":{"steamid":"76561198414262069","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1007,"last_played":1636853988},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1610929296,"timestamp_updated":1610929296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84879201","author":{"steamid":"76561198442630601","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1664,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1296,"last_played":1612898512},"language":"english","review":"Doom. Quake. Super Noah's Ark 3D. These are the games that defined shooters in the 1990's. In these games, you were running around, blowing up shit, usually with a vertically locked camera and extreme violence. The draw of these games was that they were new. In the 1980's video games were looked at as kids' toys with all the bright colors and the jump mans and all that jazz. But when Doom came out, the audience for gaming changed. Now it wasn't just your little brother running around and stomping on Bowsers or whatever, you were out there shooting guys in the face, blood everywhere. The thing you have to understand about these types of games, though, is that they weren't very subtle, and they weren't very pretty. They offered little in the way of plot and the levels often felt like labyrinthine mazes to navigate after all the shooting and the blood was over. The gameplay boiled down to shooting guys and then walking over their corpses until you got a key. Half-Life didn't do that. Half-Life gives you a goal within the first few minutes and makes it clear how hard it's gonna be to get there. Immediately you're thrown into combat encounters where you actually have to think about spacing, learn enemy attack patterns, and make every move count. Now, a modern gamer playing this game would be deterred not only by the graphics, but by the dated gunplay. I know that I certainly was at first. But the game honestly began to grow on me. While it takes a while to get used to, mastering Half-Life's combat is a deeply rewarding experience. In the beginning, you're put into the role of a scientist named Gordon Freeman whom no one really likes. You're seemingly always late, your coworkers talk down to you, and your job is to push a cart of magic alien stuff into a laser beam. But as the character of Gordon Freeman gets stronger, so too does the player. It's a game where you're constantly learning new things, having to navigate new scenarios, and getting new weapons in a supremely satisfying feedback loop. By the end of the game, everyone else in the facility that you're trying to escape from begs for your help and heralds you as a hero. This narrative connection to the protagonist is what makes Half-Life's sparse story so potent. It's truly a case of one man against the world, and you are going to die a lot in this game. But scraping by those tough combat encounters with only five health points remaining is tense and rewarding in a way not a lot of other games are, and I respect it for that. The final boss, while really mediocre, serves as a serviceable climax to the game. It's difficult to end video games, and throughout the game I felt like the quality just kept increasing. I was bored in the first few hours, but once I really got into it and learned the ropes of the combat and physics, I started to love it. Overall, I would recommend this game to anybody who loves shooters or is just curious to see how Valve started out. Peace and love, fellows and fellettes.","timestamp_created":1610924633,"timestamp_updated":1610924633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84879198","author":{"steamid":"76561199086555441","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2035,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":974,"last_played":1654675878},"language":"english","review":"Ok, so this game is great, but PLEASE fix the glitch im about to say.
