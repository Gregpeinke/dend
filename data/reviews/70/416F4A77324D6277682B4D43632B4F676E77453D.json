It revived its genre which was getting into a dull and monotonous state at the time with similar games getting released one after the other. It marks a gameplay experience with a cinematic style, getting you into the plot. What makes it so special and amazing is its narrative. The way it constructed a game world was so different from the FPS around at that time. You are not holding a gun from the very beginning, your only goal is not to kill as much enemies as you can in the search of an escape point. You have a facility and an alien world to explore, puzzles to solve and different enemies to handle in a strategic way. Also you have a mysterious man in a blue suit who seems to be appearing several times all of a sudden. G-Man is a bonus to the already definitive game.

Almost everything in this game is so exciting to play be it the combat the exploration or even, shockingly, the platforming (first game ive played with decent first person platforming). \nHere i'm just going to list what i liked and disliked.\nLikes:\nThe world is vast and branching but not so much that you get lost, there are often 2-3 ways to get from point a to point b which means that even after playing a second time I never hit a part where I had to take the same path.\n\nThe combat feels good, enemies pop out of the environment during the straight shooting sections so you're not just aiming at a vague area, the aim assist was annoying at first but became a blessing later on when i had to hit small targets while moving fast. The guns make the most satisfying noises in the world.\n\nThe music is hype and only kicks in when it needs to, so it doesn't grate on you.\n\nYou never lose control. From the start of the game to the end you are always in control, this really helps immerse you since you never get pulled out to watch your character do his own thing in a cutscene.\n\nThe story is interesting but they never shove it down your throat, you can pay attention if you want and if not you can continue on your merry way.\n\nDislikes:\n\nLadders\nLadders\nLadders\nHonestly i want to climb a fucking ladder wihout having a 50/50 chance of gordon deciding to fucking jump down 50 feet to his death\n\nThe final Boss: This is not a game killer by any means but it leaves a really bad taste in my mouth every time, you either spend 70 hours fighing him with every weapon in the game save one to barely win, or you use the ghostbusters beam and kill him in 2 seconds, so it's either spend a lot of time using things like the crossbow and revolver which have worked fine the entire game til now going through the annoying teleport move sections time and again, or you get lucky and in your mad dash to pick a weapon hit the ghostbusters weapon and insta melt him.\n\nTldr:good game, use the ghostbuster beam on the final boss.","timestamp_created":1525583508,"timestamp_updated":1525583508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41871347","author":{"steamid":"76561198140895945","num_games_owned":496,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":2214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":949,"last_played":1630332937},"language":"english","review":"I honestly like this better than the sequel.
