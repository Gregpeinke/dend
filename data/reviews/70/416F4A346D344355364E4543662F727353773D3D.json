never played this when it first came out.  So of course it looks dated compared to modern games.  There is nothing wrong with older games, many I still play now.  Overall, I say this is a fairly good game.  This game is a bit of a mixed bag.  Being a FPS game, I enjoyed most of it.  Not being a big fan of puzzle or jumping games, there are parts I did not enjoy that much.  The puzzle aspects, while really simple, just seemed to slow the pace of the game for me. I'd rather be shooting something  than sliding crates around to get to the next goal. Some people, on the other hand, will greatly enjoy this aspect.  The parts of the game that require jumping I found to be boring and tedious.  Mr. Freeman seemed to be on uppers all the time, running too fast and over shooting most of the jumps repeatedly.  The controls on this aspect just did not seem as precise as I would have liked. Again, others will find jumping to be fun.  There are some games I go back to over and over again because they have great replay value... this is not one of them for me.  Once was enough.   7 out of 10 for me and my picky tastes.  Probably higher for those that like the mixed bag aspect.","timestamp_created":1451088985,"timestamp_updated":1451088985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19944907","author":{"steamid":"76561198044196409","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2040,"playtime_last_two_weeks":192,"playtime_at_review":436,"last_played":1659920797},"language":"english","review":"a","timestamp_created":1451088956,"timestamp_updated":1451088956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468164771795272827","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19942478","author":{"steamid":"76561198271354346","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":81,"last_played":1635259186},"language":"turkish","review":"ekran widescreen oldu bir türlü düzelmiyor allahın belası.. bunun orjinal dosyaslarını tekrar indiremez miyim steamdan bi yardım edin","timestamp_created":1451073298,"timestamp_updated":1451073298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19941695","author":{"steamid":"76561198169632576","num_games_owned":333,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":163,"last_played":1649885999},"language":"turkish","review":"Bi an çocuklugauma döndüm ve tüm seriyi aldım","timestamp_created":1451071754,"timestamp_updated":1479983390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19941130","author":{"steamid":"76561198111375129","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1505503541},"language":"english","review":"veri god","timestamp_created":1451070592,"timestamp_updated":1451070592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19940740","author":{"steamid":"76561198090619683","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":352,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":250,"last_played":1560703137},"language":"russian","review":"Покупай после этого лицензионные игры...

I have no problem with old graphics or games but it seems to be a bit too dated for me to play, will probably pick up Black Mesa instead.\nHooks you on the plot, world is immersive, weapons and world design unique. Very original and innovative for its day and age. However some of the levels appear to be broken, one specific area took me  at least 2 hours to beat because one of the in-game trams got stuck. Not unbeatable though without a walkthrough or some ingenuity.\nA problem is the game is so old it breaks when I close it so until I restart my computer steam acts as if It's still open, thus my 7 hours of gameplay is now 125+ hours, and preventing me from playing other steam games until I restart my system.\nOverall a good game. I recommend you grab the valve complete pack or the orange box instead of this on it's own though.\n9/10.","timestamp_created":1450898883,"timestamp_updated":1451156049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518716573715209961","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m4CU6NECf/rsSw=="}
