Think of it as a really good version of the retro FPS formula. But I was expecting for some reason to get a satisfying story campaign as well, which doesn't manifest. Shephard isn't much of a character and all the events that happen are really big coincidences. You don't really feel like you're part of a marine unit send in to deal with the situation, or that your fellow marines have any value. This could have just been about a guy who was sent in solo to fulfil a undercover type mission. I find this unfortunate because, without an investing story, the really dynamic mechanics are left to dry. The great game-play could have been expanded a bit more to make up for the story. Still worth a buy if you're into the genre.","timestamp_created":1629785007,"timestamp_updated":1629936385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98126679","author":{"steamid":"76561199049454178","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":84,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1660264147},"language":"spanish","review":"Remember adrian shephard","timestamp_created":1629773830,"timestamp_updated":1629773830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98116767","author":{"steamid":"76561198125867138","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":300,"last_played":1629867942},"language":"english","review":"cool","timestamp_created":1629756886,"timestamp_updated":1629756886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475113123655319214","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98103168","author":{"steamid":"76561198375122963","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1629707027},"language":"english","review":"Game good, let dumb scientists heal you then merc them.

To jest ten sam, dobry, stary Half-Life, ale z inną fabułą i postaciami. Gra umie utrzymać klimat placówki, może nawet i lepiej niż oryginał, dzięki soundtrackowi, jak i dobrze zrobionych lokacji. Twórcy postanowili, aby powrócić to pewnych lokacji z pierwszej części, ale też dodali coś od siebie, co jest miłym dodatkiem od ich strony. Nie popełnili tych samych błędów co Valve podczas robienia lokacji, bo nie doświadczyłem, żadnego denerwującego momentu. Nawet po tylu latach gra umie wciągnąć mimo swojej starej mechaniki gameplayowej jaki i grafiki. Niestety wciąż jest denerwujące AI, które sobie postanawia nie iść dalej, albo tak po prostu nam strzelić kulkę w naszą głowę.
