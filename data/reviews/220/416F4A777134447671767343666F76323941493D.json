OH BOY, do I have grievances with this game!\n\nBack in the late 00s I played a pirated copy of this game, and like anyone else, thought is was amazing and very well polished. Now that I'm an adult with actual disposable income, I bought the game as part of a bundle to sort of \"attone\" (remember: a pirated copy is not, necessarily, a lost sale). It lay in my library for a couple months, until I saw somewhere, can't remember where, that people were playing HL2 again. I would later find out there had been a concerted effort, by a number of gamers to beat the previous \"currently playing\" record for the game during the 14th and 15th of August 2021. I figured, \"Oh yeah, I bought that, let's play it, got nothin' be'r to do, and I remember that game being SUPER GOOD!\". \n\nAlas I started playing on the 17th so wasn't part of the new record. Anyway, the Game:\n\n#######\nNostalgia lied to me! \nOr maybe my younger self played on Easy.\n\n#First, the Good:\n\nThe early parts of this game are AMAZING! The way that Valve intruduces you to its new setting, mechanics, weapons and enemies is sublime and emersion friendly, never stopping the player's flow with a clunky pop-up. Just intuitive \"show, don't tell\" philosophy. \nMost of it's set-pieces are very enjoyable and, at this point, familiar and iconic. Everyone remembers the rooftop chase, the airboat, Ravenholm, Highway 17, Nova Prospeckt... \nGunplay is solid; each weapon has its place and specific use, you will rarely find yourself in a position where you have no use for any of 'em. They pair well with the new enemies and their abilities.\nThe world is recognizably mundane but sprinkles elements of much greater sci-fi and eldritch concepts and implications, weaving an enthralling tale of mystery and wonder!\n\n#Now the Bad:\n\n## PHYSICS OBJECTS: This is a game where you will be stopped dead in your tracks because theres a wooden board at your feet which, for some reason, Gordon refuses to just walk over. Other times, you will strugle to avoid enemy fire because a barrel/box just happened to roll over to where you where going costing you that precious half-second you needed. In ravenholm, you will struggle to keep track of the saws you throw around with the gravity gun, because if they don't hit a wall at a specific angle, they will bounce off to lord knows where. You will stand and jump on crates and wooden palets to have them wobble beneath your feet despite being on solid ground. Sometimes, the physics just break and all sorts of chaos erupts, ocasionnaly leading to you taking unnecessary damage or straight-up having to reload!\n\n## VEHICLES: The airboat and buggy have very wonky controls and steering, it was fine in 2004, but it really did not age well; the level design DOES NOT cater to their turning arcs. In the airboat segment, in particular, you will struggle to dodge the rockets from the CP cars and the mines from the hunter- choppers. Despite the urgency that the game enforces in these segments, going at top speed is actually detrimental to you, you might miss the way forward, fail to dodge a new obstacle/enemy projectile or just fail to turn a curve properly (did I mention the level design does not cater to your turning arcs? Cus' it bears repeating!).\n\n## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: The enemy AI is fairly decent, especialy the combine soldiers; they make apropriate use of cover most of the time, they lob grenades to flush you out, they make use of terrain such as high ground when it's an option. Your ALLIES, on the other are a different story!\nI wish, I WISH I had been recording my gameplay from last evening, so I could show how suicidally stupid these people are!   It wouldn't be so bad if I could indefinitely tell them to stay put somewhere until I need them, but the \"stay put\" command is temporary, they will randomly decide to start following me again! In the roof of the combine nexus(the bank/museum place) I wanted to fight the gunship without the squad intervening and, after several reloads, it took me constantly weaving back to the staircase to tell them to stay inside while I lobbed rockets at it. \nOther times, those people won't take cover, meaning they just sit there taking fire and dying, when I desperatly need them to deviate fire and keep the combine and the GODDAMMED STRIDERS from leaving me alone long enough to aim and fire at them. \n\nNow, you might ask: \"Why do you care to keep 'em alive? Are you a hippie softie who can't stand a bunch of 1s and 0s being switched off? Just send them against the enemy, that's what they're there for!\"\n\n#FIRSTLY: Who made you the arbiter of how one should play the game?\n#SECONDLY: Often, you will need that squad at the end of the section where you picked them up. Either there will be a big fight or some other threat, like that section where you have to fight from the top of a damaged building while surronded by combine soldiers and TWO DAMMED STRIDERS. I had to lower the difficulty to easy to get through that one!\n\n## THAT HEADCRAB TYPE THAT LOWERS YOUR HEALTH TO 1: This enemy exists; that is my complaint. At least they only show up like 2 or 3 times.\n\n## PUZZLES: I get that Valve was flexing on their physics tech but that is no excuse for shoving it down the players throat! Some of these are acceptable deviations from gunplay, but the remander are just taking the p...urine and many are not intuitive at first glance. I had the benefit of having played this game before and knowing the early ones from how prevalent they are in the meme-sphere, and I still got confused from time to time. For instance, it took me a few minutes on the crane to remember I had to grab the buggy, place it on the pier and knock over the bridge. Ocassionaly I would struggle to find the way forward until realising I had to use the gravity gun to make a path or clear physics objects out of the way. Individually, none of these segments ruins the experience or anything, but pleasure wanes and frustration mounts!\n\n## THE THRICE ACCURSED STRIDERS: Look, isolated from everything else, there's nothing wrong, design-wise, with this enemy, if you interpret it as a mini-boss that you have to fire rockets and use cover against. But when they show up in-game, it's always accompanied by some element that makes dealing with 'em a nightmare. The first time you deal with striders, you are expected to fight THREE of them, and these things take 7 rockets to bring down! The squad you had with you will likely die as well as the npcs fighting in the area; furthermore, the crate of rockets is at the end of a gauntlet where you have to avoid their fire as well as the fire of a newly arrived combine squad. Did I mention that Strider fire can kill you in a few seconds from full health? And that the time between their fire cycles is really not that long? \n\nAnd if you beat that, guess what? a later section has a strider show up FROM BEHIND YOU inside a long corridor, and, later on, another strider pops out right in front of you, while your chased by another strider, and you´re supposed to duck beneath it, into a combine trap! And then you´re supposed to kill both, with minimal cover, while flanked from multiple sides!\n\nThe very last strider you meet is the one in the citadel. You have to go through a long hallway while fighting combine soldiers, while it has free range to fire on you, whereas you can't do anything to it until you're close enough to grab the combine energy balls with the upgraded gravity gun so you can lob them at it. Oh, by the way, did you know that strider fire can knock objects out of the gravgun's grapple? \n\n## CLOSING STATEMENT:\nThis is a great game! But let us not ignore it's failings okay?","timestamp_created":1629391004,"timestamp_updated":1629391362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97869566","author":{"steamid":"76561198086381564","num_games_owned":308,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":599,"last_played":1580409413},"language":"english","review":"Amazing story that we all know and love.","timestamp_created":1629390974,"timestamp_updated":1629390974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97868189","author":{"steamid":"76561198260125396","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1742,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1535,"last_played":1631866357},"language":"latam","review":"ñ","timestamp_created":1629389227,"timestamp_updated":1629389227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97867938","author":{"steamid":"76561198051715639","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2611,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1248,"last_played":1630235507},"language":"english","review":"Classsic sick shooter.

Es un juego del 2004 y sigue siendo re contra disfrutable hasta el día de hoy. Te re cagas a tiros todo el tiempo y tiene algunos puzzles donde haces uso de la física del motor gráfico.\nEn historia me gustó un poco más el primero, porque peleas mucho con los Aliens, zombies y algunos soldados, pero en este solo peleas todo el tiempo con los soldados de la Alianza y algunos robots. Creo que los únicos enemigos que quedaron del primer juego son los zombies con cabeza de Headcrab que hay en una zona donde te encontras con un cura re loco y haces muchísimo uso de la pistola antigravedad, que me copó mucho.\nLa banda sonora lo mismo, muy buena.

duda alguna fue una de las mejores experiencias que eh tenido jugando algún titulo, me parece sorprendente que este titulo sigue viéndose muy bien a pesar de ya tener 17 años desde que se lanzó, al sacar Half-life 2 Valve tenia en mente dos cosas, uno mejorar o perfeccionar la saga y segundo demostrar el potencial del motor Source, ambas cosas lo hicieron bastante bien, el primer Half-life ya de por si se diferencio de los demás shooters de la época que compartían muchos mecánicas similares (copias de Doom básicamente), Half-life 2 en cambio fue tan ajeno a otros shooters de su época pero si
