Playing this game besides the amazing picture and beautiful storyline it also implements a type of vibe that will keep you hooked and I truly believe that the largest contributer to this sense of completion is the soundtrack presented into the game. As for the recomendation on this game I give it a 9.5/10 it is simply a masterpiece crafted from Irrational Games. \n\nI as well will list the pro's and con's that I feel fit tword this beauty. \n\n[i] Pros: [/i]\n- Amazing storyline \n- Beautiful graphics \n- Attaching soundtrack\n- Attaching characters \n- Fair combat and movement \n- Impressive bosses and challenges\n- Long campaign to keep you hooked \n- Beautiful cutscenes \n\n[i] Cons: [/i]\n- Some issues with game crashing or freezing \n\n\nOther then that I honestly would not change a single thing about it this game builds the foundation for following single player adventure games past its release it is a work of art that none other can match I began with the amazing first two titles of The Rapture we all love and then fluctuated into this iconic setting as well. I hope for the next time one desires to purchase an adventurous single player game I recommend Bioschock Infinite as your chocie.

Not in this one tho\n\n\n\n\"A really dumbed-down Bioshock game\" is not enough to describe it. \nAfter watching all those amazing E3 trailers showing all emotional and weird stuff that was supposed to happen in this game I was so amazed and now I am regretting even purchasing this game. \nLet's start with the fact how developers decided to kill a new fresh First Person Shooter idea that was Bishock 1 and 2 just to make another generic Modern Military Shooter for quick buck without any sort of effort:\n\n>dull gameplay based around hidding behind covers and enemies with ton of health because a player is too dumb to enjoy a game that takes less than 12 hours to finish\n\n>constantly losing a control over your character because a player is too dumb to play a video game without cinematic experience\n\n>\"press this button to progress\" every few minutes, even during cutscene and conversations because a player is too dumb to pay attention otherwise\n\n>choices doesn't matter because a player is too dumb to understand them\n\n>checkpoints every 2 minutes because a player is too dumb to have some sort of challenge\n\n>regenerating shield because a player is too dumb to use healthpacks\n\n>2 gun limitation because a player is too dumb to use multiple guns\n\n>very small amount of maximimum ammo because a player is too dumb to use a gun that he want for a longer time\n\n>5 out of 8 powers are just stun because a player is too dumb to use more unique powers\n\n>laughable variety of enemies because a player is too dumb to fight something different than a human with a gun\n\n>only 2 enemies in game use \"powers\" that are advertised all over the city because a player is too dumb to complain about world consistency\n\n>slow reloading and enemies barely twitch after being shot because a player is too dumb to understand what a good gunplay means \n\n>tons of copy pasted generic guns because a player is too dumb to use something different than another shotgun or rifle\n\n>upgrading multiple weapons makes no sense because a player is too dumb to use more than 2 guns at once\n\n>very limited customization of passive upgrades because a player is too dumb to have a bigger choice\n\n>open area and map are replaced with tight corridors and simple navigation arrow making exploration minimalistic or worthless because a player is too dumb for exploration\n\n>no side content because a player is too dumb care about those\n\n>Elizabeth is a meaningless character that give us no reason to care about her for a whole game and cannot even die because a player is too dumb to protect this moving dispenser\n\n>existence of magic and fighting ghosts with bullets because a player is too dumb to complain about McGuffins and story inconsistency\n\n>cliche boring story filled with plot holes, terrible dialogue, meaningless choices, a message \"racism is bad\" that goes literally nowhere with ending so bad that creates a time paradox because a player is too dumb to understand and complain about script and its plotholes\n\n>no different types of ammo because a player is too dumb to switch between them\n\n>hacking removed because a player is too dumb for minigames \n\n>false advertisement because none of promises, E3 footage, Songbird, script, ideas or scenes such as horse resurrection are in the game and player is way too dumb to even remember or complain about that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_lN_7DsFIw\n\n\n\nAnd in exchange for what? An NPC that gives you infinite health, salt, ammo, guns, money for free and revive on spot for a small fee?\n\nIs that why this game is called \"Infinite\"? \nThen why its called \"Bioshock\" when the game has nothing to do with Bioshock gameplay?\n\nOh, there is also \"1999\" difficulty but all it do is give less ammo, respawn cost more money, enemies are more bullet sponge and deal more damage to you.\nThat means you will have LESS chance to buy upgrades and powers while you will hide behind covers way MORE often. Does that sound like fun for you?\n\nWouldn't be better if this difficulty did something different? Like adding more types of enemies using powers and other real challenges that would make actually in game difference and give some replayability to this game? \nOh, its just me thinking that? Alright.\n\nWasn't this franchise supposed to be about unique gameplay that is not just like any other modern shooters, advanced technology, gene manipulations and how it can lead to disasters anyway?\n\nNope, instead we get easy predictable story with a \"racism is bad\" that gets drop in the first half of the game for sake of plot about different universes that also goes nowhere.\nOh, wanna finish this so-called \"story\", eh? \nWell then be ready to buy all horrible DLC's that clearly feels like they was cut out from main game just to be later sold.\n\nBioshock 1 and 2 gave us gameplay affecting moral choices and multiple endings. \nInfinite gave us a lesson that your choices means nothing and there is just one ending\n\nNo wonder that studio don't want to make another Bioshock after this because greed killed this franchise just like it did with Mass Effect, Duke Nukem and Dead Space. \n\nI enjoyed Bioshock 1 and 2 for being unique games unlike majority of shooters available on the market and because of all those changes - I really hate Infinite.\n\nSame story with Duke Nukem Forever - they did want to create more simple, dumbed down game that works both on consoles and PC. \n\nI dont mind that but why did they had to change so much franchis formula with already two game in the franchise (also available on consoles) that not only was very popular but also praised by both fans and critics for its uniqueness\n\nSo why this game is called \"Bioshock\"? \n \nOh, I know why - because it was way cheaper to make a sequel to critically acclaimed games than making a new IP. \"Easy money from blind fans\" as developers and publishers say. \nThat why this garbage still have \"mostly positive\" reviews I guess.\n\nThey could at least make this game a co-op Bioshock for 2 players.\nImagine that - one play as Booker and other as Elizabeth, each have own skills, guns and own paths making game worth of playing as both sides to see everything.\nElizabeth could use her \"magical\" tear making powers to collect items or give them to Booker when Booker have his own gimmicks but no - that would be too good and unique idea for this game\n\nAlso it would require way too much testing and we had to rush this game into stores, guys. Thats why we need another generic shooter instead - they are way cheaper and faster to make than well crafted, detailed shooters with fresh, original ideas.\n\nDefinitely my worst game of 2013. \nWhat a huge disappointment after all that years of hyping up product by greedy corporations.\n\nI expected a step forward from a sequel to Bioshock 2, not 10 steps backwards perfectly showing-off that there is no place for innovations in First Person Shooter genre.\n\nI am really glad that games like Doom, Wolfenstein and Serious Sam exist and proves that there is still place on this market for more fun First Person Shooters.\nThose games gives me hope that developers will stop with this \"everything is Call of Duty/Halo\" ambition.\n\nI did want to play a Bioshock game that was promised to me by E3, all those trailers and interviews. Instead I got another heavy scripted Modern Military Shooter. \n\nIs this wrong that I expected a Bioshock game to have....well, more Bioshock in it?\nUnfortuned, I got way less of it. \n\nBut my biggest pain in all that is how many people are praising games such as Bioshock Infinite as a masterpiece because this send a message to developers and publishers that people want more dull shooters every year that insults players intelligence instead of good crafted shooters that respect players skill and time.\n\n\n\nIf you want a more elaborate critique of Bioshock Infinite, would you kindly watch this video which not only talk about everything I did just say but also more: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdNhwb7iuI4","timestamp_created":1482159088,"timestamp_updated":1616252236,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28464562","author":{"steamid":"76561198089175333","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":856,"last_played":1581108206},"language":"danish","review":"Gameplay - 10/10 \n\nXD","timestamp_created":1482141367,"timestamp_updated":1482141367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28464201","author":{"steamid":"76561197986508603","num_games_owned":544,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":4830,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4754,"last_played":1481985546},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is actualy a masterpiece.\n\nI can't complain about anything in this game.

В первой понравился сюжет и она заставила побыстрее запустить вторую, которая разочаровала меня и заставила не запускать Infinite. Но я всё же вернулся к этой франшизе всего спустя неделю, так как восторженные отзывы не давали спокойно спать.\nТретья часть BioShock потрясла своим сеттингом. Такой резкий контраст солнечной и открытой Колумбии и мрачного подводного Восторга. В отличие от первых частей, мы попадаем Колумбию в период своего расцвета. Можно несколько часов бродить по мощёным улочкам и разглядывать витрины магазинов, заглядывать в счастливые лица людей, но всё-равно где-то таится ощущение, что с этим городом не всё в порядке.\nЧерез какой-то промежуток времени мы находим Элизабет и вот тут приходит понимание того, что игру делали профессиональные психологи. Так умело манипулировать сознанием игрока сможет не каждый. На проработку этого персонажа, я уверен, ушло немало средств и времени, но Кен Левин и его команда смогли достичь того, что планировали. Элизабет не ощущается как набор скриптов и текстур, она ощущается как живой человек, за которого ты готов сражаться до последнего патрона. Элизабет влюбляет в себя игрока и в какой-то момент игрок понимает, что не Букер главный герой игры, а Она. Задумка Irrational Games была в том, чтобы игрок олицетворял себя с Букером, чтобы сформировать такую сильную привязанность к Элизабет. Такое я вижу впервые.\nКроме того, Элизабет крайне полезна: кидает патроны, здоровье, деньги. Но что самое главное, никогда не путается под ногами, ведь это обычно то, что делают напарники в играх.\nКак шутер игра не очень выдающаяся. Больше всего бесили двери, которые открывались только после полной зачистки комнаты. Ну и конечно же исчезающие противники в 2013 году.\nОт стрельбы можно получить удовольствие только если находить новые комбинации энергетиков (Колумбийские аналоги плазмидов) и оружия. Например, поднял в воздух толпу врагов одним энергетиком и смыл их за край Колумбии другим.\nСценаристы придумали такой сюжет, благодаря которому можно было бы клепать сиквелы и дополнения бесконечно и я очень рад, что этого не случилось, в дополнениях лишь связали первую часть и Infinite.\nИгра безусловно достойна внимания, не как шутер, а как увлекательная история, после окончания которой сидишь в лёгком недоумении и разочаровании от того, что франшиза закончена.","timestamp_created":1481805028,"timestamp_updated":1481893425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":28,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.719898879528045654","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28385922","author":{"steamid":"76561198077572468","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":453,"last_played":1505407313},"language":"german","review":"Auch

absolut fantastisch. Habe kaum je ein schöneres Spiel gespielt.\n\nAuch die anfängliche Atmosphäre ist äußerst dicht - jedenfalls für die 1. Stunde im Spiel, während man sich noch im Tutorial (der Jahrmarkt) befindet.\n\nAuch der Sound und die genial arrangierten Songs im Spiel haben mir sehr gefallen.\n\nAber sobald das Spiel in den Egoshooter wechselt, ist die gesamte Atmosphäre dahin.\nWer zum Geier hat denn in einem so hochkarätigen Spieleentwicklerteam die tolle Idee, einen absolut simplen Shooter aus diesem Spiel zu machen?\n\nAlles, aber auch absolut alles, was bei System Shock und Bioshock 1 und 2 noch Spaß machte, ist entfernt worden. Es gibt keine Map mehr, man kann meistens sowieso nicht eigenwillig an vorher besuchte Orte zurückkehren. Man folgt ziemlich stur einem vorgegebenen Weg. \nMan kann Maschinen nicht mehr hacken (nur noch kurzzeitig umpolen), es gibt nicht mehr die Möglichkeit, dass man nach und nach lernt, welche Gegner empfindlich gegen welche Waffen sind. Nur noch simples Haudrauf-Shooting mit ein paar stupiden Zusatzkräften. Schlösser knacken übernimmt auch die Nebenfigur. \n\nDie grafische Umsetzung mit den Rissen, aus denen man sich im Kampf hilfreich bedienen kann, ob nun mit Medipacks, Salzen oder Bots, die auf die Feinde schießen, finde ich überhaupt nicht gelungen. \nDiese ständigen Blitze, die die Risse aussenden, lenkten mich immens vom Kampfgeschehen ab bzw. war es stellenweise nicht möglich, den oder die Angreifer überhaupt auszumachen, wenn sich in der Nähe einer dieser Risse befand. \n\nDann kann man im Spiel nicht selbst speichern, sondern es wird immer automatisch gespeichert. Nun ist mein Rechner so schnell, dass ich das Speicher-Symbol oft gar nicht zu sehen bekomme. Daher weiß ich nie, wie viel der Story ich noch einmal spielen muß, wenn ich in den Optionen \"Zum letzten Speicherpunkt zurückkehren\" anklicke. Denn oft muß man sich dann auch ewig lange und langweilige Cutscenes/Gespräche nochmals antun. Zum Würgen!\n\nAuch bin ich ständig an Treppenaufgängen und anderen Ecken im Spiel hängengeblieben. 3 Mal so heftig, dass ich nur neu starten konnte, weil außer Schießen ging gar nichts mehr. \nIst schon toll, wenn man vor ein paar Snipern Deckung sucht, und dann wiederholt zu Tode geschossen wird, weil man wieder mal am Treppenlauf festhängt.\n\nUnd dann gibt es endlos viele Waffentypen im Spiel, aber man kann immer nur zwei mit sich herumtragen. Super, wenn man dann plötzlich den Feindeswellen gegenübersteht und eine Gatling Gun gebraucht hätte, sich vorher aber doch für den Karabiner entschieden hat, weil der im Kampf davor wesentlich praktischer war. Und das alles dann ohne eigene Speicherfunktion. PRIMA!\n\nEs gibt noch hunderte anderer Dinge, die den Spielspaß so extrem runterschrauben, dass ich persönlich das Spiel zum Schluß nur noch gehasst habe. Ich habe es nur zu Ende gespielt, um zu erfahren, wie die Story ausgeht.\n\nDie ist nämlich ganz gut durchdacht, wenngleich sie erst ganz zum Schluß wirklich Fahrt aufnimmt.\n\nAlles in allem kann ich das Spiel für Freunde simpler Ego-Shooter durchaus empfehlen.\n\nAber für Spieler der Bioshock- und System-Shock-Serie ist dieses grafisch wirklich überragend brilliante Spiel anhand seiner aus meiner Sicht total mißlungenen Spielmechanik absolut nicht zu empfehlen.","timestamp_created":1481754638,"timestamp_updated":1481754725,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513321638107299805","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28367528","author":{"steamid":"76561198012662123","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1040,"last_played":1509282706},"language":"german","review":"Ich fand persönlich das Unterwasser-Setting in Rapture besser, trotzdem nen launiger Shooter mit einer sehr verwirrenden, aber guten Story und vielen Oha-Momenten.
