This is a game that defines streamline story telling and gameplay. The game has a silent protaganist who often is reminded of his past, Though i would recomend getting Half Life one if you want to keep track of whats going on. This game is rich with lovable characters who you will care about, you know why, because the facial expressions and body animation are Lost arts! No current game designer has even come close to Valves character building and streamline gameplay. There are no cutscenes (for some reason i've heard people complaine about non exsistant cut scenes.)The graphics were absolutly fine for the time and still are. and the gameplay is brilliant! With fast paced action and great level design you cant go wrong! If i haven't convinced you already,well, your brain dead.

J'avais déjà apprécié le premier volet en jouant à Black Mesa, pour ce qui est de sa difficulté et de son ambiance, du coup j'esperai quelque chose d'encore mieux avec ce nouvel Half life, vu qu'il y a un \"2\" dans le titre !\n\nDonc, par où commencer ?\nEt bien par ce qui m'a déçu, car en générale c'est ce qui saute aux yeux, et puis comme ça on terminera sur les bons points ! Je commence par l'ambiance: J'avais aimé l'ambiance du premier (souterrain, centrale nucléaire, laboratoire), mais j'ai eu du mal à accrocher à l'ambiance de celui-ci :/ les décors \"Europe de l'Est\" c'est surement mieux adaptés à des jeux styles STALKER ou metro. J'aurais préféré un design plus futuriste, mais ce n'est que mon avis et non un défaut du jeu.\nLe jeu est plus facile que je l'espérais, il n'y a plus beaucoup de séquence de recherche ou de plateforme assez hardu qu'on retrouvait dans le premier, séquences à s'arracher les cheveux (quand même !) mais qui offrent une grande satisfaction une fois réussie. Ici les gunfights sont plus mis en avant, ainsi que les conduites de véhicules, qui là encore de mon avis ne sont pas si passionnantes ^^'\nNéamoins, le jeu est bon !\nOui il l'ait, je l'ai commencé en 2013, alors qu'il n'est sorti qu'en 2004 et je peux vous dire qu'il offre de très belles mises en scène malgré son âge. C'était un plaisir de voir la Gestapo débouler dans les appartements des citoyens, de voir les \"Striders\" en action, ainsi que les véhicules aériens ennemis.\nDe plus on a un gameplay intelligent, il est varié et dynamique; Entre les differents types d'ennemis, les differents armes à dispositions et comment le level design qui combine certains de ces éléments en particulier, on a de quoi se satisfaire pleinement ! Le jeu est varié, et offre une expérience compléte pour tous passionnés de FPS.\nEnfin, en ce qui concerne le scénario, il ne m'a pas vraiment marqué, c'est du classique ne vous attendez pas à grand chose de ce côté là;\n\nPour finir, j'ai dis ne pas avoir aimé l'ambiance générale du jeu, mais néamoins mansion spéciale à l'ambiance du dernier niveau

A few weeks ago, after downloading steam on a new computer, I was able to boost the graphics to the highest (which isn't too difficult) and still getting high frame rates. More than that, I weirdly enjoyed the game a whole bunch. I think it comes from a place of being a more mature player and one that played the game without any hype knowing that I didn't really like it some years ago...\n\nSo yeah, it's a crazy good game that I have not yet finished but know that I want to play it again when I am done.","timestamp_created":1388109977,"timestamp_updated":1388109977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8320307","author":{"steamid":"76561198033942409","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1092,"last_played":1531349106},"language":"czech","review":"Super gameska! :)","timestamp_created":1388109325,"timestamp_updated":1388109325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8320129","author":{"steamid":"76561198083481216","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1403741676},"language":"spanish","review":"to op","timestamp_created":1388108850,"timestamp_updated":1388108850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtYTvmMMCccjeHw=="}
