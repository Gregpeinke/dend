Prior to Half-Life’s release, the genre was dominated by the id Software franchises Doom and Quake, with the games that they inspired carving out the remainder of the market share. Story in video games was often seen as unimportant or unnecessary past the base justification of the player’s actions. Half-life changed the landscape of video games as a whole with its focus on introducing abundant atmosphere, an engaging story, and tactical depth to the pre-established expectations of first person shooters at the time.\n\n\tHalf-Life's intent to immerse the player in a living world is apparent from the opening scene of the game. The player avatar, a scientist working for the Black Mesa Research Facility who we later learn is named Gordan Freeman, rides a tram system from his dormitory to his place of work. As the ride progresses, we see evidence of the laissez faire attitude of the Black Mesa administration to the safety procedures practiced onsite. An automatic announcement system blairs over the speakers on the tram, warning personnel to report any suspected exposure to radiation as the monorail rides over a lake of radioactive waste. Ambient drones echo in the player’s ears as they cross over deep underground pits with no visible bottom. Researchers in the labs are terse and uninterested in conversation while analyzing formulas on whiteboards or inputting data into spreadsheets. This tense, foreboding atmosphere only grows heavier throughout the game, making the player feel like a rat trapped without hope of escape, tone weighing down on them like all the tons of rock overhead.\n\n\tSuch an atmosphere lends itself well to the story of the game. Gordon is scheduled for a test on anomalous materials and suits up in the now iconic Hazardous Environments Suit featured on the boxart. Once protected, he travels to the test site where equipment malfunctions have been creating minor disturbances all day. Despite these malfunctions, the site administrator has been promised results and the test goes on without delay. This results in an apocalyptic disaster called a Resonance Cascade that weakens the barrier between our reality and the borderworld Xen, unleashing alien monstrosities that quickly begin slaughtering the staff. Immediately after awakening from the injuries he sustained during the test, Gordan’s only goal becomes escape from the facility. He hears word that the military has arrived and is the only chance of escape, but this is a cruel lie. The military is here to cover up the experiments being done at Black Mesa and kill employees on sight. Even after he reaches the surface, it is a wartorn hellscape with bombings leaving Black Mesa a pock-marked wasteland. He is forced back underground where it soon becomes clear that if the Resonance Cascade is not stopped, there will be no world left to escape to. The story continues on unweakened until the game ends with a climactic choice. This choice gives no true answers, leaving the player hungry for more knowledge about the Black Mesa Incident. While intriguing and satisfying taken as a solo experience, this ending also does an excellent job generating interest for a Half-Life 2.\n\n\tOf course, such a story would be of no consequence if Half-Life’s gameplay was poor. Luckily, it inherited the fluid control of Quake, whose idTech 2 engine had been modified to produce Half-Life’s own GoldSrc. The movement in the game is buttery smooth and delicate, with the notable exception of ladder climbing. Airstrafes and bunnyhops are also present in the game for those with interest in advanced movement techniques. The gunplay is solid and boasts a wide selection of weapons with unique uses. From the group damaging grenade to the close range shotgun to the point-and-click tau cannon. In addition, encounters are built to be asymmetric and unique, meaning that very few firefights in the game feel similar. The difficulty level does not result in very many game overs, but continuously deprives the player of resources and keeps them on edge. Taken together, this weapon variety, encounter design, and difficulty level make for a tactical depth absent in many of today’s big releases, let alone Half-Life’s contemporaries.\n\n\tHalf-Life not only revolutionized the First Person Shooter genre, but can be seen as popularizing the idea that action games should have just as good a story as any adventure game. In the following years, other games agreeing with Half-life’s storytelling philosophy would come along to critical and commercial success, such as Halo, Gears of War, and Uncharted. The idea that good gameplay and good story were mutually exclusive was debunked by Half-life’s immense success and lasting legacy.\n\n\tThe game holds up to this day and I strongly recommend anyone interested in first person shooters buy and play it.","timestamp_created":1399503261,"timestamp_updated":1622884013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10042039","author":{"steamid":"76561198059918386","num_games_owned":501,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1400375839},"language":"english","review":"buy it half life","timestamp_created":1399449512,"timestamp_updated":1399449512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10038310","author":{"steamid":"76561198013412178","num_games_owned":227,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":381,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1397578350},"language":"english","review":"The super duper famous Half Life 1! \nIn my opinion, the Half Life series is overrated, but it sure was fun... until I realized I could just open the console and load the final map, change gravity and friction, just like in Counter Strike (which is based on Half Life).\nThe game is fast paced if you bunny hop and it has awesome guns. 9/10 if you like classic games.\nI'd pay the full price on Steam, but a sale would save you some bucks as well.","timestamp_created":1399408228,"timestamp_updated":1399408228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499291807413101196","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10030918","author":{"steamid":"76561198054980054","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":25184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15515,"last_played":1515865159},"language":"french","review":"(T)","timestamp_created":1399330359,"timestamp_updated":1399330359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512953341007232666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10029722","author":{"steamid":"76561198121313892","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":494,"last_played":1401473631},"language":"english","review":"Looking back on Half-Life, many believe it to be some sort of gaming Holy Grail. It was influential in shaping the first person shooter genre; taking bold steps in terms of level design, gameplay mechanics and dynamic storytelling. \n\nTaking the role of theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman, you are tasked with making it out of the Black Mesa research facility when you and your colleagues accidentally unleash an alien invasion. The enemies you encounter are numerous and varied; from the slow but eerie alien headcrabs to the ruthless government agents who are sent in to keep the situation contained. The action takes you from claustrophobic laboratories to large open environments. Each encounter feels fresh and exciting and the pacing is perfect: with large scale battles broken up with exploration. \n\nWith not cutscenes and limited interaction with characters who are not hostile the story is delivered non-invasively through details in the environment. For players who are keen on rich characterisation and story driven epics they may feel disappointed, especially when comparing Half-Life to its sequels. However, for players who enjoy uninterrupted shooting sprees, Half-Life will be a pleasant addition to their library, even though most first person shooter fans will have played it already.\n\nBy contemporary standards Half-Life may seem rudimentary however the robust gameplay mechanics, fun gunplay and unique setting still make it a fun experience and a must have for any first person shooter fan.","timestamp_created":1399319416,"timestamp_updated":1399319416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10027166","author":{"steamid":"76561198033728720","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":42019,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35631,"last_played":1429803922},"language":"french","review":"il est bien je prend du plaisir a le jouer .","timestamp_created":1399300029,"timestamp_updated":1399300029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10016076","author":{"steamid":"76561198118136271","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1035,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":108,"last_played":1642420271},"language":"russian","review":"Великая игра!","timestamp_created":1399203181,"timestamp_updated":1399203181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10002546","author":{"steamid":"76561198109764697","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2112,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1787,"last_played":1571460453},"language":"english","review":"nothing ventured, nothing gained","timestamp_created":1399080226,"timestamp_updated":1605518632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10002064","author":{"steamid":"76561198020930052","num_games_owned":471,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":6501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6414,"last_played":1447180563},"language":"english","review":"It was very interesting to play a game that had inspired so much. I honestly enjoyed this game. Ignoring the style of graphics that were common for the time period that this game came out, it ran quite well. There were a few loading problems when the loading screens came up as I progressed through the game. It was a suprisingly long game, which I enjoyed. It had a good amount of puzzles and was challenging in various ways, although it is quite simple to grasp the concept and controls. The controls were simple and easy to use. It was pretty simple to play and I progressed through the game with little trouble. The storyline was interesting and captures attention well.
