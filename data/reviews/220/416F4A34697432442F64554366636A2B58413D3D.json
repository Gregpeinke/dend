August 2nd, 2007, my father got me my very own steam account, and this game, my first game, MY VERY OWN GAME! It was amazing to me, I remember fearing for my life, crying as the civil protection was \"clearing\" the apartments, or when I first encounter Alyx Vance, Barney, Doctor Kliner, and his pet head crab, Lamar. Or when I first saw the Air Boat, and realizing that something epic will come, and it did, yah, an air boat is cool, BUT WHAT ABOUT A UPGRADE THAT WOULD MAKE ME AND THE HUNTER CHOPER EQUALS, AND ABLE TO FIGHT IT ON! Later after that, I fought with the metallic flying beast, and we both knew only one of us would survive to tell the tale. I remember when I first met D0G, a robotic canine, well, similar, but more then just a yaye-high pet. Then I grew of anger as the combine destroyed everything that was of Black Mesa East. I had to go to Ravenholm, a place that even my most cherished companion, Alyx, feared and avoided to look towards that direction, I wondered why this was the case. But I had to put my friends fears of that pace aside, and march in, and continue my journey towards the end goal. As I slowly put my foot on the old, and ruined grass, I see death, despair, and danger. I feared Ravenholm a lot, I guess you could say, it was too much for me. Ever since, I never escaped Ravenholm...\n\nBut then, in the summer of 2012, I returned to Half-Life 2, played through it again, and looked towards that dreaded place as Alyx was explaining about it, before the combine attack. I knew I had to finish Half-Life! And so, I got a fucking huge 2 L bottle of Coca Cola, and journeyed through that place, I remember my hart beating as those Fast Zombies were clawing at me, and waiting for that small platform to carry me away from danger. Then me, and a creepy religious man with a double barrel shotgun walked through the graveyard, and at that last moment, he sacrificed himself for ME! I remember my shocked mind as he ran through fire, laughing and killing the zombies. I turned towards the exit, and ran without looking back. I remember seeing the sun again, and never felt the same ever again. I remember seeing the Jeep and was shocked, first an Air boat, now a Jeep with, a, umm, laser gun, oohhh boy, the looks were deceiving, I then killed my first gunship, and crossed the large, shaking bridge, and avoiding the train as it did its routine...\n\nOh yah, then the sand traps, I ran right through that, then the prison, boy, I remember laughing as I saw the antlions take down combine and/or the turrets, and seeing how loyal they were to me, this was just the beginning, then me and Alyx teleport in the FUTURE, well more like a week, but then all of humanity decided to start an uprising due to the signal after teleporting from the citadel. Then I fought lots of striders, soldiers, CP's, gunships, till I got to the citadel. That first moment where intense music started right as I exit a sewage pipe, to see the citadel slowly mining into the planet, I had to stop them, and so I did, with the help of the combine and their fucked up anti-weapon device, they modified my anti-gravity gun, to grab soldiers, and also, have an higher carnage. And I fought with Breen, destroyed the citadel, and saw the Gman again, this all felt amazing ,the carnage, the intense finally, and the perfect cliff hanger for the next 2 episodes, that I got later...","timestamp_created":1469186418,"timestamp_updated":1469186418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24457159","author":{"steamid":"76561198098936543","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":617,"last_played":1585150030},"language":"french","review":"Super jeu.

Indeed, Half-Life 2 is the franchise grown up, and proving that it still has legitimacy in todays gaming world.\n\nThe story of Half-Life 2 is a bit of a roller coaster in that there are great moments of narrative flow and others where you are left scratching your head a bit thinking \"why did they put that in there?\".  But saying that, there are plenty of ups to the few downs.  The story is overall strong and immersive with a few deviations that help create a vibrant lore.\n\nThe game mechanics are obviously much smoother, and well structured.  By todays standards, they stand up.  There are some nice features with the engine that work well.  The feel of the game when using certain weapons and the ability to manipulate some aspects of the environment help the gameplay support the story.  There are still a few things that don't seem right, such as no hands on steering wheels, being able to climb a ladder whilst simulatenously reloading or firing a heavy weapon, getting caught on obstacles, and the clumsy and altogether painful squads that do 2 things - 1) Die over and over, and 2) Get in your way when you need to do a run and gun (or often a grenade lob and duck).  The squad could definitely have used some more commands other than point and press C to have them run uselessly a couple feet before returning to interfere.\n\nThe weapons pretty much were a joy to use, especially the Pulse Rifle and the SMG.  No alien weapons to use in this game, other than the Antlion Pheropods, and this was the clumsiest weapon.  A few odd decisions were made with some of the weapons though, especially the .357 Magnum revolver.  Having a total ammo store of 18 rounds resulted in this being an often unused weapon.  Surely, Gordon could carry more than 18 bullets for this gun, considering the number he could carry for some of the others like the 9mm with a total ammo store of 168.  I'm sure it was for a balance purpose, but only being able to carry 18 rounds felt silly and frivolous.  The magnum went from being a mainstay weapon of the original series to a bit of a joke weapon in my mind.\n\nOf the gameplay, I'm so happy that they decided to move away from the platform styled approach.  Moving across impossible terrain features and engineering in the original games made it feel like a caricature of a game.  Those titles didn't know if they were a shooter, narrative or platformer, often falling more towards the latter.  This game for the most part does away with that completely.  There are still a few gameplay components that aren't well thought out, mainly by being overly long and taking something novel and at first fun, and making it tedius - namely riding the airboat, and crossing the sand without touching it.  Both were fun at first, but quickly devolved into just hoping that it would soon be over, but nope - there was more and more of it.  Still, those didn't detract too much from the game as a whole.\n\nThe passage of time in the game, like in the first one though, still seems odd.  The immersion of that point is lost easily with the change from night to day as you are constantly on the move, never seeming to rest.... Jack Bauer, eat your heart out.\n\nOverall, Half-Life 2 was and still is a great game, and my concerns with the game are more exagerated nitpicks than hangups.\n\n4.5/5","timestamp_created":1469107379,"timestamp_updated":1469107379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576086938381195068","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24441647","author":{"steamid":"76561198290932922","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1578242152},"language":"russian","review":"Решил на новом аккаунте купить The Orange Box в который входит Half - Life 2, Half - Life 2 Episod One, Half - Life 2 Episod Two и другие...
