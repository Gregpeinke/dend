I've never seen a sequal so enhanced and great. Fucking beautiful visuals, Detailed Multiplayer, and a great Story, you don't need no damn review to make your choice on buying this game. But incase you like getting to know your games before you play them, well here's my review. Portal 2 continues some huge ass time distance in the future. Aperature Science is completely destroyed and useless. You still play Chell, who is undeniably, one of the most boring Valve characters, but I won't go into depth with that. Gameplay has remained the same, except for the fact that they've added a new mechanic called Gels! There are different kinds of Gels to allow you to do different things in your world. New chamber mechanics have also been added, but are not that important to mention. The Multiplayer in this game is an entirely co-operative game, another Story if you will. But it's easy way of communicating with the player without having to use a mic is very very satisfying. The Workshop Custom Chambers work differently. Normally in a Source game, you'd have to download Source SDK, create your mod/map/CSGO skin, then publish it like that. In Portal 2, Valve did something different. The map maker is in the game, AND ITS FUCKING AMAZING AND EASY TO USE. ANYBODY can make a custom chamber, ANYBODY! My only concerns with this game is that the Story is way too Story-driven. I played the first Portal with pure enjoyment because it was mostly quiet and easy to think in. Yeah, there was a story and dialoge. But since it didn't have as much dialoge as Portal 2, the game became quiet very easily and made it more of a thinking ground, which helped a lot. In Portal 2, everybody is speaking everywhere, and it can get very annoying when trying to focus on a chamber.\n\nOverall, this game is a damn good game and you should already have it in your library and installed.","timestamp_created":1404541686,"timestamp_updated":1404541686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11079057","author":{"steamid":"76561198073497973","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":3954,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":926,"last_played":1508730717},"language":"english","review":"I LOVE THIS GAME.

I enjoyed the game very much, but personally didn't (in general) like some of the faster paced reaction bits or having to place Portals while upside down and backwards (though they weren't going to hard on that). [i]Portal[/i] had about 70% logic and 30% reaction puzzles aka [i]Test Chambers[/i]. Only downturn was, that the (intentionally) grey and sterile environment kept the girls away from playing.\n\nSo, this game adds some Cockney speaking companion, has the old fun bits, remains solid in the core and adds really wonderful new gimmicks. All of them are lovely, but the [i]Gels[/i] \"stick\" out for me, because they open up incredible possibilities. Apart from the gels, the game is in general more colourful than its predecessor since the story after the end of [i]Portal[/i] allows that. \nNow it is about 80-90% logic puzzles which are [b]not[/b] just recycled old ideas. To the contrary, the game hasn't really maxed out the sheer endless options and this is there the community comes in.\nThis is about one of the biggest games ever, since there are hundreds of free community test chambers to download and easily to integrate which makes the game extremely valuable - not only on sale!\nSadly, there are more of these factory/outdoor debris maps, where most effort remains simply looking for the portable surface. \nThe icing on the cake is the Co-Op Multiplayer, which should be really part of any good workplace team building effort. This hypes the game to a complete new level. [i]Portal 2[/i] reassures the community that [i]Valve[/i] stands for witty quality games.\nHighly recommend this game; don't see anything worse compared to [i]Portal[/i] and most of it better. You don't need to play the first part, but it helps to enjoy some comments even the better.","timestamp_created":1404518625,"timestamp_updated":1404520705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.585479676723480225","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11076536","author":{"steamid":"76561198092499872","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":859,"last_played":1455832306},"language":"english","review":"Kicked my friend in his robot balls 10/10","timestamp_created":1404518294,"timestamp_updated":1404518294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11075115","author":{"steamid":"76561198108164433","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6,"playtime_at_review":569,"last_played":1659767405},"language":"english","review":"THis game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1404510982,"timestamp_updated":1404510982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11075044","author":{"steamid":"76561198026729465","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":88,"last_played":1633286343},"language":"german","review":"Mahct richtig Spaß und rätsel werden nah jeder runde kniffliger.\nAuch der Humor des Spieles ist köstlich.\nEInziges Manko:\nnach jedem Level kadet es. und auf dauer nervt es","timestamp_created":1404510691,"timestamp_updated":1404510691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11075019","author":{"steamid":"76561197995712954","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":842,"last_played":1643138870},"language":"polish","review":"Portal ma to coś w sobie, co trudno opisać.

Ich hoffe, dass ein Nachfolger kommt, denn diese Reihe verdient es wirklich. Sollte ich dieses Spiel nun bewerten würde ich neun von zehn Punkten geben, denn obwohl das Spiel schön an die Story des ersten Teils anknüpft und man durch lustige Dialoge wirklich gut unterhalten wird, ist es leider einfach zu kurz.
