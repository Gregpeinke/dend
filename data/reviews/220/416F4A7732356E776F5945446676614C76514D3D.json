Calling this game great is almost criminal because of how fun this game is.  Half-Life 1 may have been one of the first games that was enjoyable instead of just being a way to kill time but this game had me wearing a stupid grin almost the entire time.  The way you play with the laws of physics makes you feel like a god but all that is stripped away and replaced with pure horror as a hoard of zombies creeps closer. you are always at the perfect amount of ammo where you need to be careful when you shoot but you aren't completely hopeless, the monsters look, feel and especially sound like what waits in the depths of hell has finally found a way to drag you in.  Every gun feels good and is introduced at the perfect time to use, each enemy is just the right amount of challenging and, it makes you think in ways that have you appreciate human ingenuity.  The story is even better than HL 1 and the characters are all fun and interesting.  The gameplay never gets old, it's the perfect amount of challenge, the story is amazing the characters are super fun, the mood and tone are perfect whether that be comedic or terrifying, it looks phenomenal, and the sound design is just about perfect.

Still, Half-Life 2 is no \"ordinary\" game. Even before it's release, it was the most talked about, and surely most anticipated game up till then. Back in 2004, Valve was still primarily a game-developer, Steam had only just been launched in order to streamline the updating-process for the Valve-games (quite an original and ground-breaking idea since back in those day patching one's game could easily turn into a hazardous adventure). Immediately after its release, Half-Life 2 was loaded with critical praise, and almost instantly rose to the top of all lists defining the best games ever. And even today, after ten years, it still tops a lot of those lists.\n\nI played it for the first time only five years ago, messing around with the original Half-Life up till then. Five years ago, the game struck me as still very good-looking and a blast to play, even being five years old. Quite recently I picked it up again, to be honest in the first place to get some of the achievements I had missed during my first play-through (I only got really interested in the Steam achievements this year). To my surprise, the game immediately got back under my skin, so I decided to give it another play-through, and I enjoyed it immensely, hence this review.\n\nOf course the Source Engine shows its age: up-close textures get quite blurry, but the wider vistas are still amazingly \"alife\", and the colours and general atmosphere are still exciting. The physics engine - a novelty back then - now surely feels outdated, even crappy, but playing around with the famous \"gravity gun\" makes more than up for this, and surely has its funny moments. But in every other respect, this game is a classic and a masterpiece in the true sense of the word. The story is so convincingly told, that I felt myself beeing \"Doctor Freeman\" again, already during the first chapter (which introduces the gameworld in a very ingenious way which has not been surpassed ever since). The level-design is simply awesome. Compared to modern-day shooters, the interface and the amount of information about the surroundings you get as a player, are minimal. There is no minimap, there are no waypoints, there is no compass, there is no large-scale map. And still, I never ever got lost, thanks to the downright genial way the levels are designed. Still, the amount of freedom you get is great: there are tons of hidden places, byways, or larger spaces to explore, besides the more traditional corridors, but they always manage to lead you in a logical way. This game offers the classic examples on how levels can be optimally designed.\n\nSound, too, is amazing: there is not much in-game music, but when it appears (mostly in the action-packed scenes), it really delivers to the full. Sounds from the guns, NPC's and ambient sounds are extremely convincing. But what still shines most of all is the actual gameplay and the way this games is \"paced\". Sneaky, almost stealth-like scenes alternate with extremely violent action-moments, in a very, very clever way, only to be alternated with puzzles and other moments where thinking is required. The choice of the right gun at the right time is essential, and very rewarding. There is a lot of interaction with other characters, but never up till the point where this gets tedious. And best of all: there are countless moments of surprise, when the story takes a turn for the unexpected. So, yes, this is still a classic, and yes, it's still up there among the best games ever (although I personally would grant it a top-five place or so, the top-three spots taken by more recent \"classics\").\n\nFor my scorings, I give them as I conceived the game during my actual playthrough, so not taking into account it's a eighteen year old game.\n\nGameplay: 27/30 (there are some frustrating puzzles and some weird moments with the gravity-gun but everything else is sheer genius)\nGrahics: 15/20 (the outer vistas are great, the rest is showing its age)\nSound: 9/10\nLongelivety: 8/10 (no multiplayer, but the game has tons of singleplayer gameplay)\nSteam integration: 10/10 (it comes with trading cards and 33 achievements, most of which really add something to game, if only to explore different ways to achieve things - the way achievements should work imo)\nTechnical: 9/10 (runs very smoothly and I got no crashes, but sometimes hangs for a couple of seconds on loading screens)\nPersonal appreciation: 10/10\n\nOverall: 88/100","timestamp_created":1654876940,"timestamp_updated":1654877080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116771975","author":{"steamid":"76561199263835370","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":44,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1659755181},"language":"brazilian","review":"simplesmente uma obra prima","timestamp_created":1654876165,"timestamp_updated":1654876165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116769433","author":{"steamid":"76561198823326776","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":612,"last_played":1654474131},"language":"spanish","review":"ayuda\n","timestamp_created":1654872463,"timestamp_updated":1654872463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116766756","author":{"steamid":"76561199241902344","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":334,"last_played":1655464869},"language":"english","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1654868205,"timestamp_updated":1654868205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116760540","author":{"steamid":"76561198067643043","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1406,"last_played":1655894088},"language":"english","review":"I look forward to a sequel","timestamp_created":1654856269,"timestamp_updated":1654856269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116759859","author":{"steamid":"76561197962039430","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":118,"last_played":1654954890},"language":"english","review":"Legend never die.","timestamp_created":1654854850,"timestamp_updated":1654854850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":34,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.73583066463470459","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116759179","author":{"steamid":"76561198852495866","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":762,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":433,"last_played":1654887501},"language":"english","review":"SHoosheeeeeeeeeeesh!!","timestamp_created":1654853305,"timestamp_updated":1654853305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116758988","author":{"steamid":"76561199148790454","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":927,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":927,"last_played":1656155007},"language":"russian","review":"Это не будет обзором игры.

(Профиль>Настройки>Счёт по умолчанию>Сменить). И создаём новый счёт в тенге (валюта Казахстана), и делаем его основным счётом по умолчанию.\nТеперь перевод между счетами - рубли в тенге. Так как рубль держится на одной лишь гречке и некромантии то точные формулы сколько вам надо рублей для перевода в тенге я сказать не смогу, на данный момент 1 рубль = 4,60 тенге. Так же учитываем комиссии во время конвертации валют, перевода с киви в стим и конвертации валюты внутри стима, так что опытным путём сами скоро разберёмся.\nИ так, мы пополнили наш счёт некой суммой тенге, так как её теперь перевести в стим, ведь внутри стим нельзя пополнять с киви?! Ну работает с обратной стороны, из киви в стим переводы работают. Да абсурд, но и нет.\nНа сайте Qiwi заходим раздел \"Платежи\" и ищем раздел \"Игры\", и жмём \"Все игры\", теперь выбираем \"Steam (Казахстан)\" иии вуаля, вводим наш Steam логин, наш счёт KZT (должен быть по умолчанию) и вводим сумму в тенге, которую мы расcчитали для той или иной игры ну и Steam при конвертации заберёт комиссию, ибо придёт на кошелёк в долларах и переведётся в рубли (у меня было так), и жмём оплатить и подтверждаем платёж.\nТеперь вы имеете на своём Steam кошельке деньги и можете купить игры, DLC, подписки, совершать внутриигровые покупки и покупать вещи на ТП. Да, думаю совершив это вы заметите, что заплатили в рублях куда больше, чем ожидали, комиссия там, сям, конвертация-хренвертация и т.д, но учитывая, что нам порезали почти все варианты оплаты и пополнения, это пока один из доступных вариантов, конечно можно вроде ещё юзать PayPal, но вроде сним тоже уже проблемы есть (не знаю точно).\nНадеюсь я кому то помог, берегите себя и т.д...

продовження легендарної гри. Друга частина переносить нас приблизно на 20 років уперед після подій у \"Black Mesa\" і ставить перед Гордоном Фріменом нелегке завдання звільнити людство від окупації позаземною цивілізацією, що підкорила собі вже всю Землю на момент початку гри. \nВзагалі, це не дуже правильно - прискіпливо оцінювати настільки давні ігри. Бо ж тоді і потужності були інші, і сам підхід до геймдизайну був інакшим. Але все ж я поділюсь своїми враженнями\n\n[h1]Плюси:[/h1]\nОтже, що нового пропонує нам Half-Life 2 і за що гру однозначно можна похвалити?:\n- На своєму шляху Фрімен раз за разом зустрічатиме нові варіації зомбаків, хедкрабів, велетенських членистоногих членистоногими, а також боротися зі зразками позаземної військової техніки.\n- Десь так з третьої третини гри нам на поміч дадуть загін повстанців, які рушатимуть за Гордоном, або слухняно утримуватимуть позицію за нашим наказом. Цікаво, що час від часу медик загону буде давати головному герою невелику аптечку, якщо у тому буде потреба\n- В декількох місіях дозволять покерувати чимось на зразок моторного човна, чи баггі з кулеметом, на якому ми завзято маневруватимемо  і розстрілюватимемо супостатів\n- Звісно ж, декілька нових видів зброї, зокрема автомат позаземних бійців.\n- Граві-пушка!! Я вирішив її винести в окремий пункт, бо це унікальне пристосування, яке дозволить піднімати і переміщувати невеликі предмети і таким чином проходити через перешкоди чи застосовувати їх у бою. А під кінець гри стає сама по собі грізною зброєю.\n\n[h1]Однак:[/h1] \nЄ дещо, що мене неприємно здивувало, а саме одноманітність локацій та їх дизайн. Внутрішнє оздоблення приміщень Цитаделі, цієї бази позаземних загарбників виглядає....доволі вбого, як на мене. І річ тут навіть не в графіці, ні, аж ніяк. Просто мало деталей. Скупі голі стіни, мінімум декоративних елементів, все це навіює якусь нудьгу. Плюс до всього хотілося б більшого різноманіття локацій. В основному бідолаха Гордон блукатиме міськими вуличками, бігатиме посеред каміння та піску на окраїні міста, чи досліджуватиме темну та нудну ворожу Цитадель. Ех, дуже не вистачає чогось на зразок позаземного Зену.\nНу і, як на мене, звук від пострілів зброї занадто якийсь різкий і неприємний.\nШкода, що друга частина дещо коротша за першу(\n\nЩо ж, загалом, це просто хороша гра, хороше продовження серії яке в багатьох викличе сльозу ностальгії, і яке цілком заслужено у свій час отримало любов гравців.","timestamp_created":1654803520,"timestamp_updated":1654991838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116735789","author":{"steamid":"76561198346884191","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1583,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1556,"last_played":1656217495},"language":"english","review":"it's like half life but 2","timestamp_created":1654803355,"timestamp_updated":1656565824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116733022","author":{"steamid":"76561197968806940","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3096,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3096,"last_played":1654205016},"language":"english","review":"The Sequel to One of The BEST GAMES EVER MADE!!!!","timestamp_created":1654799220,"timestamp_updated":1654799220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116729518","author":{"steamid":"76561198285133524","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":142,"last_played":1658141051},"language":"russian","review":"советую пройти крутая игра","timestamp_created":1654793929,"timestamp_updated":1654793929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116728206","author":{"steamid":"76561198985594070","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1284,"last_played":1654797409},"language":"polish","review":"7.5/10 fajna","timestamp_created":1654791788,"timestamp_updated":1654791788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116724156","author":{"steamid":"76561198076583941","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":863,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":863,"last_played":1640184865},"language":"russian","review":"Вторая часть шедевра","timestamp_created":1654785620,"timestamp_updated":1654785620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561752974987030029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116723585","author":{"steamid":"76561198259235292","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1214,"last_played":1654234851},"language":"tchinese","review":"關卡設計比較讓人困惑以外沒什麼可挑剔的","timestamp_created":1654784751,"timestamp_updated":1654784751,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116721405","author":{"steamid":"76561198057500834","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":531,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":531,"last_played":1654768395},"language":"hungarian","review":"10/8 Már a mai szemmel nézve!
