Medio tarde, ya que allá por el 2007 yo solo tenía 13 años y no me interesaban este tipo de juegos. Obviamente, no sabía lo que me estaba perdiendo. Recién ahora, tras escuchar varios elogios decidí probarlo. Realmente es un juego atrapante, su humor negro es sublime. Destaco también el doblaje, muy bien adaptado a nuestra benévola y a la vez siniestra anfitriona.\nCon respecto a la historia, parece simple: Nos despertamos dentro de una pequeña habitación de cristal en Aperture Science, los rivales directos de Black Mesa, que al igual que estos últimos, también experimentan con portales. No sabemos qué hacer, ni cómo nos llamamos, tras unos segundos comienza a hablarnos nuestra misteriosa anfitriona... Y ahí comienza nuestra aventura. Con el paso del tiempo nos iremos dando cuenta de que hay algo que \"no concuerda\" y... dejo de contar y se los dejo a ustedes.\nLa único que le critico es que es demasiado corto, una persona inteligente lo termina en menos de 2 horas. Sin embargo, el juego es rejugable con sus desafíos, con sus niveles de dificultad, para los que les gusta exprimir el juego y sacarle todos los logros y también con la curiosidad (en mi caso) de jugarlo de nuevo con las voces en inglés, ya que la interpretación en dicho idioma recibió muchísimos elogios.\nCon respecto al plano técnico:\nGráficos: Teniendo en cuenta la época de realización del juego, los gráficos son excelentes e incluso en la actualidad parecen muy bien logrados.\nSonido: Detallado y claro, las voces claras y los efectos excelentes. La banda sonora bien adaptada y excelente para crear ambiente.\nInnovación: Muchísima, no es un juego cualquiera, nada de generalidades.\nY por último quiero hacer una mención especial a los créditos (si, lo que sigue al terminar un juego y que todos se saltan) realmente me pareció \"diferente\" y a la vez simpático, no digo más.\nEn conclusión: Juego buenísimo, recomendado al 100%.

Sollte vermutlich später einmal in die Spielegeschichte eingehen, denn soviel Spaß haben Physik und (leicht wahnsinnige) Computergegner noch nie gemacht. Gehört nach dem ersten Mal durchspielen jetzt zu meinen Lieblingsspielen und wird nun ein zweites mal gezockt - mit Kommentaren der Entwickler. Danach Portal 2, was ja noch besser sein soll.\nHilft auf jeden Fall Reaktionen zu verbessern und kostet wenig Geld für mindestens 2 Stunden Spaß - teilweise ein wenig undurchsichtig was jetzt genau gemacht werden soll, erklärt sich aber nach 5 Minuten von selbst. Am besten in Englisch spielen (GlaDos klingt dann einfach besser) - meinetwegen mit deutschen Untertiteln. Damit hört man den beißenden Unterton besser und versteht ihn trotzdem noch.\nIch bin dann mal weg - es nochmal spielen.\n","timestamp_created":1419191524,"timestamp_updated":1419191524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13505482","author":{"steamid":"76561198123209617","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":267,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":178,"last_played":1422128602},"language":"english","review":"You owe me a cake.","timestamp_created":1419189484,"timestamp_updated":1419189484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13504816","author":{"steamid":"76561198145980479","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":358,"last_played":1419676990},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego es perfecto:\n\nMúsica:10/10 tranquila, aunque no suena muchas veces, pero le pega :D\n\nHistoria:10/10 Entre las veces que Glados decía cosas ridículas de forma tan normal y todos los lugares con mensages raros, está perfecto, aunque no sepamos mucho a menos que juguemos su secuela\n\nFísica y Mecánica:10/10 Portales??
