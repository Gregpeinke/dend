Игра вышла в 2001 году. Игра предлагает самостоятельный сюжет, дополняющий и расширяющий вселенную игр Half-Life, но c точки зрения другого персонажа - охранника «Чёрной Мезы» Барни Калхуна, друга Гордона Фримена.\n\n[h1][b]Сюжет[/b][/h1]\n\nГлавным героем является охранник «Чёрной Мезы» Барни Калхун. Является другом Гордона Фримена (их дружба более описана во второй части Half-Life). Когда начался Инцидент, главной задачей нашего героя стало спасти некоторых учёных и сбежать с Черной Мезы. Барни не такой динамичный персонаж как Гордон или Шепард, он простой работяга, который хочет выбраться из ада и не особо попадает в гущу событии. Даже G-man попадается на глаза Барни всего один раз так, как G-man заинтересован больше Фримену и Шепарду. Фримена мы видим тоже пару раз, а про Шепарда только про него слух. Тут дальше нечего говорить.\n\n[h1][b]Графика и звук[/b][/h1]\n\nВсё такой же, что и в первой Half-Life и в Opposing Force\n\n[h1][b]Геймплей[/b][/h1]\n\nВсё такой же, что и в первой Half-Life, и ничего нового.

We are in the midst of crisis. Nico Nico Doga is at war against a far reaching storm of disturbance and of leash. Nico Nico's economy is badly weakened, a consequence of carelessness and irresponsibility of the part of management, but also on the collective failure to make hard choices and prepare for a new, mad age. Today, I say to you that the challenge is real, they are serious, and there are many. They will not be easily met or in a short span of time, but know that at Nico Nico, they will be met. In reaffirming the greatness of our site, we understand that greatness is never given, our journey has never been one of shortcuts. It has not been for the path, for the feint hearted, or seek only the fleshly pleasures. Rather, it has been the risk takers, the wasted genie, the creators of mad things. For us, they toiled in sweatshops, endured the lash of the spanking, time and time again. These men struggled and sacrificed so that we might LIVE BETTER. We remain the most powerful sight on the Internet and minds are no less inventive and services were no less needed, that they were last week, or yesterday, or the day before the day after tomorrow. Starting today, we must pull up our pants, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking Nico Nico Doga. Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest that out service system cannot tolerate to many movies. There memories are short, for they have forgotten what Nico Nico already has done, what free men can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose. And so, to all of the people that are watching this video, from the grandest cities to the small villages where Exile was born, know that Nico Nico is a friend of every man who seeks a future of love and peace. Now we will begin to leave authorized common materials to Nico Nico people and forge a hard, earned piece in this mad world. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility. This is the price and the promise of Nico nicommon's citizenship. Nico Nico Doga in the face of are common dangers in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words: ASS WE CAN. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested by doss attacks, and refused by Youtube, we did not turn back, nor did we falter. And we were carried forth that the great gift of freedom be delivered and is safely to future generations. Thank You. God Bless. And God Bless Nico Nico Doga.","timestamp_created":1644544516,"timestamp_updated":1644544516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109950213","author":{"steamid":"76561199015984861","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1644536310},"language":"english","review":"half life? more like mid life\n3/5","timestamp_created":1644534702,"timestamp_updated":1644534711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109940444","author":{"steamid":"76561199024196288","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1644520770},"language":"polish","review":"[h1] Half Life: Blue Shift [/h1]\n\nNajkrótszy Half Life w jakiego grałem, co wcale nie oznacza, że jest najgorszy.

Blue Shift es una expansión buena y entretenida pero no te esperes que sea como Opposing Force además de que la duración de esta expansión es muy corta (1 o 2 horas), opinión más detallada abajo:\n\nUno de los puntos buenos de la expansión en mi opinión es:\n\nCrossovers con el Half Life principal y Opposing force:\nEn esta expansión nosotros estaremos en el punto de vista de un guardia normal de Black Mesa (Barney Calhoun) y momentos como: \nInsecurity en el elevador justo cuando sucede la cascada de resonancia\nDuty Calls cuando vemos a unos miembros de HECU tirando un cuerpo y hacen mención a Adrian Shephard  Y por ultimo cuando en el final (Deliverance) vemos a Gordon Freeman siendo arrastrado por miembros de HECU así conectándose con el capitulo \"Apprehension\" del Half Life principal es muy interesante de ver en esta expansión como desde el punto de vista de Barney y más si completaste el Half life principal y Opposing Force.\n\nEs entretenido y tiene puzzles divertidos:[/h1]\nEsta expansión te puede llegar a pasar un buen rato ya que se mantiene el Gameplay divertido del Half Life principal y además de que es fácil de entender, esta expansión también es la que incluye más puzzles a comparación de hl1 y Opposing Force, los puzzles son simples de entender ya que tampoco son muy complejos.\n\nLo que considero lo malo: \n\nSu duración:\nEs demasiado corto que llega al punto de sentirse algo decepcionante y además de que sus capitulo de introducción \"Living Quarters Outbound\" se llega a sentir algo largo y más que en el siguiente capitulo \"[Insecurity]\" ya quieres entrar a la acción a pasar un buen rato pero eso es hasta ya la mitad del capitulo\n(HL1 también tiene 2 capítulos de introducción así pero al menos se perdona porque dura más tiempo)\n\nCinemáticas a tiempo real que se sienten aburridas:\nHL2 también tiene cinemáticas a tiempo real pero ahí llegan a estar interesantes por como se implementan pero en Blue Shift es diferente ya que momentos con el \"Dr. Rosenberg\" se llegan a sentir interesantes la 1RA ver pero ya cuando es tu 2DA ver jugando Blue Shift se llega a sentir [/i]tedioso[/i]...\n\nEste es mi primera
