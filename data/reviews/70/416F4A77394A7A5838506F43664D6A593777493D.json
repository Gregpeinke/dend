The bugs are extremely common; floating headcrabs, getting stuck on geometry after loading into a level, AI simply stopping altogether... and the placement of the loading zones is ridiculous. They'll often be put in the most awkward areas near enemies, which leads to easily the most immersion breaking thing in this game; enemies despawning after loading zones are encountered.

life es un juego increíble, extraordinario y una revolución en los videojuegos. \nEste juego tiene aspectos muy positivos, el shooter frenético, una IA aun hoy muy buena, variedad de armas y enemigos, tiempo justo y necesario de juego (16 horas aproximadamente) y un gameplay frenético y divertido. A pesar de sus puntos malos, como lo son el casi nulo autoguardado y la batalla contra el nihilant (un poco floja y fácil, aunque dentro de todo, puede resultar más o menos aceptable), Half life supuso y supone al día de hoy, una revolución, a tal punto, que hoy en día es dificil encontrar un juego que no tenga la palanca de Gordon Freeman como un easter egg. Los factores principales que lograron que se lo considere así, fueron la inmersión, narrativa, acción e historia y la forma de contar esta, ya que en su tiempo (al día de hoy incluso sigue en gran medida) se contaban cosas de forma innecesaria en cinemáticas que arruinaban totalmente la inmersión en el juego y si te las salteabas, no conocías nada de la historia. Acá pasa lo contrario, y eso es bueno. Hay más ejemplos en los que este juego revolucionó el mercado, no voy a decir todos para que esto no se haga tan largo, pero no son difíciles de descubrir.\nHoy en día millones de personas juegan a Half life y sus mods como Team Fortress, Counter Strike, Day of Defeat, Garry´s mod u otros productos y servicios derivados como la excelente saga Portal y el propio Steam. Es increíble el aprecio que me dejó este juego, es super recomendado. Half Life demostró al mundo que los juegos son más que entretenimiento, demostró que es sencillo innovar con ganas, demostró que cualquier equipo desconocido para la fecha puede crear o modificar una obra. Half Life demostró al mundo que los videojuegos son arte.","timestamp_created":1627416253,"timestamp_updated":1627416387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96473609","author":{"steamid":"76561198919749707","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":411,"last_played":1655908465},"language":"turkish","review":"AL MULTİPlayerını kafa dağıtmak için oynarsın ikaye moduda oynananır\n","timestamp_created":1627412471,"timestamp_updated":1627412471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96471056","author":{"steamid":"76561198394372240","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":667,"last_played":1618649146},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1627409427,"timestamp_updated":1627409427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96468414","author":{"steamid":"76561199167431869","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":112,"last_played":1630051723},"language":"turkish","review":"güzel","timestamp_created":1627406001,"timestamp_updated":1627406001,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96464766","author":{"steamid":"76561199026819833","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":338,"last_played":1655779873},"language":"english","review":"It's Half-Life","timestamp_created":1627401195,"timestamp_updated":1627401195,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96459188","author":{"steamid":"76561199179919028","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":835,"last_played":1648058866},"language":"turkish","review":"eğer pro arkadaşınız varsa vs atmayın ananızı skertebilr","timestamp_created":1627394290,"timestamp_updated":1627394290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96456123","author":{"steamid":"76561198033583512","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1653509878},"language":"english","review":"There I started playing it, am I a real gamer yet?

https://youtu.be/_pvmuARPXRU\n\n[h1] Геймплей [/h1]\n\nЭтот обзор направлен скорее на людей которые что-то слышали об игре Half-Life, не совсем понимают от чего так деды кайфуют при ее упоминании и почему так рьяно ждут продолжение серии. Начнем прямо с самого начала, во первых если вы решили поиграть в первую часть и ее дополнения в Стиме, знайте там русской озвучки нету, поэтому сначала стоит позаботиться с установлением русификатора, могу сказать вам честно, это не отнимает большого количества времени. Игра вышла еще в далеком 1998 году, когда собственно родился и я, поэтому первый раз поиграл в эту игру я где-то в 2003, вместе со своим братишкой, причем кстати ее полностью прошел, на тот момент игра казалась шедевром и игралась довольно-таки просто. Сейчас для меня лично первый отрезок игры представлял некоторый челлендж в плане привыкания к механике лестницы, вспоминать как делать распрыжку в игре и что самое наверное сложное и от чего я отвык, отсутствие навигации, как таковой вообще, вы собственно понимаете, что двигаетесь по одному большом туннелю до лаборатории Лямбда (это наша конечная цель в игре), но иногда я так жестко тупил, люди на стриме наверное помнят: бежишь бежишь, не увидел комнатку за углом и начинаешь по полчаса круги наматывать по локации пока все-таки не увидишь эту комнатку за углом. Для многих может стать откровением и то, что ХП надо восстанавливать от аптечек, а не то чтобы оно ресалось само. Для многих первый участок игры (до выхода на поверхность) является любимым, так как он такой камерный и атмосферный с решением множества логических задач, а на поверхности все скатывается в шутер, вот как раз скатывание в шутер сейчас мне понравилось больше (не знаю может быть я отупел из-за современных игр, где если это шутер, то это шутер, если платформер, то платформер). Халф-лайф вполне грамотно объединяет все эти механики, а в тот момент когда вы подходите к концу игры, из-за обилия стволов игра становится таким аналогом Дума, где ты на высоких скоростях двигаешься по карте и меняешь оружия, убивая врагов, создавая некоторую феерию, мне очень это понравилось. Единственное что мне прямо откровенно не понравилось - это уровень в Зене, а конкретно не помню как это правильно называется завод, не завод не помню, но локация просто вырвиглазная, когда я ней играл, меня прямо тошнить начинало\n\n[h1] Атмосфера [/h1]\n\nВ целом графика даже сейчас выглядит неплохо, да и музыкальное сопровождение всегда в тему и ты чувствуешь заряд адреналина, хоть это и игра 1998 года\n\n[h1] Сюжет [/h1]\n\nИграем мы за, уже ставшего легендарным, ученого по имени Гордон Фримен, вроде бы обычный рабочий день в Блэк Мезе, которая находится в Нью-Мексико, мы катим по монорельсу к своему рабочему месту, одеваем защитный костюм и идем всовывать  кристалл в реактор, вот тут и начинается весь экшончик: вторжение инопланетян, потом мобилизация войск, направленных якобы на помощь нам. И развивается он довольно-таки бодро!\n\n[h1] Итог [/h1]\n\nА итог, по традиции, смотрите у нас на канале))\n","timestamp_created":1627305293,"timestamp_updated":1627310157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96396514","author":{"steamid":"76561198871788975","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1886,"last_played":1647279798},"language":"english","review":"shut up right now\n","timestamp_created":1627293853,"timestamp_updated":1627293853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96394253","author":{"steamid":"76561198439687600","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":377,"last_played":1637923292},"language":"russian","review":"Есть два типа людей:\n\n- те, кто считают, что Half-Life лучшая игра на свете\n- те, кто не играли в Half-Life","timestamp_created":1627290070,"timestamp_updated":1635789697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96391932","author":{"steamid":"76561198807297644","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":553,"last_played":1657477646},"language":"english","review":"I love this game","timestamp_created":1627285671,"timestamp_updated":1627285671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96388236","author":{"steamid":"76561198946390111","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1619,"last_played":1656521180},"language":"russian","review":"гуманоиды с планеты жопа в плохом качестве","timestamp_created":1627278600,"timestamp_updated":1658042118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9JzX8PoCfMjY7wI="}
