The story is good, the graphics and gameplay are fluid but the game has far, far to much gore for my taste.

This game is not anything that it was supposed to be, and I am deeply disappointed, considering how promising this title looked.  \n\n     I could go on for a while and write an essay about how bland and overrated this game really is.  I mean that, but I know you won't read all of that dribble.  So I'll try and keep this short and sweet.  The weapons are heavily uninspired and generic of today's typical FPS.  The charaters are lazily written and cliche (sans the Luteces).  The story is atrociously played out and shows that the writers didn't understand the themes and concepts they were exploring, and it is blatantly obvious that the writers rushed the story out in less than a year, giving it a very small amount of actual death and lore (unlike the earlier titles in the Shock Series).  The gameplay is simple, go from point A to point B while shooting basic bad guys along the way, and is extremely linear.  The boss battles are underwhelming, the ending makes no sense, there is only ONE ending, the choices you make in the game don't fucking matter, the heavy hitters rarely appear, vigors are fucking horrible compared to plasmids, I can go on and on and on.  \n\n   Want to know the actual good parts of this game?  Here they are.  Voice Acting, Visuals, PARTS of the soundtrack.  That is fucking it.  Don't buy it, you will be wasting your money.  It is a textbook example of bait-and-switch if you watch the early gameplay videos from the early 2010's.  Want a real FPS?  PLAY THE FIRST BIOSHOCK, or System Shock, if you really want to be cool.","timestamp_created":1395369284,"timestamp_updated":1395369284,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54530644416809082","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9579011","author":{"steamid":"76561198011243555","num_games_owned":557,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1923,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1442,"last_played":1406752435},"language":"french","review":"Début et fin très intéressante, milieu -> jeu d'action de base.","timestamp_created":1395368875,"timestamp_updated":1395368875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9578946","author":{"steamid":"76561198020314115","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":955,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":932,"last_played":1375521953},"language":"english","review":"If you have not played BioShock franchise and you call yourself as a pc gamer, you simply disgust me","timestamp_created":1395368330,"timestamp_updated":1395368330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9578880","author":{"steamid":"76561197984504120","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2387,"last_played":1421220795},"language":"english","review":"Fucking dope off the chain serious mega-awesome time, best single player iv ever played, and the best ending of any game iv ever played.","timestamp_created":1395367742,"timestamp_updated":1395367742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9578845","author":{"steamid":"76561198048535429","num_games_owned":538,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":793,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204,"last_played":1466131121},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая игра с напарниками за последнее время.атмосфера отличная..так и тянет заглянуть за каждый угол.","timestamp_created":1395367528,"timestamp_updated":1395367528,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49773755669593811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9578780","author":{"steamid":"76561198088102112","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":491,"last_played":1462672526},"language":"english","review":"Great Game!

Er soll eine junge Dame namens Elizabeth in der weit über den Wolken schwebenden Stadt Columbia finden und nach New York bringen. Der Auftrag erweist sich inmitten eines Bürgerkrieges und mit dem selbsternannten Propheten Comstock und seinem Songbird im Nacken als schwieriges Unterfangen. Zumal die Reise auch noch durch alternative Realitäten führt, wo stets zwei seltsame Zwillinge mit vagen Hinweisen warten.\n\nDie Handlung stellt die starke Seite des Spiels dar. Die fliegende Stadt präsentiert sich nicht nur mit einer ausführlichen Hintergrundgeschichte, belauscht und beobachtet man die zahlreichen NPCs, so erfährt man auch mehr über die aktuelle Situation in Columbia. In der Stadt verteilte Audiotagebücher, im Spiel Voxophone genannt, geben noch tiefere Einblicke. Dabei werden für Computerspiele eher ungewöhnliche Themen wie Religion und Rassismus aufgegriffen. Auch werden die ungewöhnlichen Technologien und ihre Funktionsweise erläutert. Selbst für die ganzen gecoverten Songs im Spiel gibt es eine Erklärung. All das trägt dazu bei ein glaubhaftes Gesamtbild zu erzeugen. \nEbenso weiß die Geschichte rund um Booker und Elizabeth zu faszinieren. Früh zeigt sich, dass mehr hinter dem Auftrag steckt, als es zunächst den Anschein hat. Im Spielverlauf ergründet man die Vergangenheit und auch eine denkbare Zukunft beider Charaktere. Am Ende wartet ein ziemlich ausgefallenes Ende, mit dem man so vielleicht nicht gerechnet hat.\n\nAuch bei der Präsentation hat man sich redliche Mühe gegeben. Die Spielwelt präsentiert sich detailliert und abwechslungsreich in bester Graphik. Das liegt an den zahlreichen Stadtgebieten, die sich im Design merklich voneinander abgrenzen. Dazu kommen noch die verschiedenen Versionen von Columbia aus den anderen Dimensionen, die sich in gleicher Weise teils deutlich voneinander unterscheiden. Die deutsche Sprachausgabe ist ebenfalls gelungen, so wie auch die ungewöhnlichen Neuinterpretationen altbekannter Songs.\n\nIn einem Punkt ist der Titel aber nur bedingt erfolgreich. Als First-Person-Shooter kann das Spiel nur mäßig überzeugen. Die Begrenzung auf zwei Waffen schränkt zu sehr ein, zumal die Auswahl ohnehin nicht sonderlich groß und abwechslungsreich ausfällt. Zudem könnte es deutlich mehr verschiedene Gegnertypen geben. Kampfgebiete mit Sky-Line sind selten und fallen eher klein aus.\nErfreulich ist zumindest die Beteiligung von Elizabeth bei den Gefechten. So wirft sie gerne mal Munition zu, was bei dem stark begrenzten Vorrat äußerst praktisch ist. Gelegentlich kann man auch als Tränen bezeichnete Portale öffnen und so unter anderem Unterstützung herbeiholen. \n\nDie Vorzüge von BioShock Infinite liegen mehr in der Story und Präsentation als im Gameplay. Als Shooter ist es zwar kein Reinfall, aber eben auch kein Hit. Selbst auf hohen Schwierigkeitsgrad ist das Spiel nur selten fordernd, sofern man beim Ableben nicht direkt wieder vor einem Handyman erwacht. Doch die außerordentliche Darstellung der fliegenden Stadt vermag diesen Makel ausreichend zu kompensieren. Wer in eine überzeugende Welt mit bemerkenswerter Geschichte eintauchen will, der wird mit diesem Spiel gut bedient.","timestamp_created":1395362119,"timestamp_updated":1399486701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549921333789825439","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9578074","author":{"steamid":"76561198058675545","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":600,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":485,"last_played":1388952429},"language":"english","review":"As a fan of the first bioshock, I was fairly disappointed with this game. It starts off very promising, the visuals are great with a few set pieces that really give the environment character. The story seems to be leading towards a certain direction until you finally meet elizabeth. From there the story takes a bit of turn. From then on the story becomes more and more convoluted, until the game finally ends. It seems as if the writers thought a baffling ending meant a good ending. All the while the gameplay begins to feel like more of a chore than fun. there are only a handful of unique enemies that are sparsely used throughout, making each fight feel like the last. Though the vigors and the rail system add a bit of diversity, they really cant overcome the rinse and repeat feel of the encounters. Meanwhile elizabeths special power seems very underutilised. [spoiler]For being able to tear through time, space, and alternate realities[/spoiler] all she provides for you is extra ammo, and a friendly turret here and there. Even in terms of the story, elizabeths power is mainly used to skip over events. I felt that this was a very lazy move on part of the writers. Rather than have the player achieve their goal, the writers say [spoiler]\"elizabeth tears into an alternate reality! so now you dont have to do this objective!

Set before the previous games, Infinite's Columbia city in the sky is a breath of fresh air compared to the dank claustrophobic chambers of Rapture. The story is as good if not better than previously, and the addition of the main character Booker DeWitt actually speaking and interacting with Elizabeth is a wonderful change to the mute protagonists of the past. Spanning between calm repressed utopian grandeur and the rise of troubled revolution to outright war and devastation is similarly a nice change to the post-apocalyptic decay of Rapture. \n\nMechanically the game is much the same, though combat has more angles of attack outside of the skyless Rapture. The skyrail travel and combat are a fun addition. Weapons are more normal ballistics and limited to a much more rational carrying of only two, and thus having to make choices about what to carry as you go along. The added Shield on top of health, as well as Elizabeth's timely gifts of potions and ammo make resource management slightly less of an issue. Plasmids have been renamed Vigors, the passive Tonics have been replaced by clothing that are found and not bought. Again the hacking mechanics are simplified, this time down to an effect of one of the Vigors, in the place of the previous games' minigames.","timestamp_created":1395339686,"timestamp_updated":1395339686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9574786","author":{"steamid":"76561198055065590","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1218,"last_played":1461874509},"language":"spanish","review":"best game history EVER","timestamp_created":1395339633,"timestamp_updated":1395339633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9574785","author":{"steamid":"76561198053072551","num_games_owned":417,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":957,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":486,"last_played":1530304770},"language":"finnish","review":"Awesome!","timestamp_created":1395339630,"timestamp_updated":1395339630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9574724","author":{"steamid":"76561198067364432","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":642,"last_played":1488829893},"language":"russian","review":"\"Но время океан, а не река.
