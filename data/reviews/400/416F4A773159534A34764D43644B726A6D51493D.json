Игрок выступает в роли девушки по имени Челл, которая проходит испытания внутри этой Лаборатории. Игровой процесс основан на решении головоломок при помощи переносного устройства, позволяющего создавать на плоских поверхностях порталы — два связанных разрыва материи, через которые можно мгновенно перемещаться в пространстве самому или переносить предметы. И к черту сюжет знаете, здесь есть пушка, моря веселья и счастья, а еще это постоянное обучение. Все время мы будем находить новые способы применения порталов, так что играть интересно до финальных титров (они заслуживают отдельной похвалы). Что насчет боевой части, то мордобоя в Portal нет. Да и злобные демоны из порталов не лезут. Из опасностей — разве что похожие на расплющенные веб-камеры дроиды, иногда постреливающие в нас (если окажемся в их поле зрения), а также водичка, в которую очень нежелательно попадать (иначе стремительно отдадим Game Over’у душу). Все остальное, включая падения с огромной высоты, переживается легко.  Однако самое замечательное, что есть в Portal, — эти, извините, не порталы.  увлекательнейшую систему перемещений затмила сама ГЛэДОС, наша постоянная подружка. Это, без шуток, один из самых ярких персонажей компьютерных игр за последние несколько лет. Ее реплики остроумны, циничны и до уточек в глазах смешны.

Или вот еще: [i]«А вы знаете, что у вас есть возможность пожертвовать несколько жизненно важных органов в фонд девичьей самооценки?

It's so hard to break out of the immersive universe and stop playing, and the humor in the game feels like the cherry on top. I have a massive regret with this game, and that's that I didn't play it sooner. I can't believe I kept myself away from this story for so long...and if you're not good at puzzles, don't worry. I'm absolutely horrible with puzzles. However, trust me when I say that you can most definitely solve these without help! They have a perfect level of difficulty to where you'll scratch your head, then go, \"Oh! I understand!\" and you'll solve it. This game is undoubtedly a classic, as is Portal 2.

The dark humor sometimes made me laugh a little bit.\n\nValve has treated this game as a piece of art - the lore, the graphics, and the level design were all fantastic.\n\nGo out there and buy this game.","timestamp_created":1596733091,"timestamp_updated":1596733091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73870790","author":{"steamid":"76561198339227593","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1596729981},"language":"schinese","review":"3小时通关，今典之作，值得一玩，但如果晕3d或者有幽闭恐惧症的玩家还是劝退吧，十分推荐","timestamp_created":1596730130,"timestamp_updated":1596730130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73867002","author":{"steamid":"76561198881876820","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1180,"last_played":1596725059},"language":"english","review":"only 200IQ players allowed\n","timestamp_created":1596725098,"timestamp_updated":1596725098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73866974","author":{"steamid":"76561198994439234","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1305,"last_played":1646261786},"language":"english","review":"pretty darn good","timestamp_created":1596725057,"timestamp_updated":1596725057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73865892","author":{"steamid":"76561198351352335","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":80,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":80,"last_played":1587898435},"language":"russian","review":"прошёл за 40 мин сам того не понимая...","timestamp_created":1596723570,"timestamp_updated":1596723570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477707028388977051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1YSJ4vMCdKrjmQI="}
