Так мое первое знакомство с игрой и закончилось. Да и сильно жалко не было. Просто пропустил мимо и забыл, установив “Far Cry: Rambo”, чтоб его перее.ало, навечно осквернив мой старый системник (но это к делу не относится). И сейчас, на зимней распродаже, не охотно купив пак с двумя частями, хочу поделиться своим мнением. \n\nИгра встречает нас не особо выдающейся картинкой на 2007 год (ну не Крузис е.та маа.ака),  но она имеет свой шарм. Локации выглядят как хайтековские научные лаборатории, а не как ваш школьный класс по физике, где работает, в лучшем случае, е. онитовая палочка. А про застенки даже говорить не буду. Их надо видеть самому. \n\nСюжет достаточно прост и незатейлив.  Вы играете за Chell - лабораторную мышь и игрушку в руках спятившего искусственного интеллекта по имени GLaDOS, а ваша цель – выйти на свободу и получить “торт”.\n\nГеймплей основан на физике тела и изменении его положения в пространстве за счет порталов – разрывов в пространстве, искусственно соединяющих две отдаленные точки. Создание порталов возможно только на пригодных для этого, ровных поверхностях, проходить сквозь которые могут заряженные частицы, лучи, предметы и вы сами. Головоломки очень занимательные и не особо затратные по времени.  Все зависит от вашей сообразительности. Для искушенных любителей головоломок есть бонусные, усложненные камеры с меньшим количеством пригодных поверхностей и прочими ограничениями, а также обычные камеры с челенджем при прохождении, на наименьшее количество порталов, шагов или времени.\n\nОбращая внимание на аудио сопровождение, можно сказать, что большую часть игры вы будете слышать различные механические шумы с завываниями ветра, которые очень хорошо подчеркивают атмосферу исследовательского комплекса, сопровождаемые комментариями GLaDOS, часто заслуживающими разбития на цитаты.\n\nПодводя итоги, можно смело сказать, что покупкой я более чем доволен. Шикарная на свое время игра не растеряла ни капли своей притягательности и через семь с лишним лет, и не потеряет, как мне кажется. К покупке и ознакомлению крайне рекомендую. Ну а выводы остаются за вами. Всего доброго, и удачи!!!","timestamp_created":1420389043,"timestamp_updated":1480340247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566025912761688232","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13831866","author":{"steamid":"76561198104105187","num_games_owned":451,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":288,"last_played":1548773255},"language":"russian","review":"Portal-игра от компании Valve.значит игру уже стоит купить,а дальше поиграть и написать о ней обзор.\nОтличная головоломка с 15 уровнями,где на прохождение требуется примерно 1 час и 30 минут может и меньше\nПоследнeе заданиe делаeт большую сложность и только этo заданиe увеличиваeт время прохождения\nАтмосфера игры безупречна","timestamp_created":1420388721,"timestamp_updated":1501757023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.7195853590965271","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13831226","author":{"steamid":"76561198165838978","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":85,"last_played":1433080441},"language":"english","review":"Portal is yet another Valve masterpiece.
