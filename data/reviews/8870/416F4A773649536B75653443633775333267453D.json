It has plenty of poignant moments and amazing set pieces. And, at the end of the day, it's just a fun game. At the same time...\n\n...Infinite is a massively dumbed down Bioshock game. Please remember that Bioshock 1 in itself was a dumbed down version of System Shock 2: the character classes were removed, the inventory was removed, the weapon maintenance system was removed, the character progression system was reworked into a simpler Tonic system. However, despite these changes, the Shock games' essence was still present there. Some mechanics, like Researching, were also significantly improved over SS2. Bioshock Infinite though, completely disregards not only its System Shock roots, but even its much more recent Bioshock roots. Here is a list of mechanics that were either straight up removed or severely dumbed down from its predecessors:\n\nRemoved:\n- Cameras are removed, along with the entire alarm system\n- Crafting is removed\n- Hacking is removed, although it could be argued that it was replaced by the Possession Vigor or Lockpicks, in which case it's severely dumbed down\n- Researching is removed\n- Manual saves and quick saves are removed, replaced by checkpoints\n- * Ability to carry health kits / Salts (Eve) injectors with you is removed\n- Weapon upgrades being visible on the weapon models themselves are removed\n\nDumbed down:\n- Linear levels instead of hubs and, due to this, the map was removed\n- * Two weapon limit\n- The entire Tonic character upgrade system, with 15 slots, has been downgraded to 4 Gear slots\n- * There are no weapon upgrade stations you have to actively seek: there are weapon upgrade vendors in the open which sell them for money\n- Weapons have only one ammo type instead of three\n- * No additional resource needed for upgrading Vigors: once again, you just use money\n\n* These, I think, have been enforced partially just to make Elizabeth useful gameplay-wise by providing you with ammo, money, health and Salts e.g. you wouldn't need ammo on the fly during combat, if you had the ability to just switch to several other weapons.\n\nWhat you get instead:\n- Skylines, the only noteworthy addition aside from...\n- ...tears\n- Melee executions\n- A regenerating shield\n- Lockpicks\n- Elizabeth who, gameplay-wise, is a walking ammo-money-health-Salts dispenser\n- Weapon re-skins?\n\nSo what is left of the Shock formula?\n\n- Powers (Vigors)\n- A (minor) character progression system (Gear and Infusions)\n- Weapon upgrades\n- Vendor machines\n- Audio logs\n\nAt this point it's closer to Doom 3 than to a Shock game.\n\nMoving onto the narrative. The plot is a time travel, multiverse type of story. From my personal experience these kind of narratives end up either masterfully brilliant or catastrophically poor, no in between. Unfortunately, Infinite's story is of the second variety. It is full of paradoxes, nonsensical plot elements, all hand waived by the ending's twist. And no, dear Bioshock Infinite defense squad, it is not that hard to understand; actually, proper understanding of it makes you realize just how bad it is. Bioshock Infinite's plot is one of my favorite examples of how a complex narrative does not automatically make it a good one.\nTo sum it up, the story is pretentious and far up its own ass. There were certain moments in the game where I was rolling my eyes, as the developers constructed them in a way as if nudging me with their elbows telling me \"look how clever we are\". Kojima level cringe'y stuff.\n\nFurthermore, there are moments wherein the characters behave in an extraordinarily stupid way. The prime example, mentioned in many of the reviews here, is in the beginning, where Booker encounters a poster showing that the scar on his hand is perceived in the city as the literal mark of Satan. Instead of attempting to cover it up somehow, he just goes \"huh\" and goes on his merry way. It backfires on him spectacularly no more than 5 minutes later.\n\nThe villain. Andrew Ryan is easily the best antagonist in the series: charismatic, memorable and quotable AF. Fontaine, although he is a stereotypical ruthless gangster, he is also memorable since the voice actor had clearly a lot of fun playing him. Sophia Lamb is a cold, calculating bi*ch with a messiah complex; played well and memorable.\nComstock is not memorable. Comstock is not quotable. Comstock is a racist religious fanatic who is, somehow, portrayed as a boring old man. There was so much potential here, even hamming it up would have been better than the... nothing that he is now. The sermons on the audio logs are, generally, predictable and he too rarely addresses you directly: there is literally one scene at around quarter of the game in which he talks to you, then nothing up until the last 5% of the game (after Comstock House); these are far too few encounters with him. The most hilarious detail I've noticed is the fact that they attempted to make him sound menacing through the speakers, by giving him this weird voice filter; breaking news: it failed completely.\n\nIn the end, even though I still had fun, I cannot, with a clear conscience, recommend it. Unless you just do not care about its origins or coherence of the story, in which case knock yourself out. I have to admit I have an unreasonable dislike towards the game because of the enormous potential that was wasted here. \n\n\nKen Levine's fan fiction part 1 (Burial at Sea ep. 1)\nRapture is back, hub levels are back, multiple weapons you can carry are back. Now the game is much harder and focuses more on stealth than outright combat (if playing on harder difficulties). I really like this change of pace. \nBut, of course, the story just has to connect all Bioshocks together for no reason and has a \"clever\" plot twist at the end. Makes me appreciate games with good stories and no plot twists that much more. When you think about it, the whole plot is so tacked on, it's obvious that it was built around Rapture i.e. they wanted to return to Rapture first, due to naysayers preferring it to Columbia, and then built a throwaway narrative around it. I think Columbia was one of the few things they did right and they should've stayed there.\n\nKen Levine's fan fiction part 2 (Burial at Sea ep. 2)\nEven better than ep. 1. Full on stealth mode + can carry health packs. Columbia even makes a return for a short period. However, it appears the primary reason to do so, is to patch up various plot holes from the base game in a rather ham-fisted way.","timestamp_created":1574009427,"timestamp_updated":1574990611,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.620230555534362793","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57372990","author":{"steamid":"76561198983961519","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":826,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":711,"last_played":1574014855},"language":"spanish","review":"entretenido a mas no poder y con horas enviciantes","timestamp_created":1574008013,"timestamp_updated":1574008013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57371885","author":{"steamid":"76561198034138471","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":744,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":704,"last_played":1610513461},"language":"koreana","review":"갓갓겜","timestamp_created":1574007004,"timestamp_updated":1574007004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57365772","author":{"steamid":"76561198436020010","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":553,"last_played":1658913623},"language":"schinese","review":"真的好玩\n","timestamp_created":1574001195,"timestamp_updated":1574001195,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57364738","author":{"steamid":"76561198834804363","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":85,"last_played":1617288319},"language":"schinese","review":"13年的神作，当之无愧，希望能出4","timestamp_created":1574000192,"timestamp_updated":1574000192,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57362140","author":{"steamid":"76561199000742673","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":780,"last_played":1573997525},"language":"german","review":"WOW - Ich bin total begeistert von dem Spiel.

Стоит и еще как. Таких игр не так много, если вы любите мясные шутеры, то данная игра для вас.\n     Что в этой игре есть такого интересного?\n-Отдача от оружия, как ты из него стреляешь. Ты чувствуешь оружие, ты его любишь. Любое оружие отлично выполнено. Из него удобно стрелять, ходить, бегать. Твое оружие - это как твой ребенок.\n-Сюжет. Каждый кто играл в Биошок знает, что сюжет здесь продуманный. Ни каждый сможет понять его, поэтому нужно переигрывать или смотреть видео. Он очень интересный, и лучше пройти игру самому, чем смотреть как кто-то проходит.\n-Сложность. Могу сказать что на сложности \"Трудно\", мне правда было трудно. Конечно, есть много факторов которые облегчат игру ( Улучшения, вещи, оружие и тд), но бывает реально сложные моменты. Могу дать совет: Беру точную и мощную пушку ( Снайперская винтовка, ручной пистолет и тд) и стреляйте только в голову. Так же возьмите \"Одежду\" на +50% к криту, и разносите всех с ваншота в голову :) (Я всю игру проходил с такой тактикой)\nВообще в игре есть много сетов и тактик для прохождения игра. Обязательно берите самую сложную сложность ( Жалко что она открывается после трудной), т.к так будет на много интересней.\n-Контент. Обязательно берите все Длс на эту игру, они вам обязательно понадобятся! \nВ этой игре кучу возможностей: Слабая пушка или способность? Да на, иди качай; Чувствуешь себя не комфортно? Собирай сет из одежды и иди разноси их в свежее мясо :). Кучу разбросанных вещей (вкусняшек) секретов, пасхалок и тд. Длс с отличным сюжетом, а так же отбивание волн :)\nЗдесь правда много контента, и если тебе скучно. Бери эту игрушку и играй. Только не слишком часто, голова лопнет xD\n     Могу сказать что мне было интересно играть в эту игру. Она одна из самых интересных что я видел, и я еще многого не прошел. Для нашего времени она отлично выглядит, и слабое железо может потянуть ( конечно лаги есть, но не сильно критичные). Самое главное, берите высокую сложность и не торопитесь играть в нее. Проходите постепенно и получайте удовольствие от этой игры!\n                                                                      Спасибо за внимание!","timestamp_created":1573917698,"timestamp_updated":1573917698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557572305202484131","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57292663","author":{"steamid":"76561198009083245","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3498,"last_played":1537702518},"language":"english","review":"One of the best Games of all time.\nLike his predecessors\nBioshock and\nBioshock 2,\n\nWith a story better than most Hollywood Films.","timestamp_created":1573916527,"timestamp_updated":1573916527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57291491","author":{"steamid":"76561198124536726","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":90,"playtime_forever":1458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":434,"last_played":1654392875},"language":"english","review":"The scenery in the game is great it has a good story good action too one of the best Bioshock games I've played (right behind Bioshock 1) This is just a whole new experience","timestamp_created":1573915480,"timestamp_updated":1573915480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57289435","author":{"steamid":"76561198372218079","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":680,"last_played":1573806894},"language":"schinese","review":"为了你，我可以杀死我自己","timestamp_created":1573913662,"timestamp_updated":1573913662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57287622","author":{"steamid":"76561198353391923","num_games_owned":475,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1313,"last_played":1573912827},"language":"english","review":"While I did enjoy the game a lot, I didn't understand the different dimension fuggery.\n\nI'd still plow Elizabeth, though.","timestamp_created":1573912033,"timestamp_updated":1573912033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57286396","author":{"steamid":"76561198418099855","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":928,"last_played":1625144064},"language":"schinese","review":"我永远爱着在那个在沙滩上跳舞的女孩","timestamp_created":1573910885,"timestamp_updated":1573910885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57286187","author":{"steamid":"76561198826117602","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":404,"last_played":1613681981},"language":"english","review":"Bad game, dosent fit the game series at all.
