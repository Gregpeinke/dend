This is that game and I loved it.  At first glance it looks like a first person shooter.  But instead of shooting at baddies, your weapons create two ends of a portal, through which you can then make progress.  So the puzzle is to make your way through the labyrinth of the game by solving the spatial problems put before you.  You get to jump onto moving platforms, and pick up and deposit objects to help you.  There are also things that shoot at you.\n\nBut what makes the game particularly interesting is the bizarre computer HAL type overseer that accompanies you through the game, promising cake at one moment, then threatening to kill you the next.  This is very well thought through and very amusing , a real masterstroke.  The only real downside is that the game is disappointingly short.\n\nThoroughly recommended.

Nach etwa 3-4 Stunden hat man das Spiel durch. Es gibt zwar noch zusätzlich einige Herausforderungen, die die Level erschweren bzw. auf Zeit laufen lassen, das unterhält allerdings auch nicht wirklich lange.\nInsgesamt kann ich Portal aber jedem nur empfehlen, der Lust auf ausgefallene Rätsel und eine interessant/lustige Story hat.

Если подумать - ничего. Кажется, что вся игра уже видна в обложке - порталы. \nС одной стороны, это так. Без этих самых пространственных дыр не обходится ни одна комната, но если судить игру только по этому сингулярному введению - это чистой воды банальная головоломка. Что есть, то есть. Как головоломка Portal проигрывает многим проектам, выигрывающим и без умных пушечек. Но, как ни странно, эта головоломка до сих пор проходится не хуже Half-Life 2, а по оценкам почти дотягивает до него.\nПотому что не только порталы, скажу я вам. В этой игре не только порталы. Разработчики понимали, что обычные пространственные загадки не выстрелят - они добавили специализированность. Целый центр ради порталов. Разработчики понимали, что обычные тестовые камеры могут быстро наскучить - они добавили бега по закулисью центра. Кажется, все есть. Но разработчики неожиданно поняли, что и это не выглядит на все сто - они дали нам GLaDOS. Победа.\nЧто вышло в итоге? Туман. Мрак. Стерильность. И жуткое одиночество. Которое попросту не чувствуется. \nПорталы в Portal мгновенно уходят в фон, а перед нашими глазами - неведомый голос, что-то описывающий нам и обещающий тортик. И ничего не объясняющий. И явно одинокий. Как и мы. Притом тоже женщина.\nК сожалению, первой я прошел вторую часть. Жалею об этом. Потому что я установил себе \"вторую\" GLaDOS, и с \"первой\" по-настоящему познакомился лишь после повторного прохождения первой части. \nВторая часть, конечно, взяла все идеи первой, отсекла лишок, улучшила их и разбавила новыми задумками. Мы увидели новый Portal. И потеряли старый.\nПервая часть для меня навсегда останется самой атмосферной и лучшей. Она дала мне ощущение запертости и замкнутости, заставила бояться любого лишнего звука и пугала меня пустотой. Ведь это, вроде, наше будущее.\nОценка?

I was stuck in the room where the player was given the first time a very long shaft to utilize object inertia. I had to turn the stick like crazy just to aim at the platforms. The controller are just not good enough and I have left it behind for 2 years or so, with a bad impression. Since Valve released it on Linux, it's been lying in my game bank since the first day I joined Steam. I just didn't play it out laziness. To whom is doing the same, I'm telling you now: YOU ARE MISSING OUT!\n\nFirst of all, I'm more than happy to play this game on keyboard and mouse rather than a PS3 controller. The controls are very smooth as to all other Source games by Valve. No odd lags or issues. They did a fantastic job there.\n\nThe game time is a little bit short but I can't really complain - around 2 to 3 hours I suppose. There's a strange charm to this game. There are only two obvious characters. There's almost no story. But the production team really knows how to tell a story, bit by bit, literally. From the beginning you are only waking up as a participant of some sort of science experiment. Going through the rooms and rooms and you discover things may not be as simple as it seems. Through every mosaic glass you can see observation rooms but obvious no one is watching. The robot keeps talking about science only makes you wonder: what is going on in this place? Where did all the people go? What is the purpose of this `test' that I'm doing? And sometimes you discover a crack in the wall that you can crawl through, there you find out things might have gone wrong: the writings and the palm prints on the wall raised a certain level of mystery in you mind. It is exactly there little things that make a good game,\n\nAnd this IS a very good game. Music is good. Sound effects are good. Puzzles are good. And the production is very good. Although the graphic is a little bit outdated but that's because I'm such a late comer, and they fixed this in Portal 2 as well! I'm happy, has absolutely nothing to complain.\n\nA special mention is that the computer GLaD is very memorable, and that she also played an important role in the sequel.\n\n10/10.","timestamp_created":1400952618,"timestamp_updated":1400952618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10220104","author":{"steamid":"76561198052704319","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":49,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":49,"last_played":1393122076},"language":"english","review":"this game has holes and robots and it's scary, do not play","timestamp_created":1400948982,"timestamp_updated":1400948982,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.310963720083236694","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10216453","author":{"steamid":"76561198090635527","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":105,"last_played":1497368866},"language":"german","review":"Ein Hammer Spiel und jedem zu empfehlen der ein wenig rätseln möchte!

Es ist zwar ein Logik/Rätsel Spiel, aber wenn man erstmal drinne ist hat man den Bogen sehr schnell raus! Es fängt an mit sehr simplen Testkammern. Zb. ein großer Berg auf dem man nichtklettern kann oder so, man setzt ein Portal unten und eins auf dem Berg, rein ins untere und raus aus dem oberen :) Mit der Zeit wirds zwar schwerer aber im grundegenommen bleibt es leicht, wenn man nicht nur alle 2 Monate anspielt! :D Spielzeit beträgt ungefähr 14 VOLLE STUNDEN! Kein Witz! Die Story ist sehr groß und wie bereits erwähnt unglaublich spannend! Die Grafik ist zwar nicht wunderschön, aber das entscheidet garnichts! Im Fazit gibts 10/10 Punkte!

However, once I realized how I was being taunted by GLaDOS, it became much more interesting.  The puzzles got more and more challenging, but never too tough that it was frustrating.  It was a relatively short game, but that's better than if it was too long.  The ending is a true classic and was very satisfying.

After the third or fourth 'Test' or level it was decided the game was for braniacs so it was dismissed to gather dust motes. Years later it was given another shot but still the thought of getting past that one hard level was virtually impossible. It wasnt, once that test was completed the theory behind the blue and orange Portals became obvious and the rest of the testing became fun and very enjoyable. So much so that Portal 2 was a must once Portal 1 was complete. Portal 2 was the same but way far better. A battle of the AI ensued with the protagonist being  the 'meat in the sandwich. Despite originally deciding that each level was pure puzzle solving it later develops into a gritty comedic sojourn into bouncing - sliding -portal hopping goodness. Glados and Wheatly the main AI at each others throats or heads as it were, giving the comedic relief where needed. Once you are past a certain point in Portal 1 you will grasp the whole idea and embrace it in your Portal Gun weilding arms. \"Lovely\" as Wheatly would say and 9 out of 10 rubber Chickens.","timestamp_created":1400771561,"timestamp_updated":1400771561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44rifksYCf8DzJg=="}
