The story is sort of interesting at first, but ends up getting way too convoluted for it's own good, not to mention the absolute lack of subtlety as far as \"messages\" and philosophy go. Also, story-wise this really couldn't have less to do with the original games, aside from one fan-service DLC that from what I've heard is somehow even more of a plot clusterfuck than the base game.

플레이를 거쳤지만 스토리는 위키를 참조하기 전까지는 이해하기 힘들었다.\n분명 사람들이 이 게임을 칭찬하는 이유에는 잘 짜여진 스토리도 한 몫을 했을 텐데 말이다.\n다만 그런 사실을 제외하고도 바이오쇼크 인피니트는 충분히 즐길만한 작품이라 불릴 법하다.\n\n개인적으로 옛 미국의 모습을 오마주하면서 판타지와 화려함을 잘 어우른 배경이 특히 마음에 들었다.\n거듭되는 싸움을 통해 그 평화와 환상을 철저히 부스는 게 플레이어의 목표라는 아이러니도 함께 말이다.\n게임이 진행되는 동안 눈 앞에 펼쳐지는 공중도시의 모습은 내게 후회없는 경험을 선사하기에 충분했다.\n\n바이오쇼크 인피니트 속의 싸움은 단순한 FPS라 불리기에는 아까울 정도로 개성이 넘친다.\n왼쪽 클릭으로 사격, 오른쪽 클릭으로 특수능력, 스페이스바를 통한 스피드 넘치는 공중 이동까지.\n멋진 디자인(+효과)의 총기류와 갖가지 아이템을 구입할 수 있는 자판기 역시 존재감을 마음껏 발휘했다.\n정말 누가 이런 것들을 하나하나 생각해냈나 싶을 정도로 나는 게임 속 소재들을 높히 평가하고 싶다.\n심지어 컴퓨터 사양 때문에 낮은 그래픽으로 플레이했건만 콘텐츠를 즐기는 데에는 전혀 문제가 없었다.\n\n위와 같은 장점들은 DLC에서도 이어지나, 전작과 연결되는 부분 때문에 초심자인 내게는 살짝 어려웠다.\n그래도 복잡하게 생각할 것 없이, 주어진 임무를 수행하는 것만으로도 충분히 즐겼다는 생각이 든다.\n앞서 난해하다 평했던 스토리의 경우, 위키를 검색하여 이해하는 게 가능했고 말이다.\n오히려 이 작품은 한 번에 다 이해하기(그리고 즐기기) 힘들기에 다회차 플레이도 문제 없는 게 아닐까?\n기왕이면 전작들도 즐겨보고 싶은데, 다들 최적화 문제로 말이 많아 훗날을 기약하고자

my feelings for this game equate to Meh. It's not a bioshock game but it's not bad it's really just meh.\nThe ending doesn't relate to the first two games even though they do briefly bring you back to Rapture, No horror atmosphere. They bring back the mechanic of plasmids but i do think it's a step down from the second game, Elizabeth is hot and useful so she's a good thing that's introduced.\n\nI by no means think it's a bad game I just don't think it's a bioshock game. If it was created separate from the franchise then it could've been a better game with different mechanics and hooks. I think by including it in the bioshock series they only limited themselves and sold the game short.\n\nseparate the game could've been good and I would've loved to work on it myself, Compared to bioshock the game is meh in every aspect. I don't think I need to go on for you to understand the feeling imposed upon a bioshock fan, someone who started with the first two games and loved them for everything they contained. once again sadly this is not bioshock.","timestamp_created":1598239572,"timestamp_updated":1598239572,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471944302320480347","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74814976","author":{"steamid":"76561199027565913","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1598406597},"language":"schinese","review":"真的不错，这画风和剧情吹爆，尽管游戏性不是很高，但就是好玩。一周目通完后准备二周目全收集！！！","timestamp_created":1598238395,"timestamp_updated":1598238395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74814873","author":{"steamid":"76561198320087096","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":698,"last_played":1630118875},"language":"english","review":"Bought this Anarchistic, pro-Bolshevik, anti-Judeo/Christian sentiment trash while it was on sale for 80% off.
