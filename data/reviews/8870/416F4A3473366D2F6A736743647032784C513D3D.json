It's just challenge maps. \n\nI just played Burial at Sea Ep 1, and it finished in about 1.5 hours. It was garbage. I spent all my time picking stuff like coins, and health up, and the rest of my time dying. I had to turn down the difficulty coz I was dying every encounter before that. It was just hard, boring, and added nothing to the Infinite experience. (Elizabeth is there and she just got in the way as much as anything. A few times she obsructed an exit to an area I had just gone in, e.g. like behind a bar or counter.)\n\nThe story just doesn't sit with with Infinite.\n\n\nEp 2 is not so bad and longer than Ep 1, but still fairly short. It does get going in the way Infinite does, meaning you get involved in the story of it. The tasks work in the same way Infinite does so you become immersed. It was strange at the start. Ammo was in pityful supply and I got trapped and stuck, meaning it checkpointed just before I died. Every time I tried I died exactly the same. I gave up thinking the Season Pass was a waste of money. After many months I came back out of curiosity, and found I was being revived somewhere completely different. The invisibilty plasma I had was gone. I played on and had a blast with it for a few hours.","timestamp_created":1409527828,"timestamp_updated":1428430496,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471391409635543823","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11939586","author":{"steamid":"76561197990208194","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1180,"last_played":1593970832},"language":"german","review":"mir hat dieses spiel sehr gut gefallen.\n+gute grafik\n+einfallsreich\n+viel emotionales\n+ein feeling des hinterher-fieberns *g*\n\nnaja, ich übertreib. es war dennoch wirklich gut und für quantenphysiker sicher ein interessantes gedankenexperiement.\nBioshock ROCKS!","timestamp_created":1409517220,"timestamp_updated":1409517220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11939523","author":{"steamid":"76561198143582242","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":962,"last_played":1409516714},"language":"english","review":"My Mind is officially blown!!!!!!

The whole open world-ish type levels are still there, with beautifull locations and the whole environmental storytelling thing, that tell you side stories paralel to the events of the main game by simply placing a couple of bodies, a smere of blood and a voxophone (audio diary), and this gives you an incredible sense of freedom without actually sacrificing the immersion of the whole thing, wich is really hard to get right.

Though they both focus on political and social sciences, Bioshock Infinite is like a separate game altogether. Don't get me wrong, I loved this game, but it definitely felt a little weird when there was little to no mention of Rapture and/or Andrew Ryan. Burial at Sea made up for that, I suppose, but maybe a little more Rapture would have been nice in the plot. \n\nOverall, it was confusing (had to do some reading after playing it to connect all the dots) but enjoyable, I liked the plot, even though the racism was a little hard to bear at points (not the intended racism, mind you.)

Also at some points you would run out of bullets for the guns you have and then you have to pick up a gun that feels much inefficient for the task at hand.\n\nVerdict: Bioshock Infinite, has one of the most gripping stories ever, stunning graphics, animations are done very well, guns work very well but just run out of ammo for me XD, and sadly suffers for extendanitis in the middle.     \n\nRating: 9/10, alot of singleplayer games are not made this well these days and its good to see that developers like rational games can still provide the gripping singleplayer games they always have provided.","timestamp_created":1409369002,"timestamp_updated":1409369002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11915948","author":{"steamid":"76561197961604249","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":502,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":454,"last_played":1479007398},"language":"english","review":"Best Indiana Jones game ever!","timestamp_created":1409364376,"timestamp_updated":1417717572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11915781","author":{"steamid":"76561198090134750","num_games_owned":1206,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1987,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1241,"last_played":1585949273},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is one of the most amazing games ever and it's one of my top favorite games.

In Bioshock Infinite you plays Booker Dewitt. Hes a private detective whos sent to columbia. A city thats above the clouds to recover a woman named Elizabeth. Once you get there you find out that somethings very wrong so its up to you to get Elizabeth and Get out of the flying city. So how is this game ? Its actually the best one in the series. The gameplay is what you remember just improved. The gunplay is smooth and alot of fun. The game alos provides you with a ton of Vigors to choose from. The game also Looks outstanding. Wihtout a doubt one of the best looking games as of now. The game isnt linear so you can go explore columbia at youre will. The gameplay also has a few problems. The game only allows you to carry 2 guns which is quite sad because theres some really cool ones as well. The game also is some times hard to navigate which is quite annoying. So now for the Pros: The game is Beutifull. Amazing Story, Great Gameplay and amazing Voice acting. Cons:Glitches and No map which makes navigating the make confusing. Overall You need to get Bioshock Infinite without a doubt one of the best games ever created. I give BioShock Infinite a 9.5/10\nNow for the Columbias Finest Pack. The guns are incredible. The make the game a breeze so if you want some great weapons and gear i highly suggest you get it no matter what. I give Columbias Finest 8/10\nNow for the story dlc.\nClash in the Clouds is a horde mode done Bioshock Style. Its quite difficult so if youre looking for a challenge definetly pick this up but otherwise just skip it because its kinda boring. I give Clash In the Clouds a 6/10\nNow to avoid spoilers for infite all im gonna say about it takes place in rapture after the events of Infite.\nSo the first Episode of Burial at sea is bad. Im really sad to say this but it is. Its incredibly short and the story barely makes sense. Honestly its not very good so only buy it if you want to complete the full story. I give Burial at Sea episode 1 a 5/10\nBurial At Sea episode is quite diffrent. In episode 2 you play as Elizabeth and the gameplay revolves around stealth rather than Brute Force. This episode is quite good and its quite creepy and it also shows the events leading up to the first bioshock.

A lot of themes are mentioned in this game, but the story never really builds on them. It tries to introduce multiple themes about multiple universes, the futility of our choices, and various religious and racial themes, but it doesn't really implement any of them well. The story is also riddled with plot holes, and the combat is viciously dumbed down. Most vigors act similarly with only a few exceptions, you can only carry 2 weapons at one time, hacking has been removed, a Halo-esque shield system replaces first aid kits, and ammo is no longer scare but plentiful. Comparing this to the original System Shock games, it's almost like they're exact opposites. I can't really understand why this is an entry into the Bio/Systemshock series. It lacks the survival horror elements of the previous games (as well as any sense of atmosphere). It's sad to see that people are praising this as the \"Citizen Kane of gaming\".

However there were a few noticeable issues, for example the game was in quite a few areas a bit to linear, the story forced you to make moral decisions which had no noticeable effect on the overall story, the ending felt like it was rushed being almost completely unrelated to all of the story up to that point (SPOILER: Your actually the bad guy from the past she is you daughter she drowns you 'cause you only get to kill your dad once (#YOGKYDO) and you left with an uber ambiguous scene which implies that you're actually still alive). Bus aside from those problems this is a really fun and engrossing experience which will keep calling you back until your seen it through. Tonally this game is very different from the BioShocks and System Shocks in that the gloomy depressed feeling is removed and replaced with this Passive-Aggressive wonderland.

Fantastic story and characters, especially Elizabeth, good graphics, fun combat and an ending that you will not forget so soon. Its just amazing how many work, money and effort was put by the developers of Irrational Games to create this masterpiece. This is gaming at his best and just a few games can match the atmosphere, story, gameplay and the artstyle of Bioshock. The only downside is that there is no multiplayer but the campaign is about 12-15 hours long and when you see the ending you will want to play it again. Believe me, you will.
