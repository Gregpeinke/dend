Everything in this game has been made to the best quality imaginable, even 13 years later most games can only hope to achieve a small portion of what this one has. There is a reason people have wanted Half life 3 for so long and it is indeed a good reason. The story is spot on, revealed piece by piece rather than a huge plot dump. The mystery and horror of an omni-present alien threat oppressing earth and its people after the events of Half Life force the player to live the events and feel the same emotions that the average man does and empathize with them. The gameplay is fun and intuitive with an array of original weapons ranging from the obvious SMG and Shotgun to the classic RPG, the exclusive \"Gravity Gun\" and of course the Half Life staple the crowbar!

It still has the variety that HAlf-Life 1 had, which was the best part of that game and this game. It takes you from a densely populated city to a river marsh, to a freaktown, back to the city, through a desert and into the bloated end of the game.\n\nThe part that makes the game frustrating at some times is that you sometimes don't know where you have to go. This happens a lot in places like [spolier] Ravenholm, during the sequence in which a lot of headcrab zombies keep spawning; somewhat during the antlion buggy sequence; City 17's rebellion, Nova Prospekt and the ending Combine Lab. [/spoiler]\n\n\nAlthough this game does have flaws and such, I would reccomend this game to people who enjoyed Half Life 1 and want to continue the adventure or people looking to play a solid FPS.

Time to review this blunt knife.\n\nCompared to the original half life, I felt what half life 2 gained in atmosphere it lost in gameplay. Where as the original life life was challenging and action packed but lacking in logical environments, half life 2 felt like it was a slow paced tour of an apocalypse.\n\nThere are so many concepts under the half life 2 package that could've been expanded on so brilliantly, and with it could have kept its oppressive atmosphere up a little longer. \nSuch as having you get past more checkpoints. see more oppression and overall actually fear the enemy before trying to worm you way out of a city overrun with dread.\nIt would have been more beneficial to allow the player to continue to feel the dystopia which was portrayed so strongly into the core at the beginning of the game.\nIt felt at first like it was you against never-ending swarms of emotionless, faceless troopers, where as in the end it felt something along the lines of a light bar brawl between a lepricaun and three drunk stormtroopers.\nInstead of trying to switch out atmosphere with mediocre action scenes, it should have instead kept the oppression as a base and worked from that.\n\nWhile the scenes themselves felt unique, the gunplay never felt impactful enough to relate to the original half life's action. I blame this partially on the poor weaponry sound design.\nPuzzles being one of the core gameplay elements, I feel like they never did anything other than waste time walking from point a to point b. \nThe only positives in this regard were the rewarding yet well-hidden lambda stashes strewn throughout the game.\n\nMy main problem with this is that unlike the first half life, where you were expected to rush into limited corridors to blast off foes, I felt that instead of feeling like you were weaving between the cracks, picking off squads of enemies and aliens, half life 2 gave the impression of running straight at the enemy without a care in the world, but only coming across the odd trooper who would miss you for fun.\nThere was so much potential in the portrayal of atmosphere and early action scenes that the mid and end game just felt mediocre in contrast, with relatively too few enemies to give any meaning to your characters forced blind bumble through various terrain.\n\nI felt like a lot of emphasis was trying to be placed on individual enemies working together to overcome the player, but at the same time it was feared that the player would never succeed, so even on harder difficulties, the enemy combatants felt mediocre and forgiving.\nThere were no hidden strategies that made me think \"aha! I could use This to push through these enemies!\" it all just felt very A to B, unlike the first game which was willing to gameify itself enough to actually present fun challenges, such as the silly tripwire room and jumping platforms. \nContrarily to this, it seems that half life 2 tried to be semi-realistic in the sense that it didn't want any \"silly\" scenes and opted for what was effectively mechanical repetition as far as the game mechanics are concerned. Once you beat your first duo of starting troopers, you've beaten them all.\n\nI feel there was no trust in the player to push through the game on their own as the player's hand is held so much throughout the entirety of the game. The first part of action we think we may see and it's ruined by some \"badass\" npc trying to impress us with their ability to disarm soldiers in close quarters, then do nothing but climb for the rest of the game. \nLooking at you, Alyx.\nThe only thing I think this game did well is that the story concluded on a nice cliff-hanger and a quick twist that left a good element of mystery surrounding the game's ending.\n\nTLDR: As an atmospheric shooter, this game should have been consistent with it's initially good atmospherical set-up and scene variance, bringing FPS gameplay into it through unique battles, too, instead of just unique scenes with copy-paste gunplay.","timestamp_created":1495725756,"timestamp_updated":1562118681,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31953243","author":{"steamid":"76561198067567275","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":92,"playtime_forever":1224,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1219,"last_played":1508684966},"language":"english","review":"My requirements of a GOOD game:\n\nFun Game: ✔\nLinux Port: ✔\nGood developers: ✔\n\nOptional:\n\nIndie: ✘\nGood fanbase: ✔\nImmersive: ✔","timestamp_created":1495724841,"timestamp_updated":1495724841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.449738502502441406","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31952195","author":{"steamid":"76561198015454102","num_games_owned":356,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":855,"last_played":1605003425},"language":"russian","review":"ЭТО КЛАССИКА!
