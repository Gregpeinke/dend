[/h1]\nЛегендарная игра, которая стала началом всех игр Valve: Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, Portal, а так же, легендарной франшизы Half-Life. Сюжет неоднозначный: история учёного Гордона Фримэна, которому поручили провести эксперимент в комплексе Black Mesa, но что-то пошло не так... Сюжет одновременно хорош и плох. Хорош в том, что очень много неожиданных сюжетных поворотов, а плох - потому что ОЧЕНЬ МНОГО НЕНУЖНОГО!!! Зачем было делать 19 ГЛАВ, если 2/3 сюжета можно легко убрать и от этого хуже не станет! Игра будет всё той же прекрасной и не урезанной! Очень много непонятных глав, где ты ломаешь себе голову и порой у тебя это получается. Гордон [strike] Дмитрий[/strike] Фримэн стал легндой ПК игр, а ведь Half-Life выходила ещё и на PS2! Мультиплеер хорош. Его наличие скрашивает игру и добавляет разнообразие. Онлайн высокий и найти сервер 15-20 онлайна не составит проблем. Но берегитесь игроков с Гаузом (они зачастую скиловее вас раз в 100). Я люблю эту игру и рад что существуют такие ремейки этой игры, как Black Mesa. 8/10.

I'll boot it up, have a good time, and then be done to take a break. Half Life is different. It's a game that almost demands a single sitting, as each level progresses to the next almost seamlessly, save for a very brief loading screen and one instance that marks the end of the first half of the game. Even after that, I kept on playing all the way up to the infamous Xen sections. Xen was admittedly not as painful as I thought it would be, though perhaps Doom Eternal made me accept that first person platforming could be fun. Regardless, this is an easy recommendation.

I remember playing this as a 9 year old on my cousin's PC and I told myself this is the most realistic game I had ever seen. The most horrifying experience I ever had was encountering the alien possessed scientist for the first time and all I had was my pistol. It felt that I was actually holding my gun and I was fighting for my life. And I remember dying a couple of times.  Bear in mind, it was 1999 and the only games I was exposed to was Super Mario and Contra. \n\nAfter playing for the first time, I had dreams about this game. I thought about this game all the time during breakfast, school time, homework and at bed. I didn't have a computer like my cousin's so I told myself when I would grow up, I will get a job and buy myself a computer with Half Life and that's it, I will be settled for life. Again bear in mind, I was 9 at that time.\n\nFast forward, 20 years later, I download this and play it, and my impressions are this (and I am trying to be unbiased while having my nostalgia goggles off ), the graphics and gameplay mechanics are way too outdated, the shooting is mediocre and I can kill that alien scientist with my eyes closed. So if you got into gaming very late, played all the AC, Far Cry, GTA, all those  high budget AAA games and then playing this, and thinking \"I don't get why this game is great\", I get it, I feel the same way at times, its too outdated. Its amazing how the games have come so far, considering I once thought Half Life had the most \"realistic graphics\" ever.\n\nSo, would I recommend this game ? Hell, yes. \n\nTbh, I'm just playing it for nostagia's sake, but as I play it, I can't help but feel some of the things this game did right that we don't see in today's games, the setting. the mood. the tone of the environment. Its just a mix of horror, anticipation,excitement, you have no idea whats going to happen in the next room, and it all happen in real time, in first person, in your perspective. No cutscenes, no in game movies. You don't see that many games do that today, and that is what makes me appreciate Half Life.\nThis game will still be forever in my heart as one of the best games ever made.\nMy cousin is no more. R.I.P.
