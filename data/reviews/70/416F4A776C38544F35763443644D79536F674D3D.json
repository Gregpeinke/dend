É Half-Life, não tem o que falar [/h1]\n\nAssim como GTA San Andreas e Minecraft, você é moralmente obrigado á gostar desse jogo, caso contrário, você merece ser deportado do planeta terra.\n\nEsse jogo envelheceu melhor que alguns outros da mesma época, todos os controles são extremamente funcionais (por mais que eu ache que o Freeman corra mais rápido do que um humano mediano), os gráficos nem chegam a importar e além de tudo, a história não tem traços ou ideias antigas, um jogo hoje em dia poderia facilmente ter uma lore inteira baseada na ideia de fugir da base depois de uma explosão catastrófica de um reator. O único ponto ruim em questões técnicas é a inteligência artificial, e se todos os outros pontos não fossem absurdamente funcionais em pleno 2022 (por se tratar literalmente do milênio passado) daria pra relevar, mas a falta de humanidade nos inimigos chega a impressionar.\n\nOutro ponto que me deixou intrigado é o fato de que em nenhum momento do jogo você tem um objetivo definido, a gameplay flui tão estranhamente bem que parece realmente que você realmente é o Freeman. Até onde conseguir conferir avaliações, a atmosfera desse jogo só perde para Shadow of the Colossus. Você não se sente como um jogador, você realmente se sente como o próprio personagem. Você está (ou estava) tão bem acompanhado, seguro e assegurado e do nada, isso acaba, e cabe à você, unicamente e exclusivamente à você sair da Black Mesa e resolver tudo.\n\nE quando você para e raciocina que esse jogo foi inteiramente produzido em 1998, você para, pensa, e chama quem te passou essa informação de mentiroso.\n\nE apesar de todos os bons pontos que eu listei, eu não gostei tantokkk\n\nO jogo é bom sim, isso é indiscutível, porém, não é meu estilo de jogo, não sei exatamente o que esse jogo conseguiu falhar comigo, porém, infelizmente não consegui terminar o jogo. Eu baixei dublagem, me desconectei de tudo para poder focar na história (normalmente jogo ouvindo música ou vídeo) e o resultado foi... não gostei.\n\nEu recomendo, mas, assim como todo jogo, analisa antes de comprar (por mais que eu tenha colocado só 5 reais nisso).\n\n24/06/2022\nO jogo é do meu estilo sim, eu só não tinha paciência para poder terminarkkk\n\nJoguem esse jogo na primeira oportunidade que tiver, (aproveita a sale de agora)\n\nQUE JOGO FANTÁSTICO","timestamp_created":1644263615,"timestamp_updated":1656098520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109738984","author":{"steamid":"76561199061256250","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84,"last_played":1654171710},"language":"russian","review":"у меня один раз случилась забавная история с этой игрой.

est un jeu de tir à la première personne, développé par Valve Corporation et publié par Sierra le 19 novembre 1998 pour Microsoft Windows. Il est ensuite publié sur la plate-forme Steam depuis 2003 et disponible depuis janvier 2013 pour Mac et Linux. Le jeu utilise une version profondément modifiée du Quake engine, appelée GoldSrc. Le jeu a également été porté sur PlayStation 2 et publié le 15 novembre 2001.\n\nDans ce premier épisode de la saga Half-Life, le joueur incarne le docteur Gordon Freeman, un théoricien récemment diplômé qui, après des expériences de téléportation qui ont mal tourné, doit se battre contre les créatures extraterrestres accidentellement apparues dans le complexe puis contre un commando de militaires envoyés par le gouvernement pour nettoyer la zone.\n\nÀ la sortie du jeu, la critique a salué sa présentation générale et ses nombreuses séquences scénarisées, et lui a remis une cinquantaine de prix le consacrant jeu de l'année au cours des années 1998 et 1999. Half-Life a grandement influencé le monde du jeu de tir à la première personne, notamment parce qu'il a été le premier jeu de cette catégorie à apporter une intrigue scénaristique forte. Depuis, ce jeu est considéré comme l'un des plus grands. Avec plus de huit millions d'exemplaires vendus depuis, Half-Life est un véritable best-seller du jeu de tir subjectif sur PC. La franchise Half-Life a connu plus de 15 millions de ventes.

Half-Life, que relação difícil que eu tenho com você...\n\nDurante minhas primeiras horas de jogo eu estava amando. A cada área nova que eu chegava eu explorava tudo, já que o jogo te recompensava muito bem com suprimentos, mas a partir de um ponto, essas explorações começaram a ser desnecessárias e, inclusive, em algumas situações eu saía perdendo. Half-Life possui sim seus pontos fortes em level design, mas não chega a ser um ótimo level design, é longe disso.\n\nNão é recomendável pular entre plataformas em cima de uma piscina de ácido enquanto você corre a 40km/h. Moral da história: não faça um jogo com movimentação tipo DOOM e que tenha plataformas minúsculas para progredir.\n\nXen é definitivamente a pior reta final que eu já em todos os jogos que já joguei, literalmente tudo nessa área é péssimo, e o boss final tá incluido nesse pacote de bosta que é Xen.\n\nSALVEM CONSTANTEMENTE ESSE JOGO! Eu devo ter terminado o jogo com mais de 150 saves, já que é muito fácil morrer em 5 segundos devido ao dano extremamente alto dos inimigos.\n\nHeadcrab, Alien Grunt, Ichthyosaur e Alien Controller, eu odeio todos vocês do fundo do meu coração, e espero que todos queimem no fogo do inferno.\n\nÉ uma relação bem complicada que eu tenho com esse jogo. Ele tem mais pontos positivos do que negativos, mas os pontos negativos são mais fortes do que os positivos, então a balança pesa mais pros mesmos. Acho ruim, mas gosto. Recomendo todos jogarem pra pelo menos terem essa experiência. Tenho certeza de que Half-Life foi extremamente importante pro gênero FPS e pros jogos num geral e pretendo estudar sobre todo o processo de construção e criatividade por trás dele.\n\nHalf-Life é infelizmente um jogo datado.","timestamp_created":1644212734,"timestamp_updated":1644212734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109695624","author":{"steamid":"76561198838676636","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":390,"last_played":1649101549},"language":"english","review":"For me its a really interesting exprience.

Every map feels like a puzzle, it lets you figure out for yourself what you will do, the game is pretty fun honestly, even when it feels so frustrating to play sometimes, I still feel the fun it is. I really liked the weapons used in this game, the mechanics are very awesome, especially the Gluon Gun, it's like the most OP weapon in the game, even though it consumes like a lot of ammo. Should you play this game? Yes. Should you finish this game? Absolutely. Should you play this game first before the sequel? Depends, this game tells it's story on what on earth happened in Black Mesa and on Earth, but if you do not want to play, I'd say your gonna miss out honestly. This game was pretty fun, even when times you just wanna skip the game, it's still worth it. 8.6/10.
