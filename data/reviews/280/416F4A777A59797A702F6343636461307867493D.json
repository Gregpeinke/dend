I know that even on release fans were disappointed by how lazy this game was (which is how black mesa began iirc).\n\nJust... Don't buy it, and if you get it through the valve complete pack then don't waste your time on it. This is just a very very lazy port of Half-Life to a very very old source engine. Result is a very very buggy mess that is broken. I mean... it *is* playable but like... ai is just broken (I know for a fact the soldier ai isn't supposed to be this hard), some code is fucked (example: vorts don't charge their attack faster on hard) and the map dimensions are all wrong (you jump slightly higher as a result).\n\nIf you want to play Half-Life but the original game is a little out of date for you then you have two options.\n1) Black Mesa: A reimagination of the classic game from 1998 (note that it is a reimagining and not a \"remaster\").
