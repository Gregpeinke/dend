Биошок доказал,что своей композицией из геймплея, сюжета и графики игра может тягаться с любым произведением популярных жанров -будь то литература или фильмография,а в своей интерактивностью и превосходить их.\nИнфинит в моих глазах это великолепное заключение трилогии,начатой в подводном рапчуре, локация небесной Колумбии сначала засталяют нас засомневаться в приемственности истории,за исключения заголовка игры, но чем дальше мы продвигались по сюжету,тем яснее вырисовывались ниточки,связывающие цикл.

А Элизабет..она просто великолепна. За ее гаммой эмоции безбожно приятно наблюдать... Она просто идеальный женский персонаж,сотверенный с предельным вниманием и любовью разработчиков.Не хочется вдаваться в извилины сюжета,который тут не просто хорош,а очень хорош.Он хорош настолько,что заставляет ломать голову после прохождения,а некоторые ответы даст только в ДЛС. Ну и финал истории заставил мне,а так же моих зрителей,которые следили за историей через экран ТВ,выведеный Hdmi с ПК, с разинутыми ртами...ДЛС не испривало наш шок,а только усугубило его.Ибо я считал ,что финал должен был быть другим.Но с историей Инфинит,прям как с романами Мураками, ломать голову и выдумывать варианты альтернвтив -вполне реально и по фану.

Она поражает своим масштабом, красотой и технологичностью. На первый взгляд Колумбия — обитель тепла, любви и дружности. Чтобы стать частью всего этого, надо лишь принять крещение и начать поклоняться пророку. А, ну ещё быть Европейцем. \n\nBioShock Infinite — социальная, футуристичная и фантастическая игра. Она вопиюще демонстрирует всё: жестокость, неравенство, предательство, жертвенность. Поднимает тему отцов и детей, ответственности, принятия, смирения.

Инфинит — яркое пятно, которое ослепляет тебя; кажется, что всё видно, как на ладони, но на деле за поворотом может оказаться обрыв. \n\nУ BioShock Infinite замечательный сюжет, запутанный, сложный, всепоглощающий. Но мне по атмосфере ближе первые два Биошока. Хотя я бы не стала их рекомендовать всем, Инфинит в этом плане более универсальный. \n\nЕсли ты не играл в BioShock Infinite — время пришло.

Ближний бой это вообще! Без улучшений оно абсолютно бесполезно, и хз зачем добавили ближние добивания, когда у врага остаётся хп на 2 выстрела. Конечно, тут есть энергетики, которые разнообразят геймплей, например: использовать против врагов воронов, а потом их отвлеченных закидать огненными шарами, или загипнотизировать их технику и расстрелять в спину, но этого оказалось для меня недостаточно, да и пользовался я этим не очень часто...От боевой темы кровь из ушей через несколько часов. А боссы...ну, мне не запомнились как ужас, кроме леди комсток...Это ад какой-то, ты умрёшь десятки раз перед тем как ее убить, потому что кроме нее на арене много врагов, а патронов максимум на пол ее полоски хватает, часть из которой она восстанавливает после твоей смерти, а тебе дают кучку патронов и приходится бегать по локации в поисках другого оружия(а из-за множества врагов сдохнуть не проблема)...Ох, самый худший момент в игре...И эту игру я забросил после второго с ней боя.\n\nЯ думаю, эту игру лучше посмотреть в виде игрофильма, вместо того, чтобы играть.

[/h1] \n[hr][/hr] \n\nFirst thing I have to say about Infinite is that it gave me motion sickness as soon as I started playing it. Pretty bad, to the extent that I almost puked the first time. Bioshock 1 and 2 didn't do this. I went to the files to fix the following:\n\nC:\\Users\\yourname*\\OneDrive\\Documents\\My Games\\BioShock Infinite\\XGame\\Config\n\ngo in there and find the following:\n[code]DefaultbReduceMotionSickness=1[/code]\n[code]bReduceMotionSickness=True[/code] (I have to say that this setting kept changing automatically to False so I was never really able to change this)\n[code]MaxUserFOVOffsetPercent=90.000000[/code]\n\nwith all this done, I think the only TRUE thing that helped was the last line of code that changed the FOV to 90 and I was able to adjust the FOV slider in the options menu a lot better. Now, the BEST thing that helped the motion sickness was to stop running in the game. When you run it has a head bobbin movement that is truly horrible and there is no way of turning that off, thanks developers, so I just stopped running altogether. I literally walked everywhere in this game like a nerd. Elizabeth wanted me to hurry up,... nope, you're going to have to wait for my slow ass to get there.\n[hr][/hr] \n\nNow let's get into the actual game.\n\nI am a fan of the first two games. I absolutely love them. This was the perfect continuation to the series. It's a story rich game that it's so fast paced that you know you're missing things as you play along. important plots are being missed cause of the euphoria you feel at the moment because you just got jumped by like 10 guys and are out of ammo and have to get that while at the same time listening to the story. I'm used to that from playing the first two games so I was expecting it. Regardless of the quick pace, the game is marvelous. I absolutely loved this game. It can also be played as a “stand alone” FPS if you haven't played the first two, just don't play the DLC's Burial at Sea until you play 1 and 2.\n\nAs a continuation of the story, it really doesn't tie well UNTIL you play the DLC's Burial at Sea. My god, what a story that is. I have no idea why those are DLC's, they should've been a mandatory continuation after playing Infinite. Those DLC's hold the key to tying the stories from Bioshock 1 and Infinite and they made that in such a superb way that is just a masterpiece. It's an incredibly story rich game with many ways of interpreting it. I truly recommend playing 1,2, Infinite and then the DLC's to fully tie all the loose ends. Watch YouTube videos if you need a better explanation of the events.\n\nGetting the whole franchise during a summer/winter sale just gives you the best deal for a timeless franchise that will give you bang for your buck. Just get it.

I don't think you can really mix the past and the future together very well. While I still stand by this, the colonial-themed future idea is kind of cool.  I think this is an interesting take on an alternate history where we figured out how to make entire cities float using quantum science. The game itself is a lot of fun to play, and the story is definitely interesting.\n\n  Graphically, very unimpressive by today's standards. But it was 2013 when this came out, so I can't say much about that. Also, quick little note on Elizabeth: Why she built like that? Like jesus she has no midriff. Her figure reminds me of ReeKid saying \"You're not dummy thicc, you're dummy stick.\" And if you add that plus her big eyes, she ends up looking like a 1900s Alita Battle Angel. Not a complaint, I just thought maybe I could get some jokes in. But for real, that is a slender woman. \n\nGameplay is pretty good, but the controls are low key garbage. Yeah, standard WASD keys for moving, and shooting is left mouse, but the melee button is a bit of a ways off from the main key area (V key). I haven't actually tried to change the key configurations yet cause I've been so lost in the actual game. But I think better defaults should have been Q to change weapons, E as a function key, right mouse to aim, and middle mouse to use Vigors. I would use mouse five as my melee button, but if you don't have an epic gamer mouse, figure something else out or go buy one. The arsenal isn't anything super huge, like COD, but its also not small, like in SUPERHOT. Its got a mid size arsenal, but regardless of size there's a weapon for everyone: A pistol, a revolver, a couple automatic weapons, a sniper rifle, a marksman rifle, a shotgun, and some heavy weaponry like RPGs. \n\nThe story is pretty cool. Its got kind of a scientific yet supernatural vibe to it. The idea with Elizabeth is that she can open portals, or \"tears\" as she calls them, which can bring you to a parallel universe or bring something onto the battlefield, like a spot to grapple onto or an automated turret. So her \"Dad,\" the prophet Comstock, thought that was scary so he and his wife locked Elizabeth up in a tower, and now you have to rescue her to pay back some kind of debt to some loan sharks (I guess?).\n\nI really like this game. Its definitely a good buy for FPS fans, and especially steampunk fans. I got it on sale for a little over 7 bucks, and I've gotten 6 hours of gameplay as of the time writing this review. I don't like spending a lot of money on games, so whether or not you should sacrifice like 30 bucks for this is up to you, cause I can't say. 4/5 stars, very happy with this!\n\nEdit: Finished the game a couple hours ago. That was just under 7 hours of gameplay, and there's not multiplayer. Definitely not worth 30 bucks, get it on sale.
