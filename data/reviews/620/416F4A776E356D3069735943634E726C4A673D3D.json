A sudden shake-off of the room which reveals the room is actually one container of 10 thousand people multi-complex. The show begins with an tremendous fashion. It appeals the player right away as if it is inviting them into the story.\n\nAnd right away do you also feel the witty sarcasm which exists throughout the entire game. When the robot manager tell you: `This is art, stare at the art for 5 seconds.' and then plays classical music, it just makes me smile. The script writers are geniuses. The lines are comical but not too funny, and with a sense of dark humor. The robot themselves are always joking around with the death or termination of themselves, and sometimes to each other too. Almost childish but not overdone. Especially GLaDOS herself is a very charming character, I have to confess I fell in love with GLaDOS when she tried to talk Wheatley into a paradox, and mumbling \"dont think about it dont think about it\". It's just so cute.\n\nThe story and background setting are definitely deepened deliberately this time. When I played the first three chambers I was kind of worried they are just remaking Portal 1 - because I played 2 right after 1 so I could remember the puzzles as the same. Gladly they weren't! It's a fairly lengthy brand new game - about 8 hours - and every minute of it worths it. They put a lot of effort laying the background and showing the player how Aperture and the facility come to be. They laid huge architectural work for the game, I couldn't even imagine how big the facility is because it was so massive, there are so many rooms which you can't see the top end or the bottom end - which surprisingly reminds me of BioShock not at the time of playing but now. I've seen Valve done this large-world trick before in Half-Life 2, and I know they are getting good at it because this one is even better.\n\nMusic is great, not repetitive and well paced. Voice acting is tremendous, both Wheatley and GLaDOS.\n\nThe end game was also very good (and surprising!). I'm very happy that they didn't make the final boss very hard - after all, who would want to fight a difficult boss after solving all the puzzles? The tired player deserves a relaxed good show.\n\n10/10, I haven't felt this kind of excitement for years, and Portal 2 brought it to me. It's a fine piece of work and I strongly recommended it.\n\nPs: I haven't played the multiplayer yet, but I heard it's very good too.","timestamp_created":1400954908,"timestamp_updated":1400954908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537750363349914551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10220090","author":{"steamid":"76561198024514027","num_games_owned":429,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":929,"last_played":1486172048},"language":"english","review":"A great successor to Portal. It adds just enough to make it feel like a new experience but not so much that it is completely different. Basically what you do in Portal 1 + 2 is interact with 3D environments in order to solve puzzles and achieve your end goal (of escaping the chamber). The platforming elements of the game are light and can be handled equally with keyboard/mouse and with a controller. The puzzles are \"delightfully challenging\". I think the main story mode can be completed in 10 hours or less.\n\nIf you're considering getting Portal 1 or Portal 2, I would recommend playing through Portal 1 first... unless you only want to do multiplayer, then go with 2.","timestamp_created":1400948902,"timestamp_updated":1400948902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10219527","author":{"steamid":"76561198089013791","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2433,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1328,"last_played":1618790451},"language":"english","review":"This is my favorite game!

Like in the original game there are 2 people back, Chell (Hero) and GlaDoS (anti-villan). This game brings up right where Portal ended well kinda as you are in a dorm room? You eventually meet someone named Wheatley who tells you that youve been sleeping for 100 years (clear white lie) and that the entire Laboratory is destroyed because of you (so true). The puzzles in each room increase and so does the story. The Co-op is strongly recommended cause many people do not co-operate with you since every puzzle is literally meant for 2 people. Than comes the beloved Steam Workshop making our lives 200% harder. Since you can make your own level, 99% people will rage quit im not lying its not only true but funny.\nI give this game 9/10 because the co-op mode doesnt have enough features and in my opinion they should add a little more levels in both single and co-op modes.

For example the portal gun wich you will be using a lot. But the manager (Cabe Johnson) of the place tried to build his wife (Caren) as a robot and then they created Glados.

And in this game Portal 2, Chell wakes up in a room and then gets saved by a robot called Weathley (wich is my personal favorite character) he drives the room into a wall and the room gets smashed into pieces. Epic intro!!! Glados is back and you have to escape from Aperture Science... again. This story has so much backstory to it. I have read the comics and watched some interesting theories about the game.\nThe game is a puzzle game so the game has a lot of different puzzle levels. The levels are test chambers that you go through. The puzzles are revolutionary when you have to shoot portals on walls and ceilings to go through them to get to the end of the level (test chamber). \nOverall this game is fantstic.\nMy favorite game ever.     10/10","timestamp_created":1400598623,"timestamp_updated":1400598623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10178696","author":{"steamid":"76561198035326052","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1440,"last_played":1428324501},"language":"polish","review":"Najlepsza gra logiczna, w jaką grałem! \nWymaga dużo myslenia oraz zręczności.

Очень жестокая игра. Вы были предупреждены!\n\nЕщё одна захватывающая игра от Valve от первого лица ! \n\nНачну про одиночную игру, сюжет великолепен, иногда бывают даже неожиданные повороты событий и шутки умело доставляет удовольствие от игры, а кооперативный режим тоже не оставит вас не равнодушным, ведь у вас проявится столько эмоций! Где одни из них: Гнев, злость, отчаяние, разочарование и ненависть на вашего (явно бывшего) друга! \n\nВы наверно подумали, что игра сможет испортить вашу дружбу? Пффф ещё бы! Но это не единственная особенность всея шедевра, совсем нет! Тут можно создать свои тестовые камеры. Вы наверно спросите что это, какова игра и что она представляет? Спокойно, давайте я вам всё объясню, плюс перескажу начало сюжета (И нет это не спойлер).\n\nПо сюжету вам нужно убежать от робота психопата по имени ГЛаДОС , которого вы уже убили (Ну да это спойлер, но как бы вы играли в первую часть. Но даже если вы не играли вы бы всё равно узна… Ой в общем НЕ ВАЖНО!). Важно то что во время побега, вы случайно с вашим дружком (скажем так, роботом компаньоном) активировали его жизненные процессы снова. И тут она назвала вас «МОНСТРОМ». Робот баба, которая хотела вас убить, называет вас «МОНСТРОМ» (Стоп и тут спойлер, ну как бы во время игры вы это и так узнаете. Хотя это же спой… КРЧ НЕ ВАЖНО). Важно то что за такое поведение и вас же потом отправила на тестовые камеры. Где в предысторий, изучали портальную пушку.\n\nВ общем, разработчики создали тестовые камеры для тех людей, которым не было достаточно головоломок в самой игре и создали такую систему, где «ТЫ» творец! Создай \"ТАКУЮ\" тестовую камеру, где реально можно выиграть, но нереально решить головоломку, где можно выиграть. Сложно? Возможно!\n\nВ общем игра некого своего рода пазла. Где можно часами сидеть, думая –Ну как же твоюж налево пройти этот уровень! Хотя по идее этот уровень проходится за 1 минуту, ЗА 1 ЧЁРТОВУЮ МИНУТУ.\n\nИ в этой игре уж очень много да и в правду неожиданных поворотов. Да и концовка игры ну просто «ВАУ»! Какая? Ну яж сказал что спойлеров не будет! Ну кроме тех которые отнеслись к 1-ой части. Но оно так давно вышла, наверно все его сыгра… ЛАДНО ЭТО НЕ ВАЖНО! Важно то что в конце у вас появится столько эмоций! (Ну кроме те которые вы испытали бы в кооперативе). Ведь игра о дружбе, предательстве, одиночестве, пониманий, прощений, разлуки и искренности. И этот шедевр всей игроиндустрий завершили как надо, а ведь не все разработчики способны на это. А это очень важно!\n\nИ тааак: Атмосфера, саундтрэки, оригинальный сюжет, качественная физика!, ко-оп, графическая составляющая и много юмора, очень... прям сидели вечерком, пили кофеёк с Эдди Мёрфи и сочиняли шутки.\n\nТы всё таки хочешь сыграть кооператив со своим другом?
