I passed Portal three times (but I've got a total of 9hrs, not much at all)  and thoroughly enjoyed it; mostly because it's inside the Half-Life universe. I had been wanting to play Portal 2 for a very long time because of it, since the first game was so original and well thought-out. I actually memorised most of the Portal levels and tricks, so I thought Portal 2 wouldn't be a huge challenge, and that it'd be easier. I thought it wouldn't make me think as much as the first game, I was sure of it. And I was wrong.\n\nValve has crafted something astounding with Portal 2. There were about four chambers in which I was so frustrated I just wanted to rip the hair off my skull. The game forced me to think and puzzled me a great deal. When I wasn't stressing myself, shooting portals all over the map and jumping to my death in exasperation every ten seconds, I was astounded and unable to believe how incredibly well made the maps are and how well executed the chambers are. Portal isn't my favourite Valve game, subjectively to me it isn't the best. But objectively, I have to say Portal is Valve's best creation. They have crafted something special in this game, three influential factors (two which I'll count as one): Humour, tragedy/darkness and originality. \n\nThe first factor is evident. Cave Johnson and his speeches are hilarious. GlaDOS is a bitch, and yet her intended-to-be-hurtful comments are hilarious and found a way to make me gasp in both surprise and humour. The long-fall boots, turret trailer and the Portal Valentine's Day video are hilarious to say the very least (and freaking original!).\n\nThe second factor is well covered up by the first factor, but it is still there nevertheless. Portal has a tragic story: that is undeniable. Aperture Laboratories has a tragic, screwed-up background. Test subjects were treated like dirt, the scientists didn't care an iota about their welfare and Cave Johnson didn't even try to hide his contempt towards them. That's why it's screwed-up, but it's tragic because it's an abandoned facility which used to be one of the greatest science companies of all time (even though they had their fair share of controversies) and it wasn't abandoned because of its bankrupcy, or because they ran out of ideas/products. It's because everyone was murdered, dammit! Every single scientist we know of, except Rattman, is dead and just when Aperture had its most promising project under its sleeve. Not a single soul is seen in Aperture; death is such a strong essence in Portal but the tragedy is well masqueraded by the undeniable humour. \n\nThe third and last factor is the most astonishing one: ORIGINALITY. The test chambers, the idea of the game, the execution of physics in the game to make a realistic notion out of the puzzle-solving with the Handheld Portal Device; as bizarre as the idea of a gun which shoots portals in plain surfaces sounds, Valve found a way to make it seem both believable and realistic. Both with the execution of physics in the game and with the explanation of the gun itself. It's incredible. \n\nThese three factors, but the last one specially, is why I consider Portal is the best game Valve has ever made, and why I consider it to be one of the most amazing games to *ever* be created. I recommend it to *everyone*.\n\nThank you Lord Gaben for hiring the folks at Nuclear Monkey Software to create this franchise.

Porém, repetindo a dose do jogo anterior, este aqui também tem coisas puxando-o para trás: os Challenge Maps de novo são difíceis para jogadores casuais, e alguns níveis no modo história requerem uma lógica maior do que no primeiro jogo. Mas tenho que dar os parabéns novamente à Valve pela série, e se você sempre quis jogar co-op com seu amigo mas ele não tem o jogo, pega um ou dois controles de Xbox e vai jogar no PC, este aqui tem co-op local (não sei se ocorre o mesmo nas versões de PS3 e Xbox 360).\n\nNota: 9.5 / 10","timestamp_created":1422819032,"timestamp_updated":1422819032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14285075","author":{"steamid":"76561198045781293","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":406,"last_played":1460207987},"language":"english","review":"Very good game, it puts your mind to the test.
