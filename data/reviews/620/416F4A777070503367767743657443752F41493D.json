Portal était cette petite gemme, recommencable facilement, avec un level design qui posait des bases simples au début du jeu puis tentait d'explorer ces mêmes mécaniques jusqu'à leurs retranchements. Il te présentait peu de nouvelles choses mais poussait les anciennes à l'extrême. Au final, le jeu avait exactement la bonne longueur à mon goût.\nPortal 2 fait beaucoup plus dans la variété, en te balancant de nouvelles choses constamment dans la figure. Néanmoins, je n'ai pas l'impression d'avoir autant vu de variantes dans l'utilisation de ces nouvelles mécaniques.\n\nLes puzzles aussi était beaucoup plus dans le \"trouve le petit pixel de la salle noire dans laquelle il y a une surface compatibles aux portails\", alors que les salles de Portal encouragaient la créativité avec beaucoup de stratégies envisageables. Dans Portal 2, j'avais souvent la sensation de finir un puzzle de la manière dont les développeurs l'avaient prévues, alors qu'une partie du fun de Portal 1 était la sensation d'avoir résolu les énigmes de ta propre manière, tu te sentais créatif. Notez que je ne dis pas qu'il y a une seule manière de résoudre les énigmes : Je suis sûr qu'il y en a plusieurs. \nJe parle du sentiment, du ressenti du joueur. \nJe ne suis pas autant fan de ce que les puzzles tentaient de proposer, c'est tout :/\n\nNéanmoins, Portal 2 BRILLE sur la sympathie de son écriture. Je n'ai pas vraiment rigolé durant l'aventure, mais je vois quand même tout l'effort et la qualité mises en place pour garantir que l'humour était de qualité. \nJ'ai souri un paquet de fois !\nJe ne peux m'empêcher de regretter l'humour plus sombre et subtil de Portal 1, mais Portal 2 a absolument fait le job de ce côté et je n'ai RIEN à redire. \nDonc pour résumer mon avis sur Portal 2 : \n\nDisons que je vois les qualités du jeu, je comprends pourquoi tout le monde sauf moi l'a adoré, il s'agit simplement de préférences de mon côté. \n\nCe que Portal 2 essaye de faire, il le fait bien.\nJe pense juste qu'il aurait pu essayer autre chose. \nIl va de soit que je conseille à toutes et tous de jouer à Portal 2.

playing Portal 2 chiefly do the huge amount of requests I got from friends and viewers to check it out. And I'm glad I did. It's a great party game. It's a game where you get together with friends, and have a big WHODUNIT match, very much like an interactive board game, but better. It's a LOT of fun, when you have people to play with.\n\nHowever, you have to understand that is simply that. A casual, party game meant to be played with friends. It's not a game that requires a great amount of skill, just the ability to be a detective,  it requires you to be an excellent liar. It's definitely a game worth playing, but it isn't a game that you should take and replace your life with.\n\nThe core gameplay loop does get boring relatively quickly, because there is nothing to work towards, nor does it have any real progression mechanics. It simply exists as a fun, round-by-round type game. Nothing more, and nothing less.\n\nI hope you found this review helpful!
