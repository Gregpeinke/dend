This game is a mod of the original half-life that came out in 2000, however because of its thriving community and plethora of mods, its age has only really now begun to show. It places you in a future alternate universe where the entirety of existence depends on your ability to partake in the activity of “Duel to the Death Space Frisbee” or DDSF for short. Below I've made a table to outline all the various elements of the game with a rating at the end.   \n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th][b]Concept[/b][/th]\n        [th][b]Description[/b][/th]\n        [th][b]Rating out of 10[/b][/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story[/td]\n        [td]The story of Ricochet is a deep and complex one. You are placed in a totally new world, where it only seems as if people are interested in this sport \"Space Frisbee\". You are never told anything about your character, except that they are a Space Frisbee player. That being said though, your character is made to be disposable, and when your character dies, it's over. You are placed in the shoes of a new person, who wears the same clothing as you, and sounds the same as you, and often shares the same fate as you. It's a highly critical commentary on today’s culture, where it seems as if people are losing their lives to something arbitrary, almost a sport, for no real distinguishable reason. It makes the player contemplate what they are doing with their lives, and whether it is meaningful or not. I won't spoil the rest of the story for you, but all I can say is that you should look forward to epic conspiracies, insane bosses, and one of the most exciting and fulfilling endings in all of video games.[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]Now, Ricochet is truly one of this games that you can describe as \"easy to learn, difficult to master\". Its gameplay seems simple at first, as it begins with \"throw disc and hit object\" but as you progress you find more ways to play the game using its initial mechanics. First you're introduced with obstacles that your discs bounce off of, allowing you to start having your discs ricochet. The obstacles then change in complexity and usefulness, as near the later parts of the game, you even start to avoid them as they can be very deadly. There are different power-ups for your discs that change the way you use them, which gives a greater feeling of accomplishment when you figure out how to use one of the power-ups to its fullest affect. Ricochet’s gameplay respects player intelligence by giving you many different ways to play. The depth of the mechanics have been compared to dwarf fortress, and although I wouldn't go that far I can certainly see players sinking thousands of hours into this game trying to really figure everything out for themselves.[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Graphics[/td]\n        [td]There isn't too much to say here. For a game that came out 14 (now nearly 15) years ago, it looks quite good. When in came out it was among the best looking games to date, and remained that way until about 2005. Despite looking a bit aged its color and stylistic focus make it easy and pleasant on the eyes, while still allowing for good atmosphere.[/td]\n        [td]8[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]I'll just start out by say the multiplayer is AMAZING. It captures the cinematic and atmospheric feel of the single player, while allowing player interaction in a diverse open world. You're allowed to find various \"Arenas\" in which you may do battle with your friends to see who's the best at DDSF. With a booming community, and an incredible amount of modded servers you can easily find yourself playing this multiplayer for hours on end. Even though it's been 14 years, because of its very in-depth gameplay and large community, the Ricochet multiplayer is still one of the best you can find on this platform.[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nAll in all, I'd give this game a 10/10. Everything about it is amazing and enjoyable, from its single player, multi-player, stunning visuals, in-depth gameplay, and did I mention its kickin' soundtrack? Well it's amazing. Seriously, if you don't have this game, you need to fix that right now.\n\nTL;DR In my opinion one of the best games valve has ever made, I highly recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1419629812,"timestamp_updated":1419629812,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":61,"votes_funny":72,"weighted_vote_score":"0.782167255878448486","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13581274","author":{"steamid":"76561198070051934","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":132,"last_played":1443933608},"language":"english","review":"Very fun and addictive, though it's enraging when one starts out. \n3.5 out of 5 stars.","timestamp_created":1419477660,"timestamp_updated":1419477660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13579790","author":{"steamid":"76561198146560031","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":18,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1543724337},"language":"english","review":"this game is actually really good it should gain a cult following,it is definetly an underrated gem of the steam community.","timestamp_created":1419469042,"timestamp_updated":1419469042,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514802634716033936","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13576390","author":{"steamid":"76561198044816629","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":81,"last_played":1449346166},"language":"english","review":"Triple Fast Freeze Power Shot Simulator 2000.\n\nOh.

Today the community of active players is small and there are not a lot of games to join (I just found a couple of servers with 2 people each). I got this game for free with Counter Strike 1.6 and decided to give it a go. It's a Tron type game with the matching visuals. The gameplay is about disk throwing and pushing your opponents off the platforms. Which is great but lack of people to actually play with pulls down the score a little bit. However even dueling one person is good fun so I recommend it.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1417903750,"timestamp_updated":1495267074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515138030052185059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13244269","author":{"steamid":"76561198111161269","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1484099849},"language":"english","review":"What an underrated game.
