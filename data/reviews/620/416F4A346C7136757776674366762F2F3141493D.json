I don't think they could have found a better voice for... the guy who funded and owned aperture science, I forgot his name, I don't know why. GlaDOS is one of the most hilarious characters in a video game, period. Her monotone delivery and deadpan lines is hysterical, nearly every line that comes out of her... metal audio thing? Anyways, it's just perfect. Wheatly on paper sounds like he'd get annoying and grating quickly, but he stays just as funny the entire time, probably even funnier as the campaign continues. Does the twist that happen a while through the game shock me? No. Was it well executed and still a bit surprising? Yes. The visual style is phenomenal, the overgrown vines and moss contrasting with the white and gray modern testing labs looks amazing. This is super well optimized, since there usually any entities that need to be spawned.
