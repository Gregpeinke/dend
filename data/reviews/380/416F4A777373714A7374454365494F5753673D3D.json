I couldn t believe it was quite this good. I chuckled in muddled disbelief, expectations utterly defied. My nervous fingers reloaded the level, knowing that I had to see that breathtaking sequence one more time. It was then that I knew for certain: Valve had surpassed not only themselves, but everyone else too. Half-Life 2 is an astounding accomplishment. It is the definitive statement of the last five years of first-person shooters. Everything else was just a stopgap.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a near perfect sequel. It takes almost everything that worked from Half-Life and either improves on it, or keeps it much the same. But that simple summation undersells how the Valve team have approached this task. Half-Life 2 is a linear shooter with most of the refinements one would expect from years of work, but it is also a game of a higher order of magnitude than any of the previous pretenders to the throne. The polish and the stratospheric height of the production values mean that Half-Life 2 is a magnificent, dramatic experience that has few peers.\n\nIt would be madness for me to spoil this game by talking about the specific turn of events, so spoilers are going to be kept to a minimum. We re going to talk about general processes and the elements of style and design that make Half-Life 2 such an energising experience. Key to this is the way in which Gordon s tale is told. Once again we never leave his perspective. There are no cutscenes, no moment in which you are anything but utterly embedded in Gordon s view of the world. Everything is told through his eyes. And what a story it is. Gordon arrives at the central station at City 17 a disruptive and chilling dystopia. And from there? Well, that would be telling. This is not the contemporary America that Gordon seemed to be living in during the original Half-Life. The events of Black Mesa have affected the whole world. The crossover with Xen has meant that things have altered radically, with hyper-technology existing alongside eastern bloc dereliction.\n\n\n\nThe world is infested with head-crab zombies and the aliens that were once your enemies now co exist amongst the oppressed masses. This very European city is populated by frightened and desperate American immigrants, and sits under the shadow of a vast, brutalist skyscraper that is consuming the urban sprawl with crawling walls of blue steel. It s a powerful fiction. City 17 is one of the most inventive and evocative game worlds we ve ever seen. The autocratic and vicious behaviour of the masked Overwatch soldiers immediately places you in a high-pressure environment. People look at you with desperate eyes, just waiting for the end to their pain, an end to the power of the mysterious Combine. Who are they? Why are you here? Who are the masterminds behind this tyranny? The questions pile up alongside the bodies.\n\nHalf-Life 2 isn t big on exposition, but the clues are there. You re thrust into this frightening near-future reality and just have to deal with it. Your allies are numerous, but they have their own problems. Your only way forward is to help them. And so you do, battling your way along in this relentless, compelling current of violence and action, gradually building up a picture of what has happened since Black Mesa. The Combine, the military government that controls the city in a boot-stamping-face kind of way, are a clear threat, but quite how they came to be and what their purposes are become aching problems. Once again Gordon remains silent, listening to what he is told so that you can find those answers for yourself.\n\nBut even with Gordon s vaguely sinister silence (something that is transformed into a subtle joke by the game s characters) there are reams of dialogue in Half-Life 2. It is spoken by bewilderingly talented actors and animated with almost magical precision. Alyx, Eli, Barney and Dr Kleiner are delightful to behold, but they only tell part of the story. There are dozens of other characters, each with their own role to play. And each one is a wondrous creature. They might be blemished, even scarred, with baggy eyes and greasy hair, but you can t tear your eyes away. People, aliens and even crows, have never seemed quite so convincing in a videogame. Doom 3 s lavish monsters are more impressive, but Half-Life 2 s denizens are imbued with life. More importantly, they offer respite. Half-Life 2 s world is a high-bandwidth assault on the senses that seldom lets up. That moment when you see a friendly face is a palpable relief. A moment of safe harbour in a world of ultraviolence. As Gordon travels he is aided by the citizens of City 17 and the underground organisation that aims to fight the oppressors. Their hidden bases are, like the characters who inhabit them, hugely varied an abandoned farm, a lighthouse, a canyon scrapyard and an underground laboratory each superbly realised.\n\n\n\nIt is this all-encompassing commitment to flawless design that makes Half-Life 2 so appealing. Even without the cascade of inventiveness that makes up the action side of events, the environments become a breathtaking visual menagerie. Cracked slabs and peeling paint, future-graffiti and mossy slate, tufts of wild grass and flaking barrels, shattered concrete and impenetrable tungsten surfaces City 17 and its surrounding landscape make you want to keep exploring, just to see what might be past the next decaying generator or mangled corpse. Whether you find yourself in open, temperate coastline or mired in terrifying technological hellholes, Half-Life 2 presents a perfect face. The first time you see ribbed glass blurring the ominous shape of a soldier on the other side, or any time that you happen to be moving through water, you will see next-generation visuals implemented in a casual, capable manner. Half-Life 2 doesn t have Doom 3 s groundbreaking lighting effects, but objects and characters still have their own real-time shadows and the level design creates a play of light and dark that diminishes anything we ve seen in other games. The very idea that people have actually created this world by hand seems impossible, ludicrous. The detritus in the back of a van, the rubbish that lies in a stairwell it all seems too natural to have come about artificially. Add to this the split-second perfection of the illustrative music, as well as the luscious general soundscape, and you have genuinely mind-boggling beauty.\n\nBut these virtual environments are little more than a stage on which the action will play out. And what jaw-dropping, mind-slamming action that is. What s tough to convey in words, or even screenshots, is just how much impact the events of combat confer. This is a joyous, kinetic, action game. The concussive sound effects, combined with the physical solidity of weapons, objects, enemies and environment, make this a shocking experience. Each encounter is lit up with abrupt and impressively brutal effects. Explosions spray shrapnel and sparks, bullets whack and slam with devastating energy. The exploding barrel has never been such a delight. You think that you ve seen exploding barrels before, but no: these impromptu bombs, like everything else in the game, are transformed by the implementation of revelatory object physics. Unlike previous games, the object physics in Half-Life 2 are no longer a visual gimmick they are integral to the action and, indeed, the very plot.\n\nGordon can pick up anything that isn t bolted down and place, drop or hurl it anywhere you choose. Initially this consists of little more than shifting boxes so that you can climb out of a window, but gradually tasks increase in complexity. Puzzles, ever intuitive, are well signposted and entertaining. If they re tougher than before they re still just another rung up on what you ve already learned. This is immaculate game design. There are a couple of moments in these twenty hours where something isn t perfect in its pace or placing,","timestamp_created":1450843557,"timestamp_updated":1450935943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19850898","author":{"steamid":"76561198151697493","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":465,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":465,"last_played":1450983647},"language":"english","review":"Best Summary and a Awesome Game :D!!!","timestamp_created":1450817345,"timestamp_updated":1450817345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19850526","author":{"steamid":"76561198070254994","num_games_owned":386,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1450816183},"language":"english","review":"Quite a good little journey.","timestamp_created":1450816678,"timestamp_updated":1450816678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19844272","author":{"steamid":"76561198243009122","num_games_owned":319,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":341,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":341,"last_played":1450539243},"language":"schinese","review":"虽然没有第二章那么精彩，但同样跌宕起伏","timestamp_created":1450797064,"timestamp_updated":1450797064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19833856","author":{"steamid":"76561198047645676","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":470,"last_played":1439603774},"language":"english","review":"I think I actually sat and listened to the entire broadcast.","timestamp_created":1450743647,"timestamp_updated":1450743647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466666668653488159","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19833486","author":{"steamid":"76561198093220408","num_games_owned":289,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1656628553},"language":"english","review":"The only reason I don't recommend this game because they put episode one there instead of 3 \n\n\n\n\nThat was a joke buy this game \n\nI AM STILL CLICKING NON-RECOMMENDATION","timestamp_created":1450741292,"timestamp_updated":1450741292,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19825529","author":{"steamid":"76561197990669989","num_games_owned":891,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":810,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life!!!\n\nUpdated with Steam Achievements ;-)","timestamp_created":1450712618,"timestamp_updated":1450712679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19818546","author":{"steamid":"76561198054557242","num_games_owned":828,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1351148400},"language":"english","review":"Did I must say something ?","timestamp_created":1450677285,"timestamp_updated":1450677285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496240615844726563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19808934","author":{"steamid":"76561198129465435","num_games_owned":497,"num_reviews":592,"playtime_forever":816,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":153,"last_played":1623557278},"language":"turkish","review":"Half -

Сразу стоит заметить - игра чертовски короткая и это безусловно главный недостаток. Короткая даже для дополнения. \n\nДостоинств и сильных сторон в Episode One безусловно больше чем минусов. Эксперименты с освещением и мимикой персонажей явно пошли на пользу. HDR сделал картинку более реалистичной и красочной.\n\nОпределенно стоит отметить прогресс в работе над ИИ, наглядно продемонстрированный через Аликс. И вообще, ее персонаж занимает в этом дополнении очень значимую роль. На протяжении всей игры игроку предстоит взаимодействовать с ней как в боях так и решая разные задачи. Само собой это делает геймплей более проработанным и утонченным.\n\nА вот ИИ врагов не претерпел особых изменений в сравнении с hl2. Зато появился новый вид зомби - зомбайн, комбайн с хеэдкрабом на голове. Достаточно остроумное решение.\n\nА какое веселье начинается в самый разгар сюжетной линии! Как раз в самый нужный момент начинает звучать бодрая музыка настраивающая на нужный лад и вот тут то и начинается тот самый экшн, который Valve умеют создавать не хуже мифов о 3-ей части франшизы. Из под земли лезут орды муравьиных львов, со всех сторон прут зомби, бегут отряды альянса, все взрывается, грохочет, в разные стороны летят мертвые тела всех мастей. Все против всех, как и заведено с первой части. \n\nНу а вообще, в дополнении не так уж много свежих идей. Все улучшения в основном по технической части. Это все тот же hl2 только лучше в некоторых технических особенностях.\n\nАх да, та самая убогая миссия с эвакуацией гражданских мне тоже не понравилась.
