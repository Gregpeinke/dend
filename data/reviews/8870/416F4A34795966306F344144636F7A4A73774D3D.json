I can't deny that the game looks great, has very good characters, an interesting story and setting, and solid overall mechanics. But i do personally feel it could be a lot better.\n\nThe two big problems i have with this game is the weapons/2 weapon limit, and the movement. Arguably the two most important aspects of an FPS is the guns and movement and this is where I feel the game lacks. First off the guns aren't too bad but only a few are really good without upgrades. And upgrading can be annoying since you won't have enough money to buy all the upgrades but you won't know what weapons you will have for certain parts of the game, and this issue is only made worse by the 2 weapon limit. Certain arenas were just no fun since i had to use bad/non-upgraded weapons to beat it since i ran out of ammo, not very fun. And now the movement; when the game has the skylines in the arenas they are pretty good and add a lot to the movement, but when there are no skylines it just turns into COD. Hiding behind cover waiting for shields to come back then poking out and taking a couple shots before being hit yourself and needing to go back in cover. The absence of the skylines from certain arenas just turn them into slogs since the games base movement is not good. \n\nBut overall i can't give a negative review just because i personally feel it is overrated, so if it's on sale pick it up.","timestamp_created":1650825386,"timestamp_updated":1651771238,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114411325","author":{"steamid":"76561198290970685","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":953,"last_played":1651811223},"language":"spanish","review":"No le entendí el final pero estuvo bueno xd","timestamp_created":1650821032,"timestamp_updated":1650821032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114406790","author":{"steamid":"76561198804002809","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":838,"last_played":1650781203},"language":"english","review":"Excellent game!!

[/b] [/h1]\n\n[b] BioShock Infinite [/b] is the third entry in the series but it's not called BioShock 3 and it has mostly nothing to do with the first two games.\n\n[h2] Gameplay [/h2]\nGameplay has been massively altered from the first two. Booker DeWitt, the main protagonist, is given a two weapon limit(bro momento) and a regenerating shield ala Halo. Unlike the previous two games, you cannot backtrack to levels; once you change the level, there's no returning to previous ones. Sky-Lines are a mechanic that allow you to get on roller coaster like things and move at high speeds across the area, and you can do aerial attacks from them. When you die, you lose a little bit of money.\n\nElizabeth, that girl on most promotional art of the game, also exists gameplay wise. She can find Medkits, Salts, ammo and cash automatically, and can open \"Tears\"; things from alternate timelines that have no cost to use and when used strategically can be useful. Tears are at predetermined locations and can be vending machines, supplies, weapons, and more out there things.\n\nVigors, the games equivalent of Plasmids, are similar in use to 2. While Booker doesn't have one out at all times, it can be easily used instead of needing to be switched to. Also unlike the first two, all Vigors are free, and are collected in the environment. The only currency is Silver Eagles, which is used to buy ammo, HP and Salt packs that are instantly consumed upon use(you cannot carry medkits or power juice unlike the first two) and Vigor upgrades. Hacking is non-existent, but you can use the first Vigor you get to hijack machines even if it uses a LOT of Salts.\n\nInstead of buying HP and Salts upgrades, you acquire those and your shield capacity with Infusions. When picking up an Infusion, you can choose which to upgrade, with being able to upgrade one thing a maximum at ten times. There are only 24 infusions in the game barring any DLC rewards, so you cannot fully upgrade all your stuff.\n\nGear is a thing you can also find, and are clothing items that give you passive boosts such as setting people on fire with melee. It's purely stat based and you always wear the same clothes visually.\n\n\n\n[h2] Story [/h2]\nYou get sent to a flying city to wipe away a debt and [b] what the actual fuck is going on [/b]\nAlso aside from the confusing aspects it just feels inferior to the first two.\n\n[h2] Graphics [/h2]\nInfinite's art direction is REAL good, and the game itself looks pretty good just looking at it. However, it is definitely starting to show its age, with pretty notice-able shadow pop-in on Ultra and to todays standards pretty low res textures though they're good enough. Also Elizabeth, to me at least, looks like a fucking cartoon compared to every other human.\n\n[h2] Verdict [/h2]\nI hereby give BioShock Infinite a [b] 7/10 [/b], it's deffo inferior compared to the first two, and it doesn't help if you look at any pre-release gameplay. Here's a tip: don't look up the 2011 E3 gameplay prior to playing this if you want the most enjoyment out of it. I looked at that after I finished it but it's still pretty depressing. It's still a good game though, but not as good of a BioShock game.","timestamp_created":1650742513,"timestamp_updated":1651242358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114351223","author":{"steamid":"76561198219370397","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1200,"last_played":1650736409},"language":"english","review":"I never review games, but I have to rate this game!\nI don't know why I had this part of BioShock in my library for so long (never run)\nThis game is a freakin masterpiece!","timestamp_created":1650736928,"timestamp_updated":1650736928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.70671766996383667","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114349568","author":{"steamid":"76561198799628284","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1724,"last_played":1649465639},"language":"italian","review":"[h1] SUA MAESTA' BIOSHOCK INFINITE!!!

Bioshock Infinite is like Bioshock 2 a decisive game with people that either love it or hate it. But i dont think anyone can deny that it was made with love and care despite its flaws. As all the games in the series the main thing that made them stand out is the incredibly story and set pieces like Rapture. infinite provides that in my opinion with a great set piece named Colombia and a fantastic (if very mindfucked) story with once again good written characters. The gunplay unfortunately became a bit consolized forcing you to only carry 2 guns as opposed to the other games but its still really fun burning and shocking your enemies.

The cloud city setting is excellent, and what I enjoyed most about the game was exploring the city. The audio logs you find throughout do a great job of telling the story of the religious zealot behind all the bad things going on. It’s definitely worth beating the game to see how the story plays out, because you will probably be surprised. It should only take you about 10 hours to beat if you power through it.\n\nElizabeth is a cool character and a very useful companion who stays out of your way and helps you by finding items and ammo. The loot system is limited in the variety of items you find, but searching everything is necessary because that’s mainly how you get money, gear, upgrades, and lockpicks (which are important). One thing I didn’t like was that the powers for the various gear you find (hats, shirts, pants, boots) are mostly only useful for very specific situations. I wore the first shirt I found early in the game for the entire game even though I found multiple shirts that were different. \n\nOn normal difficulty, there were only a few fights that I thought were difficult (particularly the final fight) as someone who is not good at shooters. The weapons are pretty basic, and some of the vigors (special powers for combat) are redundant, but you can do serious damage if you figure out strategies for when to use them for maximum impact.\n\nAn hour of Bioshock that I played years ago was all the Bioshock I played before Infinite. I think Infinite is a good video game, but I don’t know if it’s a good Bioshock game. I found Infinite to be a competent shooter but nothing special in that regard. What kept me playing to the end was the world and the story.","timestamp_created":1650519952,"timestamp_updated":1650519952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530470192432403564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114206690","author":{"steamid":"76561198171423917","num_games_owned":1005,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":3044,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2830,"last_played":1650526235},"language":"latam","review":"⣿⣿⣿⡷⠊⡢⡹⣦⡑⢂⢕⢂⢕⢂⢕⢂⠕⠔⠌⠝⠛⠶⠶⢶⣦⣄⢂⢕⢂⢕\n⣿⣿⠏⣠⣾⣦⡐⢌⢿⣷⣦⣅⡑⠕⠡⠐⢿⠿⣛⠟⠛⠛⠛⠛⠡⢷⡈⢂⢕⢂\n⠟⣡⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⣑⠝⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡵⢁⣤⣶⣶⣿⢿⢿⢿⡟⢻⣤⢑⢂\n⣾⣿⣿⡿⢟⣛⣻⣿⣿⣿⣦⣬⣙⣻⣿⣿⣷⣿⣿⢟⢝⢕⢕⢕⢕⢽⣿⣿⣷⣔\n⣿⣿⠵⠚⠉⢀⣀⣀⣈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣗⢕⢕⢕⢕⢕⢕⣽⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⢷⣂⣠⣴⣾⡿⡿⡻⡻⣿⣿⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣵⣵⣵⣷⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿\n⢌⠻⣿⡿⡫⡪⡪⡪⡪⣺⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠿⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠃\n⠣⡁⠹⡪⡪⡪⡪⣪⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⠋⠐⢉⢍⢄⢌⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠏⠈\n⡣⡘⢄⠙⣾⣾⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡀⢐⢕⢕⢕⢕⢕⡘⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠏⠠⠈\n⠌⢊⢂⢣⠹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⢐⢕⢕⢕⢕⢕⢅⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⢋⢜⠠⠈","timestamp_created":1650512457,"timestamp_updated":1650512457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114206002","author":{"steamid":"76561199229584366","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1046,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":920,"last_played":1658936948},"language":"brazilian","review":"''Tudo deve acabar, para nunca começar.
