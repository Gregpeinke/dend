A fun game that has a very interesting backstory that you learn as you play through the game. Though this is a pretty short game, its definitally worth playing. As soon as you're finished you're going to want to play Portal 2 which is longer and develops the backstory much more. 10/10","timestamp_created":1403929618,"timestamp_updated":1403929618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10893381","author":{"steamid":"76561198090761131","num_games_owned":419,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":135,"last_played":1590521761},"language":"english","review":"portal is a great game if you like solving puzzles i mostly like for how it is the story not much story until you get to the last testing chamber","timestamp_created":1403926332,"timestamp_updated":1403926332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10892392","author":{"steamid":"76561198098203007","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1398296144},"language":"english","review":"Great game!!! love the ending! cant wait to finish portal 2","timestamp_created":1403923315,"timestamp_updated":1403923315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10892129","author":{"steamid":"76561198039574999","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1447307408},"language":"english","review":"Fun... but you will get dizzy once.","timestamp_created":1403922567,"timestamp_updated":1403922567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10891453","author":{"steamid":"76561198138469404","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1403928714},"language":"english","review":"Great game, love the challenge of a virtual puzzle.
