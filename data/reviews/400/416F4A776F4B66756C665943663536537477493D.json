CandyCrush, WordPress they've never appealed to me as I feel like enjoying myself in a game should be mindlessly wandering or making mayhem without thinking... but Portal makes you think. And I love it!\n\nPortal hasn't got much of a story nor any characters apart from yourself and a hilarious A.I. that speaks to you throughout the different levels otherwise referred to as chambers. While the lack of any story may turn some players away I beg you to look past that as this game has more on the table to make up for this trade off. The whole idea of the game is you are a nameless character testing a new device for Aperture Science Laboratories, what device? A portal gun! This nifty little thing allows you to place a blue portal and an orange portal and traverse between the two with all kinds of crazy physics and wacky puzzle solutions which never failed to keep me entertained through the game. Your character never speaks and the campus you are testing this device on can seem lonely and empty at times adding an eerie and creepy tone to the game with hidden areas of people claiming strange things about the laboratory. All while doing this your friend/A.I. will be mocking, praising and nagging you about cake the whole time which adds a lot of humour to the game and I really love this. \n\nIn terms of it's visual style Portal has a Mirrors Edge vibe to it with nothing but white and a few extra colours here ans there. There isn't anything pretty to look at or any fancy effects just a plain white room where your being tested, and while this may seem as though it's a boring-looking game it really helps immerse yourself inside it and strengthen that creepy tone. Not to mention this also means the game will run great on older hardware so don't worry if your grandmas vista machine cant handle it because I bet it can! \n\nNow before I conclude I'd like to talk about the puzzle and the games length. Firstly, the puzzles in this game are fantastic! Some levels have multiple ways of completion while others have only one way. Some levels you instantly figure out what to do while others you will sit there scratching your head for a long while and that's what makes the game so brilliant. The way it makes you think about the physics of the portals and forces you to get creative leads to some extremely memorable levels and there is a massive sense of achievement when you finish a level and get excited to start the next. Sadly though this comes with one slight drawback. The game is very short. It takes about 3.5 hours to finish this game which leaves you craving more and while the game does have a good bit of replayability the only real extra time you'll spend playing this game is doing the challenge runs which are just the same levels with a twist (like you can only take 3 steps or use 5 portals).\n\nDespite it's length Portal is easily the best puzzle game I've ever played and it has made me more open to the puzzle genre I may even consider buying a puzzler in the future. I feel like this is a must play game for anyone puzzle fan or not. it can run on just about anything, good to kill the time, very rewarding to finish. \n\n9.2/10 ~ Neppy Review.","timestamp_created":1607127684,"timestamp_updated":1607127684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81625027","author":{"steamid":"76561198362021117","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":758,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1630455784},"language":"english","review":"c\n","timestamp_created":1607127662,"timestamp_updated":1625444261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81624642","author":{"steamid":"76561198057463231","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":164,"playtime_forever":466,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1649385445},"language":"english","review":"Short but sweet puzzle game","timestamp_created":1607127054,"timestamp_updated":1607127054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81622410","author":{"steamid":"76561198076031003","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1412124687},"language":"portuguese","review":"Esse game é uma experiência única, com muitos desafios e uma mecânica inovadora demais para a época.

Vestirete i panni di Chell, una cavia umana che si risveglia in uno stanzino abbandonato dei laboratori Aperture Science. Il vostro compito è quello di superare una serie di trappole mortali con la vostra \"Portal Gun\" (Pistola spara portali, per chi non sopporta anglicismi) e sconfiggere GLaDOS, l'intelligenza artificiale assassina e sadica che infesta le rovine dei laboratori torturando fisicamente (e, soprattutto, psicologicamente) la nostra eroina silenziosa.\n\nSemplice ma efficace, un concetto che può riassumere la storia ma anche il gameplay. L'idea di sparare dei portali per superare un rompicapo potrebbe non sembrare particolarmente avvincente, ma questo concept da molti considerabile banalotto e noioso è sostenuto da un design dei livelli eccezionale, colpi di scena interessanti, atmosfera semi-horror azzeccatissima e i tanti, TANTI commenti sarcastici ed esilaranti di GLaDOS. Da soli valgono il prezzo del gioco.\n\nE' un gioco corto, ma sa intrattenerti dall'inizio alla fine senza mai annoiare e non è affatto un'impresa di poco conto considerata la apparente ripetitività del gameplay e il fatto che ci siano solo due personaggi.\n\nMolto divertente, humor impeccabile, gameplay innovativo... Non avete motivo per giocarci, non tirate fuori la scusa del \"mio PC che fa schifo\" perché questo gioco fa miracoli anche sul PC puzzolente, scassato vietnamita di vostro zio.\n\nConsigliatissimo.","timestamp_created":1607117872,"timestamp_updated":1607117872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81617326","author":{"steamid":"76561198394676557","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":161,"last_played":1607115014},"language":"turkish","review":"[i] Valve'dan yine harika bir oyun daha...

The game includes several very funny phrases in each test chamber. The sequel, Portal 2, is (in my opinion) a bit better as it has longer, more content, a deeper story and even funnier sentences. All in all, Portal is a must and a classic. It's also terribly cheap, which I can't understand. The game could easily have cost 99.99 euros XD.

Сюжет: неплох.  Приятный но немного коротковат (это относится ко всей игре).\n2. Идея: гениальна. И порталы, и эксперименты на людях, и злобный искусственный интеллект.\n3.  Геймплей: прекрасен. Мне не встретилось не одного бага, и все механики работали исправно.\n4. Персонажи: есть и ладно. У нас имеется главная героиня (Чел) и злая робот (ГЛэДОС).\n Ну куда же без минусов:\n-Озвучка и перевод: просто ужасны. Голос неприятный, нет шуток и колкостей которые были в оригинале, в некоторых местах голоса ломаются и пропадают (я знаю что эту тему обсосал каждый).\n Portal была одной из самых первых игры которую я купил и скажу честно она стоит своих денег. Сама по себе Portal приятный продукт на несколько вечеров не напряжного геймплея.\n Игра очень даже хороша.
