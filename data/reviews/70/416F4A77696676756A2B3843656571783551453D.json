Graphics are old, but they are super slick and clear. When combined with the game mechanics, it makes the shoot out a purists experience where speed and accuracy are rewarded. The first story is also the best of all, not complicated, with great characters, acting, and no constant 'friend' presence to have to manage either (sorry Alyx).  Even the soundtrack is just better than anything which came afterwards.  Somehow all the subsequent improvement attempts (e.g. source, black mesa) whilst technically are 'better', just detract from the rawness and punch of the original.\n\nAll in all, it is truly a gripping game from start to finish - traps, jokes, puzzles, hidden achievements and plenty of trigger action..   Has never been bettered by any game I've ever played. \n\nIf you don't know half-life, close your ears and eyes to everything that is on the web and just open this game and play it as if you've never heard of it, or you don't know what its all about. Guaranteed it will be the memorable game experience of your life....","timestamp_created":1576959971,"timestamp_updated":1576959971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474452555179595947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60266545","author":{"steamid":"76561198452324938","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2164,"last_played":1628128565},"language":"english","review":"Very Nic","timestamp_created":1576959861,"timestamp_updated":1576959861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60265356","author":{"steamid":"76561198878940102","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":81,"last_played":1656376626},"language":"latam","review":"Un clasico, siempre recomendado","timestamp_created":1576958662,"timestamp_updated":1576958662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60265111","author":{"steamid":"76561198331062902","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":400,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48,"last_played":1657305817},"language":"english","review":"interesting game, don't be confused by my hours, I played it out offline on another pc.\n\nIt's a no brainer to get if it's on sale.","timestamp_created":1576958418,"timestamp_updated":1576958418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60264157","author":{"steamid":"76561198313962855","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":936,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":333,"last_played":1641521725},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1576957476,"timestamp_updated":1576957476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60263078","author":{"steamid":"76561198282466901","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":823,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":229,"last_played":1579849428},"language":"english","review":"The AI is pretty smart","timestamp_created":1576956367,"timestamp_updated":1576956367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60263059","author":{"steamid":"76561198066403277","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":629,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1589499601},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1576956346,"timestamp_updated":1576956346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60261354","author":{"steamid":"76561198821381244","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1641597947},"language":"english","review":"👪Player Bases:\n☐ Kids.\n☐ Everyone.\n☑ Mature.\n☐ Casual Players.\n☐ Pro players.\n\n⛺Graphics:\n☐ Potato.\n☐ Really Bad.\n☐ Bad.\n☑ OK.\n☐ Good.\n☐ Beautiful.\n☐ Masterpiece.\n\n💸Price:\n☑ Full Price.\n☐ Wait For Sale.\n☐ Refund It If You Can.\n☐ Don't Buy It.\n☐ Free.\n\n🚀Requirements:\n☐ Minimum.\n☑ Medium.\n☐ Fast.\n☐ High End.\n☐ Super Computer.\n\n💀Difficulty:\n☐ Easy.\n☑ Medium.\n☐ Hard.\n☐ Very Hard.\n☐ Death March.\n☐ Dark Souls.\n\n\n⌛Game length:\n☐ Really Short.

There's a lot of old games I never got the chance of playing  during their initial release so I'll play them years later and find the gameplay/story to be stale cause it's just aged terribly.  I tried Half Life for the first time in 2014 and loved it.  I compare its aspects to Halo which I grew up on since 2002 and am biased to say is my favorite fps but Half Life sticks out as an amazing fps despite being old in gaming.","timestamp_created":1576868537,"timestamp_updated":1576868537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60189314","author":{"steamid":"76561198208159331","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":165,"last_played":1604319317},"language":"russian","review":"ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН, ФРИМЕН.

Low model quality and textures combined with the occasionally clunky controls and physics makes for an FPS adventure that is a bit rough around the edges. Still - the gameplay itself is solid with a wide weapon sandbox available to you, and can still be challenging on the Nth playthrough. An very good game - but I'd recommend the newer Source remake, Black Mesa, if you want a more modernized experience.\n\n★★★★☆","timestamp_created":1576790605,"timestamp_updated":1576790605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60136556","author":{"steamid":"76561198450286533","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1230,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":258,"last_played":1646605486},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1576790047,"timestamp_updated":1576790047,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60133033","author":{"steamid":"76561198049050127","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1083,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":733,"last_played":1659827255},"language":"spanish","review":"buen juego","timestamp_created":1576785402,"timestamp_updated":1576785402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwifvuj+8Ceeqx5QE="}
