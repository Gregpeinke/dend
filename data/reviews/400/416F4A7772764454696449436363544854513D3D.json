The puzzles are amazing, with the later ones even providing multiple ways to use the portal mechanic to get past obstacles. This game is amusing and fun on a level most games never achieve. All that being said, I believe it is a bit overrated. After hearing people raving about how awesome it was for so long (and even owning it on Orange Box for PS3 years ago without ever having played it), I fianally decided to just jump in and find out what all the hype is about. It is fun and well worth the entry fee to play, but the total play through took me a Sunday morning. My play time that you see is how long it took me to beat the game and I really don't have much desire to go back and do it again or to do the extra trials on the same levels. The first half of the 19 challenges were brainlessly easy and basically just a tutorial on the mechanics leaving you with only a handful of actually (somewhat) challenging levels (and a bit more). The story is amusing and the whole package is well put together. All this being said, this game is fun and everyone should try it. I just don't see what all the fuss is about and why there are so many fanboys out there acting like it this is the best thing ever created in the gaming industry. It is a great game and fun to play through, but there are  lot of those out there. Worth the $10 (or less if you can catch it on sale)? Absolutely! Worth the hype and people running around with their hair on fire with a portal shirt on?

Enough said.  Oh ok, I'll go into some more detail.  The aim of Portal is to complete test chambers by using your portal gun (A.K.A. The Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device).  The device can pick things up and put things down.  For example you might pick up a box and drop it onto a turret clobbering it and obliterating it.  Poor turret, they seemed so nice.  Finally, of course, this is why it is called a portal device, it can shoot two different types of portal (one entrance portal and one exit portal).  \n\nYou need to complete test chambers by doing what needs to be done inside of it, like putting boxes on buttons and using portals to get across obstacles, and exiting it alive only, however, to do another one.  In most test chambers there are obstacles like turrets that you need to avoid.  Other wise they will look at you, point a laser at you and open fire upon you with their powerful machine guns.  How ever, some of the turrets can not be so clever.  They might shoot at you even if there is a big pane of glass in the way.  That is very annoying because the mess up the glass so that you can not see through it.\n\nStory wise, Portal doesn't have a very long one.  In fact, it's really short.  When I say really short I mean really really short.  It only has nineteen test chambers and five other levels that take place after the test chambers.  How ever it is still a fun game.  But a game that you won't spend too long playing but I still recommend it.  An evil robot called GLaDOS is forcing you to do the test chambers.  She is crazy.  Her only job in life is to test and test and test over and over again.  She will do this to test subject after test subject after test subject.  For those test subjects there is no last test chamber, unless they die of course.  Oh great, you may be thinking.  Don't worry, it's only a game.  Anyway, for them, the test chambers just keep on coming.  However you, Chell, are something different.  You can think outside of the box and in some levels even outside of the test chamber.  Quite literally.\n\nI would rate the game 90/100 however I am ignoring the fact that the game is so short.  Now the time has come for you to pay attention.  All I've been telling you to do in this review is to GET THE GAME!  If you follow this order (GET THE GAME!) your life will become so much better for about eight hours of playing Portal.  This game has been rated overwhelmingly positive (when this review was written and I doubt it will ever change from overwhelmingly positive) for crying out loud.
