The game is primarily an adventure in which you \"fight the power\" and begin an uprising against a totalitarian and unfeeling alien government that has enslaved the vast majority of the human race into carrying out its various biddings. From whacking cyborg policemen with a crowbar in the first level to manually controlling laser-guided rockets in mid-air to drop two gunships from the sky while your vast army of giant bugs terrorizes the super soldiers residing in the local prison facility, your journey will make you feel as though you're accomplishing a lot.\n\nValve did a great job of designing HL2's levels around rewarding exploration, as well as giving players little resting periods between hectic gunfights to solve physics-related puzzles in order to advance or claim extra goodies in the form of health or ammunition. As for story, the game has more of it than meets the eye; look around and you might find newspaper clippings telling of a \"Seven Hour War\"; listen carefully to Dr. Breen (the \"puppet antagonist\") and you might discover why there are no children to be seen in the entire game. Lastly, without giving anything away, I'd like to add that the game's final level STILL, to this day, leaves a lasting impression on me; it is most definitely one hell of a ride.\n\nI think the only glaring flaw this game has is its rather vague and abrupt cliffhanger ending (cue Episodes 1 and 2). There are, of course, other smaller issues, like the occasional enemy standing still and accepting your bullets to their face with glee, or the frustrating vehicle controls (yes, there are driving segments, and they don't end quickly). I also wish the game gave the player more opportunities to approach a group of enemies stealthily, as their spidey-senses usually kick in once you've entered the same acre as them.\n\nIn conclusion, I give Half-Life 2 nine damn cats out of ten. It is truly a treat.","timestamp_created":1423386702,"timestamp_updated":1423386908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14383283","author":{"steamid":"76561198045988146","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1431919523},"language":"english","review":"I love it... but when I get to Ravenholm it bugs out and I am unable to continue.","timestamp_created":1423383882,"timestamp_updated":1423383882,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.371711522340774536","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14381428","author":{"steamid":"76561198052579884","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":1676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1303,"last_played":1639382220},"language":"english","review":"Play Half-Life","timestamp_created":1423372175,"timestamp_updated":1517417805,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472827732563018799","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14380994","author":{"steamid":"76561198041357059","num_games_owned":1489,"num_reviews":136,"playtime_forever":1665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1153,"last_played":1442196606},"language":"english","review":"It's aite.","timestamp_created":1423369175,"timestamp_updated":1423369175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480916023254394531","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14378133","author":{"steamid":"76561198084266800","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":936,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":760,"last_played":1532532997},"language":"russian","review":"Неустаревающая классика, шедевр на все времена!","timestamp_created":1423353080,"timestamp_updated":1423353080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14376932","author":{"steamid":"76561198056264254","num_games_owned":761,"num_reviews":137,"playtime_forever":1424,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1424,"last_played":1423346727},"language":"english","review":"Roughly ten years after its original release, Half-Life 2 holds up fantastically. Fun shooting that tosses you into a variety of different situations with a large arsenal of weapons means the gameplay alone is enjoyable, but Half-Life 2 is made unforgettable by its cold, bleak atmosphere that ranges from oppressive to ominously empty and its mysterious universe, which the game forces you to examine all the little details around you to get a full grasp of.\n\nDespite being graphically dated, featuring fairly blurry texture work, Half-Life actually stands out and looks much better than many other games from the era, arguably even ones that were used as graphical benchmarks like Doom 3 and Far Cry. Despite having a realistic graphical style, Half-Life 2 features incredibly strong art direction and some of the best environmental design in an FPS I've ever seen.

And then a bunch of retarted gamers who have had their standards lowered by the shitty food see the crap and start yelling about what a masterpiece it is and eat it. And so the chef looks at the gamers perplexingly but then shrugs and charges them to eat his shit. And then 10 years later the restaurant is a five star French restaurant, but the gamers are still eating the shit, which is now all moldy out of nostalgia? You know when that happens? I hate it when that happens. But that’s half-life 2 in a nutshell.\n\tHonestly how is this so popular?  I am not even exaggerating when I say this is one of the worst games I’ve ever bought! The first thing I noticed is the camera movement is weird, but didn’t think too much of it since a lot of games have that problem. I mean really why can’t all first person games do their cameras minecraft or eldritch style? The next thing I noticed was the weapon selection, it is bad. To select a weapon you have to scroll to it AND left click when you reach it and be quick about it because you only have a few seconds before it closes. This may sound nit picky and it’s all right some times, but when you’re being attacked (which is when being able to switch weapons fast is the most important) it is annoying! It forces you to direct your eyes and attention away from the action.\n\tRight, so the next thing I noticed is the combat… it is dull! It just doesn’t have much going for it there’s nothing to make it more than “point the curser at the thing, click till thing dies.” In other games you can surprise enemies or dodge there attacks but not here. \n\tOkay, so that’s two problems down and two to go. So the whole game pretty much takes place in one giant corridor, but they do their best to hide it. The problem is they sometimes hide it too well. That’s right is another one of those “where the @%#$&*% am I suppose to go?” games, need I say more?\n\tSo here it is he final nail in the coffin. Your health doesn’t regenerate. You get your heath back from heath kit, which would be all right, but they don’t give you much health, there aren’t many of them, and they don’t come back. This makes the dull combat frustrating, since you it almost impossible to not get hit because the enemies have pinpoint aim and reflexes. Your not allowed to play around in this game because if you lose heath in the proses you never get it back. This also means the lever designers can’t know how hard to make the levels because they don’t know what your heath will be. \n\tI couldn’t finish the game, I ended up in a boring   boss battle with 9 health and no med kits. What I don’t understand is how people like this game? Really I’m not even being rude I really want to know, please tell me in the comments.","timestamp_created":1422896288,"timestamp_updated":1422896288,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.311603337526321411","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14298181","author":{"steamid":"76561198171129635","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1462,"last_played":1587963277},"language":"french","review":"Wow still playing after 24 hours of gameplay\ngreat game","timestamp_created":1422895791,"timestamp_updated":1422895791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14297750","author":{"steamid":"76561198064071489","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":889,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":889,"last_played":1389699840},"language":"french","review":"Le jeu qui m'a fait me remettre aux FPS.

Mas de fato isso não acontece, não posso julgar defeitos graficos devido a idade do jogo, mas podia muito bem melhorar com patchs. No final do Half Life 1 voce entra em um trem e pronto o jogo acaba, mas no começo do Half Life 2, como é que voce foi parar em um trem totalmente diferente a caminho de uma cidade tomada por aliens humanóides sem motivo aparente?

There's just so much to say. Half-Life 2 is, simply put, the best single-player shooter ever released for the PC. It does so many things right in so many ways that it might be possible to write a thesis on the topic of Half-Life 2 compared to other single player shooters. What Valve has created is simply a masterpiece -- a work of art in the genre. Not only does it engage the mind with mysterious happenings, vagaries, and mostly intelligent dialogue, but also captures the senses with a superb visual style made possible by brilliant technology. And once the initial shock of it all wears off and it becomes possible to peel back the polished layers of sight and sound, there is an excellent shooter here. Half-Life 2 doesn't do anything particularly new; it doesn't really innovate in many ways. But what it does is set a new height for all other designers of first-person shooters to reach. It still isn't exactly perfect, but it's about as close as I've seen in my tenure here. \n\nBefore I really get into the review, you should know the background of how this game was reviewed. Valve did not want to send out copies of their game (for fairly obvious reasons) before it was released to the public. In order to play the game, I, and several of my colleagues throughout the industry, took a trip up to Seattle to visit Valve in order to have some private time with the title. I was given a little room to myself where I could close the door, turn off the lights, click my little red slippers, and pretend that I was sitting at home. It worked for the most part, largely because I was so engrossed with the game that when I came out of my trance I often had to take a moment to get my bearings. Obviously, Valve was happy to bring me into a controlled environment for ideal playing conditions. \n\nThe system that I played the game on had these specs: \n•ASUS P4C800-E dlx motherboard \n•Intel P4 3.2GHz CPU \n•2.0GB DDR400 dual-channel RAM \n•Radeon 9800PRO 128MB video \n•Creative Audigy 2 ZS sound \n•Western Digital 160GB SATA HD \nObviously, since we were only allowed to play the game at Valve, this is the only system that we've had the chance to play with. That said, at 1280 resolution, the game ran flawlessly, even in the most extreme environments with tons of geometry and lots of objects moving around, both with and without AI. The Source engine is an impressive piece of software from the outside looking in. There's a large chance my brain would melt like Velveeta in a microwave should someone try to explain its inner workings. \n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Review The long-awaited release of Half-Life 2 is finally here. Valve has spent years perfecting this sequel to one of the most respected first-person shooters ever. Has the wait been worth it? Tune into this in-depth video review, which includes tons of sweet new direct-feed. What are you waiting for? Download this while you read the rest of the text review. \n\n \n\nWhat's particularly impressive about the game running so well is that it does so without compromising any part of gameplay or design. Environments are complex, colorful, and highly detailed; AI is certainly impressive in that NPCs work as teams, flank, react to sound and movement, and then engage with lifelike aggression. But like I said, we're going to have to wait and see what the game runs like on a more standard system after it's released. Therefore, you can look for an additional supplement to this review about how the game runs on lower-end systems after we've had the chance to check. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n The other problem with reviewing the game up at Valve is the simple fact that we couldn't test out Steam and how well the product registration system necessary to playing Half-Life 2works. I'm not exceedingly happy about the forced registration even if it is understandable in today's climate of highly pirated games, though I can't say I believe this will stop ultra-determined hackers from cracking the game regardless. \n\nStill, no matter what you think of Valve's business policies, Half-Life 2 is a \"must buy\" game. If you're a fan of the series, that was already obvious. Heck, if you're a PC gamer chances are you're going to get it at some point anyway. But if you're new or skeptical of the genre and want to see a prime example of the power and excitement of a first-person shooter, this is it. And it begins with the continuation of a story. Wake Up and Smell the Ashes... \n\nLast time we left Gordon Freeman, the unlikely scientist-hero from the first Half-Life, he was traveling. Yes, just traveling. The mystery was where he was traveling to and why all of the incidents at Black Mesa had happened (not to mention why the game was rife with so many horrific jumping puzzles towards the end). Half-Life 2 begins with Gordon arriving via train with the G-Man teasing his mind with sickly whispers of warning. The last stop of the arriving train is City 17, a bastion of the alien Combine forces, yet another mystery themselves. \n\nFor the rest of the story, you'll have to play the game yourself. I'm absolutely dedicated to getting through this review with your chance at an untarnished gaming experience intact. That means no spoilers. Suffice to say, there are lots of twists to curl your brain along the way, some a bit more predictable than others, but all welcome and interesting. \n\nWhile the writing and plot points will act as fly paper to your attention, the real winner here is the way the story is presented. Through the eyes of Gordon Freeman, you'll experience roughly 17-20 hours of consciousness which tests your senses and captures your mind. The simplicity and style with which this story is presented are perhaps the most graceful maneuvers of the many that Valve has carried out. From the moment you take your first steps off of that train and into the station at City 17, you'll begin to be tutored in the ways of this bizarre eastern European city. Public service announcements, private conversations, and the actions of characters around you, whether part of the Combine or simply waylaid citizens, create a stifling and threatening feeling that City 17 has become some sort of elaborate prison preaching the chance for freedom and opportunity without choice or desire. \n\nWhile I was ultimately left a little bit frustrated by the open-endedness, the journey to get to the end of the story was assuredly interesting and opened up the doors to many more possibilities. It's easy to start speculating about this or that, just don't let it drive you nuts. The deeper you get, the darker and more intriguing it becomes until you get to the end... which you'll have to see for yourself. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n This frightening vision of the future is only made stronger by a stunning visual style that manages to express artistic vision while coming as close to reality as I've seen in my decades of playing video games. One of the most stunning moments comes with the first steps out from the train station and into the city proper. It's the wild realization of a fantastic dream. The Combine citadel looms on the horizon as a testament to their power, authority, and technological capabilities. It's both impressive and oppressive at the same time, serving its purpose with more presence than an army of a Combine soldiers and Striders ever could. \n\nLight plays a significant role in the beauty of Half-Life 2, not only because of its quality, but because of the way that it tracks the passage of time. Each passing level brings the sun down a bit more until you're encased in an eerie canopy of unease at just the right moment in the game. The brighter points allow for the exquisite detail of the textures found everywhere in the game to become more apparent while the colors of the city and contrasting nature,\n","timestamp_created":1422770219,"timestamp_updated":1422770219,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14273053","author":{"steamid":"76561198065929635","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":791,"last_played":1639944971},"language":"english","review":"Why are you reading this when you could be playing this masterpiece ?","timestamp_created":1422766337,"timestamp_updated":1422766337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14271064","author":{"steamid":"76561197991633394","num_games_owned":308,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":806,"last_played":1422753605},"language":"english","review":"Half life 2 is a very good game that is design to chellenge the player with puzzels and obstacles that was rarely seen in most games of the period and for the most part aren't that repetitive as well as create an enviroment and story that you almost feel apart of..\n\nHowever However.
