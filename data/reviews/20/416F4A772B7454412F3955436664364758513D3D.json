The gameplay is similar, but there is a different gameplay spin in each game. For example in Counter Strike you use real life weapons, in Half Life you use iconic weaponry from the games and in Team Fortress you have classes.\n\nClasses range from a heavy who uses a mini gun, to a spy and a medic and many many more. All of them have different weaponry and all function differently on the field. Some weapons do more damage, but fire slower or vice versa. It all boils down to skill and it's really fun.\n\nGameplay wise, I only got the chance to try out Capture the Flag as it's the only server I found which still contains a nice amount of dedicated players which is nice. Other gamemodes have a few players, but the game is pretty much dead and I will get into that a bit later.\n\nGraphically this is a mod of the Half Life game similar to Counter Strike, so a lot of the same assets and models are in this game. It's not aged well, but overall graphics are not the selling point for this game.\n\nGameplay is really fun, it's challenging and rewarding and it's general a really good gameplay design.\n\nNow the only bad thing is a major problem with the game. It has a dying community and it's dying rapidly. I only found one server that had 13 people in total, while others only had 2 or no players. It's a dying game, but the people that play it, they are very dedicated players so you can get in touch with a community and get  a game going.\n\nOverall Team Fortress Classic is a fun game, is it as good as Team Fortress 2 ? No, not really. While I like the gameplay more in this game, I still think Team Fortress 2 is the better game.\n\nFinal Rating:\n6/10 \n\nPros:\n+ In Depth Gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Dying Community","timestamp_created":1473455948,"timestamp_updated":1473455948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.7033538818359375","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25431540","author":{"steamid":"76561198119487783","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":90,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":90,"last_played":1474124797},"language":"english","review":"you shoot stuff...","timestamp_created":1473452351,"timestamp_updated":1547477565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490494310855865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25323244","author":{"steamid":"76561198258538636","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56,"last_played":1560108364},"language":"english","review":"It's a good game but sadly nobody plays it","timestamp_created":1472903247,"timestamp_updated":1472903247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487548172473907471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25218257","author":{"steamid":"76561198161719758","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":259,"last_played":1613119671},"language":"english","review":"So awesome to play this game!
