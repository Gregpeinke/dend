The game is longer, the puzzles are harder, there is more backstory, and it introduces us to a couple of new gameplay mechanics. GLaDOS is as menacing as ever, contrast by the introduction of Wheatley, a bumbling, precious idiot. And that's only the Single Player. Multiplayer allows you to play a seperate campaign with a friend, as well as literally hundreds of community-made maps.","timestamp_created":1373991032,"timestamp_updated":1373991032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4023089","author":{"steamid":"76561198030863760","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":4524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3455,"last_played":1633760521},"language":"english","review":"What could be better than this game?

Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact.\nThe gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well.\nOne of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay.\nCo-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player.\nI highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter. \nOverall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 10/10\nGameplay 10/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation\n\nAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA","timestamp_created":1373979641,"timestamp_updated":1489171222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":244,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.840165078639984131","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2178723","author":{"steamid":"76561198003553138","num_games_owned":370,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":123,"last_played":1447799693},"language":"english","review":"get it or go to hell","timestamp_created":1373978322,"timestamp_updated":1373978322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1369464","author":{"steamid":"76561197992245932","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3083,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2854,"last_played":1651508396},"language":"english","review":"Simply awesome!

Игра была официально анонсирована Valve 5 марта 2010 года. Изначально её выпуск планировался осенью того же года, однако после нескольких переносов датой выхода Portal 2 было назначено 18 апреля 2011 года. В России игра вышла 21 апреля 2011 и распространяется компанией «Бука».\n\nПродолжение развивает игровой процесс первой игры, состоящий из головоломок, построенных на использовании специального устройства для создания порталов — разрывов в пространстве — позволяющих игроку мгновенно перемещаться из одного места в другое. Среди множества нововведений геймплея в Portal 2 присутствует кооперативный режим для прохождения двумя игроками. Действие игры происходит спустя некоторое время после событий Portal в разрушенной и заброшенной Лаборатории исследования природы порталов (Aperture Science) и фокусируется на дальнейшем противостоянии всё той же главной героини, подопытной девушки Челл, и маниакального суперкомпьютера GLaDOS. В кооперативном режиме присутствует отдельная сюжетная линия.\n\nСравнивая Portal и его продолжение, Valve подчёркивает, что первая часть была лишь экспериментом, в то время как Portal 2 является уже полноценной игрой с совершенно новыми элементами геймплея и гораздо большей продолжительностью (игровой процесс рассчитан примерно на 6 часов в одиночном режиме и столько же в кооперативном). Более того, на конференции GDC 2010 директор Valve Гейб Ньюэлл заявил, что Portal 2 — это лучшая игра за всю историю существования компании.","timestamp_created":1373833126,"timestamp_updated":1373833126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5558810","author":{"steamid":"76561198051904005","num_games_owned":413,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1786,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1060,"last_played":1574374458},"language":"english","review":"Probably my favourite game.
