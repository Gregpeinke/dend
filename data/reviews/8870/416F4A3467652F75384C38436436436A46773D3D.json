Врагов кидали пачками. К слову, проходил на максимальной сложности, но проблем всё равно не было. Будто играл на изике.\nНу а где-то 7 часу всё настолько закрутилось, завертелось, что хрен оторвёшься... Когда пошли титры на экране, было странное ощущение пустоты. Такое у меня бывает, когда игра цепляет.\n\nОчень интересный сюжет, который держит до конца. К тому же игра вполне вменяемый шутан. Дизайн оружия кстати не вштырил. Всё печальное в основном. Но мир очень круто сделан. Хотя дальные планы плывут в мыле.\n\nЕсть лёгкое впечатление того, что игру делали в торопях(что вполне закономерно для ААА проекта). Очень часто встречаются моменты - стыки в мапе, дыры между стыкуемыми домами, сквозь которые видно всё и прочие не очень хорошие мелочи.\n\nНо в целом игра вышла очень достойной. Я бы даже сказал - произведением искусства. Очень добротная история, в которой из-за невнимательности можно ещё и не разобраться с сюжетом после прохождения.

The conversations you'll overhear throughout your time in the game will make you laugh, smile, or even recoil in offense. \n\nIf a game is meant to tell a story, Bioshock: Infinite certainly does that.
