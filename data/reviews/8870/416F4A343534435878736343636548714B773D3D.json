No, all that would have been excused if the gameplay could hold it up. Gunplay in Infinite is just as floaty and flaccid as the first Bioshock, and now a new shield system dramatically slows the pace of the game.

While far more linear than the last Bioshock (and somewhat less worthy of multiple playthroughs) it showcases a lot of immersion and incredible production value. The storyline and setting are packed with imagination and wholly worth the cost of admission--even though the game probably clocks about a shy 10 hours total. This is a gamer's game, no mistake, don't think that the experience is going to deviate too greatly from every other FPS out there; lots of head-shots and violence await your trip through the city in the sky. The mood is cavaliering and the run-and-gun action is a great break from the cover-based monotony that has become the norm. The world is very well fleshed out, and the spectacle hits you full force. The ending is one of the best conclusions in recent memory and elevates every moment proceeding it in its profundity.\n\nAdmittedly, the gameplay has slightly less depth than the previous Bioshock. But it's not terribly lacking for it, instead it feels streamlined. There is far less choice in this game as well, but the game is focused on a single storyline instead. I'd definitely advise everyone who has enjoyed a shooter in the past to give this game a go (and play the first one first). It's a thrilling story arc and a great showcase of the power of first-person immersion in a virtual world.","timestamp_created":1407004100,"timestamp_updated":1407004100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11523545","author":{"steamid":"76561197995747944","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1218,"last_played":1406474950},"language":"french","review":"Un jeu qui se joue comme un rêve!\nGraphismes pas mal, musique / ambiance top et gamelplay réussi","timestamp_created":1407001990,"timestamp_updated":1407001990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11522133","author":{"steamid":"76561198085827232","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1630,"last_played":1561140252},"language":"italian","review":"Life is a shit, but it's worth to live just to play bioshock infinite.

This game is the latter. It's not just a great shooter (which it also is), but it's a game where you emotionally bond with the characters and the story, with a very detailed world, great dialogues, a couple of good jokes and easter eggs. The game is also rather bald in the way it mocks religion, racism and patriotism and portrays the early America. The gameplay itself is in perfection: the way they innovated the idea of a proper gameplay companion, the tactical combat (tears and skylines with constant lack of proper ammunition), the choice of vigor upgrades and weapons, the nice RPG elements it's all there.\n\nThe difficulty is challenging on the \"hard\" difficulty, I died about 10 times before the last combat scene, and I was unable to finish the last combat mission on \"hard\" in 4 attempts (lowered the difficulty because I really wanted to find out what happens in the end). The challenge is increased due to the \"auto-save\" system, which I found appropriate for this game. I enjoyed everything about this game except for the ending. Without giving away any spoilers I will just say, that I find it in contradiction with the plot and simply not enjoyable with too much mysticism for my rational mind to handle. I would also like to say that the game runs really smooth on my nvidea 570gtx with no lags. I was unable to find any bugs during the gameplay. It's an example of a successfull port from the console. 10 for graphics and optimization 10 for gameplay 10 for originality and concept 10 for character and game design 8 for the plot (mostly because of the ending).

We can only carry two weapons and a small amount of ammo. Its realistic, not to mention everytime we're the middle of a battle, there will be weapons available in some corner, and soldiers always drop weapons. But its not the same thing. We can't fully upgrade something choosing some kind of class, or make that weapon specialized in killing a type of enemy. This time we have Vigors that kill a type of enemy or stun a type of enemy. Now that I mentionvigors, we have a huge list that's completely pointless. We can finish the game using only one type of vigor, and some of them are just completely pointless. Vigors like Charge, that might be fun to use, becames useless because you can only use it on an enemy at the same, which ends up consuming a lot of your salts. \nMost frustrating moment for me, The battle with the Siren drives me insane. I hated it the first time and even more the second. Its simply cringe worthy and frustrating, a waste of ammo and salts, because the enemies you killed once, you kill them again, and Mrs Commstockflies around in a weird pattern, making it difficult to become a target. \nThe final battle. Let me tell you how little prepared we are for the final battle. I found it that when I played this game for the first time, I wasn't in the least preparedfor the final battle, considering you're only allowed to travel along with two weapons, and those might not be the weapons you have fully upgraded, you can might be walking into your doom. You're given almost all the enemies you fought before, all at the same time (Almost, the crow, and fireman aren't in the final battle, which would have made things even more ridiculous) You're not sure what's going on, until half the bar for the ship is already gone, then you realize you were supposed to defend that blue bright thing. Its a mess. \nBut I was able to play this game a second time, I gave it more time and I slowly played through different paths and made different choices (Constants and variables). \n\nI did like this game, after the first and second playthrough, I liked every little bit, finding moments of frustration along. I advice you to play it because even though it has all the problems I pointed out before, and probably more depending on the experience of other players, its still a great full and entertaining moment. You're left on the edge of your seat because you just want to know who is Elizabeth, and at a certain point, who are you. In the mission with Slate you think your past and story is all coverd, but as the time goes by, you realize its not like that at all. \nThe first time I played it I just wanted to play more and uncover what was going on. Who were the people who wanted you to \"Bring them the girl\". Second time I played with more time and patience, knowing the story already, I took the time to explore and find out more about Colombia. \nOh, and Colombia, though. My congratulations to the artist in ths game for the beauty that slowly died away and gave place to destruction, to the writter who gave us a Disney princess Elizabeth making her slowly grow up and find out more about herself, that gave us the Luttece, Commstock, Daisy and Fink, to the sound team who gave us an amazing sountrack like always, bringing oldies transforming them into something that felt like it belong to Colombia. It was delicious to play through this game and find these characters, and story so interesting. \nA good thing I have to say about the combat and upgrade is that, this time you can upgrade yourself with the Gear, making amazing combinations that would make you a perfect killing machine, depending on what type of gameplay you wanted to make. The Vigors might have been too many, but you could still make perfect combinations between them, and between the weapons, you could plan strategies or just go full killing mode. \nYes, I recommend it even though it fails in a lot of ways, and it definetly its not a 10/10, but its worth the buy and worth your time.","timestamp_created":1406892042,"timestamp_updated":1406892042,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11504761","author":{"steamid":"76561198065094815","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":783,"last_played":1490910841},"language":"spanish","review":"Deja de hacer lo que estes haciendo, comprate este juego, y no hagas otra cosa hasta que te lo hayas acabado.

Infinite was a breath of fresh air as far as \"endings\" to a trilogy go. The environments were lush and immersive. The enemies were unique, bountiful and challenging. Infinite blends just the right amound of gameplay and rich, captivating story, although at times, the story feels overbearing and gives you the sensation as if you're drowning. By all means, it could be argued that this was the best installment of the franchise (the most polished at the least) but I find it a stretch to say that it trumps the original.","timestamp_created":1406841424,"timestamp_updated":1406841424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11496529","author":{"steamid":"76561198080453822","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":789,"last_played":1468390886},"language":"english","review":"Didnt live up to what was shown in the E3 footage, a good game overall, but is missing something the first bioshock game had.","timestamp_created":1406838730,"timestamp_updated":1406838730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11496381","author":{"steamid":"76561198131852199","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":614,"last_played":1458890496},"language":"russian","review":"Потрясающая история,хорошая атмосфера. \nЭта игра очень красочная и захватывающая.\nОгромное спасибо Кену за этот шедевр, теперь,BioShock одна из моих любимых игр","timestamp_created":1406838139,"timestamp_updated":1406838139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547297775745391846","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11494610","author":{"steamid":"76561198111054440","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":742,"last_played":1478130419},"language":"english","review":"the gameplay was fun, the story was interesting but hard to understand at times.","timestamp_created":1406829783,"timestamp_updated":1406829783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11493687","author":{"steamid":"76561198065866669","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1405463237},"language":"english","review":"Great game play.
