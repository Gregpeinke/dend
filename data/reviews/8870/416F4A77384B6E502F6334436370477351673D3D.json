And I cant believ how much I missed. This game is great, the fighting mechanics are really cool, and I personally love the skyline, not so much for combat wise like games like Infamous for the playstation, bu it just feel awesome going on them.\n\nNow story wise, at the beggining it felt a little pushed in a way, like the sudden thing that the AD on his hand ment the false shepard was a little pushed to get to the fighting scenes, but it had a reason. The prophet new you were coming to get his \"lamb\" And the story just moved toward from there, Now, I havent completed the game yet, but this is is only an early review form my first impression from the game, so bear with me, and I dont want to bring spolers at all.\n\nSomething that caught my eye, from the many times this game has done, is the powers that you get. They are really interesting and many of them practical in battle, and the combination from them will fit almost any playstyle that you may have. Plus weapons in the game. Something interesting wa sthat you could have ammo for a weapon that you didnt have, so you could empty you pistol, grab a machine gun and be good to go.\n\nThe powers from Elizabeth are really interesting in battle, they give you an edge where enemies might surround, moreover to progress the story she has to literally pull you and her into another universe. Not going to say much about this and how this happens, but holy molly it is mind blowing in a way.\n\nNow character wise, the main character De Witt, he just wants to get things done. He doesnt care about what happens in the city, he doesnt care about goo or bad, he cares about getting things done. Now many characters in games will get completly side tracked to help a person, but De Wiit only does things if he has to. Its a really good character model, and so far he has changed a little in the story. I dont know if he will change more, if your actions will affect the end of the game, I dont know, but I really like his character so far. Elizabeth  is the girl in the towet iwith a strange power that  only wants freedom. How will this affect the two character. We will see later.\n\nSo far I love this game, is entertaining in almost every sense of the word. For me this game so far is an 8/10, and i give it this score for me beacuse I havent finished it yet, so I want to wait till the story is over so I can see if it gets better ir not.","timestamp_created":1438996169,"timestamp_updated":1438996169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17436292","author":{"steamid":"76561198191701418","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":118,"last_played":1576667850},"language":"english","review":"best fps shooter i have ever played my favorite out off the 3","timestamp_created":1438992352,"timestamp_updated":1438992352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17434382","author":{"steamid":"76561198170416057","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":531,"last_played":1636244753},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinte is a fast past action game with twist and turns everyware the game is super fun and is a  great game","timestamp_created":1438981523,"timestamp_updated":1438981523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17434103","author":{"steamid":"76561198067252771","num_games_owned":910,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":413,"last_played":1505124785},"language":"swedish","review":"i like the story and the gameplay alot i think its fun. the main story is a bit to short though but still nontheless a game i'd recommend\n","timestamp_created":1438980195,"timestamp_updated":1438980195,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473684221506118774","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17433497","author":{"steamid":"76561198169225594","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1016,"last_played":1499616352},"language":"romanian","review":"the story line is amazing when you finaly manage to understand the connection  betwen the tears .          10/10","timestamp_created":1438977206,"timestamp_updated":1438977206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17433441","author":{"steamid":"76561198006784126","num_games_owned":420,"num_reviews":358,"playtime_forever":800,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":800,"last_played":1438972862},"language":"german","review":"Bioshock Invinite\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=493819747\n\n[b]POSITIVES[/b]\n\n+ gute Wassereffekte (wie bei allen Bioshock Spielen)\n+ schöne Lichteffekte\n+ viele kleine Details\n+ hervorragende deutsche Vollvertonung\n+ gute Umgebungs-Soundeffekte\n+ viele Voxophone Audio Logs (mal mehr mal weniger interessant)\n+ ähnlich wie in den Vorgängern sammelt man besondere Kräfte (siehe dazu aber weiter unten)\n+ Waffen fangen an vor Hitze rot zu glühen, wenn man diese ohne Pause abfeuert (leider geschieht das viel zu schnell)\n+ Begleiterin Elizabeth\n+ solide 13 Stunden Spielzeit für einen Shooter\n+ 1999er Modus, der anspruchsvoller ist (auf den man aber auch erst nach einmaligem Durchspielen Zugriff hat)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=493819876\n\n[b]NEGATIVES[/b]\n\n- schlechte Bodentexturen (Gras) und auch ansonsten nicht gerade die besten Texturen\n- zu bunt\n- viel zu durchgeknalltes Szenario\n- total wirre Story\n- Klon NSC \n- kein freies Speichern\n- Kräfte oft total überflüssig\n- Wasser (am Strand) nicht betretbar\n- sehr schlauchiges Leveldesign \n- elendiges Levelrecycling (teilweise läuft man zwei bis vier Mal durch das gleiche Level)\n- NSC Gegner nutzen leider keine Spezialfähigkeiten, obwohl überall in Columbia damit gehandelt wird;

Columbia ist quasi die fliegende Schwester von Rapture nur dass die Wolkenstadt keine Freigeister und Forscher angelockt hat, sondern Christen bzw. fanatische rassistische Sektierer. Wirkliche Spannung und Spielspaß kam bei mir aber leider kaum auf. Ich hatte oft das Gefühl, dass selbst den Entwicklern ihre verschwurbelte Story über den Kopf gewachsen ist. Die beider Vorgänger sind die besseren Spiele, so dass ich Bioshock Infinite leider nicht empfehlen kann.\n\nWenn ihr an weiteren Reviews von mir interessiert seid, dann folgt meiner [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868887-Dark-Chummer%27s-Reviews/?appid=63110]Gruppe[/url].","timestamp_created":1438976926,"timestamp_updated":1550164719,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.365617156028747559","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17432449","author":{"steamid":"76561198047756389","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":516,"last_played":1499672818},"language":"koreana","review":"게임? ㄴㄴ 예술 ㅇㅇ","timestamp_created":1438972156,"timestamp_updated":1438972156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17431810","author":{"steamid":"76561198035082474","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1338,"last_played":1464768509},"language":"russian","review":"Вы никогда не забудете эту игру!","timestamp_created":1438968954,"timestamp_updated":1438968954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17431138","author":{"steamid":"76561198137233959","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":659,"last_played":1601999818},"language":"spanish","review":"Maravilloso, jugad el 1 tambien es aun mejor.","timestamp_created":1438965712,"timestamp_updated":1438965712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17431113","author":{"steamid":"76561198121814069","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":765,"last_played":1472768555},"language":"english","review":"There are no words.

Протагонистом игры является бывший сотрудник «Детективного агентства Пинкертона» Букер ДеВитт. Что касается финала, то тут привычных «нескольких концовок» не предвидится, хотя по ходу сюжета и встречаются места, где игроку предоставляется возможность выбора того или иного варианта пути. Тем не менее, после титров появляется непреодолимое желание пройти игру ещё раз, только более вдумчиво и медленно. В любом случае после завершения сюжетной линии равнодушным вы точно не останетесь. Также стоит отметить потрясающую актерскую игру, что вовсе не случайно, ведь на озвучивание в BioShock Infinite потратили уйму времени и сил. Благо, что русские локализаторы не добрались до дублированного перевода и сделали в игре субтитры. В итоге каждый из персонажей получился настолько ярким, что запоминается надолго. В игре Букеру ДеВитту будет помогать 20-летняя девушка по имени Элизабет. По сюжету она много времени провела в заточении и там весьма неплохо научилась взламывать дверные замки. Так что если проход куда-то для вас оказывается закрытым либо требуется взломать сейф, то способности Элизабет будут весьма кстати (от игрока лишь требуется снабжать девушку отмычками). Да и в иной трудной ситуации эта помощница подсобит: то патронов подкинет, то аптечку предложит, то соли даст. С помощью экстраординарных способностей Элизабет мы также сможем натравить на противников стаю голодных ворон или подбросить небольшую группу негодяев на пару секунд в воздух. Кстати, если вы отдаете предпочтение старому доброму огнестрельному оружию, то убивать врагов только с его помощью не получится. Если в начале уничтожать противников в ближнем бою ещё возможно, то к середине игры сделать это уже нельзя, поскольку в дело вступают снайперы, роботизированные охранники и ракетчики.\n\n\nСложность прохождения сюжета в игре достаточно высокая. А если вы еще и любитель трудных ситуаций, то вам разработчики приготовили настоящее испытание. В условиях высокой сложности игроку предстоит искать подход к каждому типу противников, правильно сочетая «заклинание» и огнестрельное оружие. Опять-таки весьма полезными окажутся и сверх способности Элизабет. Она умеет открывать проходы в параллельные вселенные и извлекать из них различные полезные предметы. Например, девушка сможет по вашему приказу поставить турель либо создать укрытие.\nЛюбопытна в BioShock Infinite и транспортная система, а именно аэрорельсы. Мало того, что с их помощью можно передвигаться по городу, так вдобавок ко всему во время поездки игрок может застрелить нескольких противников. А спрыгнув с такой аэрорельсы, можно и раздробить кому-нибудь череп с помощью крюка, на котором только что катались. Что касается RPG-составляющей в BioShockInfinite, то прокачке поддаётся буквально все оружие и все умения. Вдобавок к этому можно носить с собой до четырех вещей, которые, так или иначе, влияют на характеристики какого-либо оружия или способностей. Стоимость таких вещей очень высока, и, чтобы найти хоть какие-нибудь дополнительные финансовые средства, игроку придётся обыскать немало трупов.\n\n\nБезусловно, ничто в этом мире не идеально. Так, в BioShockInfinite есть небольшие проблемы с искусственным интеллектом персонажей, поведение которых порой не поддается никакой логике. Но в целом работа, проделанная IrrationalGames, разработчиками игры, получилась очень достойной, если не сказать — выдающейся. После прохождения сюжета даже остается определенная пища для размышлений. Несмотря на то, что в 2013 г. выпущено много различных игровых хитов, на сегодня лишь немногие из «громких» проектов смогли оправдать возложенные на них ожидания. На этом общем фоне BioShockInfinite, безусловно, стал одним из самых ярких событий современной игровой индустрии.\n\nОценка:10/10\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1438859735,"timestamp_updated":1438859735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503816783428192139","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17412708","author":{"steamid":"76561198082627531","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":396,"last_played":1568400981},"language":"thai","review":"เป็นเกมที่ดีมากๆ เนื้อเรื่องสุดยอด เอาไปทำหนังได้เลย สนุกมาก","timestamp_created":1438859684,"timestamp_updated":1438859684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17412153","author":{"steamid":"76561198235405640","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":937,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":924,"last_played":1450617193},"language":"english","review":"GOOD FUN GAME","timestamp_created":1438856216,"timestamp_updated":1438856216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17411408","author":{"steamid":"76561198174436133","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":129,"playtime_forever":522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":376,"last_played":1444819025},"language":"polish","review":"Tylko jedno słowo opisze tą grę: Arcydzieło.","timestamp_created":1438851411,"timestamp_updated":1438851411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466237932443618774","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17411265","author":{"steamid":"76561198162807436","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":798,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":719,"last_played":1463352821},"language":"hungarian","review":"Awesome, I absolutly recommend this game !!!

Luckily, it turns out you don't need to have played Bioshock 2 to follow the story in this one.\n\nWow. What can I say? It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a game this much. The presentation is top notch, the story is excellent, and it all ties in very nicely together. The biggest downside I'd say is that the combat is rather repetitive. Compared to the first game, there is far more gunplay and not nearly as much stealth....\n\n\nThe good\n[list][*]The graphics are brilliant. You'll be grateful the first portion of the game is just story and scenery because you'll be spending most of it wandering round marvelling at the detail and imagination that's gone into the production of Columbia\n[*]The voice actors and music are excellent. I don't know where they find these people, but they have just the right amount of emotion to drag you in and make you feel for the characters\n[*]The story. It's slow to start, and a lot of things you come across seem a little out of place, but as you progress everything gradually comes together, including a tie-in to the first game\n[/list]\n\nThe bad\n[list][*]As mentioned, the actual shooter part of the game gets repetitive very quickly. It's not innovative and it's not much fun. Sure, it's a challenge on the higher difficulties, but other games have done this much better before\n[*]The game is fairly linear, but that's what we've come to expect from the Bioshock series. There's very little in the way of sidequests apart from the occasional door you can lockpick, and none of the choices the game lets you make actually make any difference in the end\n[/list]\n\nGet it if you want to see a nice, shiny well-polished AAA game that isn't afraid to spend time developing a story with conflicted, deep characters. But don't expect anything new gameplay wise.\n\nOh, and get the \"Burial At Sea\" DLC.

Especially after whatever god awful corporate money based direction gaming companies will take the series in. For all we know EA will eventually own the rights to this or square or some other mega gaming company. It may very well be doomed after this.\n\n Bioshock Infinite, with its DLC, ties the entire series together. Story wise Bioshock Infinite was very powerful. It could have used some more gameplay hours in my opinion, I completeled everything in about 18 hours.Not counting clash in the clouds, which im probably not going to play very much of as its just a combat minigame. The length is not a major drawback, its just the story and gameplay are so good the hours pass by quickly.\n\nI wouldnt spend more than 20 dollars on this including dlc (try not to spend more dollars than hours youre going to put into a game).","timestamp_created":1438764190,"timestamp_updated":1438764597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17396011","author":{"steamid":"76561198168408302","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1153,"last_played":1439109024},"language":"english","review":"Buy it.","timestamp_created":1438763316,"timestamp_updated":1438763316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17394898","author":{"steamid":"76561198004669277","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1769,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1649,"last_played":1619427916},"language":"english","review":"The game was going great until the minorities went all Ferguson on it","timestamp_created":1438755154,"timestamp_updated":1438874514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17394608","author":{"steamid":"76561198158938940","num_games_owned":2084,"num_reviews":465,"playtime_forever":1084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":734,"last_played":1632243446},"language":"english","review":"Love this game.
