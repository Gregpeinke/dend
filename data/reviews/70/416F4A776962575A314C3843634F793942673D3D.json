I would say it’s sinful to not have any Half-Life game in your Steam library. \n\n+Awesome and fun campaign\n+Numerous aliens and soldiers to fight against\n+Every chapter takes you to a new and unique location without it being the same sort of level again and again. Lots of platforming and puzzles to have to figure out in order to progress.\n+Tons of weapons to use\n+Can save where ever and also frequent auto saves\n+A nice tutorial\n+Not heavy in dialogue and cutscenes allowing more gameplay which is always nice. Occasionally scientists will explain the situation more so instead of just running around killing tons of aliens\n+Scientists can heal you and you can command security guards to follow and assist you\n+Lots of little details that make the game so amazing. Every character reacts in unique ways, aliens will respond to smell and noises, roaches will go towards meat, aliens will attack differently depending on their surroundings, etc. Aka just a little of extra things that most games don’t even attempt to add or do.\n+Kinda short about 3-4 hours\n+Xen\n+Definitely creepy and mysterious at times\n+God tier soundtrack\n+Multiplayer… ig\n+Cheats\n+Breakable crates full of items everywhere\n+Multiple endings\n+Room full of Gaben’s face\n\n-The way Gordon throws explosives is so annoying so many times he’ll just drop on the ground right in front of him and seems to never throw it. Yet on rare occasions he seems to turn into Tom Brady and launch the explosives. Mainly he barely throws it from himself.\n-The game does have multiplayer however, as you can obviously guess for a 23 year old game it’s dead and nobody is playing. There’s still several servers running for what reason idk and a few have bots but they’re usually brain dead and never try to kill you or aimbot that absolute shit out of you. Besides that if you actually find a server with people in it. It’s usually only one server with less than 3 people in it and the only ones playing are some weird no life cucks who have been playing this game for years and will destroy you. To put it simply, the multiplayer is pointless to attempt to play whatsoever.\n-Wished that the game gave more of an insight on how to use the long jump when you acquire it as it doesn’t seem to tell you whatsoever how to use it. Even going into the tutorial and seeing how to properly use it I could only get it to work every other jump. Just annoying on how it didn’t tell you how to use it initially and then was problematic to get to work sometimes\n-Maybe it was just because I was playing on hard but, I wish there was slightly more autosaves as after clearing 3 rooms of about 15 enemies and then dying and being reset before any of that is really annoying. I guess I just have to save really often.\n-From what I remember several grates that are unable to be broken have the same texture as breakable ones\n-Game has remote play although I really doubt it works whatsoever. I've never seen Half-Life in split screen and honestly don’t think there is any iteration of it let alone a server that will somehow allow 2 people to play on the same client I don’t see working.\n-Issues with reloading at sometimes the gun with freeze and you cannot reload for a couple seconds or the reload animation doesn’t appear\n-Trying to kill headcrabs with the shotgun seems to never work\n\nHalf-Life is without a doubt a classic FPS shooter that just shows how amazing Valve is that this was one of their first games with so many small details it has in it like a GTA game. The game is just a really entertaining campaign with all kinds of weapons, enemies, and cool locations. The soundtrack is awesome but I wish it had played more often. Honestly nothing really wrong with this game it all besides is dead multiplayer but what do you expect it came out over 20 years ago. Some odd few are still playing it idk why…. Anyways if you are contemplating buying this and don’t like older games like this one then get the Black Mesa remake as you’ll probably enjoy that more so.","timestamp_created":1372982935,"timestamp_updated":1623551152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4164583","author":{"steamid":"76561198033119918","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":619,"last_played":1372875440},"language":"english","review":"its a decent game of its time. though the glitches are really annoying and wont let me finish the game, security guard wont follow me at chapter 12.","timestamp_created":1372944725,"timestamp_updated":1372944725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2274517","author":{"steamid":"76561198004987355","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":661,"last_played":1576870805},"language":"english","review":"Great game.","timestamp_created":1372931690,"timestamp_updated":1372931690,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510722875595092773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1699520","author":{"steamid":"76561197996652838","num_games_owned":351,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":400,"playtime_last_two_weeks":88,"playtime_at_review":113,"last_played":1660492977},"language":"english","review":"It's a classic that no one should go without playing.","timestamp_created":1372919802,"timestamp_updated":1385423630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwibWZ1L8CcOy9Bg=="}
