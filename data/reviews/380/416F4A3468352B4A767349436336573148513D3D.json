Is all i can say. There is only one complaint that i have and its the AI! Oh lord! She is only good for opening doors and killing. Which in Half Life you would think is enough. But this is the first Half Life, and Valve game, where i was frustrated by the difficulty. A challenge is one thing, but this is on a whole nother level. Alyx will literally not go where i want her to go, and for some reason this game has two(maybe more) instances where you are basically at the mercy of how good and how fast she can kill things. The scenes i am talking about are the ones where you turn the wheel to open the gate. And it would not be a problem if there were not so many antlions poking you causing the gate to close.\n\nI would have thought that having someone follow you around would make the game a little bit easier, and she is pretty handy, but having her around is just a nuisance. In Half Life 2 there was a part where you \"command\" soldiers to navigate the streets to get to the Citadel. And just keeping them alive was a pain because they went where the pleased most of the time. But at least for them you had some sort of control. Ive found myself having to push her to go where i want her to.\n\nThe good things i have to say about this game were the graphics and story. I played Half Life 2 on Xbox and on my Xbox 360.  And that game came out a while ago, so the graphics werent as sharp or at least from my experience. But wow! The graphics were amazing! This is a beautiful game.\n\nThe story is great. I am already hooked and it is only the beginning stages of the game. Valve does a good job at making people want to continue the game just to find out what happens next in the story. In Half Life 2: episode one I am trying to bear the headache of having Alx join me because ever since i finished Half Life 2 many years ago I was left wanting more, especially with that ending!\n\nOverall i do recommend this game but buyer beware that it will take a whole lot of patience and a whole lot of time to get used to her. The main reason i think buyers would like this game is for the story. If you care more about the story then this game satisfies that. It is definitely a game that gamers should play at least once in their life just to experience Alyx AI","timestamp_created":1388565136,"timestamp_updated":1388565136,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454179972410202026","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8472941","author":{"steamid":"76561198115176200","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":443,"last_played":1417652219},"language":"english","review":"this game is very brain racking and very fun for older children or very mature young children its very fun i suggest you get it right now or any of the other half life 2's like half llife 2 and episode 2 this is a amazing game.your charicter is gordon freeman he/you need to make it to your old freind barny and help him help citisens onto an escape train you get to battle zombies,headcrabs,soldiers,and antlions its just fun","timestamp_created":1388552786,"timestamp_updated":1388552786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8471031","author":{"steamid":"76561198030976818","num_games_owned":545,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1388539601},"language":"english","review":"Not as good as Half-Life 2, but still a must play for fans of Half-Life 2.

Da Half-Life 2 mir auch schon sehr gut gefallen hat. Nachdem ich im Spiel meinen Autoführerschein gemacht habe (Mein Fahrlehrer war Dog) Cruiste ich ein wenig durch die Zitadelle. Einige Zeit später kam ich dann im dritten Kapitel Namens \"Untergrund\" an. Das geile an dem Kapitel waren: Die Dunkelheit und die Zombine ... Hehe versteht ihr? Combine + Headcrap = Zombine... Hehe ne? Äh ja den Spruch hat Alyx sich ausgedacht! Das Kapitel hatte einen leichten hauch von Horror was ich sehr geil fand, in Verbindung mit den Zombies wurde aus dem Kapitel ein wirklich geiles Spiel Erlebnis. In diesem Kapitel gab es auch Leuchtfackeln. Wenn man diese entzündete und seine eigene Taschenlampe ausschaltete war die Atmosphäre noch mal einen tacken düsterer und demnach auch genialer. Da gab es beispielsweise eine stelle wo wir einen Aufzug Reparieren sollten, als dieser wieder Funktionstüchtig war und etwas Zeit brauchte um herunter zu kommen kamen einige Zombies aus der Dunkelheit um uns Gesellschaft zu leisten. An diesem Punkt habe ich wieder eine der Leuchtfackeln gezündet und dabei kam ein ziemlich geiles Bild heraus. Was ich an den Zombine noch ziemlich cool finde sind ihre Geräusche die sie machen. Hört sich besonders bedrohlich an wenn man mal alle Lichtquellen ausmacht und dann im Dunkeln hockt. Wenn die dann auf einen zu gestürmt kommen bekommt man da schon mal Paranoia. Was ich ebenfalls ganz lustig finde ist das wenn sie einem zu nahe kommen eine Granate aus ihren Taschen holen und sie so lange in die Luft halten bis sie Explodieren. \n\nQuelle:\nhttp://1000kcirtap.wordpress.com/","timestamp_created":1387647124,"timestamp_updated":1387647124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8167501","author":{"steamid":"76561197976095300","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":14,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1561802624},"language":"english","review":"Great continuation of the story.

This game 2 hours playing and all I can say is, the plot is boring, you just run through a ruined factory, or whatever, using only the gravity gun. For God sake, why you need to pass more than one hour using only the gravity gun, what sucks as a weapon, when every enemy is using a machine gun?!! Their weapons simple vanish preventing you from getting it. The gravity gun should be like the kinetic in Dead Space, a bad and slow weapon used only you are out of ammo, just like the classic crowbar. If you only will give me only the bad weapon, give me my crowbar! And when you finally get you gun, the alien zombie enemies, that don't shoot you, begins to appears. It means, the game can have you using the gravity gun against armed soldiers, but you need a gun to fight unarmed aliens. Very logical!\n\nHalf Life 1 is one of the best games I ever played, I really though that Half Life 2 was inferior into everything, with exception of graphics, than the first one, but still playable, beatable and funny. But this third one, is too weak, it is boring, have parts the that piss you off. For exemple, the part of elevator that wreckage falls from the ceiling, and you are supose to shoot that before it falls, but they end uo falling and breaking the elevator too fast for you to get a shock orb (or whatever that is) and shoot them in the falling wreckage, and the gravity gun has too little range to shoot them directly in time. I needed to repeat that many time until I finally got the way, and the next part, you are supose to grab a computer out of the way with the gravity and shoot a shock orb, but there is no indication that you can grab that, and that is a major flaw of the gravity gun, you never know when you can shoot the gravity repeller, or grab any thing, and when it decides you can shoot, doesn't mean you can grab, this takes me to other part of the game that sucks, when the train crashes. There you can shoot anywhere, but can grab nothing, I needed a walkthrough to figure out that I needed to grab the soldier that was attacking the girl, and drag him out for she to escape, until there I was only shooting him, what more should I think? The gun shoots, the thing is attacking, so shoot him.\n\nAnyway, being Half Life doesn't make a good game, the Valve should had it tested to the end before launching, and correcting this problems, and rethink the idea.","timestamp_created":1385581139,"timestamp_updated":1385581162,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.35236436128616333","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7787213","author":{"steamid":"76561198085002055","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":820,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":820,"last_played":1467582787},"language":"english","review":"Get more Half Life 2\nImproves upon base game's flaws\nContinues story","timestamp_created":1385573117,"timestamp_updated":1518664671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7776777","author":{"steamid":"76561198027912887","num_games_owned":594,"num_reviews":104,"playtime_forever":209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":209,"last_played":1335164400},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 2: Episode One takes place directly after the ending of Half-Life 2.
