I do recommend this game to anyone who likes a fast paced FPS but it is because of these new people and even the people who can never progress there skills on this game that worries me. YOU CAN BE TO GOOD FOR THIS GAME NOW! This new community is killing this game for the skilled and next generation of skilled players to come.

It especially ticks me off when I get banned all for accusations of doing either of them. I wish this game worked like the law in a way, \"innocent until proven guilty\".

This game is actually pretty fun but is no where near as fun as counter strike in my eyes but its still a very good game. Theres not much i can say cause this game is just like counter strike bu there are some diffrences. The maps are way bigger and the guns take some time getting used to. But there are a few negatives i want to talk about. Its quite difficult to find people who play on the official valve servers and not some neon filled maps (even though i kinda like those) but the biggest gripe with this game is the community. If you get on a map thats quite populated you will get kicked off for pretty much anything negative you do. Talking on the mic or playing badly will get you kicked off the server quickly.

There's so little to do and so little to see that it feels unfinished. When I say unfinished I don't mean it's buggy I just mean it's generally lacking in content on it's own and missing features from the original. Some of the community still playing is pretty awesome though and or course it's cool to play a WW2 shooter on the Source engine that allows for ADS with some weapons and even CRAWLING. Sniping in Day of Deafeat Source is my personal favorite and some best fun you'll have in my opinion.\n\nUnfortunatley player limits on how many players can choose a certain class make it so that you'll have to wait to get your chance. Every other gun feels like crap and controls as well as a wet turd on a treadmill which feels like it might have been an attempt at realism. I like this game oddly enough but just because I like something doesn't mean it's good. It's not overwhelmingly bad but it's hardly above average and only worth 5 dollars NOT 10.

DOD: Source has a sense of focus and purity that you won't find in Team Fortress 2, or perhaps even CS. Zero cosmetics, zero DLC, zero bloat.\n\nThere's no gadgetry to be found, save for frag and smoke grenades. Weapons have satisfyingly strong recoil -- if you want to 'Rambo' with a MG-42, you're gonna need a massive mouse-pad. Movement is fast and overall results in somewhat frenetic gameplay. There's Arena Shooter genes here.\n\nThat said, this is a game that places notable emphasis on teamwork. Barring imbalanced teams, the side with better coordination is likely to win the match. Many points are challenging to capture/hold without teamwork, to say nothing about completing the Detonation objectives on Colmar and Jagd.\n\nGraphics are simple (not bad for 2005) and easy to read. Sounds are satisfying and the DOD theme is wonderfully nostalgic.\n\nThe official Valve-made map rotation is slim, with just 9 total (Anzio, Argentan, Avalanche, Colmar, Donner, Flash, Jagd, Kalt, Palermo). The map design therein is strong however. There are also community-made maps available, many of which are quite good.\n\nPlayer population for the Eastern US is rather decent. In prime time many servers are full and even in the more off-hours there's usually life to be found. It's a small but dedicated community, and far from a dead game.\n\nI wholeheartedly suggest giving this game a try -- everyone should already own it since every Steam user should purchase the Valve Complete Pack in the first place. There's some minor balance annoyances to be found but on the whole it's a remarkably polished multiplayer FPS.\n\nAdditional Notes: \n- If this sounds appealing but you absolutely cannot endure early Source Engine graphics, there's Day of Infamy by New World Interactive, a standalone expansion for Insurgency. It's not entirely the same vibe but it's similar and has Valve's blessing as a spiritual follow-up.\n\n- The simplicity does result in a lack of variety, so in my play sessions I'll usually just stick around for one full map rotation before heading off to something else. This is a game I keep installed at all times though.","timestamp_created":1421794807,"timestamp_updated":1543085543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14084009","author":{"steamid":"76561198052085688","num_games_owned":675,"num_reviews":138,"playtime_forever":157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":157,"last_played":1421788354},"language":"english","review":"Quite a fun shooter indeed!

I was playing Day of Defeat  myself when I was about 16 asa a mod. I played right through to the introduction of Source. I'm 31 now and haven't played in years until I picked it up again in a sale.\n\nThe beauty is, you go right back into it. You remember instantly how it works because it is so naturally designed, if the two words can be put together. Even the abundance of Orange maps on the servers these days show how good the base gameplay is outside of the World War II setting. It doesn't matter if the map is all orange, or if the server is all Avalanche, because the base game is still fantastic to play. \n\nEvery role can play it's part. Teamwork is needed to hold certain positions but maverick behaviour can sometimes seal the deal and is often needed for the last flag. Mental strategy is involved, psychological warfare in a small shooter. Let's push left, when we actually want to go right. Tie everyone down in one direction, then storm up the middle. Sneak a wild card in near their spawn and tie them down trying to find him, meanwhile everyone capture the other flags. \n\nEvery single match has a million dynamic things going on like this which change case by case based on the people involved, the atmosphere of the server, etc. The experience in all is a fantastic one and if you have never tried it, I can't recommend it enough.","timestamp_created":1421549170,"timestamp_updated":1421549496,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14042326","author":{"steamid":"76561198034766576","num_games_owned":1515,"num_reviews":676,"playtime_forever":97,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1379014138},"language":"english","review":"This is boring.","timestamp_created":1421547808,"timestamp_updated":1421547808,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.385090231895446777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0MS2/coCds3INQ=="}
