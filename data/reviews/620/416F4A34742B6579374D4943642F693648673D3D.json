Esta é a palavra que eu usaria se fosse definir (pobremente, pois uma só palavra não dá para definir) minha experiência com Portal 2.\n\nDe início fui relutante em jogá-lo devido ao hype e popularidade desproporcional que o jogo tomou. Não que estas coisas por si só sejam ruins, porém a forma como as pessoas se manifestavam sobre o jogo era demasiado chato e eu realmente não compreendi o porquê tomou estas proporções... No primeiro jogo pouquíssimas pessoas sequer tinham ouvido falar do tal. Muito me leva a crer que grande parte dos que ficaram de \"aiiin portauu d2is\" nunca nem jogaram o primeiro. \nApesar de esta ser uma resistência minha por parte da... vertente(?) que o jogo tomou, ele realmente me impressionou positivamente.\n\nComo já esperado do primeiro, Portal é recheado de tiradas inteligentes e humor que faz uma 'punção' na mente do jogador, tanto pelo sarcasmo ou pela improvável graça que personagens \"mecânicos\" conseguem passar a um personagem mudo.\n\nEm termos de jogabilidade permanece muito como o anterior (dificilmente há como mudar isso em Portal). Todavia o jogo está bem mais amplo, versátil, envolvente e divertido. Com diversas características novas e velhas repensadas.\n\nOs gráficos estão mais bonitos e a iluminação caprichadíssima. Os ambientes refletem bem a história do jogo, porém acheio o jogo um pouco pesado para uma engine ultrapassada como a Source.\n\nOs personagens, os poucos, foram um ás da Valve. Todos são muito cativantes, até mesmo os antagonistas. E também... mesmo os personagens menores conseguem capturar nossa atenção e nos dar um bom divertimento.\n\nO aúdio do jogo me parece mais presente do que em sua versão anterior. A ambientação é bem padrão, nada a evidenciar a não ser pelos pequenos efeitos sonoros de alguns objetos ou ações dentro do jogo e é claro, a voz da Ellen McLain que é linda. ahahhaha\n\nNuma conclusão... eu diria que Portal 2 é um jogo que você pode se surpreender com ou sem expectativas e mesmo se você estiver jogando apenas por diversão, também vale muito a pena. Agora se você estiver jogando pelo dois citados agora a pouco e pela história, entào tenho que dizer que você DEVE comprar este grande jogo.","timestamp_created":1386776484,"timestamp_updated":1386776484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8004523","author":{"steamid":"76561198046019648","num_games_owned":418,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":674,"last_played":1436396820},"language":"english","review":"Mindfuck.","timestamp_created":1386773608,"timestamp_updated":1386773608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8004065","author":{"steamid":"76561198002184182","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":923,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":425,"last_played":1405695514},"language":"english","review":"I am playing the campaign for the second time in a row and still enjoy it very much.

Portal 2 is longer, funnier, harder, has an even more engaging story and more satisfying than the first game. This is basically exactly what a sequel should aspire to be: better than it's predecessor. It's very clear that Valve didn't just crap out a quick cash-in sequel, they went the extra mile to make this game worth buying by it self (as oppose to being bundled with Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2).
