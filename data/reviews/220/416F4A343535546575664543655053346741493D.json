I really enjoyed the game as a whole, the only gripe I have with it is that the travelling from City 17 to escape to Nova Prospekt was really long but the Ravenholm section broke it up a bit at least. Saying that it felt right and as it should for Gordon being on the run, the firefights were cool as f**k from masses of Combine forces, taking down huge gunships and Strider battles! I liked meeting all of the rebellion members along the way helping them fend off the Combine and how Breen adapted the technology/creatures of the Xen to fight for him besides the obvious sentient Vortigaunt slaves that joined the rebellion.\n\nAll in all it was a very good game with the obvious [spoiler]open ended[/spoiler] ending and leaving me with more questions than answer. Congrats, Valve. Giving me blue balls twice in two consecutive months AND I haven't even played Chapter 1, 2 and Lost Coast yet which are supposed to add an entirely new twist to the ending of HL2 ;/\n\n10/10 (I also played the original version, not the HL2: Update)","timestamp_created":1586869361,"timestamp_updated":1586869704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528700947761535645","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67293521","author":{"steamid":"76561198972050643","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1648911479},"language":"english","review":"rise and shine Mr. freeman, rise and shine.\ngreat game and great gameplay. would recommend to anyone","timestamp_created":1586869291,"timestamp_updated":1586869291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67293154","author":{"steamid":"76561198436530428","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":432,"last_played":1614012675},"language":"english","review":"n i c e game, i also recommend the smod redux mod","timestamp_created":1586868890,"timestamp_updated":1586868890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67293144","author":{"steamid":"76561198368613012","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1030,"last_played":1600599413},"language":"russian","review":"Я:  Вот буквально полчасика поиграю, а потом спать.\n\nHalf-Life2:  Ха-ха наивный...","timestamp_created":1586868880,"timestamp_updated":1586868880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67292569","author":{"steamid":"76561198150091970","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1781,"last_played":1586867362},"language":"italian","review":"Half-Life 2 fa un grande passo avanti rispetto al suo predecessore.

It took about 10.5 hours to beat the game at what I would consider a pretty decent clip.\n\nThe major gripe I have with HL2 is the zombie portions of the game, namely Ravenholm. They slow the game down to a crawl and tend to be very annoying, the enemies are loud and obnoxious, the poison headcrabs can nearly one-shot you, and the music and atmosphere of the game goes from ominous and intense to nonexistent or boring. I can see what they were going for but for me it really missed its mark.\n\nReaching the end of the game and looking back at the start and into the middle of the game, it almost feels like it was an entirely different genre, which I really enjoyed. Just as puzzles start to get boring, the game lets you loose with your shotgun and pulse rifle, as that gets sort of old the game introduces new enemies or characters that are immediately likeable or at least interesting, the changes in scenery were just often enough to let you get used to it but not so much as to get old or maze-like, overall I definitely see why this game is hailed as a masterpiece, but perhaps a bit of cult following exaggerated my expectations. A solid title with fun puzzle elements, tight controls and unique weaponry, and an enjoyable story.
