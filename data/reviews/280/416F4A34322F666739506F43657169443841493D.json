At this point you should stop reading reviews for this game and instead buy either the original GoldSrc version or Black Mesa, I'm sure the other reviews can tell you exactly what is wrong with this game.\nNevertheless, here are some of the problems and other funny glitches I experienced, trying to avoid popular examples:\n\n-Weapons dropped from enemies have a habit of floating.\n\n-The nice Source-powered water effects aren't adapted for any other type of liquid, and sometimes aren't even applied to normal water.\n\n-Nitpick, but the default key for quick-loading is changed from F7 (used in both HL1 and HL2) to F9 by default, forcing you to go in and change it when you start the game. Again, nitpick-y, but it's annoying when you get in a bad situation and the normal quick-load key does nothing.\n\n-Sometimes quick-loading will instead boot you to the title screen.\n\n-On the dam scene for the title screen, the HECU grunt that goes back and forth on the right will disappear before he walks out of viewing range. \n\n-Some of my Lambda Core quicksaves carried the chapter name \"#HL1_Chapter14_Title\"\n\nOverall, the only reason you should get this game is for GMod content (even then, most GMod workshop mods don't require this game in particular so you'd mostly be mounting it for the weapons and/or enemies. Also, for some reason the HD models don't work in GMod).
