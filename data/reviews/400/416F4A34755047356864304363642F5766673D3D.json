Chell - główna bohaterka - dostaje do użytku Portal Gun, potrafiący rzucić dwa portale na specjalnie do tego przeznaczone powierzchnie. Działają one na zasadzie \"co pierwszym wleci, drugim wyleci\", a więc można ich użyć np. do przemieszczania się po planszy.

Dito isso, minha avalição é neutra.\nRecomendo se você tiver jogado Portal 2 e estiver curioso para saber do passado de GLaDOS e a protagonista (tendo em conta que a campanha dura apenas 3 horas) ou simplesmente for um fã da franquia e suas mecânicas e tiver a curiosidade de ver com seus próprio olhos como elas evoluíram. Fora isso, é um jogo curte sem muito a oferecer, ainda mais se comparado com toda a completude de sua sequência.\n\nEm suma: aos fãs da franquia, esperem uma daquelas promoções bacanas que a Steam sempre faz para adquirir o jogo (o comprei por R$5,00) e matar a curiosidade (como fiz); aos novatos que desejam conhecer esse Puzzle-shooter maravilhoso de quebrar a cabeça, comprem o Portal 2.","timestamp_created":1499138364,"timestamp_updated":1499138364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33212653","author":{"steamid":"76561198136306660","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":111,"last_played":1498991051},"language":"english","review":"nicely done.","timestamp_created":1499137734,"timestamp_updated":1499137734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33212030","author":{"steamid":"76561198333279646","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":152,"last_played":1527469559},"language":"english","review":"The game is good, but it is short,  beat it in only 2 hours.
