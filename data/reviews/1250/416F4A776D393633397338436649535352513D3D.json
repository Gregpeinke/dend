Nope, those dickwads always want it to be, to quote Fred Durst again, \"MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY!\" (Sorry for exposing you to autism AKA Fred Durst) Also, one of the fukbois that berated me is gay, and he's boyfriend is a furry fgt (Nothing against being gay, it's just, why do you need to display it on your steam profile?
