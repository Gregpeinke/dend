L4D or L4D2?\" I will say every single time Left 4 Dead is better. The game looks better, it plays and feels better. It's also harder than L4D2 and has some gameplay features that is not in L4D2 that makes it harder. For example, Tanks that are on fire in L4D become much faster and can completely murder you're entire team, where as in L4D2, there is no increase in speed. It is of my own opinion also that I think L4D2 just feels more like an arcade game where you can just rush through the campagin. No challenge, not hard at all unless you're playing a modded map that is solely created TO be hard as it possibly can. Now if you looked at how many hours I have on L4D2 and think I am a hypocrite, then I ask you to stop right there and pull the head that is yours out of you're ass. I've quit L4D2 many times because of how sick I've gotten of the player base(trolls and teamkillers) but I've gone back because of the mods. I know people buy L4D2 over L4D because it has all of the maps, characters and special infected and weapons and other content, but then they're introduced to the world of L4D2s literal fucking hive of teamkillers and trolls. Yes there are griefers in L4D1 but not NEARLY as much as there is in L4D2. So to the question of \"Which is better? L4D or L4D2?\" Left 4 Dead is the answer, it'll always be the answer.","timestamp_created":1489807338,"timestamp_updated":1489807338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504587173461914063","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30579789","author":{"steamid":"76561198207583911","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":4266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2873,"last_played":1569035502},"language":"english","review":"Very good game, I personally prefer it to Left 4 Dead 2 because I feel like the gameplay is more refined. It's also probably the oldest game I still play regularly (I got it on steam recently, most of my time was on xbox)\n\nPros:\nBetter bot AI (may be wrong about this but it feels like it does)\nMore punishing than 2 (harder)\ncan't be pushed off roof easily in no mercy finale (bigger issue than it seems)\nThe small community that's left isn't half as cancerous as 2\nVery fun with friends\nNot many hackers\nNo endless hordes\nMod support\nRuns great on my potato PC, better than 2 does. If it can run on mine it can no doubt run on yours. My specs are shameful\nBetter atmosphere than 2\nCan see your legs\nInfinite shove\n\nCons:\nSmall playerbase\nMods need to be downloaded manually (this isn't an issue to me personally but it may be an issue for someone)\n\nFinal score: 9/10\nThe core game is one of the most enjoyable things i've ever played but the only thing stopping it from being a 10 is the tiny playerbase\n\nAll in all I'd say that this game is very good and I prefer it to l4d2 , however they ported the content from this game into that game but it doesn't feel the same. I recommend buying the bundle if you want to play the games, as it's the best deal.

Ah, a classic fun 4 player Co-Op survival horror game. This game is probably the best most fun game Valve has ever created (besides Half-Life). You choose between a set of four characters: Zoey, Bill, Francis, and Louis. There are different gamemodes such as Single Player Campaign, Co-Op Campaign, Versus, and if you're feeling lucky, Realism Versus and Realism Campaign. Realism is pretty much no hud, you can't see the survivors if you are infected in realism versus, in Campaign you can't see where Meds are, weapons, ect. It's pretty much for those hardcore gamers out there who say \"I'm highly skilled in the arm of killing.\" Now, Let's talk about all that comes with this game.\n\nSingle Player/Co-Op Campaign: Left 4 Dead expands on six campaigns. No Mercy, Crash Course (Free DLC) , Death Toll, Dead Air, Dam It (Originally Cut) , Blood Harvest, and the most depressing DLC that is now free to play (depressing in a good way) The Sacrifice. No Mercy, Death Toll, Dead Air, and Dam It are all five leveled campaigns while Crash Course is two levels and The Sacrifice is three levels. Each level has a finale where you have to fight on hoards of infected and special infected such as Smokers, Hunters, Boomers, Witches, and of course the biggest baddest infected, The Tank. No! Not a military Tank! It's more like a special infected that took way too many steroids and is buff as f**k. Boomers puke on you or blow up on you if someone shoots him (looking at you Francis) and draws hoards of infected onto whoever has the green goop on them. The Smoker has a very long tounge that grabs you and either strangles you, or if he's close enough he claws at you. Hunters basically pounce on you and claw the hell out of you where someone would consider it rape. Witches are pretty easy to get by, but if you shine a flashlight at them or shoot at them, or ever startle them, RUN LIKE F**KING HELL!!! \n\nVerses: Four survivors Vs. tons of special infected players. There are two rounds per level on a single campaign. One round you will be a survivor where you fight off other players and infected while round two You will be the special infected and hunt down the survivors. Whoever has the most points once a campaign is finished wins.\n\nThe Verdic: Left 4 Dead is a fun Co-Op/ Single Player survival horror game that you can play for hours and hours. It's a classic and is still amazing and fun to this day to not just me, but the gaming community. In fact, once you get the hang of this one buy Left 4 Dead 2 for even more fun with new special infected, new campaigns, new survivors, and more. My final verdict for Left 4 Dead is a solid 10/10. Now that Left 4 Dead is over 10 years old and it has been a little over 9 years since Left 4 Dead 2 released, I think it's about time for Valve to release Left 4 Dead 3 this year.","timestamp_created":1489570519,"timestamp_updated":1489570823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30521356","author":{"steamid":"76561198155194368","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":142,"last_played":1565766322},"language":"schinese","review":"经典的丧尸类游戏，媲美生化危机，我心中永恒的经典","timestamp_created":1489565862,"timestamp_updated":1489565862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30519762","author":{"steamid":"76561198312770785","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1543532906},"language":"spanish","review":"Es
