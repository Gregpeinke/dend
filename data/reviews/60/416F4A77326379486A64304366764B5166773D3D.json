Sometimes i think that if Valve had promoted the game well, it'd have been at a much higher level than what it is atm. I surely say, if this game got more players i'd be way more better than many of the modern games.

Played with them for a couple minutes (more like 5) until they left. It was alright, but it would have been WAYYYY better with way more people. The concept is great but the variety of things that the game offers you just does not make it worth it for the long run, which ended up killing the playerbase. Keep in mind that this game was pre-steam. Back then (with more players) it would have even been a mixed bag. If you are looking for some quick games where you jump around and throw disks, then here you go. But with the dead playerbase, this makes it the only valve game I would stay away from.
