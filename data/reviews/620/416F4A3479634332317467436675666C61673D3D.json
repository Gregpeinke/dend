First thing i noticed, besides your humorous and clumsy robotguide,  was that even this game released in 2011 the graphics still holding up to todays standards. But that's not the only thing this game gives you. If you like a mind bending experience, Portal2 gives you that in a variety of puzzles each level of the lab has to offer. It builds up very good from easy to more challenging to incredibly frustrating levels.
