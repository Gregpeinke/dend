I keep seeing more and more of them pop up and they keep getting to the top of store pages as \"most helpful\" when they really don't say anything. Here is an example:\n\n---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\n☑ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☑ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☐ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☐ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☑ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☐ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☑ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☐ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☑ Nothing to grind\n☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☑ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☑ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☑ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☐ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☑ 10\n\nBased on the information provided, can you guess what game this review is for? What's it about? What kind of game is it?\n\nPoint is, these reviews are completely interchangeable. I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.\n\nIn my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.\n\nAnyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?","timestamp_created":1638027738,"timestamp_updated":1638027738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104346369","author":{"steamid":"76561198254682727","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":276,"last_played":1638019951},"language":"czech","review":"uplně na píču hra","timestamp_created":1638019993,"timestamp_updated":1638019993,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104302666","author":{"steamid":"76561198367612242","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1638105295},"language":"english","review":"Hala oynanır","timestamp_created":1638004849,"timestamp_updated":1638004849,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104270838","author":{"steamid":"76561199068307295","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5718,"last_played":1657601066},"language":"russian","review":"жаль что не будет 3 части","timestamp_created":1637989018,"timestamp_updated":1637989018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104263959","author":{"steamid":"76561199018900924","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":79,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50,"last_played":1638052372},"language":"spanish","review":"Recuerdos de Vietnam...

Graphics are dated, gameplay is simple, the learning curve can be punishing for new (also to CS) players, servers are few and the player base is small. However, the community is both tight and warm to newcomers and returning players. I've made several friendly acquaintances and \"DoD buddies\" on here. When a server gets going, it's a wondrous display of bullets and mayhem not unlike any other well-designed shooter. Among the servers that still run, some have great vanilla and modded maps with often interesting adjustments. There's a class/gun and playing style for everyone, regardless of skill or playing background. When there are only a few players on a map, it feels like a duel where the stakes are high and where you alone can turn the tide and when it's full, it feels like a proper skirmish, where everyone contributes their piece but where the group is more important than the individual. Both have their distinct charms. Personally, I find the bot servers  ( players only vs bots only) more enjoyable - though I'm very decent in PvP - because they're the closest thing to ideal co-op gameplay in a FPS landscape where everyone's out for themselves.
