This game is mediocre at best, definitely not the gaming milestone it's made out to be. Mechanically dumbed down, generic FPS gameplay meets poorly-thought out plotting and condescending political commentary.\nSingle parts of the mechanics or plot in particular can feel especially insulting, depending on your personal disposition.\n\n[u]The Good[/u]\n\nIt's legitimately pretty, mostly thanks to a very strong artstyle.\nGenerally very high production values, including top-tier voice work.\nThe story/plotlines start out very strong and interesting.\nThe exploration part of the gameplay is legitimately fun and feels like a well-designed first person adventure of sorts.\n\n[u]The Bad:[/u]\n\nThe whole shooting gameplay in general is just not fun. Gunplay is generally underwhelming, with many of the guns feeling samey, especially after you unlock a second line of guns from another faction that basically just iterates with slight variances on guns you already have. You *can* upgrade guns by spending money at specific upgrade machines, but the upgrades only add generic +damage/rate of fire/ammo percentages. \nSince you can only carry 2 guns at a a time and there are distinct sections of the game where using specific guns lends definitive advantages, you'd either have to know in advance which guns to carry into which battle and upgrade accordingly, or upgrade either no guns at all or all guns in a balanced fashion to keep them all viable in case you need to swap. The whole system is just poorly-thought out in general.\nEnemies have little to no variety and at times remarkably poor AI, and large scale battles devolve into frantic, chaotic messes with no strategic approach to speak of. \nEven coming from a series known for generally underwhelming gunplay (BS2 being the exception), this game is easily the worst in the series in terms of combat and shooting mechanics.\nVigors (Plasmids) all feel very samey (no distinction between attack, control and support plasmids like in BS1 and 2, instead each vigor fulfills all these functions simultaneously to varying degrees) and only really vary in visual representation, with Undertow being the only notable exception. You can also upgrade vigors by paying money at specific upgrade stations, but that cuts into your funds for upgrading guns. There are no unique upgrade mechanics for either. (Personal pet peeve: I also think that a lot of the visual changes on the player avatar's hands when using certain vigors venture too far into body horror territory and are just too gross, resulting in a thematic disconnect between narrative and onscreen action.)\nTerrible \"inventory\"/gear system. You can't carry med-packs or \"Salts\" (this setting's version of EVE) with you any more to peruse as necessary, only refill your current health/salts from stationary deposits. You get a rechargeable shield to \"make up\" for it, but it just generally results in more messiness during actual combat.\nNo stealth at all.\nNo Big Daddies; the \"Handymen\" of this setting are supposedly designed as a substitute, but they don't fulfill that role adequately, neither thematically nor mechanically.\nAs a long-time \"Shock\" fan (starting out with the System Shock series), the oversimplification of game mechanics to the point of dumbing it down to a generic dudebro fps (aka \"streamlining\" as it's known in the industry) is just... disappointing.\n\n[u]The Ugly (contains spoilers):[/u]\n\nRemember what I said about the plotlines starting out very strong and interesting?\nYeah, about the only plotline here coming to any sort of closure is the one about the relationship between Elizabeth and Songbird.\nThe main plot just fizzles out into a disappointing mess. (Booker is/becomes Comstock, because of differing timelines and ONE singular defining event in his life, because apparently that's how people and psychology work. Also, Elizabeth *basically* becomes a Timelord, because Quantum Mechanics.)\nThere is also an obvious thematic disconnect between portraying Booker's violent past (with him rather obviously having suffered from PTSD, survivor's guilt, depression and generally self-destructive behaviour before the events of the game) as having a detrimental effect on him,so much so that he has obvious violent tendencies (with you being given the choice of indulging in these tendencies at certain points of the game) in everyday interactions and even small-scale interpersonal conflict (comparable to Joel from \"The Last of Us\") and is generally what we would call \"not a nice person\", with a clear indication that this is NOT a good thing. Yet here the game is, absolutely reveling in its own cartoonishly grotesque depiction of graphic violence. A more toned-down, realistic approach might have worked wonders here. (cf. my point about the Vigors and body horror.)\n\nAnd the resolution to the sideplot about Fitzroy and the Vox Populi is intellectually insulting at best and rage-inducing at worst. \nThe game is just straight up saying that the downtrodden, oppressed masses of workers consisting solely of People of Color and the Irish, who rise up against their rich, white, racist, industrialist oppressors in a necessarily violent revolt are just total extreme extremists and therefore JUST AS BAD if not even WORSE than the racist people keeping them oppressed.\nAfter a specific point in the story that completely derails the character of one of your allies, the revolutionary faction (called the Vox Populi) just become generic, evil, mass-murdering mooks and your second set of standard enemies. \nWhat the FUCK, Ken Levine? How about you take your uninformed, patronizing \"Extremism is bad, m'kay?\" moderatism and shove it up your fucking arse, you pretentious fuckwad?\n\nOh, and before I forget it: THE \"EPIC END FIGHT\" IS A FIRST PERSON TOWER DEFENSE MISSION.

Der dritte Teil geschaffen aus der Feder vom Entwicklerteam Irrational Games, die für ihre innovativen Genre-Mixes berühmt sind, haben einen perfekten Ritt vollgepackt mit explosiven Szenen, abwechslungsreichen Shootouts und einer interessanten \"Was-wäre-wenn\"-Story, in einer der mit Abstand coolsten Spielewelten überhaupt, erschaffen.\n\nAnders als der erste Bioshock-Teil ist Infinite ein recht moderner Shooter mit linearer Erzählstruktur. Der Spieler wird an einem roten Faden durch die Story - gefüllt mit gut getimten Plottwists - geführt und immer wieder in intensive Kämpfe verwickelt. Zurück sind die Plasmiden, die jedem Feuergefecht die nötige Würze verleihen und einmal mehr kreative Möglichkeiten geben, sich der Feinde zu entledigen. \n\nAuch geheime Räume, Audiographen und Verbesserungen gibt es jede Menge zu finden. Super auch, dass man die Hintergrundinfos einfach nebenbei als Hörbuch laufen lassen kann, anstatt dass das Spiel unterbrochen wird. So verliert Infinite über die gesamte Dauer nie an Fahrt!\n\nWas Bioshock: Infinite jedoch so besonders macht, ist das World Building und die beiden Hauptcharaktere. Ähnlich wie beim ersten Teil findet man sich zügig in einem Utopia wieder - diesmal eine schwebende Stadt - die eine grässliche Grimasse hinter der Fassade versteckt. Anders als bei Teil 1 fällt die Maske jedoch erst im Spielverlauf. Während Repture bereits zerstört ist und man im Nachhinein erfährt, was geschah, entwickelt sich hier der Zerfall vor den Augen des Spielers. \n\nÜberragend gelungen ist Elizabeth, die zweite Hauptfigur. Sie ist eine mehr oder minder stetige Begleiterin des Spielers, die niemals im Weg steht und bei Gelegenheit Booker mit Items oder Münzen versorgt. Mehr als das, jedoch, überzeugt die Art, wie sie die Welt reflektiert. Selten - wenn überhaupt - hat es ein Spiel geschafft, einen Charakter so menschlich wirken zu lassen. Besonders gelungen sind die Züge ihres Gesichts, denen man jede Emotion ablesen kann. Man kann sich nicht dagegen wehren, mit Elizabeth mitzufühlen. Sie sorgt für eine irre Immersion in die Story und die Welt. Sensationell gut gelungen!\n\nWas gibt es negatives über dieses Spiel zu sagen? Es ist ein bisschen Schade, dass man immer nur zwei Waffen bei sich tragen darf. \n\nAnsonsten ist Bioshock: Infinite ein absolutes Meisterstück der Spielegeschichte, welches eine tiefgründige Story mit exzellentem Gameplay und nahezu perfektem Pacing verbindet. Ein unvergesslicher Trip, den man definitiv mehr als einmal unternehmen wird. \n\nEbenfalls zu empfehlen ist auch ausnahmsweisemal der Season Pass mit seinen beiden Episoden Burial at Sea - 1&2, die die Story zurück nach Rapture bringen. \n\nNeben Half-Life 2 möglicherweise mein favorisierter Ego-Shooter...zumindest unter denen, die eine Story erzählen","timestamp_created":1499095788,"timestamp_updated":1499095788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.656464695930480957","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33188452","author":{"steamid":"76561198260597246","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":445,"last_played":1499094121},"language":"schinese","review":"非常非常美的画风，简直哪里都可以截图当壁纸\n就是结局有点烧脑（可能是我只玩了这一部的缘故吧）","timestamp_created":1499095497,"timestamp_updated":1499095497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33188105","author":{"steamid":"76561198209704816","num_games_owned":227,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":421,"last_played":1502972259},"language":"english","review":"Good story","timestamp_created":1499094990,"timestamp_updated":1499094990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570498943328857422","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33187944","author":{"steamid":"76561198370955039","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":913,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46,"last_played":1550136154},"language":"koreana","review":"fdf","timestamp_created":1499094771,"timestamp_updated":1499094771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33187450","author":{"steamid":"76561198054858920","num_games_owned":629,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":7398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7398,"last_played":1488999539},"language":"english","review":"Great story...

The story had me hooked. I needed to know what was going to happen, how was this story going to continue. What obsticles will come my way? What will have to be done to overcome them?\n\nAs someone who likes to explore and opening almost every box i can, upgrading and seeing what works best, Bioshock Infinite made me thirsy for the story. The combat within the game was entertaining albeit repetative. Messing around with the powers and seeing what i enjoyed the most/ what combo's could clear squads of enemies was probably the most fun. The combat was not the highlight of this game. Not at all. The story, how it drags you into it. How quickly you start to care for the characters you meet and learn their stories through the recordings you find throughout the game. You'll have yourself half sprinting through the motions to find out what happens next but stopping yourself to look around at the gorgeous game that you are in.\n\nTL;DR: This game is beautiful, atmospheric and will have you strapped into the game for the story. The combat can be repetative but not drawn out too much in my opinion.\n\n10/10 Loved it.","timestamp_created":1499076481,"timestamp_updated":1499076481,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528795838356018066","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33176683","author":{"steamid":"76561198150917802","num_games_owned":287,"num_reviews":93,"playtime_forever":401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":330,"last_played":1514952922},"language":"koreana","review":"지금이랑 비교해도 안꿀리는 몇 안돼는 게임","timestamp_created":1499076452,"timestamp_updated":1499076452,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33176517","author":{"steamid":"76561198001380154","num_games_owned":516,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":17429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13418,"last_played":1610889304},"language":"german","review":"Best story i ever played.

It is probably the worst Bioshock gameplay wise, however it is still infinitely more fun than many other typical first-person shooters (cod, battlefield, etc.). The lack of a weapon wheel is one of the most disapointing things for me, without a weapon wheel like we had in the first 2 games, you're limited to whatever 2 guns you currently have on you and whatever guns just happen to be laying around. But the sky-hooks helped Ininite's gameplay to have something new and unique that neither of the past BioShocks had. The story of this BioShock seemed to be the main focus, it was just amazing.

I knew absolutley nothing about the bioshock series, so this is one of those games that I just jumped into and hoped for the best. To my fortune, it was more than good, it was great. I thought the campaign would be longer, considering that people have 14-25 hours of gameplay. Since there was alot to see in bioshock infinite, I took my time to look at everything and made sure I never missed a spot, but I still ended up with only 10.3 hours.
