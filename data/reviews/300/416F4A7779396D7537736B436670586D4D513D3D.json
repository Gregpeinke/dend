There are classes, two gamemodes, achievements, and maps!\n\nChoose to be a rifleman, assault class, support class, sniper, machine gunner, or rocketeer. Riflemen are capable of using their semi-automatic M1 Garand (U.S. Soldier RIfle) to take down enemies from long distances and with two hits while the german variant has a bolt action one that does more damage. Assaults can smoke enemy positions and charge in there to destroy the enemy team. The support class is for covering fire and is pretty versatile. Has a medium damage and ranged weapon with two frag grenades/potato grenades. Snipers are self-explanatory. They have a sniper rifle for shooting people at long distances. Machine gunners are more of a defensive class. They can place a machine gun while prone or on a sandbag and mow down an entire team although they're vulnerable. Rocketeers are for picking off key targets most likely machine gunners and snipers and have rocket launchers. They also come with sidearms. The U.S. Army rocketeer has a quick firing M1 Carbine while the German rocketeer has a close quarters C96 machine pistol. \n\nThere are two gamemodes for you to play. You have territorial control and detonation. Territorial control is a gamemode where you capture flags around the area. There are usually 5 flags with each team holding 2 and one middle flag uncapped. This is the typical, main gamemode in Day of Defeat: Source. Detonation involves detonating explosives at an opposing checkpoint and sometimes uses an offense vs. defense setup.\n\nIt's not the easy game to just pick up and be good at, but it's a fun game.","timestamp_created":1419470117,"timestamp_updated":1419470189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13578519","author":{"steamid":"76561198076147530","num_games_owned":537,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":34670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9877,"last_played":1655068297},"language":"english","review":"'' Day of Defeat: Source features multiplayer, team-based gameplay set in the WWII European theatre of operations.

Rook was shadowing him, double checking each spot that Johannson had checked before.  I was in the middle with Peters, helping him carry the M2 Browning.  And Stewart was in the rear, covering our backs with his Thompson at the ready.\n\nIt was quiet.  Too quiet.\n\nThe bridge we had set out to capture was undefended, and we quickly set up a defensive position in case a German patrol stumbled upon us.\n\nThe sound started as a low rumble.  We looked around, at each other, confused as to why the ground was shaking.  It got louder, and we could soon hear the sound of people yelling.  We readied our weapons, getting ready for the enemy to throw a grenade or fire a Panzerschreck.\n\nBut nothing could prepare us for what happened next.\n\nA giant tide of German soldiers, all carrying trench shovels and primed Steilhandgranates in their hands, came around the corner, rushing at us screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\nWe opened fire, but there were too many and we were quickly overrun.\n\nStewart was the first to go, having gotten overzealous with his Thompson.  He had managed to push the wave of Germans back, when they surrounded him and began pummeling him to death with their shovels.  \n\nOne of them, holding a grenade, charged Rook and Johannson from behind.  They never saw it coming.\n\nBy now, it was only me and Peters, him firing his MG wildly at the advancing tide while I threw frag grenade after frag grenade.  And then Peters started to run out of ammo.\n\nQuickly, I rushed up to his position with a new box of ammunition, but by that time they were almost upon him.  Peters quickly pulled out his M1911 and managed to squeeze off a few shots, but it wasn't long before he too was buried under the mass of grey and black.\n\nI was cornered, back against a locked door while I blasted soldier after soldier back with my Sniper rifle.  But it was no use.  They descended upon me, swinging shovels indiscriminately at my already bruised and battered body.  They were relentless, beating me until at last, I succumbed to the darkness.\n\nAs my vision blurred, they stopped screaming long enough for one of them to say something to me.\n\nSomething that would shock me to the core.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"lol noob get rushed fggt\"","timestamp_created":1418712092,"timestamp_updated":1429297475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":341,"votes_funny":1056,"weighted_vote_score":"0.866146743297576904","comment_count":28,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13398089","author":{"steamid":"76561198083699155","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":77,"last_played":1527774902},"language":"english","review":"Entertainment and history in one package.

After all, the game is almost a decade old now. However, I was still able to find several populated servers at all hours of the day or night.  Old age hasn’t killed DOD:S.\n\nIf anything age has worked in DOD:S’s favor. For example, it attracts an older and more mature crowd. I haven’t had to put up with as much drama or slurs from annoying prepubescent teammates as I do in more modern multiplayer shooters. \n\nAnother example of age helping the DOD:S experience is how “old school” it feels. Despite the WW2 setting, DOD:S plays more like an arena shooter from the 1990s than today’s super serious military shooters. Forget aiming down iron sights. Secondary fire for most weapons throws solid punch instead. Expect to spend a lot of time zipping about, shooting dudes with crosshairs, punching them for good measure, and laughing at the exaggerated ragdoll physics. \n\nDay of Defeat: Source is not a masterpiece but it’s worth a look if you have a hankering for a shooter that isn’t too serious.\n","timestamp_created":1417065398,"timestamp_updated":1417065398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":153,"votes_funny":11,"weighted_vote_score":"0.897491574287414551","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13100014","author":{"steamid":"76561198011171532","num_games_owned":555,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1469253698},"language":"english","review":"A true Valve classic.
