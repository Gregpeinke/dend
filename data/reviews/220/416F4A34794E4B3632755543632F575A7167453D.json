I started back in 2013-14 or so, played about half of it, then took a break. Which lasted about five years. I picked it up a few days ago, this time CERTAIN I was going to finish it. But I just can't do it.\n\nThis game is just not fun, interesting or challenging. Most of the praise people seem to aim at it I just can't see. The story, which is usually brought up first, is your average invasion story with aliens instead of the Chinese, Russians, North-Koreans or whoever else. The characters are dull and lifeless, none more so than Dr. Freeman, who inexplicably also happens to be an expert in firearms, explosives and military tactics, with an endless physical endurance.\n\nNormally, I'd consider these positives. In games like Doom or Quake. But people don't hype up Doom or Quake for their story or for it's realism and releatable characters, the same way they do Half-Life 2. Which is why I want to snark about it. If Freeman was made out to be a superhuman from the beginning, then all of this would be fine. But he's made out to be a normal human, thrown in the middle of a chaotic situation, and it all just comes off idiotic.\n\nI don't care about the graphics as such, but the art direction is awful. It's literally nothing but concrete grey and mud brown all the way through. Broken down cities, cluttered streets, war torn apartment buildings... it's dull. Dull dullness all the way through. A few interesting locations through the game, but far too few to save the game from being overall horribly dull.\n\nThe gunplay, which is what you'll be doing most of the time, is horrible. Enemies eat bullets like they were M&M's. The only guns that have any sort of an impact are the revolver and the crossbow; two guns that you don't really get any ammunation to throughout the game. The AI is terrible, the enemies just rush at you and do little besides.\n\n\"But wait\" I hear you say. \"You can't say those things! It came out in 2004, before all the Cowwaduuties and other corridor shooters were out there cluttering the scene. It was the first of it's kind! It was inventive and original when it came out!\"\n\nYes it was. So what? Does knowing this  change the experience when played right now? It does not. It should be respected as a legendary game for all the things it innovated, but that does NOT make it a fun game to play today. It's an incredibly dull game with sub-par gunplay, awful characters, generic story, generic weapons, generic enemies and generic environments. The literal only reasons to play this game today are a) if you're blinded by nostalgia, and b) if you're interested in it for purely it's historic value. But don't believe for a secodn the people who call it one of the best shooters of all time. \n\nMaybe it was back in 2004, but it does not hold up today.","timestamp_created":1536755299,"timestamp_updated":1536755299,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44695955","author":{"steamid":"76561198845211398","num_games_owned":697,"num_reviews":164,"playtime_forever":838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":435,"last_played":1561710850},"language":"english","review":"ᅠᅠᅠ","timestamp_created":1536748450,"timestamp_updated":1536748450,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44694941","author":{"steamid":"76561198341444146","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1042,"last_played":1609761807},"language":"english","review":"<3","timestamp_created":1536742677,"timestamp_updated":1574797033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44694375","author":{"steamid":"76561198183703147","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":11915,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2549,"last_played":1657457102},"language":"brazilian","review":"Vale a pena jogar nota 10","timestamp_created":1536738906,"timestamp_updated":1536738906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44693359","author":{"steamid":"76561198423432293","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":39717,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19041,"last_played":1659360065},"language":"russian","review":"Плюсы \n1)Хорошая и приятнаяя атмосфера   \n2)Захватывающий геймлей\n3)Классная по тому времени графика \n4)Практически отсутсвие багов, лично мне за 10 лет игры в эту игру попалось отсилы 4-6 багов.

I think it's safe to say that the release of Half-Life 1 was a turning point in video games, and 6 years after the release of the classic Half-Life, Valve released Half-Life 2. Half-Life 2 was the next huge step for video games in a lot of ways, and the Source engine is probably one of the most popular engines due to how crazy it was back in the mid 2000's. But how does Half-Life 2 stand as it's own game? Many call it \"The best PC game ever\", and back when it was first released I think I'd be more likely to agree with that, however, now personally I wouldn't agree with this, but Half-Life 2 is still an amazing game that is WELL worth the price. The graphics are still great, even by today's standards. The facial animations are so amazing it's hard to believe the game was realeased in 2004. And the fact that the graphics and animations are this good in-game and that it doesn't even have to be in a cutscene to be that good looking. Variety in weapons and enemies is something that classic FPS games like Half-Life, DOOM, etc. always did really really well and it is absolutely present in Half-Life 2. There are tons and tons of weapons to use against the combine and other enemies. They all have situational advantages so you won't want to just use one or two weapons throughout the entirety of the game. I feel as though I should mention what is probably the best part of the game, and that is Ravenholm. In this chapter, ammo is scarce, and you have to heavily rely on the iconic gravity gun to get you through a town infested with headcrabs and zombies. During your journy through Ravenholm you run into an interesting character known as Father Grigori who I wont spoil anything about. There are many other interesting characters in the game as well. Alyx and Eli Vance along with Barney and Doctor Kleiner, Judith and Breen are all really good characters that fit very well with Gordon in this very well made world. The G-man is as mysterious as always and since there seems to be no sight of Half-Life 3 in the future, I doubt we will ever figure out his motives or background. Something that did bother me about Half-Life 2 was how Vavle decided to split it up into 3 different \"episodes\", it more so just made everything more complex than it needed to be. Half-Life 2, the first \"episode\" in the Half-Life 2 trilogy is the longest, as it takes about 16 - 18 hours to complete. Overall a fantastic game, well worth the price, especially during a sale. You can get all the Half-Life games for like 7 dollars or something like that which is an insanely amazing price.","timestamp_created":1536559406,"timestamp_updated":1536559406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44663224","author":{"steamid":"76561198416162487","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2179,"last_played":1545380127},"language":"english","review":"cool its amazing","timestamp_created":1536555427,"timestamp_updated":1536555427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44661385","author":{"steamid":"76561198392555378","num_games_owned":582,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":92,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1561793981},"language":"turkish","review":"şimdi bu oyunu incelemek beni çok mutlu ediyor çünkü bu oyun tam bir efsane oyunu kesinlikle almanızı tavsiye ediyorum vuruş hissiyatı süper grafiklerde zamanına göre iyi hikaye muhteşem fps seviyorsanız bu oyun tam size göre eğlenceli fizik moturu çok iyi oyun biraz zor.oyundaki en ünlü silah gravity gun. maaalesef bu oyunda levye o kadar öne çıkmıyor hatta levyesiz olduğumuz kısımlarda var ancak gravty gun ile bulmacar çözmek sonra zor bir bölümü geçmek çok güzel.Maalesef oyu multiplayer oynanamıyo ama genede çok  iyi bir oyun. ayrıca hikayesi yarım mmalesef episode 1 ve episode 2 yi almanız gerekiyor ancak hikaye gene bitmiyor ve yarım kalıyor ama gende oyun kesinlikle tavsiye ediyorum.","timestamp_created":1536541327,"timestamp_updated":1536541327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44660835","author":{"steamid":"76561198053743372","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2144,"last_played":1643325275},"language":"english","review":"Levels like old friends.","timestamp_created":1536537807,"timestamp_updated":1536537807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480225980281829834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44658389","author":{"steamid":"76561197978138673","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":759,"last_played":1454558448},"language":"polish","review":".","timestamp_created":1536524635,"timestamp_updated":1536524635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44658381","author":{"steamid":"76561198191335131","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":5959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5582,"last_played":1651277926},"language":"english","review":"Get this game before gmod","timestamp_created":1536524593,"timestamp_updated":1592300306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44658156","author":{"steamid":"76561198169258022","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1532423009},"language":"hungarian","review":"Örök klasszikus az összes rész.
