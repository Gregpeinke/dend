zaczynając, Blue Shift jest bez wątpienia najmniej imponującą częścią z trylogii HL1, co nie zmienia faktu, że bawiłem się naprawdę dobrze jednak ponarzekać swoje muszę.\nPierwsze co mnie uderzyło to training room który jest po prostu reskinem  z oryginału, no może jednak Opposing Force nastawiło moje oczekiwania za wysoko ale to szczegół. Dalej absolutnie nie wybaczę tego ile gra po prostu rzuca przeciwników 2 metry przed gracza. Podchodzenie do walk strategicznie to kluczowy element HL a tu notorycznie kosmici się teleportują zaraz przed gracza powodując szybką śmierć, od początku do końca gry. Dalej minusem jest to, że gra kosztuje prawie tyle co oryginał a przejście zajęło mi ledwie 3 godziny.  Mogę jeszcze uszczypliwie dodać fakt, że NPCety czasem udają, że nasza postać z nimi rozmawia ale to nie jest ani trochę tak drażliwe jak reszta. Jednak nie polecałbym gdyby był to faktycznie niezły produkt, bo historia opowiedziana z pov zwykłego  szarego ochroniarza który chce po prostu przeżyć to zawsze plus i udało się to ładnie opowiedzieć bez idealizowania pana Calhouna. Poza tym gra daje \nmocniejszy niż OF nacisk na zagadki i ma raczej spokojniejsze bardziej relaksujące tempo. Oprócz tego interakcje z doktorkiem Rosenbergiem jakiego mamy okazję poznać to naprawdę przyjemna rzecz. Pomimo krótkiego czasu rozgrywki gra opowiada co chciała i kończy kiedy uzna to za konieczne bez zbędnego przedłużania.
