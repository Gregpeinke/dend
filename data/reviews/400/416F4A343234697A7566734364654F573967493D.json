was a great setup for what Portal 2 would become. \nThe Story revolves around Chell and her journey through the Aperture Science Laboratories, being tested by the robot known as GLaDOS and her efforts to try and escape her 'tests'. The only character there is in this game is GLaDOS as Chell is a silent protagonist. GLaDOS as a character is ok in this game but definitely improves in the sequel. The story isn't really the main focus here as it only serves the purpose as to move the player along the levels. \nThe Setting of the Aperture Science Labs its well designed for what type of scenario this is set in.\nGraphically, due to the art direction being so simplistic, it doesn't need high settings for it to look good and has also made it look pretty modern for how old the game is. \nSound and Audio work very well as sounds from the moving levels to the portal gun are well fitting. \nIn terms of gameplay, this is where Portal really shines. The main thing you will be doing is solving puzzles which i must say are challenging enough for everyone to enjoy and are very satisfying when they have been completed. All puzzles need the use of the portal gun which has become a staple for the games for good reasons as the developers really revolved how levels would play out using the gun. I think the portal gun is just amazing for all the different things you can do while using it. There are also cubes, laser platforms and jump pads that are also used to aid the player to complete levels and even they are revolved around using the portal gun. The enemies in this game (turrets) are fine but only prove to be an obstacle rather than an actual enemy. Finally the boss fight was decent but at the same time felt a little simplistic. \nOverall, Portal is a great game that introduced a new way for player to interact with puzzle games and i would recommend to those who are hardcore fans of the second game or to those who want to sink their feet into Aperture Labs and get a feel for what Portal really holds.","timestamp_created":1629905290,"timestamp_updated":1629905290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98213469","author":{"steamid":"76561198352756946","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":607,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":393,"last_played":1638442414},"language":"english","review":"It's Portal.

This gun allows you to create doors comunicated. The entrance is blue, and the way out orange. Just 2. With this \"simple\" mechanic you will be solving different puzzles which for a game which came out in late 2007, still feel very fresh and provides entertainment. \nIn addition, there's a very interesting story plot which gets deeper in Portal 2.\n[i] One of the classics you absolutely need in your PC!

It stands up as well today, and sharing it with my kids has been a thrill.","timestamp_created":1629738003,"timestamp_updated":1629738003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98099864","author":{"steamid":"76561198288256855","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1640989654},"language":"english","review":"its a good classic game tbh its up with the greats\n\nbut just saying dont trust the cake-","timestamp_created":1629733571,"timestamp_updated":1629733571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98095986","author":{"steamid":"76561198871867711","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":95,"last_played":1646677459},"language":"russian","review":"Прошел игру за 90 минут.\nАхуенная жаль 3 части нет,\nиз минусов слишком кароткая(","timestamp_created":1629728743,"timestamp_updated":1629728743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482954531908035278","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98093780","author":{"steamid":"76561198981038520","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1657010642},"language":"english","review":"confusing but allot of fun","timestamp_created":1629725912,"timestamp_updated":1629725912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98093320","author":{"steamid":"76561199099359949","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":479,"last_played":1629743717},"language":"english","review":"i keep getting headaches please help","timestamp_created":1629725328,"timestamp_updated":1629725328,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98093009","author":{"steamid":"76561199006892155","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":21,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1629724556},"language":"turkish","review":".","timestamp_created":1629724932,"timestamp_updated":1658175282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98092831","author":{"steamid":"76561198355275126","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1617860093},"language":"brazilian","review":"vale muito o preço pago em promoções junto com o 2 (ainda não joguei) e te digo, é uma experiência diferentemente e muito divertida que te deixa entretido e envolvido com os puzzles e dialogos com a GLADUS do INICIO AO FIM, é impossivel não ficar impressionado com este jogo e com a diversão que ele proporciona por meio de monologos longos da GLADUS, é simplesmente genial!\nCompre! jogue! é uma obra de arte da historia dos jogos que não deve ser esquecida!","timestamp_created":1629724692,"timestamp_updated":1629724692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98088501","author":{"steamid":"76561199075930698","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":44,"playtime_at_review":440,"last_played":1659908203},"language":"german","review":"ewfsdafdsfsdf","timestamp_created":1629718595,"timestamp_updated":1629718595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ424izufsCdeOW9gI="}
