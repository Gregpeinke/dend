Thrown into a world overrun by monsters, Killing Floor becomes a brutal fight for survival. The dynamic array of guns, maps, and characters provides for hours of replayability and countless hours of fun. Killing Floor is still worth playing and if you ever catch it on sale buy the giant bundle with everything. Killing Floor holds a very special place in my heart and provided countless hours of fun for my friends and I. With the full release of Killing Floor 2 earlier this month, I hold out hope for the second game becoming a worthy successor. 9/10 game.

After some shady government experiments with cloning technology went awry, the CEO of the company behind the experiments, Horzine Industries, went berserk, letting his experiments loose on the world as some form of revenge. That's about as far as the game's story goes, though. It's basically just \"There's zombies here, kill 'em\".\n\nThe setup of the game is simple: Specimens (or zeds, if you prefer) attack in waves. Once all the zeds in a wave have been killed, you get a short, one-minute break in which the trader will open her store, where you can spend the money you earn from killing zeds to buy better guns as well as useful equipment like body armor and grenades. It goes beyond just buying bigger guns, though. Killing Floor offers you a selection of seven different classes to choose from, each with their own specific roles and abilities. If you choose the commando, you'll have access to a variety of assault rifles which are excellent for wiping out groups of lesser specimens, but you won't have access to heavy weapons like explosives which are good for denting larger, more threatening specimens. All the different classes complement each other well and even though the community may say otherwise, none of the classes feel flat out better than the others; each has their pros and cons.\n\nIn addition to the base classes' abilities, fulfilling certain requirements will increase a particular class's level, improving the bonuses you receive as well as giving you discounts for that class's weapons (as long as you're playing as that class, of course). Leveling your classes is important as well because Killing Floor offers five different difficulty levels. A level 2 support specialist is basically dead meat on the highest difficulty, but raising your support specialist's level to 6, the maximum, will vastly improve your chances of survival.\n\nThis does, however, create a small problem, which is if you level all your classes to the max, you'll find lower difficulty servers to be boringly easy because you're so powerful compared to your enemies, essentially preventing you from playing on those servers unles you want a very boring experience. It also is a bit of a problem since a player with multiple classes maxed out has an advantage over another player who, for instance, has only maxed out one class, just by virtue of being able to fill multiple roles throughout a match. This isn't a game breaking issue, but something I figured was worth mentioning.\n\nMore importantly, though; how does the game play? To put it simply: Fantastically. The different classes' abilities all complement each other very well. Nobody really feels like a one-man-army (unless they're insanely good); everyone has to depend on each other for survival. The guns feel absolutely brilliant, with great sound and visual effects. Despite there being only 10 distinct enemy types, they all add their own flavor of challenge to the game. Crawlers nip at your heels and attack in swarms, gorefasts charge you with reckless abandon, and the towering fleshpound will live up to his namesake. Everybody's role is important, and you almost never feel like dead weight (unless you're a low level joining a high difficulty server *wink wink*).\n\nI should also talk about the in-game dialogue. This game is well aware of the fact that it takes place in the U.K. and announces it loud and proud. Through voice commands, you'll get to hear plenty of clever quips and unforgettable one-liners. Hearing another player shout, \"You're all fur coat, no knickers, bitches!\", is something that never gets old. While the characters themselves don't have distinct personalities, there are quite a few to choose from, especially if you drop a few bucks for some of the skin packs. Who knew a business man wearing a gas mask, a cop in a chicken suit, and a covert operative with an advanced suit of armor would make such a good group?\n\nAll in all, what Killing Floor lacks in other departments, it more than makes up for with its simplistic yet addictive gameplay. Killing Floor has received numerous free content updates since its initial launch back in 2009, and is still going strong even 5 years later. Would I recommend this game? Absolutely.","timestamp_created":1404353832,"timestamp_updated":1404353832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528086006641387939","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11041767","author":{"steamid":"76561198086052049","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":610,"last_played":1408401130},"language":"english","review":"very very entertaining! cant get enough.","timestamp_created":1404353531,"timestamp_updated":1404353531,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11040826","author":{"steamid":"76561198011274436","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":53671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37469,"last_played":1479603988},"language":"english","review":"I love eit","timestamp_created":1404348799,"timestamp_updated":1404348799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11040405","author":{"steamid":"76561197992764766","num_games_owned":374,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":490,"last_played":1388341322},"language":"english","review":"fun co-op game","timestamp_created":1404346539,"timestamp_updated":1404346539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11040119","author":{"steamid":"76561198045837827","num_games_owned":404,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":4726,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3238,"last_played":1558810489},"language":"english","review":"I know Killing Floor 2 is comming, but honestly, this game is pretty darn good, is catchy, is an addiction, you can just join a game alone with random dudes or your friends and have a great fun time!.

The leveling up of particular classes requires time and plenty of kills but once achieved, the rewards are great.  Discounted weapons to be able to buy them at earlier waves; more damage for when you want to up the difficulty (biiig difference when this happens); and different benefits depending on the class.\nIt is a particularly fun co-op game (almost impossible on single player at harder difficulties, some achievement if you do complete it) because you need to work as a team to take down the hoards of enemies heading towards your group of survivors.  Welding doors to make a kill corridor or just to buy you some time adds to the suspense in the game and is a great feature.  \nAll in all, this game makes for a brilliant, fun, 'just kill em all' game.  The only thing I could criticise (and this is actually just a funny point) would be the trader...  When she moves to a different location, you can still see her standing in the old trade shop and she likes to run so far away that you struggle to buy anything in time unless you head there before the end of the wave...

Почему некоторые считают эту игру копией Left 4 Dead, а другие чуть ли не \"некст геном\". Ладно, хватит философствовать, надо клепать обзор. \n\nПлюсов в этой игре больше, чем минусов, а следовательно - пациент скорее жив, чем мёртв. Взять хотя бы вроде бы банальный геймплей, который сводится к: убил всех монстров -> пошёл к торговцу -> купил оружие, и дальше всё идёт как в песне \"The Loop Closes\" группы How to Destroy Angels:\n\"[b]The beginning is the end\nAnd it keeps coming round again[/b]\"\nКороче говоря, повторяется заново. Однако, через некоторое количество таких волн(4, 7 или 10), игрокам предстоит сразиться с главным боссом - Патриархом, в миру известный как Кевин Кламели, глава корпорации \"Горизонт\". Но геймплей действительно становится скучным и унылым, если играть в одиночной игре. Но стоит сыграть с Вашими друзьями, обладающими Killing Floor...  Вот тогда-то и начнётся веселье! Впрочем, Killing Floor и является кооперативным шутером. Также стоит отметить и разнообразие оружия в этой игре, так сказать от топора до убойнейшего AA12 или от мачете до ракетомёта. Некоторые, правда, можно разблокировать [u]только получив достижение в другой игре[/u], взять хотя бы топор из игры Dwarfs. Нужно упомянуть ещё и так называемые \"перки\", позволяющие немного облегчить игру геймеру. Например, если \"прокачать\" перк Техника хотя бы до третьего уровня, то стоимость дробовика AA12 снизится с 4000 фунтов стерлингов до 2399. Ах да, дело происходит в Великобритании.\nЧто? Графика? Графика как графика, ничего выдающегося. Однако приятным фактом для меня стало то, что Killing Floor на моём далеко не мощном компьютере эта игра идёт на максимальных параметрах, при этом не лагая. Весьма странный сюрприз.\n\nНо серьёзным минусом можно считать DLC, стоимость которых иногда достигает полноценной игры, за которые нам дадут...  Набор из нескольких новых оружий или одного нового персонажа. Минус становится ещё больше и страшнее, если сказать, что этих DLC много. Слишком много. DLC, DLC, DLC, блин!!!\n\nВердикт: годный кооперативный шутер, дающий нам хорошую альтернативу Left 4 Dead. \nОценка: 8,6 из 10","timestamp_created":1404161457,"timestamp_updated":1404286390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596877694129943848","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10984189","author":{"steamid":"76561198032491332","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1028,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":557,"last_played":1442020754},"language":"english","review":"loadsamoney","timestamp_created":1404159544,"timestamp_updated":1404159544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519841313362121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10983209","author":{"steamid":"76561198036672546","num_games_owned":310,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1380819056},"language":"english","review":"naked people with drill hands attack you, what more do you want","timestamp_created":1404157060,"timestamp_updated":1404157060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539978086948394775","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10983160","author":{"steamid":"76561198072623953","num_games_owned":524,"num_reviews":169,"playtime_forever":4419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2456,"last_played":1527683244},"language":"russian","review":"8 из 10\n\n","timestamp_created":1404156943,"timestamp_updated":1404156943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10982759","author":{"steamid":"76561198042280680","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3528,"last_played":1428907304},"language":"english","review":"If you hate Floors so much you want to kill them, you'll like this game.","timestamp_created":1404155938,"timestamp_updated":1404155938,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10981106","author":{"steamid":"76561198060024871","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":6603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5842,"last_played":1617204431},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito bom, é um co-op divertido, a maioria das datas comemorativas ganha algum evento no jogo o que deixa legal de novo se você estiver enjoando, é altamente recomendável você comprar com um amigo para ter uma diversão maior, não é complicado de se jogar e é um jogo legal, comprei por 20$ e entre direto em promoção, vale a pena o dinheiro.","timestamp_created":1404151979,"timestamp_updated":1404151979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10980921","author":{"steamid":"76561198133039250","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":477,"last_played":1411041900},"language":"russian","review":"Прикольная мгра\n","timestamp_created":1404151558,"timestamp_updated":1404151558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw94399sYCeePxKQ=="}
