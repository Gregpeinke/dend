My only criticism is that the ammount of weapons you get is never used to it's full potential, i think i only used the sniper rifle once, and only a handful of rockets, The game barely every puts you in situations where you need to attack from a long distance. Instead most enemies will always try to close distance to you . i also had more soft locks than the OG game, with me getting stuck in the wall between level transitions.

Am anfang macht das ganze noch Spaß man möchte dem Black Mesa Vorfall aus der dritten Perspektive sehen, die level sind interessant und man erlebt wie alles sich entfaltet und was in anderen Bereichen passiert. Die Steuerung und das ganze Gameplay ist zwar Alt aber es geht noch gut von der Hand manchmal ist es einfach gewöhnungsbedürftig aber halb so wild.\n\nIn der Mitte des Spiels merk man leichte Ermüdungs Erscheinungen aber das ist ok soweit da man denkt gleich muss noch was kommen also der Höhepunkt zum Abschluss, leider wird man enttäuscht das Endgame ist voll von Gegnern zwar viel aushalten aber dafür dann auch viel schaden machen zum ausgleich kriegt man aber dann nur wenig Medkits und Aufladungen für seine Rüstung und nicht viel Munition für die entsprechenden Waffen mit denen das alles einfacher gehen würde.\n\nEs ist sehr Frustrierend wenn viele starke Ausserirdische und Blackops Soldaten einem vor die linse geworfen werden und dann das halbe Arsenal wertlos ist da es nicht genug schaden macht. Dann hilft auch nicht die wertlose Schrotflinte für die ich absolut keinen Nutzen gefunden habe.\n\nWas cool ist, ist das man seine Kameraden mitnehmen kann und so in der Theorie, Kampffähige Verbündete hat, oft sterben diese aber schnell und, wie ich gemerkt habe, sind die an engen Stellen nicht hilfreich und schießen in den Rücken weil vor dir ein Gegner ist, das macht es dann auch nicht einfacher. Nachdem ich (wie ich kurz später dann feststellte) kurz vor dem ende war, wo das spiel schon seit 2 Std wenig bis keinen Spaß mehr machte, dann Cheats aktivierte um das ganze endlich zu ende zu bringen, merkte ich es wäre nicht besser geworden. Der Endkampf war dann nicht wirklich gut.\n\n\nZum End Kampf:\n[spoiler] Man hat vor sich ein riesiges Tentakelmonster, man soll die beiden Augen auf Augen höhe mit stionären  Laserwaffen beschießen damit dann die Mitte des Monsters aufgeht um dann dort schaden zu machen, das ganze dann 4 mal und fertig, zwischen durch werden dann die leider immernoch gleichen Gegner gespawnt was das ganze jetzt nicht besser macht.[/spoiler]\n\nDem spiel ist zu gute zu halten das es einige interessante Alien Waffen gibt die man nutzen darf, was aber trotzdem seltsam ist da man im Hauptspiel als Wissenschaftler nicht solch exotische Ausrüstung bekommt, man ist ein Marine der einfach weiß wie das ganze Funktioniert. (?!?!???)\n\nFazit: Lass da lieber die finger von, es fängt zwar gut an aber es wird sehr langweilig und eintönig zur zweiten hälfte.","timestamp_created":1613646891,"timestamp_updated":1613685372,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86943845","author":{"steamid":"76561198145689780","num_games_owned":682,"num_reviews":312,"playtime_forever":414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":414,"last_played":1491774118},"language":"english","review":"A good but very hard and short experience, maybe too short and too hard for most people these days.

This expansion is more combat-oriented while still retaining most of the creative weapons in your arsenal. This allows you to still play Half-Life with a multitude of methods.

The new mechanics like the squad control and displacer teleportation makes the game feel fresh and exciting while not separating it from the original game.

I heard that Opposing Force was the better of the two and I was craving some more Half-Life action so I decided to get it and I have to regrets. Half-Life Opposing Force is a great addition to the Half-Life Universe. Following Corporal Shepard through his experience of the Black Mesa incident was great, new weapons, interesting new enemies and almost non-stop action! \n\nIt is a lot shorter than Half-Life, but I still felt it was a full experience, in fact there were less boring parts and it seemed always on the move. If you do play, make sure to do the training first, its fun and the boot camp Drill Sergeants are just like the ones in Full Metal Jacket. The new enemies are interesting too and can provide a fun challenge. Times where you meet up with your squad add an interesting difference between this game and Half-Life. Although I had a lot of trouble at times with their path finding, most of the time they worked well. If they ever do an update or remake I hope the path-finding is reworked. Also you get to see moments from the original from a different point of view, not to mention more backstory and world building.  \nQuick side note, it even has a multiplayer mode! Surprisingly there were still multiple community servers up and running with interesting multiplayer maps. I even found two servers that had 2 or 3 real players along with a few bots.\n\nI would diffidently recommend playing this game if you want more of that Half-Life action!","timestamp_created":1613540128,"timestamp_updated":1613540128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86850009","author":{"steamid":"76561198369607080","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":314,"last_played":1613536918},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1613533665,"timestamp_updated":1613533665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86835586","author":{"steamid":"76561198364651405","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":4017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2059,"last_played":1640548457},"language":"english","review":"original game quality with a completely different side to the story with a great multiplayer","timestamp_created":1613514542,"timestamp_updated":1613514542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86832756","author":{"steamid":"76561198418774233","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":290,"last_played":1613683189},"language":"english","review":"GREEEN","timestamp_created":1613511152,"timestamp_updated":1613511152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86830835","author":{"steamid":"76561198271919148","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":950,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":832,"last_played":1633099858},"language":"english","review":"A.D.R.I.A.N\nK.I.C.K.S\nA.S.S\n\nEven as someone who normally thinks of DLC's as a pretty shady buissness practice, i cant deny that this is everything you could possibly want from a DLC.

It's more comparable to a full game than a quick jaunt through Black Mesa; it's also a bit of a ball buster. They knew what they where doing and the pacing of health and power pickups and ammo replenishment is carefully planned to keep you on edge and fully clenched. Seriously that ending third is a straight ammo dump, fun and never really frustrating, but come on guys.\n\nA bunch of surprising mechanics are introduced in this expansion like rope swinging which is insane to see implemented in 1999 and even though it's pretty jank it's cool to see. Add the hook shot like barnacle to the mix and you've got some of the earliest implementations of these mechanics in an FPS I can personally think of; props to Gearbox on that. The AI in this game specifically medics and engineers are used about twice and there not good but it doesn't bring down the experience. Other than those standouts the game is Half-Life and a fun time all around.\n\nI was surprised at both the competence of this games set pieces and at the overall difficulty and aside from a few lulls, one of which being the final boss, and a couple of bugs this game is an absolute blast.
