Team up with up to 5 other players to fight off waves of [strike]zombies[/strike] mutants. Not necessarily groundbreaking, but somehow the concept has been represented in a unique and entertaining way.  If you like cooperative FPS games, this should be a definite pick-up for you.\n\nThere are various types of mutants. Some are essentially “trash mobs,” but play a role in getting in the way. Then there are mid-tier and high-tier \"specials\" that all have unique attacks. These spawn less frequently, but can wind up overwhelming you if you don’t take them down quickly. And if you make it through all the waves in a match, there is a boss fight. If you play on the highest difficulty and with a full team, then these boss fights are easily among the most exciting and adrenaline-pumping boss fights in all of gaming.\n\nThere are 7 classes to play as.  You can play as all classes on your account, but only one at a time; and you will permanently level-up each class by playing.  Having higher levels is a must if you want to take on the higher difficulties.  On those high difficulties the true brilliance of the gameplay really shines. You’ll have to play smart and as a team if you want a chance to beat the maps on [i]Hell on Earth[/i]. It can be incredibly challenging, and you may go a while without winning a single match. But when you finally do, it can be incredibly satisfying.   \n\nHaving said that, it should be noted that the game also scales with the size of your team, and you can play solo which lowers the amount of enemies per wave and lowers their stats. Because of this, playing solo is actually easier for some, although if you make a single mistake it is game over because there is no one to pick up the slack. I personally feel the game is way more fun with full teams (and thus full enemy spawns with max stats).\n\nAlso, there is [i]a lot[/i] of DLC, but don't let that turn you off.  I have not bought a single DLC for this game, and have over 300 hours of fun and have nearly every achievement (except for two that I’m not worthy of).  That said, a couple of the DLCs are worth getting as they grant you access to some great weapons that are very effective and fun to use. And anyone who owns any DLC can drop the unlocked weapons in game for someone else to pick up for that match.\n\nSo if you like games like [i]Left 4 Dead[/i] or [i]Payday[/i], this is very much in the same vein. However, it also has a great unique identity.

I suppose it may look dated but I've never considered myself a graphics snob so it doesn't bother me.\n- The sound effects are fine for the most part, the soundtrack is hit-or-miss based on what genres of music you like, I turned it off completely so I can hear what's happening around me because I prefer situational awareness to heavy metal.\n\nWhere the game shines is the gameplay.\nThat is if you're willing to invest some serious time in it as the learning curve is one of the most intricate ones I've seen. This is interesting considering the simplicity of the premise - there are two gamemodes (one of which only has 3 official maps and frankly I've always seen it as a mere gimmick), in the standard one the players fight 4, 7 or 10 waves of zombies (9 types with different strengths and weaknesses, some of which complement one another dangerously well) plus the same boss every time and that's it. That really sounds like it should get old quickly, yet somehow it doesn't - there's always new stuff to learn, skills to improve, weapon loadouts to try... I don't think anyone can honestly say \"I know everything there is to know about KF\".\nA large portion of the advanced tricks and tactics I believe are actually a result of quirks in the code that weren't intentional but happened to make the game much more complex than it looks on the surface.\nThe downside to all this is that experienced players often have little tolerance for inexperienced ones who haven't figured out the ideal loadouts and strategies yet. It can be difficult to pick the game up now and start learning because people WILL insult you, votekick you etc, but it can be done - there are loads of guides explaining both the basics and the advanced stuff, and some experienced players like coaching newer ones and showing them the ropes. As long as you're willing to learn and don't act like a twæt, you should be fine.\n\nSo yeah, Killing Floor 1, while slowly growing old, is a gem of the FPS genre. It's definitely not for everyone but if you do get into it, you're in for many hours of good fun.","timestamp_created":1465491024,"timestamp_updated":1465491024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.712528586387634277","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23463283","author":{"steamid":"76561198091365522","num_games_owned":318,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":115,"last_played":1576452235},"language":"english","review":"meh repetitive","timestamp_created":1465451887,"timestamp_updated":1465451887,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4598560631275177","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23461171","author":{"steamid":"76561198132651819","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":16970,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8381,"last_played":1631069520},"language":"english","review":"The game is great.

Почему трудно играть в оригинальные карты, ИБО темень, в большенства карт.\n\nГеймплейна, игра интересна, конечно может насторожить у неопытного геймера, что нет у игры прицела. Для опытных геймеров, не страшно играть без прицела. Многие наверно играли в Zero Tolleranse, или в doom 1,2 на dosе, проблем труда не составит. Самый эпик начинается зайдя в Мультиплеер. Множество карт, которые делают игроки. Про кооператив я не знаю что с ним, ибо 10 месяцов назад, не работал кооператив.
