The best part about it though is to land back on my feet after falling through the ceiling onto an elevated platform. How? Because I have made portals, of course. It gets even better if you jump off and end up flying into the attic. What else can you do with your handy dandy portal gun? Make out with yourself, go into an infinite freefall, or mess around with the friendly robots in the Apeture Facility. [spoiler] Hang on, why do some of them have red lasers?

It mainly focuses on two thing: quick thinking and spartial reasoning. Two questions constantly run through your mind: how can I make that jump and what can kill me. From time to time you get puzzles on how to get something from A to B, such as power blips [spoiler] and missiles [/spoiler]. The context of those puzzles is that you are being tested by GLaDOS for something. [spoiler] Initially at least, but I think you already know that. [/spoiler] It therefore presents a really cool method of making the puzzles harder: at each level, you are given a new idea and problems to try it out with. [spoiler] This culminates into giving you the skills to eventually escape GLaDOS [/spoiler] so basically 80% of the game is tutorial, which was interesting to say the least. \n\nOne slight problem: people like should never play this game. Not because the puzzles are bad but because the whole thing breaks reality so much motion sickness was induced. Portalling from an upper level to a lower was alright because it made sense in my brain but I could not handle falling though a floor into an upper level such as an attic. It is not the game's fault; however, that should be noted for people with a condition like mine. \n\nOverall I think the game is very well made its popularity is deserved; however, people who are sensitive to motion sickness should not play this game.","timestamp_created":1477639788,"timestamp_updated":1477639788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26258616","author":{"steamid":"76561198095414333","num_games_owned":339,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":626,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1647919975},"language":"english","review":"Its good.","timestamp_created":1477628163,"timestamp_updated":1477628163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26257802","author":{"steamid":"76561198245747520","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1659417143},"language":"english","review":"A great game.
