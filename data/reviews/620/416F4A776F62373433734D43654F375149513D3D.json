В итоге я смело могу ставить 10/10, т.к это шедевр, который выходит раз в 10-летие","timestamp_created":1390462424,"timestamp_updated":1588098120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8816360","author":{"steamid":"76561198085310662","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":713,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":641,"last_played":1467322293},"language":"russian","review":"восхитительно","timestamp_created":1390460138,"timestamp_updated":1390460138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwob743sMCeO7QIQ=="}
