Supuso el debut de Valve en los videojuegos.\nUn FPS con excelente ambientación. Después de un experimento que sale mal, debemos luchar por sobrevivir ante criaturas de otro mundo que fueron transportadas al nuestro.\nContamos con una gran variedad de armas para luchar contra una gran variedad de enemigos, humanos y no humanos.\nLa IA es muy buena para un juego de hace ya 20 años, permitiendo una mayor versatilidad en los enfrentamientos contra enemigos e incluso pudiendo usar npcs para nuestro beneficio.\nEl entorno juega un papel clave, desde pasar por las instalaciones inmaculadas antes del accidente a entornos destrozados después del mismo, hasta poder mover objetos y explotar material inflamable para beneficiarnos.\nEl peligro está en todas partes, lo que aumenta la tensión en las zonas cerradas. Ya que un enemigo puede estar esperando a la vuelta de la esquina o en la oscuridad y no podríamos darnos cuenta.\nYa que hablamos de la oscuridad, el juego plantea escenarios donde la linterna es clave para poder visualizar objetos en la ausencia de luz.\nEl movimiento en este juego es bastante fluido. Lo que se traduce en escenas donde debemos correr y otras donde deberemos caminar utilizando el sigilo para salir con vida.\nEl guardado automático lo disfruté mucho. Vengo jugando juegos antiguos que no tienen esta característica y el darme cuenta de que morí después de no haber guardado manualmente para tener que repetir todo el nivel resultaba frustrante. Es una característica que no se valora lo suficiente.\nPara terminar, y esto es un SPOILER, lo que pasa en el tramo final del juego es genial. Transportarnos a Xen nos hace los intrusos en ese mundo. Tal como lo eran todas las criaturas que nos fuimos encontrando a lo largo de nuestra aventura. Ahora nosotros somos los extraños que llegamos a su mundo a hacer daño. Es simplemente asombroso.\nComo punto negativo podría decir que algunos combates son un poco injustos en las dificultades más altas y que el jefe final es un poco confuso de derrotar.\nTotalmente recomendable.","timestamp_created":1607450412,"timestamp_updated":1607450412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81848973","author":{"steamid":"76561198358488477","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":819,"last_played":1607449972},"language":"german","review":"gEIL","timestamp_created":1607449283,"timestamp_updated":1607449283,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81847455","author":{"steamid":"76561198974670520","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":440,"last_played":1659902892},"language":"english","review":"beautiful","timestamp_created":1607447408,"timestamp_updated":1607447408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81847179","author":{"steamid":"76561198357169005","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":49,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35,"last_played":1649373675},"language":"english","review":"the doctor are dumb","timestamp_created":1607447073,"timestamp_updated":1607447073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81846551","author":{"steamid":"76561198976939456","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":426,"last_played":1611832300},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun gayet güzel, hikayesi sarıyor ve 1998 yılında çıkmasına rağmen grafikleri dışında size yeni çıkmış gibi hissettiriyor. zaten bu grafikler o zamana göre gayet güzel yapılmış. sadece bu zamanın gırafiklerine göre daha yetersiz kalıyor. oyunu tavsiye ederim eğer half life ı alacaksanız öbür hikayeleriyle almanızı öneririm.","timestamp_created":1607446319,"timestamp_updated":1607446669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81845961","author":{"steamid":"76561198036191215","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":2943,"playtime_last_two_weeks":16,"playtime_at_review":1092,"last_played":1660492459},"language":"english","review":"bruh alien go brr","timestamp_created":1607445683,"timestamp_updated":1607445683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81844911","author":{"steamid":"76561198131886287","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":610,"last_played":1607444126},"language":"russian","review":"Настоящий classic","timestamp_created":1607444438,"timestamp_updated":1607444438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81844804","author":{"steamid":"76561199094781784","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":632,"last_played":1613749543},"language":"english","review":"One of the most revolutionary and best games ever made.

a classic first person shooter, running on the GoldSrc Engine, developed by Valve Software, published by Sierra entertainment on November 1998.\n\nIn Half-Life the player fill in the shoes of Dr. Gordon Freeman, 27 years old theoretical physicist late for his first day of work at Black Mesa Research Facility. He gets in the Hazardous Environment Suit, the experiment goes wrong, Resonance Cascade happens. Soon enough the first day on the job turns into Gordon's fight for his life during a cataclysmic event.\n\nOver the course of the Black Mesa incident Gordon will acquire a large arsenal of military grade armaments, experimental weapons and tools. From the humble Glock and trusty crowbar, to the exotic crossbow and destructive Gluon gun. There're aways a good weapon for your situation you are in. And what are weapons for if not killing things? throughout Black Mesa you will encounter no shortage of hostiles from all sorts of Xen fauna, HECU and black ops, there's good variety of enemies for the time, and they interact and with the player in different ways. However the threat is not only found in enemies, but the hazardous environment of Black Mesa is in itself a danger, sure the HEV suit does a lot of heavy lifting for Gordon, but it won't save you from dissolving in a pool of acid of getting crushed by the collapsing facility debris.\n\nIn terms of controls, Gordon is fast, his air control is insane, and the movement is good and responsive, however I've seen complaints about Gordon feeling ''slippery'' this is a Golds thing that comes from its Quake origins, you keep part of your momentum when you stop running, it doesn't bother me at all it is a tiny thing, but I see how it could bother someone else.\nWhen it comes to soundtrack, it is rather shy, but when it kicks in its pretty iconic and fits well with the energy and situation the player is in.\n\nValve keeps Half-Life up to date, so the game runs flawlessly on a fresh install ''out of the box'' on modern systems and hardware. It doesn't need any mods for it to run properly which is a god send when it comes to older titles such as this one, most publishers just slap a DOSbox on their games and call it a day like Bethesda did with Quake.\n\nHalf-Life is one of the first FPS games to make the jump from disconnected abstract maps chained in a episodic format to a fully story driven game. While I appreciate the simplicity and merits of its predecessors like Quake, Half-Life would go on to raise the bar and set a new standard in terms of quality, not only for gameplay but for environmental story telling and writing, both aspects that were yet unseen for the FPS genre of the time.\n\na instant classic that would change the way FPS games are designed forever. It's influence and success would cement Valve as a gaming landmark and give birth to future iconic games and franchises equally successful such as Counter-Strike, Portal and Team Fortress.\n\nIt is for this and many more reasons I consider Half-Life to be a Master Piece.\nRun, think, shoot, live.\n\n[h1][★★★★★★★★★★] 10/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1607308240,"timestamp_updated":1644380990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81759175","author":{"steamid":"76561198893969394","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":556,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":239,"last_played":1649152725},"language":"schinese","review":"伟大的游戏，真正的开拓者先驱","timestamp_created":1607307482,"timestamp_updated":1607307482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495035469532012939","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81758706","author":{"steamid":"76561198858717295","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":900,"last_played":1658211330},"language":"english","review":"It was in general a very good shooter.
