Recomendo jogar na maior e melhor TV possível, a experiência visual oferecida por Infinite deve ser aproveitada ao máximo! E olha que jogo videogame desde os 4 anos de idade, não é qualquer coisa que me impressiona. O jogo está totalmente legendado em pt-br, placas, faixas, texto em sangue nas paredes, completamente todo texto do jogo possui sua legenda.\n\nTrilha sonora\n\nUm espetáculo, a base da OST são músicas do ano de 1912. Considero a música como um personagem, de tão imersiva e importante ela é para a trama, pois falam do momento político em Columbia. Um adendo são as músicas apresentadas pelos NPCs durante o jogo e por vitrolas/rádios, deixarei algumas no final do review\n\nColumbia\n\nOutro personagem importante é a cidade voadora de Columbia, com cultura própria e política nenhum pouco laica. Os negros e orientais são tratadas como lixo, escravos da vontade branca, em vários momentos senti raiva das situações que presenciei. A cidade é enorme, e em cada parte as suas particularidades, lojas de conveniência, bancos, lojas de armas, loja de flores, enfim, uma cidade viva e pulsante.\n\nHistória\n\nComeça com o investigador Booker deWitt indo atrás de Elizabeth em Columbia, cidade governada pelo tirano religioso, O Profeta Comstock. A premissa simples logo é abandonada, vários mistérios são apresentados, e vão crescendo gradativamente até um final apoteótico. Digo que Infinite não deve nada a RPGs como Xenogears, Terranigma, ou filmes recentes como Interestelar, ou mais clássicos como Os 12 Macacos. Não posso falar mais que isso, pois não quero estragar a experiência de ninguém.\n\nPersonagens\n\nUm mais cativante que o outro, temos pouco mais que 6 personagens realmente importantes na trama, e cada um deles é explorado ao máximo nas horas de jogo. Destaco aqui a Elizabeth, um dos personagens mais amáveis que conheci, para não dizer, uma das pessoas mais interessantes que já conheci. O desenvolvimento da personagem é absurdo, inocência, medo, caridade, felicidade, raiva, ódio, amor, todos sentimentos transmitidos pelos grandes olhos azuis, e pela doçura de sua voz. Um acerto foi dar personalidade e voz ao personagem principal, isso faz toda a diferença na narrativa do jogo, e explora a sua relação com os outros personagens.\n\nJogabilidade\n\nFluída e sem complicações, quem nunca jogou FPS na vida vai se dar bem, os comandos respondem perfeitamente, eu com as mãos machucadas consegui jogar sem nenhum problema! O combate lembra muito mais uma dança sangrenta, a movimentação dos inimigos, e as infinitas formas de se lutar são um dos pontos altos do jogo. Aqui a Elizabeth brilha outra vez, sabe a mocinha indefesa? Esqueça! Ela é capaz de recolher munição, sais (necessários para usar os poderes do jogo) e medic kits, além disso pode abrir fendas e trazer coberturas, máquinas de combate e paredes para lhe auxiliar, fora de combate ela recolhe dinheiro! Sim, a mulher é linda e ainda te dá grana.\nAté o maior defeito do jogo não é algo ruim, eu queria muito jogar um NEW GAME +, e vivenciar aquilo tudo outras vez, com todos os itens e experiência adquiridos, eu queria muito mais, passaria meses jogando este jogo sem nenhum problema.\n\nBioshock Infinite é daqueles jogos que ao terminar, ele persiste em sua mente por horas ou dias. O jogo é uma experiência estética, sensorial e filosófica. Quando tiver a minha própria casa terei um quadro dele na parede, uma obra de arte, que deve ser jogada e admirada.","timestamp_created":1419566556,"timestamp_updated":1419566556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536423861980438232","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13602256","author":{"steamid":"76561198041820200","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1767,"last_played":1527228038},"language":"english","review":"The single best story driven game on the planet!

My first trip to Rapture had me hooked, and I've been a faithful player of Bioshock series ever since. \n\nSecond, Bioshock Infinite has brought to the table everything I've come to love about the franchise. An antique-but-yet-steampunkish-advanced-dystopian-awesome setting, a kind of \"modern magic\" (plasmids, vigors), strange mechanics (skylines) and more. BI delivers on all accounts, plain and simple. If you are a Bioshock fan, pick up this game and play it, plain and simple.\n\nBut...\n\nI do have one complaint against this game and the franchise at large. In the original Bioshock, we had a straight forward story with a twist. The twist was not expected (at least by me) and added a new layer to the game which was enjoyable. The second Bioshock did the same, but the twist was a bit more complicated and convoluted. I must admit by the end there were some loose strings and unanswered questions. I felt as if the Bioshock devs beleived they needed to \"one up\" the previous storyline with a more complicated one. I feared if it continued the next Bioshock might be as confusing as a Final Fantasy ending.\n\nIt was.\n\nWhat's worse than this complicated and baffling plot is that it comes rushing in at a million miles an hour at the VERY END. Let me show you in a time line:\n\nBioshock Infinite's Story (playtime 14 hours)\nStart - Plot Advances (<1hr) - Fighting! (13 hours) - Plot Advances (<1hr) - Ending\n\nBasically you start the game and learn a whole bunch of stuff in the first 30mins, then spend hours upon hours fighting and running and basically learning nothing about the main plot, then spend the last 30mins with the plot resolving at a lightning speed before the credits roll.\n\nIt's a great game, but be prepared to look over all the stuff a hundred times before you undestand what in the world happened.","timestamp_created":1419551311,"timestamp_updated":1419551311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13599714","author":{"steamid":"76561198117685125","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1072,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":880,"last_played":1492189852},"language":"english","review":"I'll have to say, this is probably one of my favourite games so far.\nThe general experience of playing this title was very positive, \neven though I'm really not a huge fan of first-person-shooters. \nThis game brings amazing visuals, interesting game mechanics and most of all: an incredible story.\nSo yeah...

Irritatingly tough enemies, beautiful detail rich enviornments, a story that'll blow your mind, and a pretty girl sidekick to boot. The addition of a NPC sidekick was a really nice touch; the feeling of isolation in the other games was a brilliant part of the game, a feeling only intensified in Infinite when you find yourself separated from Elizabeth.\n\nRunning themes of racism, opression and redeption throughout make the story every bit as compelling as the gameplay.\n\nIf you liked BioShock and BioShock 2 then Infinite will not disappoint you.

If you've played the earlier Bioshock games you'll know what to expect in terms of gameplay - it's almost exactly the same. The addition of the sky hook lets you zip around during combat and makes the gunfights a little more crazy and often 3d than they were in the Bioshock games, but it's very similar at its core.\n\nThat, of course, is not a bad thing. Not only are the weapons feisty and fun to use, but there are lots of abilities and upgrades to play around with, giving you a lot of possibilities for tackling the varied combats throughout the game.\n\nGreat game, but I would recommend Dishonoured far above this just for feeling more original and giving you a stronger sense of being part of something due to the larger number of human characters. Sure, Bioshock Infinite has plenty of 'human' characters, but aside from Elizabeth, they are all basically irrational, crazed racist scumbags and seem no different to the crazed zombies inhabiting the underwater world of Bioshock. Dishonoured has far more shades of grey in its story telling, and much more non-linear level exploration, so if you haven't played either game, try that first.","timestamp_created":1419478768,"timestamp_updated":1419478768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13581419","author":{"steamid":"76561198047035159","num_games_owned":721,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":1442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1411,"last_played":1419480434},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego increible, casi perfecto, lo recomiendo ampliamente tanto por su jugabilidad como por su historia.

I would recommend it because I think that it was enjoyable, but I personally don't think I will ever complete it.","timestamp_created":1419448602,"timestamp_updated":1419448602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13574000","author":{"steamid":"76561198042403955","num_games_owned":453,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":129,"last_played":1536687400},"language":"russian","review":"..... 10./10","timestamp_created":1419448264,"timestamp_updated":1511460951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13573766","author":{"steamid":"76561198116394587","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":797,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":746,"last_played":1443890977},"language":"english","review":"I dont usually play singleplayer games but god this was fucking amazing","timestamp_created":1419447541,"timestamp_updated":1419447541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13573337","author":{"steamid":"76561198042002606","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1505477037},"language":"english","review":"One of my favourite games, amazing.","timestamp_created":1419446223,"timestamp_updated":1419446223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13573267","author":{"steamid":"76561198072498321","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":601,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":601,"last_played":1419174121},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buena la historia y todo el sistema de aerocarriles","timestamp_created":1419446030,"timestamp_updated":1419446030,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13573123","author":{"steamid":"76561198086903319","num_games_owned":327,"num_reviews":100,"playtime_forever":757,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":757,"last_played":1415056001},"language":"english","review":"Overall, if you can get this game on sale for less than 10$, it is totally worth it.

The only reason it isn't my favourite is minor gameplay issues and tweaks I would have done, but they honestly aren't that bad. You can only carry 2 guns at a time is the big one. While some claim that it's \"strategic,\" I say it's annoying. The skyhook, while cool, can be glitchy a little sometimes (this could be due to the computer I played the game on, however), there is a sometimes glitchy button that shows you where to go as opposed to the arrow you always had in Bioshock 1, and that's really it in the complaint department. The story is possibly the best story I've ever played through ever, the gameplay other than those minor things is flawless, and the visuals? Well, to put it bluntly, it's the best looking game I've ever seen. Honestly, every aspect of this game is poerfect except for gameplay. The review is over, right? Nah. If you're going to buy this game, get the DLC with it. Trust me, it's worth it. You know all of those minor complaints I had for Bioshock Infinite regarding gameplay? Well, those are all gone in the Burial at Sea DLC. You are also in Rapture, which is pretty cool, and it tells the story of what happened BEFORE Rapture fell. That's REALLY cool. I can't spoil the story, becasue I'd not only ruin Bioshock 1 but I'd also ruin Bioshock Infinite, but the DLC blends seamlessly with the stories of the main games, and ties the series up in a nice little bow.
