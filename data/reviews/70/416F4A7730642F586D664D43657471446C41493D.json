I should specify this is a review of the first 3 hours of the game (I couldn’t bear it any further) from someone who is completely new to the series, unconcerned with its legacy. \n\nThe graphics and overall presentation hold up fine. They would obviously be considered dated by today’s standards but they’re pleasant, if unremarkable, and don’t break immersion.\n\nThe issue with Half-life is... well... everything else. \n\nThe level design is shockingly bad from both an aesthetic and functional perspective. The muted greys of the facility are repetitive and boring and the game somehow fails to make a secret underground nuclear(?) military research base novel in any way. If vents turn you on you’ll be hard as diamonds by the end of this game because the sheer amount of them is staggering. There are puzzles I suppose (I stacked a crate!) but the strongest puzzle is ultimately going to be finding a reason to continue playing. Few if any of the puzzles are engaging or challenging and feel more akin to busywork. \n\nThe layout is twisting and bizarre to the point of having nothing in common with any real life building whatsoever. Its so shockingly so that it constantly breaks immersion and provides no sense of progression. It feels as if the player is merely tossed around different parts of some massive sprawling purgatorial corridor, never gaining a sense of whether they’re closer or not to the end goal (escape?).\n\nOf course this would not be a complete non-issue if the shooting was the focus and the setting was just an excuse to get the to meat of the game (e.g. mario 64). However that’s not the case- clever storytelling through gameplay and environment are often touted as a major draw of the half life series. There are certainly instances of this - learning the military is in fact not there to help as you watch scientists gunned down from above, or seeing some poor soul dragged into a vent in the distance, foreshadowing the arrival of (yet more) headcrabs. But these instances are here and there and aren’t interconnected in any interesting way. \n\nFurthermore the actual meat of the game (Puzzle solving, FPS gameplay) is… passable at beast. The shooting is OK. I didn’t expect much and it delivered wholesale on that expectation. The guns are generic dollar store military weapons and feel underwhelming to shoot.\n\nThere’s very little in the way of mechanics or movement to learn, and the dominant strategy ultimately comes down to simply running past most enemies (the most pleasant way to play the game on hard). On the rare occasion however, the game flips the script and you’re stuck between hordes of vortigaunt and the exit hoping you don’t get insta force-lightninged to death while you wield the worst shotgun known to gaming history. Obviously this is 1998 so I’m not expecting current day AAA levels of feedback and tuning in the gunplay, but compared to something like Doom or even Marathon Half Life’s gunplay can’t hold a candle and feels phoned in.\n\nThe movement is clunky and has some weird kind of inertia to it. This wouldn’t be a problem in your average FPS but the game is filled with an outrageous amount of platforming over instant death pits (Sometimes several in a row) meaning you’ll be restarting at the same checkpoint over and over unless you’re save scumming s.t.a.l.k.e.r. style. Another weird design choice in this vein is crouch jumping. It’s unclear to me why crouch jumping is so heavily implemented in the game. It feels janky and adds nothing whatsoever. Why not just let Freeman jump higher? \n\nThe ladders make me want to blow my brains out. \n\nI can’t say whether the story picks up later or not but the beginning has nothing to offer. The silent protagonist is a theoretical physicist who works with highly dangerous alien materials. This seems novel, and a welcome change from the characters that seem typical for the genre. But nope. Half life is just an cool man who kills aliens and doesn’t afraid of anything. \n\nOn hard the difficulty is inconsistent, ranging between easy (most segments with the soldiers) to extremely punishing (office with the vortigaunts), and the game rarely finds a way to slowly build up difficulty or create a skill curve. \n\nThere are some novelties in this game, and those occur when the puzzles mesh with the combat, like leading superior numbers of enemies past a room filled with turrets while you dash behind the boxes to avoid getting shot. This is good fun and I imagine this is what made the game a hit, but for every one of these moments there’s another level segment filled with god awful platforming, crate stacking, and vents. \n\nI’d give it a 2/5 at best. There were things to like about it and it’s clear the game was hugely influential but poor design choices and underwhelming FPS gameplay middle this title and prevent it from holding up alongside other FPS classics.","timestamp_created":1594402497,"timestamp_updated":1594402497,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47308647632598877","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72448807","author":{"steamid":"76561198873775949","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":243685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4531,"playtime_at_review":346,"last_played":1660507192},"language":"english","review":"epic","timestamp_created":1594402101,"timestamp_updated":1594402101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72447144","author":{"steamid":"76561198400756306","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":857,"last_played":1588778101},"language":"czech","review":"Hra
