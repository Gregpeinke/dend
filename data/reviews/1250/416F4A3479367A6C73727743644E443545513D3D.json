There are several classes, and the higher class level, all the guns involved with that class will cost less, and do more damage. There are lots of customized maps with alot of nice add-ons and more. And if you use steam workshop, you can add on new maps, mutators, guns, weapons and stuff like dat. There is more that I'm not going to mention because it would take too dang long, but i recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1360889638,"timestamp_updated":1385422669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"876826","author":{"steamid":"76561197980804932","num_games_owned":771,"num_reviews":101,"playtime_forever":12072,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1710,"last_played":1654977812},"language":"english","review":"16/20","timestamp_created":1360730734,"timestamp_updated":1360730734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6079174","author":{"steamid":"76561198058584889","num_games_owned":336,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":8981,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8304,"last_played":1659282068},"language":"english","review":"Good game","timestamp_created":1360705348,"timestamp_updated":1645403657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1999263","author":{"steamid":"76561198000765941","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":16682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15410,"last_played":1491184707},"language":"english","review":"Dosh simulator.

Killing Floor is the explosive result of a total conversion mod becoming one solid wave-survival game![/h1]\n\nKilling Floor started as a mod for Unreal Tournament 2004 all the way back in 2005, and eventually became a full fledged game. It is as much of a straight-forward wave-survival coop game as any can be, but it's done well and that's what it matters, it doesn't try to reinvent the wheel, it just makes one damn good wheel.\n\nLondon, England, 2009. A biotech company messed up big time and now mutated specimens are wrecking havoc in the British cities. You're part of a team sent to those locations to clean the mess. You have access to your arsenal of guns, allies, and your British cussing. Go blow some heads up in glorious slow motion. Sounds like a bloody blast, doesn't it mate? Oh, did I mention that the maps have metal tracks that play while you relish on the bloodshed? Enjoy the distorted riffs while you rip and tear.\n\nThere's two main game modes, the classic Killing Floor mode where you and a group of friends can fight hordes leading up to the boss, Patriarch, and an objective mode which you can complete tasks amidst the chaos in exchange for money. In both modes, you can buy new weapons and gear in-between waves of enemies. There are Perks (classes) each with its own exclusive weapons and abilities, and as you play you'll level them up and unlock new skills. One of the interesting things about Killing Floor is that there is no cross-hair, so must you aim well and truly and trust yourself; some nice kills will award a slow motion sequence which is rewarding on its own, but shooting the guns, exploding things, or just bashing skulls with a melee weapon all feel incredibly satisfying and impacting in this game. Try the crossbow, it'll shoot straight through multiple enemies, most fun when you headshot through 5  zeds for that domino effect.\n\nThe game features several different types of specimens (AKA zeds) each posing unique threats and making the team stay on their feet. You have the Husk, which can shoot fire from a distance, the Stalker which turns invisible, the Flesh Pound which runs fast and when pissed does massive damage, the tanky Scrake carrying a chainsaw to chop you up, etc. However, all the specimen have weak points too, such as getting stunned by certain guns and headshots (Sharpshooters can stun Scrakes for instance), or being weak to explosives. Level design is crafted so the team can keep on the run or bunker up somewhere and try to survive, you'll need good communication and awareness in the higher difficulties. You can reinforce doors up with a welding tool, you can heal allies with a medic gun or injection, you can give each other cash, etc. It's all about the team work and facing the odds while wreaking bloody havoc, or you can also try to go solo of course.\n\nThe developers supported Killing Floor for quite a while as well, about 4 years after release. You have access to a lot of content in the vanilla game, but there are packs for character skins (some feature exclusive voices) which are optional. Unfortunately, there are also some guns that are locked behind DLCs, and those guns are great for some of the perks, not essential, but really good. Still, the game itself features 7 Perks, over 10 maps to choose from, and you can customize the matches' length and difficulty to suit your needs, providing a great replay value. You also automatically download new community maps when you join them.\n\nThere are few things to keep in mind though, as this is an older low-budget title and a few elements haven't aged so well. There's no running in this game, only the default movement speed which is quite slow (you can go faster by switching to the knife), movement can be a tad clunky with heavy fall damage (sometimes, falling from a low rail will kill you), and the HUD isn't the most intuitive HUD out there (at times it's hard to notice how low your HP is). There's also a few annoying invisible walls per map. Killing Floor can also be very grindy if you're trying to level up your perks, as you need an absurd amount of matches to reach the kill milestones to level up each perk. The graphics weren't the best even at the time, and although all zeds are well designed (they definitely have the creepy and intimidating factor), some things still look pretty bad; hitboxes are also a tad wonky and one of the biggest issues, as sometimes headshots won't register and so on.\n\nRegardless of its age showing and the game being simplistic, Killing Floor holds up to this day, and personally I consider it a better game than its sequel. Not only does it have more content to this day than the sequel, but also, it has better designed maps and a better Hell on Earth mode. Overall Killing Floor just accomplishes its goal as a coop horde-survival better than its successor.","timestamp_created":1359416986,"timestamp_updated":1629510314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"211973","author":{"steamid":"76561197965385361","num_games_owned":921,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2818,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2626,"last_played":1413351894},"language":"english","review":"A great team shooter.
