Half Life 1 did just about everything right, and it was rightly thought hard to top it's success. HL 2 did just that by staying with the true formula and tweaking it.\n\nGraphics 9/10 - Were absolutely beautiful at the time if I recall correctly. Lighting was praised and the physics which were also very impressive, though made for some funny, weird moments. There were no cheap effects, so the game has aged like fine wine. Sure, you'll find an odd crap texture here and there, but it's overall nice looking. The added benefit is that your rig needn't be powerful to run this game. To add to this, the NPC's look great, and the facial animations were state of the art. Seriously, just zoom into a character's face, and count how many parts move!\n\nSound 10/10 - I'll admit, I'm fairly lenient on sounds, cause I really don't have high expectations, other than, just give me energy to play the game. The industro-rock-ambiental music is amazing and fits perfectly. The guns sound amazing, hell' even the chatter is believable.\n\nGameplay 10/10 - You're gonna be seeing a lot of 10s here, and for good reason. Everything has been ironed out to PERFECTION. The guns look, sound and feel amazing, they FEEL like actual guns that pack a punch, the enemies are smart, and have different tactics. While a headcrab will just try to jump at you, the human-ish enemies will try to flank you, chuck grenades at your position, and are overall very smart. A small annoyance might be that sometimes they move a tad oo much so a weapon like a crossbow is useless against them, but if you earn to use it, it's aight. \n\nStory & Setting 11/10 - There's just something about the lack of completeness that elevates the story. There isn't closure, so even today, people debate on forums about who a certain character is, why aren't some characters in the game that were in the previous one etc. That already puts it above many games of the time,  the game's  community still exists.

Not your average FPS this, the scale and scope, the immersiveness, the ease of control, the various different atmospheric sensations!

Not too hard, not boringly easy, there are puzzles but they're not the annoying obscure ridiculous type that send you looking for a walkthrough, they're just right for a li'l bit of brainteaser here and there amid the action. This game is an absolute ride and cenceptually stunning, some of the scenery is so good it's thought provoking, this is a game you really get drawn into. Can't praise it enough.

Удивительная физика предметов которая хорошо обыгрывается в различных головоломках, механика игры,невероятный геймплэй,в котором есть два вида транспорта машина и лодка на воздушной подушке,которые хорошо сочетаются с головоломками в игре.\n4.Звук имеет необычное свойство становится тише при отдалении от npc\n5.Сюжет интересный и затягивающий или же просто ШЕДЕВР\n6.Разнообразие в халфе заключается в оружии которых тут от Монтировки до РПГ. Врагов в халфе пруд пруди они начинаются с Городской полиции и Хэдкрабов до муравьиных львов и гигантских Страйдеров\n7.Атмосфера: здесь можно получить чувство своей без полезности при виде тотального контроля и слежки в Сити-17,нагнетающего страха от тёмных улиц Рейвенхольма и веселья от того,что ты можешь в том же Рейвенхолме давить и сжигать людей которыми овладели Хэдкрабы \n8.Персонажи здесь просто прекрасны,например отец Григорий который даёт нам дробовик и захватывает своей\nречью,Алекс которая пройдёт с нами весь сюжет всех частей,Пёс который помогает нам в наших похождениях,загадочный G-Man который любит не правильно произносить фамилию нашего гг и конечно сам виновник торжества главный герой aka машина для убийств aka учёный сбежавший учёный из Black Mesa aka Гордон Фримен\n9.Музыка здесь великолепна походит под игру, если ситуация напряженная (например перестрелка с комбайнами или что то того типа) то и музыка будет наряженной \nЕсть не критичный минус, это энергия которая тратится вдвойне при беге и фонарике \nВ заключение хочу сказать, что её надо покупать, а лучше сразу со всеми эпизодами, ведь наверно вам не хватит её на долгое время,ведь новый эпизод на вряд ли скоро состоится.\nКороче... Игра 12 монтировок Фримена из 10 монтировок...\n\n\n[h1] Валв, где Half-Life 3?
