Данный продукт представляет из себя головоломку от первого лица. Создан на движке Source, как и другие проекты этого разработчика. \n\nСюжет глобален по своей структуре, однако не богат событиями в самой игре. Действия онной происходят в некой Лаборатории Иследования Природы Порталов. Очнувшись в небольшой камере, девушка(за которую нам и предстоит играть) является подопытной. Подопытной для системы, управляющей всей лабораторией. GlaDOS, именно так обозначена эта система, которая к слову, была создана людьми и которая со временем обрела свой разум, при этом решив захватить весь комплекс и убить людей. Данная система контролирует большую часть лаборатории, наблюдая из камер за происходящих в ней действиях. Поэтому главной героине, не остаётся ничего другого, как следовать инструкциям машины, проходя тестовые камеры, созданные для решение головоломок, с помощью портального устройства. Сюжетно игра делится на два этапа. Первый, это тестовые камеры, а второй, путешествие по лаборатории за пределами этих самых камер. И вот во втором этапе, игра набирает обороты в плане динамичности, раскрывается часть сюжета и событий связанных с этим местом.\n\nНа период выхода игры, геймплей был настолько необычным и не стандартным...\n Поскольку игра основана на голомоломках и логических задачках, по большей части, мы будем медленно продвигатся, раздумывая над очередным тестом. К тому же, в Portal отсутствует какое либо оружие. Есть лишь единственный прибор, под названием Портальная пушка. Прибор  который в умелых руках, может быть не менее грозным оружием, чем автомат. И у которого кстати, помимо возможности создавать порталы на поверхностях, имеется функция схожая с функцией грави-пушки из Half-Life 2. Но безусловно главными особенностями портальной пушки, является возможность создания порталов. Порталов двух видов. Один из них открывает вход в портал, второй делает выход из него. Ставить порталы можно далеко не на всех поверхностях, поэтому решение очередного теста не всегда очевидно. И вот на данных особенностях этого прибора, созданы соответствующие задачки в игре. К примеру, чтобы открыть дверь, требуется активировать кнопку, на которую необходимо поставить куб. Чтобы достать куб, который находится на недостижимом месте, используем порталы. Или например есть силовые поля, проход сквозь которые убирает поставленные до этого порталы, что в свою очередь создаёт новую цепочку различных идей и головоломок на эту тему. При этом, человек или предметы проходящие сквозь портал, сохраняют свою кинетическую энергию, что часто обыгрывается  в игре, заставляя нас разгонятся в одном месте, используя разгон в другом. Часто попадаются места, в которых необходимо действовать быстро и на скорость. Ну и конечно же вторая половина игры, где за пределами тестовых камер, появляются новые возможности для создание других пазлов. Игра очень понравилась своей концепцией, интересной задумкой с использованием порталов, хорошими пазлами, для решения которых необходимо думать.\n\nОдиночная кампания очень коротка, однако процесс игры немного затягивиется, с учётом жанра игры. А первые 18 тестовых камер, хоть и готовят нас к последующим, более сложным головоломкам довольно одноообразны, как в плане геймплея, так и в плане окружения.\n\nГрафически игра похожа на Half-Life 2, что в принципе и так понятно. В игре довольно строгий дизайн карт, что сначала игры сильно бросается в глаза. Сами тестовые камеры созданы в эдаком минимализме, что придаёт игре свою определённую атмосферу лабораторий. Несмотря на то, что в игре всего лишь два персонажа, в ней достаточно много юмора и диалогов.\nХороший тематический саундтрек, который прекрасно дополняет игру.\n\n[h1] На момент выхода игры, Portal удивлял, поражал и радовал своим необычным геймплеем, хорошими пазлами, крутым саундтреком.\n\nОценка: 8/10 [/h1]","timestamp_created":1399973026,"timestamp_updated":1421051350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":195,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.840248227119445801","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10098740","author":{"steamid":"76561198078692654","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":425,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":425,"last_played":1398260826},"language":"russian","review":"I really like the game, but I couldn’t find the stupid cake.","timestamp_created":1399962709,"timestamp_updated":1399962709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10097363","author":{"steamid":"76561198123172280","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1435982537},"language":"english","review":"I guess you can say that this is a Valve classic, but dont underestimate this game.

Straight off the bat, this is a lot of fun, and they teach you a lot tricks you can pull off with an itchy trigger finger...\nPortal would be an okay game with just the mechanic alone, but where it really shines is in the writing, which of course was inescapable for a period of time [the cake is a lie], albeit righteously. I find that Portal's writing and atmoshpere are just as essential to the game as the portals themselves. I was easily made to laugh while also being challenged with overcoming a maze of ultra polite murder-robots, and at times it was creepy, but Portal finds a way to make all it's themes work.\nOf course, the length of the game is very short, and that might be a problem for some who want a more extended period of play with this game and it's mechancs. For ten dolars, cosidering the length of the game, including bonus levels, I'd say it's actually slightly steep [no hard feelings].\nSo do I recommend portal? Of course! If ten dollars is no object to you, than enjoy this game!\nBut if you want more bang for your buck, I'd say keep looking.","timestamp_created":1399743646,"timestamp_updated":1399743646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10073396","author":{"steamid":"76561198114051976","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189,"last_played":1486239300},"language":"italian","review":"gioco bellissimo compratelo ne vale la pena!!!!","timestamp_created":1399738608,"timestamp_updated":1399738608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10069706","author":{"steamid":"76561198052803788","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":340,"last_played":1399562507},"language":"italian","review":"Amazing game.

It is an amazing piece of gaming idealism(that works!). THe beautifly simple yet complex rooms that are embelished with the idea of the portal gun that creates worm holes to travel from place to place in an instant! It's revolutionary and I'm betting that the same kind of computational math will be what future games use for doorway room instance travel for easy transition to another place in games. But really, a pscyho computer out to get you while you jump through hoops(figurative and literal). I think this game deserves an award, oh it has some! Almost all games that get a sequel are worth playing, and this one is at the top of the list, it gets a sequel, and although it looks like the series ended I hope there is another one. A prequel sequel or something! I rate this game a 10/10.
