Il s'agit d'un des classiques du jeu vidéo, ainsi que l'un des pionniers du genre FPS. Le jeu tient encore le coup aujourd'hui, surtout au niveau du gameplay qui est maîtrisé: une grand variété d'armes avec une grande variété d'ennemis et un level design phénoménal. L'esthétique du jeu, bien que contrainte par les limitations de l'époque, est tout de même soignée et agréable à regarder. J'ai personnellement trouvé le jeu très prenant, particulièrement vers le début et vers la fin, avec un milieu un peu répétitif par moments mais tout de même assez agréable.

Я не надеялся, что игра окажется чем-то действительно крутым, думал, что в наши дни она уже устарела. Но как же я ошибался. Игра все ещё смотрится бодро и достойно. Первая Халф-Лайф мне безумно понравилась, и расскажу почему.\n\nКрутой сюжет. Научный комплекс Черная Меза изучает межпространственные путешествий и телепортацию. Но однажды все пошло не по плану и случился Каскадый Резонанс. Мы играем за физика-теоретика Гордона Фримена, который должен это все исправить. Весь ход событий нам повествуют через диалоги, а не как мы привыкли через катсцены. Сам сюжет очень интересный, но после прохождения игры оставляет много вопросов, создавая пространство для теорий и догадок.\n\nРазнообразие геймплея тоже радует. По ходу игры мы будем перемещаться по огромному количеству разных локаций: куча разных лабораторий, подземные пути и многое другое. Сами локации очень сильно отличаются друг от друга. Сразу видно, что это старая игра: на локациях постоянные разветвления, и часто не понятно, куда нужно двигаться. Это добавляет интереса, и желания исследовать. Но тем не менее, я пару раз пользовался гайдами, т.к. сам не мог понять, что делать дальше.\n\nБогатый арсенал оружия. Кроме привычных нам пистолетов, дробовиков и автоматов встречается и куча новых пушек: рукаулей, тау-пушка и многое другое. Звуки стрельбы и перезарядки звучат неплохо и по сей день. Сама стрельба в игре местами напрягает, постоянно не засчитываются попадания, что огорчает.\n\nХалф-Лайф - это классика на все времена, которая никогда не устареет.
