It is a full-fledged game that expands the Half-Life universe. And City 17’s exploding barrel industry is still going strong.\n\nThese are answers to some big questions Valve Software raised last year when it announced the first new Half-Life game since 2007 — but exclusively for virtual reality. Many series have VR adaptations or tie-ins, but Valve promised to deliver “the next part of the Half-Life story” in a package that could help take VR mainstream.\n\nThat’s setting a very high bar, and, for now, I’m not sure Alyx clears it. The game is fighting VR’s inherent hardware limits, a pandemic-related headset shortage, and the difficulty of building a game for a new platform. While it’s about as long as the landmark Half-Life 2, with my game clocking in at 15 hours, it doesn’t feel as big or as narratively and mechanically fresh. It advances the series’s main plot, but it doesn’t come close to resolving it.\n\nBut if you keep these admittedly big reservations in mind, Alyx is a worthy addition to the Half-Life universe. It’s not just a good VR game; it’s a good video game, period.\n\n\nHalf-Life: Alyx is set five years before Half-Life 2, in which protagonist Gordon Freeman wakes from a mysterious 20-year stasis to find Earth colonized by an alien empire called the Combine. Alyx Vance is the daughter of Gordon’s former colleague, and she’s one of Gordon’s most capable companions. Now, in Alyx, she’s the protagonist — a member of an anti-Combine resistance that sees Gordon Freeman as nearly mythical. When her father Eli is captured, she learns about a secret Combine superweapon, which turns out to be more complicated than it seems.\n\n‘ALYX’ IS AN EXTENSION OF ‘HALF-LIFE 2,’ NOT A NEW ‘HALF-LIFE’ CHAPTER\nAlyx is set in the same urban dystopia as Half-Life 2: a washed-out and decaying Eastern European metropolis called City 17. While there’s a lot more detail, you’re facing a similar crowd of hostile alien fauna and transhuman soldiers as well as similar weapons and environments — although soldiers give those classic Half-Life barrels a wider berth. The series’s first two installments practically took place in different worlds. Alyx is more like the sequel’s add-on Episodes, extending the plot without starting a new chapter. At the same time, it feels like a very different kind of game.\n\nThat’s partly because Alyx is a more human-seeming character than Gordon, and City 17 is nearly the whole setting, not the pit stop it was in Half-Life 2. Where Valve poked fun at Gordon’s stoic ‘90s-shooter hypercompetence, Alyx has more realistic — if top-notch — fighting capabilities. Levels have the same forward momentum and minimal backtracking, but Alyx moves at a slower pace through denser and more fully formed spaces. She’s got a history with the world already, having grown up under Combine occupation, so she can bring some context and familiarity to your journey — until a massive curveball near the game’s end.\n\nVR IS PERFECT FOR A CHARACTER WHO’S SKILLED BUT FALLIBLE\nAlyx also dwells a little more on the weird dynamic of being a post-apocalyptic teenager (in this game, at least) who hangs out with a bunch of nostalgic old men. Her Resistance mission control is a pathologically cheerful inventor named Russel who rhapsodizes about old-world sandwiches and future business plans while advising her over an earpiece. He’s not as compelling an ally as... well, Alyx herself in Half-Life 2. But in a setting that players have seen already, their conversations help establish how the characters see that setting.\n\nHalf-Life: Alyx screenshot\nValve’s approach to VR is perfect for a character who’s very skilled but fallible. It’s tough to make PC or console shooters feel messy yet not artificially clumsy. Unsteady aiming or awkward skeuomorphic controls can be effective, but they seem like handicaps on a “normal” point-and-shoot experience. VR hand controllers, by contrast, mimic your physical motion in a fairly natural way — and players haven’t been trained to expect mathematical precision. It’s easier for games like Alyx to make your screw-ups feel like natural mistakes, instead of a designer stacking their deck against you.\n\nActual VR headsets, unfortunately, do screw up. Valve’s Index headset is the gold standard for Alyx, but The Verge’s Index ended up in pandemic lockdown along with the rest of our office. Valve promises support for almost any PC-based VR setup. So I played Alyx with the Oculus Link system, which turns a standalone Oculus Quest into a tethered headset. The initial experience was a mess. My PC easily meets Alyx’s specs, but the headset froze or the game’s frame rate massively dropped at regular intervals. After I finished the game, Valve released updates that seemed to mostly fix the problems, but my later sessions still involved stopping for reboots or resets.\n\nWHEN THE QUEST WORKED, I NEVER FELT LIKE I WAS MISSING OUT\nThat’s not unprecedented for a VR experience, and some issues might be Oculus Link bugs. It’s an experimental feature, so I expect rough spots. Compared to dedicated PC headsets, though, the Quest is a troubleshooting nightmare: a device with its own operating system connected with a detachable cable and enabled with the Oculus desktop app and SteamVR. The Quest is immensely popular by VR standards, so Alyx could be a huge stress test for Link and a potentially frustrating experience for users if anything goes wrong.\n\nI hate how badly the Quest performed because when it did work, I didn’t feel constrained using a non-Index system. The Index controllers can estimate grip strength and the precise placement of each finger on your hand. But Alyx uses broader motions like pushing, throwing, gripping, and, in one memorable section, clasping a hand over your mouth. Oculus’ controllers are more than capable, especially since their stick and button layout — used for things like locomotion — is very similar to the Index’s.\n\nWhen you reload a gun, you physically mimic reloading it. A simple pistol makes you reach over your shoulder for a new magazine, slot it into the gun, and then snap the slide lock shut. If you eject a half-full magazine, you’re just discarding the bullets, so you’ll have to un-learn any reflexive reloading habits. Shotguns get cracked open and loaded with individual shells.\n\nYou have only a handful of weapons, so fighting is a constant game of counting shots, swapping between guns, and almost inevitably fumbling a few reloads with a zombie swiping at your face. The system sounds awkward on paper, but you can develop the muscle memory quickly, making it just a normal part of the game’s rhythm. (It also remains easier than loading a real gun.)\n\nYOU WILL LOOK RIDICULOUS — EMBRACE IT\nAiming is harder than with a mouse or stick, and you can’t knock back enemies with a crowbar or Half-Life 2’s Gravity Gun. So the small, fast-moving, but easily dispatched enemies from earlier games — like flying manhacks and headcrabs — become minor but infuriating threats. Big battles become tense shootouts as you reload and scrounge for more ammunition while crouching behind cover. And yes, I mean literally crouch unless you enable a special accessibility feature. This game will make you look ridiculous. Embrace it.\n\nAlyx isn’t aiming for gritty realism, though. You can move continuously by holding an analog stick, but the “Blink” setting — a common VR locomotion option — offers near-instant teleportation. The game feels designed for these impossibly sudden jumps into and out of danger, and even with the former option, you’ll use a blink-like system to jump across gaps. Incidentally, I got absolutely no motion sickness with the Blink option, which is (unfortunately) noteworthy for a movement-heavy VR game.\n\nTL-DR Pog?- Max

Foi o primeiro a apresentar sua história sem cortes, totalmente em tempo real. Após milhões de cópias vendidas, mais de 50 premiações ganhas e 6 anos de espera (5 deles dedicados à produção do jogo), é lançado Half-Life 2, um dos jogos mais aclamados de todos os tempos.\n\nOs gráficos de Half-Life 2 são impressionantes, assim como a sua física, os sons de alta qualidade e a jogabilidade clássica e impecável. O jogo utiliza a Source Engine, uma modificação da engine de física Havok, o que faz a jogabilidade ser extraordinária. A história é 100% em tempo real, assim como na primeira versão do jogo, o que faz com que o jogador se sinta o próprio Gordon — protagonista da trama.\n\nIncidente em Black Mesa\n\nApós conter a invasão de Black Mesa pelos alienígenas de Xen, Dr Gordon Freeman foi obrigado a escolher entre morrer ou trabalhar para G Man — apesar da escolha de Gordon não ter sido clara, presume-se que ele escolheu a segunda opção, pois ele é colocado em um estado de hiper-sono e é acordado em HL2 por ninguém mais do que o próprio G Man.\n\nGordon acorda então em um trem que se dirige à cidade 17. Ao chegar, ele se depara com uma situação bem diferente da qual estava acostumado — a terra está infestada por alienígenas, os recursos naturais da terra estão praticamente esgotados e as pessoas estão escravizadas e proibidas de procriar. A repressão impera e a mídia é completamente manipulada a favor de Wallace Breen, o atual governador.\n\nFreeman se dá conta então de que o pior havia acontecido: a Combine tomou conta da terra enquanto ele dormia e agora, em sua pele, você deve combater este mal que ameaça a humanidade.\n\nNovos inimigos e velhos aliados\n\nEm sua jornada, Gordon enfrenta, na maior parte do tempo, as forças da Combine, que consistem em soldados humanos, máquinas biomecânicas, armas biológicas e robóticas. Entretanto Freeman encontra também inimigos da primeira versão de Half-Life, como Headcrabs, Barnacles e zumbis possúidos por Headcrabs.\n\nGordon tem, contudo, à sua disposição aliados poderosos como os humanos membros da resistência e os Vortigaunts, alienígenas que eram seus inimigos anteriormente, mas se livraram da dominação de Nihilanth e agora são aliados. Apesar de serem seus inimigos no começo do jogo, os Antlions — espécie nova no Half-Life — acabam por ser uma importante força de apoio.\n\nAlém destes aliados, você tem a ajuda de personagens mais significantes, que também participam da trama, como Alyx Vance, Barney Calhoun e Dog — o robô de estimação de Alyx.\n\nA Ameaça Combine\n\nCombine é uma poderosa espécie alienígena que sobrevive da pilhagem de mundos paralelos. Eles subjugam as espécies dominadas através de implantes biotecnológicos, lavagens cerebrais, e uma forte repressão. Outro artifício utilizado é a manipulação das lideranças locais, resultando em uma estrutura quase inalterável de poder. Qualquer tentativa de revolta é cominada com penas violentamente terríveis.\n\nEles invadiram a Terra em apenas sete horas utilizando seu formidável aparato tecnológico, não permitindo que as forças de defesa humanas esboçassem a menor resistência. Logo após a invasão, eles dominaram os humanos e começaram a drenar todos os recursos do planeta, criando enormes desertos que cercam as cidades.\n\nAs táticas de combate foram aperfeiçoadas\n\nUm dos pontos mais interessantes do jogo é a inteligência artificial, que desempenha um papel importante no modo como o jogador deve agir e no quão realistas as coisas são. Todos os personagens possuem uma inteligência diferente, sendo eles aliados ou inimigos.\n\nInimigos como os zumbis ou os head crabs são lentos e não planejam muito para atacar, no entanto, os Soldados Combine são desafiadoramente inteligentes, pois eles atacam em grupos, flanqueiam o alvo, se protegem do fogo inimigo, recuam, chamam reforços e usam táticas e equipamentos de acordo com o momento.\n\nOutro detalhe importante é que os Soldados Combine lutam contra os alienígenas de Xen e vice versa, o que melhora ainda mais a qualidade do Half-Life 2.\n\nO Melhor Equipamento contra invasões alienígenas\n\nPara combater a Combine, Freeman precisa estar preparado. Para isso, Dr Kleiner o presenteia com o HEV Suit, uma roupa para melhorar sua performance em batalha. Ela lhe dá habilidades como proteção contra tiros, maior velocidade na corrida e maior capacidade de respiração debaixo d'água.\n\nEm HL2 pode-se segurar objetos — como latas de refrigerante ou caixas — e arremessá-los, empilha-los ou simplesmente levá-los para outro lugar. Há assim uma nova opção para a resolução de problemas básicos que basicamente todos os jogos do gênero apresentam: a possibilidade de alcançar lugares inacessíveis. Basta procurar caixas ou objetos parecidos e empilhá-los de forma que o permita escalá-los, permitindo-lhe alcançar lugares mais altos que o seu pulo.\n\nPorém a maior novidade do jogo é a arma de gravidade que, além de otimizar essa possibilidade, permite, por exemplo, que o jogador pegue itens de vida ou munição em lugares de difícil acesso, ou traga objetos de longe, como barris ou caixas, para ajudá-lo a tomar cobertura durante uma troca de tiros com os oficiais da Combine. No decorrer da trama, seu poder é acentuado, possibilitando controlar inclusive inimigos à distância.\n\nOutro recurso de Gordon nessa versão de HL são os veículos. É conferida ao jogador a tarefa de pilotar dois veículos durante o jogo: um bugie de areia armado com um canhão Tau igual ao do primeiro Half-Life e um barco movido a hélice, que inicialmente não possui armas, mas posteriormente é acoplada à sua estrutura uma arma roubada de um helicóptero Combine.\n\nO Velho Pé de Cabra está de volta\n\nAssim como na versão anterior de HL, Gordon começa sua aventura portando apenas um pé de cabra, que é usado principalmente para destruir obstáculos ao longo do caminho, como caixas ou pedaços de madeira, podendo também ser usado como arma.\n\nEntre as outras armas estão: Zero-Point Energy Field Manipulator (a famosa arma de gravidade), pistola 9mm, .357 Magnum, Submachine Gun, Overwatch Standard Issue Pulse Rifle, Shotgun, Crossbow, Rocket-Propelled Grenade Launcher, Antlion Pheropod (Bugabait) e M83 Fragmentation Grenade.\n\nRevolução Gráfica no mundo dos games\n\nHalf-Life 2 revelou uma nova dimensão, em que os efeitos visuais realistas fazem diferença na diversão proporcionada pelos jogos. Com todas as novas tecnologias de melhoramento gráfico e simulação da física, o jogador passou a imergir em mundo cheio de detalhes e cenários deslumbrantes com uma interatividade nunca antes vista.\n\nTudo isso foi proporcionado pela Source Engine, que utiliza tecnologias usadas pela Pixar para a criação de animações como Toy Story e Monstros S.A. Gráficos de última geração normalmente requerem hardware da mesma qualidade, o que não acontece com HL2, pois o jogo foi desenvolvido para consumir a menor quantidade possível de recursos do sistema.\n\nSource Engine, realismo inacreditável\n\nSource Engine, a “mecânica” desenvolvida pela Valve para possibilitar todos os efeitos incríveis vistos no jogo, impressionou até mesmo os críticos mais exigentes ao elevar a qualidade do gênero para um nível nunca antes visto.\n\nAs mudanças vão desde os gráficos realistas e de alta qualidade até a maravilhosa física, que possibilitou uma interação surpreendente com praticamente todos os objetos do ambiente e uma proximidade do movimento dos corpos com a realidade.\n\nComo se a física revolucionária não fosse o suficiente, a Valve também inovou ao implementar novos filtros gráficos como o HDR (High Dynamic Range Rendering), que proporciona mais realismo nos efeitos de luz e sombra, e o Shader Model 3.0 que torna modelos 3D não renderizados parecidos com os vistos em animações pré-renderizadas.\n\nAmor eterno a franquia HALF LIFE
