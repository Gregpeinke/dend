The first portal was awesome and had a great story line that went well with the gameplay and mixed with the dark humour tied it all together into a big knot of amazing gameness. I was't quite sure what they could do with the story so was a little leery of basically a remake for a sequel. But this game took all the doubts I had and shoved them right up Wheatley's @#$. This game is near perfect. An improvement on the first and looks great. Plays great. And best of all the puzzles dont get boring. Later on they get harder and harder and sometimes, after a considerable amount of screaming, you have to just take a break from a level, come back later, see your dumb mistake, hit your head against a wall, and continue into the wonderful brain melting delight that is Portal 2. A must play for any Portal 1 lover or gamer in general. Fingers crossed for Portal 3.

The game let you discover a lot more about how all these tests work, you're finally seeing the machine (well, beside GLaDOS of course).\n\nThe gameplay is the same as the first one portalgun-wise, but introduces a bunch of new mechanics. Turrets, our lovely turrets, are also back into the party. Puzzles are really cleverly-made, nothing is too difficult if you concentrate enough, though I felt I kinda cheated one or two rooms and somehow made it to the exit, without trying to.\n\nThis is of course a must-buy, it goes on sale regularly but is totally worth the full price.

She is bitter that you tried to kill her previously (maybe in portal...dont know havent played it yet) and she wants you to die, basically.\nI loved the wittiness and the way she taunts you throughout the game. It really makes you want to overheat her core! You are given a portal gun that enters/exits and left to decide what to do to reach the exits in each board. Seems simple enough but might find yourself scratching your head like I did a few times. Took about 5 days to beat this game, playing for several hours in the evenings and a full day. Roughly 20 some hours.\n\nGraphics are great for a game several years old and the gameplay was smooth.
