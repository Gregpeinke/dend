Well if you do there no reason to skip out on this installment of the series. The same humor from the first returns and improves upon the original.I found myself laughing at  each of the comments made by the expanded cast. This title also sheds some light on the origins of GLaDos and Arperture Science. Theres even a few references to the Half Life universe that appear in the game for those who  explore the levels carefully and pay attention.\n   The game is about 2 to 3 times as long as the original (depending on the player). The portal mechanics return but bring new elements into the puzzle solving such as Repulsion Gel, Excusion Funnels and Jump Pads. The co-op is fun and challenging requiring communication between both players to complete each test. Not game of the Year but my inner nerd was giddy from start to finish.","timestamp_created":1311383721,"timestamp_updated":1311383721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1045428","author":{"steamid":"76561197985205405","num_games_owned":416,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1517,"last_played":1387515497},"language":"english","review":"Do it!","timestamp_created":1311363959,"timestamp_updated":1311363959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"196542","author":{"steamid":"76561197964916133","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":372,"last_played":1313996400},"language":"english","review":"Awesomesauce.","timestamp_created":1311352483,"timestamp_updated":1311352483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"382758","author":{"steamid":"76561197970184031","num_games_owned":1430,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":147,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":147,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Brain teasing fun, while the computer insults you = win.","timestamp_created":1311293451,"timestamp_updated":1385412273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"506675","author":{"steamid":"76561197971276335","num_games_owned":683,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":4257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3369,"last_played":1605301867},"language":"english","review":"Lemon Win.","timestamp_created":1311285005,"timestamp_updated":1385423335,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3085702","author":{"steamid":"76561198017190644","num_games_owned":1239,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1362,"last_played":1557469868},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo do ano!

The small, compact gameplay areas of Portal have been replaced by spaces so big that a zoom function has been included into the game.\n\nI feel that Portal 2 was not a puzzler but a story game with some mediocre puzzle parts embedded into it. This is not what made the game unique, and some of the new features are great, but not gold. Portal created the genre that it designed and Portal 2, with its multiplayer and DLCs, may build it up but will never come close to the originality and resourcefulness of the original game.
