For example, the pistol in other games generally becomes useless after you get other weapons, but here the pistol stays useful for precise, accurate shots from far away.\n\nThe tau cannon is an experimental uranium weapon that doesn't ever need to be reloaded, fires rapidly, and has two fire modes. The second mode will fire a STRONG beam of energy that will knock you back, but proves very effective towards helicopters.\n\nThe MP5 is great for taking out enemies quickly, and the second mode launches a grenade which is great for crowd control.\n\nAnd the snarks are little bugs [b](insects)[/b] that can be deployed to greatly mess up enemy group formations. If there aren't any enemies around, they'll come back and attack you. See what I mean? I wish more games had cool weapons and items like this, so I applaud Half-Life and one of it's few traits this game has over it's sequel\n\n[b] Graphics [/b] \nThis game is from 1998, so it's obviously going to look old. That doesn't mean it looks bad though. I'd recommend [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2303784937] turning off texture filtering [/url] for a pristine look.\n\nIn 2001, Gearbox [b] (the same Gearbox that made Borderlands) [/b] released an expansion called Half-Life: Blue Shift. This introduced higher quality models that were ported over to Half-Life and their other expansion, Opposing Force.\nPeople like to complain about it, for reasons that make sense, and for some that don't, like;\n[list]\n    [*]The higher-poly models [b] (don't expect premium quality, they're from 2001) [/b] clash with the then-dated models of the game. I can respect this one because it's true, but maybe just disable the pack then??\n    [*]It's default, so most new-players won't know about the older models.. ok? You can still love Half-Life and use the new models.\n    [*]They change the actual guns themselves, like the Glock to a Beretta, and the MP5 to a.. M16 assault rifle?? Now the assault rifles use the same ammo as the pistol, which makes little to no sense.\n[/list]  \nBut remember: you can [b]ALWAYS[/b] turn it off, so I don't think it's as big of a deal as people make it out to be.\n\n[b] Spec requirements [/b] \nIf your computer doesn't predate the late 90's, you can run Half-Life.\nSomething great about a game this old is that level transitions load fast. The most it should ever take is 5 seconds.\n\n[b] Difficulty [/b]\nThe amount of items you get or damage you take is affected by what difficulty you choose. I'd recommend playing through the Hazard Course before playing so you get the hang of movement, especially crouch jumping if you aren't used to that in other games.\n[url=combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Difficulty_settings_(Half-Life)] You can read more about difficulty here [/url]\n\n[b] Story [/b]\nHalf-Life presents it's story in a way many games didn't do (and still don't do) at the time. Instead of taking away your control and forcing you to watch a cutscene, Half-Life has it happen right in front of you.\n\nGordon never talks, and since you have the ability to kill neutral characters, you can be your friendly-neighborhood Gordon, or be a psychopath and light up everybody you see.\n\n[b] Bugs [/b]\nThe game is old. Of course you're going to encounter bugs.\n\n[b] So, overall? [/b]\nThe game is great to this day, however do be warned.. the last few chapters are easily the worst part about the game","timestamp_created":1574131722,"timestamp_updated":1639187613,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57452618","author":{"steamid":"76561198147152070","num_games_owned":272,"num_reviews":114,"playtime_forever":778,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":163,"last_played":1653710151},"language":"english","review":"this game is older than me, but more fun than more recent games","timestamp_created":1574131241,"timestamp_updated":1574131241,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512195110321044922","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57451272","author":{"steamid":"76561198308622078","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":814,"last_played":1580997113},"language":"turkish","review":"ZAMANIN ESKİTEMEDİĞİ EFSANE BİR OYUN HİKAYESİ BİLE ÇOĞU ANİME VE OYUNA BİN BASAR MULTİPLAYERİ HALA ÇOK ZEVKLİ BU OYUNUN EŞİ BENZERİ DÜNYADA YOK 3.

could never understand what so amazing about this game, every time I try it everything about is just plain annoying to me. \nFirst things first, the movement is just godawful, your character has this ridiculous momentum and slide a bit every time you come to a stop its absolutely infuriating constantly messing up shots and making the platforming way more frustrating than needed, I mean why would you even have such a movement system with paltforming!? Its moronic. \nNext, enemies are a chore, they're all sponges and feel like they have a bit more health than they need to, they also make no animations when you hit them so sometimes your really wondering if you're actually doing anything as you empty a whole magazine of ammunition into soldier as he fires at you non-stop completely unaffected. The stupid soldiers are some the most un-fun stupid enemies ever, they're all hitscan and take ton of damage they're basically aimbots to boot so forget outrunning their aim you basically forced to play stealthily and hide behind cover constantly to take care of them without getting your health melted. \nMemorization game, this game really promotes save scumming, theres alot of scripted stuff and just dickish enemy placement that totally screw you over without knowing whats going to happen, so if you don't already know whats coming up your probably gonna die and have to start over from a previous save as just a out of sight soldier placement can melt you pretty quick or some dumb scripted event happens and if you don't react the exact right way or don't have you're screwed. \nI'm guessing this game was a big deal because it spawned a lot of popular multiplayer mods and people were tired of the fantasy/scifi heavy FPS games and thought something more narrative driven with more grounded atmosphere and realistic guns was a good change of pace, I guess there's the technical impression as well, but in the current year I can only judge it on its actual gameplay and personal fun factor, Unreal came out earlier the same year as Half-Life and imo is an amazing game, much-much more fun than Half-Life, I'd suggest playing that instead.","timestamp_created":1574057976,"timestamp_updated":1574057976,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":30,"votes_funny":11,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517907083034515381","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57404833","author":{"steamid":"76561198124014248","num_games_owned":657,"num_reviews":400,"playtime_forever":1305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1305,"last_played":1659316852},"language":"english","review":"There are few games as well designed as Half-Life. Not only there's a nice selection of weapons, both conventional and experimental, and hordes of horrific enemies, but it's all wrapped in a very interesting setting. However, the greatest strength of the game for me is the pacing; there isn't a dull moment in the game unless you get stuck and there's a surprising amount of variety for the main campaign. \nThe only downside to me are the vehicle segments, which I've never enjoyed, and that enemies are too spongy in the highest difficulty.","timestamp_created":1574053227,"timestamp_updated":1659320125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57402761","author":{"steamid":"76561198975890797","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6721,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":868,"last_played":1657925046},"language":"english","review":"its time to kick ass and find some ammo.
