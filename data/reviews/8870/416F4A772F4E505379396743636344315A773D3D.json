They want to be raw and emotinal, with an ending which  is gritty and brutal but is able to give you a warm feeling that makes you remember it for ages. \n\nThis is it. Every AAA release you've ever played and thought 'eh I understand what theyre trying to do here, but i dont feel any emotion at all.' But this game does it, this game knows what it wants to do, and does it perfectly, and doesnt try and be somethings its not.\n\nWhy? Heres why.\n\n1. Great length. The game certainly isnt the longest, about 13 hours or so for one playthrough-ish, and i think maybe it could have been improved by shortening it slightly, but only for replayabilty purposes\n\n2. Replayabilty purposes. Due to the AMAZING plot and writing, the moment you finish this game youll want to start it again. After the shock though. \n\n3. Difficulties.With the amazing varied and perfectly balanced difficulties, Easy is easy, Medium is tolerable with bosses still being punishing. Hard will punish you constantly but is well worth a play, my preffered difficultly for this game. 1337 mode, which, unless you do research will mess you up in every imaginable way. Perfect for a Linear shooter\n\n4. Level design. The level design is phenominal. Wow. having to constantly change weapons alongside the varing landscapes, with some large open shooting areas and some close encounters, along this I will mention enemy types, which is an area this game doesnt do perfectly. Whilst there isnt too many enemy types, the show up uncommenly enough to make you change up your style and punish you, forcing you to learn quirks for dealing damage. But the lack of different textures for these can be annoying, maybe 3 or 4 different textures and voicelines.\n\n5. The raw emotion. Most AAA publishers are just stupid when it comes to this. Having a main protagonist going round shooting everyone, and giving them a kind and caring personality and then making you care for them DOESNT WORK. You will not care. Whilst Booker DeWitt (Our protagonist and player character) isnt nessisarly the kindest man, or even overly interesting, and you wont care for him too much, all your care is focused on the side-kick Elizabeth, a non-killing sweet girl who you genuinley care for.\n\n6. Elizabeth. Perfect character design. Perfect voice acting, perfect writing. This is a 'side-kick' she wont damage or take damage in combat (and has reasons for both) so will only provide supplies occasionally, never whilst playing this have i thought 'Wow shes annoying' or 'she made me die.' Never. \n\n7. The tone. Whilst not having as much tone as BIO 1 or 2, certain moments are so memorable, moments are so tense, so confusing, so dramatic, and spooky. Sometimes all at once, often all at once.\n\n8. The shooting is amazing. The only downside is the lack of weapons here, a few more types would definaetly even the spread of gameplay, no 'super unique' weapons here, apart from the melee, which allows you preety much fly around on metal zip-lines, making combat fast-paced, but not overused so youll enjoy it more.\n\n9. The plot. The plot can only be appreciated with the playthrough of BIO 1 and maybe 2, IF you include the DLC for this game, Burial At Sea, then this story beats BIO 1, but only if you played that first. No spoilers, jsut play this and BIO 1 just for the plot. A video game in which the story is told perfectly. \n\n10. Everything else. Play this now. This is the best Linear shooter to date, and i dont think there will be a better one, as long as you know what your getting into, you wont be dissappointed. Best shooter out there, arguably one of the best games out there. Ever.\n\nPlsy BIO 1, play this, play the DLC. Get the tissues. Have a word document full of your findings and revelations in this game (you WILL need it).

Aber erst mit den Dlcs wird es richtig spannend, natürlich sollte man sich auch in das Spiel hineinversetzen.\n\nGrafik: Für die damalige Zeit wirklich gut gelungen, großer Schritt gegenüber Bioshock 2, trotzdem bleibt der Charme des Grafikstils noch erhalten.\n\nGameplay: Eigentlich ein großer Kritikpunkt, nur 2 Waffenslots verfügbar. Kämpfe arten meist in stupides Draufgeballere aus. Auch die Aufwertung der Waffen würde ich als nicht so gelungen ansehen, da man zumindest in höheren Schwierigkeitsgraden im Spiel mehrmals die Waffen wechselt. Plasmide/Kräfte habe ich auch nur um die 2 Kräfte aktiv genutzt. Alles in allem eher ein Rückschritt zu Bioshock 2.\n\nSoundtrack: Empfinde ich wirklich als sehr gelungen. Von schönen klassischen Stücken, über fröhliche Lieder, bis zu nervenaufreibende Titeln (Violine) ist alles dabei und passt zumeist perfekt zur Situation.\n\nTechnik: Keine Bugs, Blackscreens etc., wie es bei mir in Bioshock2 war. \n\nFazit: Großer Geheimtipp, auch heutzutage noch, wenn man nicht so viel Wert auf Gameplay legt.
