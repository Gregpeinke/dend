Portals equal science... duh [/h1]\n    I love the concept and enviroment of this game. It makes you feel like you're trapped and manipulated to do these \"tests\" or puzzles chambers. You have a goal and something to achieve, escape and freedom. As simple as it sounds, it makes this a pretty deep but shallow game at the same time. While having a basic design and basic gamplay, it innovates a whole new genre in gaming.\n\n    Lets talk game mechanics. When I said basic gameplay I meant it as easy to understand kind of basic. The portal physics and momentum makes the portals more believable. All you need to know is that you can manipulate these portals any way you want to. This ingredient of this game recipe is its main ingredient. \n\n    Lets talk level design. Since this is a puzzle style game based on portals, you would think the levels would be clusterd and confusing, you would be right to an extent. The beginning levels of portal are simple and easy to figure out, this continues but at the same time it teaches you something about your abilites. One level might urge you to bring a test cube out of a box while another urges you to fling yourself onto a cube despenser button. This is good level design, something that teaches you something about the game, your abilites, progress (like chamber numbers) and chamber expectations or hints next to the chamber number. Though the level may look simple, it could be the hardest one you've come across and thats what makes the level design fun and suprisingly satisfying to figure out.  \n\n    Lets talk story. The lore and story for this game are shallow and lacks protagonist development. Of course thats not a bad thing to have a silent protagonist as it makes the game more emersive to feel like its you, the player, who GlaDOS is talking too. As far as story goes it does go somewhere. As you progress in game, GLaDOS becomes more currupt and refers to Chell's (who you play as) history and even name at some point. Since Chell can't talk, GLaDOS acts as a narrator throughout each level. Since there is some story throughout portal, I wont spoil any juicy details if you havent played it yet. Just remember that you're not the only human alive in the facility. \n\n    Portal is a simple but mind-exercising game that takes you on an intersting ride with one antagonist and one goal, freedom. Its popularity gave inspiration upon the 3D 1st person puzzle genre and continues to with its greatly polished metanarrative sequel, portal 2.\n\n~If you were wondering how I beat the game in an hour, I didnt. I beat the game on my Xbla 360 with orange box. and decided to compare PC gamplay with the 360's, so far I think they are both great ways to play portal!","timestamp_created":1523904414,"timestamp_updated":1531197664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41526980","author":{"steamid":"76561198018090575","num_games_owned":333,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1594,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1594,"last_played":1481802194},"language":"english","review":"You wake up in a weird facility.

This is one of those games that will be in classic gaming libraries for future generations. Aside from being an awesome game, Portal is a first person puzzle game (FPP anyone?) \n\nThere are no monster to shoot up or kill, so forget that type of game. You do have an enemy (sort of), but I wont spoil it, that's for you to discover. \n\nPortal requires you to use your brains rather than muscles to advance as it is a FPP. You will be a master of portals, hence the name of the game. You will blast your way through mazes that are so well done, that once you finish the game, you will have that proud feeling of achievement, just like handing in a term paper for school and acing it. You know that feeling, right? ;)\n\nThe thing that amazes me the most with the game though, is the balancing, some levels are tricky to solve, yes, but they are not on an impossible level, and you won't most likely have to youtube any of your answers. That to me, is a testament of great testing and level design. This is where testing is so important for a game, to be able to create levels that are so balanced that anyone can achieve and finish levels, yet be challenging enough to keep on going and wanting to discover, what's next? I can't wait to play another level, just one more and so on :) \n\nNot to many games today are so well thought out. The game itself is around 3-4 hours of wonderful gameplay, and worth the price, no matter if you can get it on sale or not. Ranging everything from 5-15$, easily. And apparently there is a huge community making levels beyond as well as you yourself can create levels for this awesome game (nothing im personally into, but still it's a great way to play extended levels and challenges if you want more goodies.\n\nThe graphics are what they are, you are not going into this game for the graphics or the music really, so I'll put that aside for this game.\n\nLast note: Get this game, it's a must. It's fun, it's engaging and really just pure love and passion, what else do you really want from a game?","timestamp_created":1523695951,"timestamp_updated":1523695951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41475321","author":{"steamid":"76561198260425281","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":44,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44,"last_played":1482751893},"language":"english","review":"Short game but fun.

The graphics are top notch. For Windows 10 laptop, the graphics are brilliance and same with gameplay.

The greatest game I've every played. This was also the first game I've ever played in my life, and it was a great experience playing it again. I would rate it 10/10. There is nothing I have against this game. There is nothing wrong with the levels, the graphics, the commentary, the humor. NOTHING, is wrong with this game. It's only $9.99 please by it. You will treat yourself to the best game  ever. It is a masterpiece of a game. Valve worked so hard on it, and it's amazing it's still relevant.
