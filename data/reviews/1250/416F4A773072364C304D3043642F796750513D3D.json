I have played this game a long time, this is my 2nd steam account and between the two I have well over 3200 hours of play with this game. This was my first steam game I ever bought. The first thing I liked about the game, other the the fact it has some very interesting monsters, Was that the game was team based. And that the game could also be played solo. But the more I played I noticed that the \"ZEDS\". interacted with each other in some strange and funny ways.That you don't normally see in video games. For example a Bloat puked on some Clots by mistake. and a few of the Clots followed the Bloat around and attacked it from behind. until the Bloat killed them off.I have played about every game worth playing on PC and most gaming consoles. And I have to say Killing Floor is one of the most unique games, I have ever played.It's not only that the game is fun and has lots of replay value. but the community support and love for this game is awesome. Just check out the workshop for new mods and maps. I have about 100 maps that I can play in solo mode \"off line\". or if I want I can host my own server or use the multiplayer server to find a game. There are also Events hosted by Tripwire during the summer and Holidays. I have to say this game is the only reason I still have a Steam account.......just buy it already","timestamp_created":1433806855,"timestamp_updated":1455862345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549180328845977783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16266655","author":{"steamid":"76561198072100145","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":823,"last_played":1439575051},"language":"italian","review":"6/10","timestamp_created":1433799141,"timestamp_updated":1433799141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469924807548522949","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16265549","author":{"steamid":"76561197990492344","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":40027,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38695,"last_played":1516559723},"language":"english","review":"Amazing","timestamp_created":1433794343,"timestamp_updated":1433794343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16256303","author":{"steamid":"76561198065959252","num_games_owned":450,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":488,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":488,"last_played":1422373579},"language":"brazilian","review":"otimo UEUHEUHE","timestamp_created":1433751676,"timestamp_updated":1433751676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16253763","author":{"steamid":"76561198126869328","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1562078534},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor is a great zombie FPS and a good co-op game. It focuses more on wave-based arcade shooting rather than survival, though the goal is to survive a preset amount of waves.\n\nThere are quite a few good pros to this game. First off, there is the variety. There is a huge variety of weapons bundled with the game. On top of that, there are somewhat overpriced DLC weapon packs. However, the weapons feel decent, and the gun handling is rather smooth. Now on to the maps. There are plenty of maps bundled with the game. Not enough? Get the Toy Master mod. Not enough? Check out the Steam Workshop. The possibilities are endless. On top of that, I believe there are some extra weapons on the Steam Workshop. Grab five friends, and prepare for hours of fun for anyone. \n\nRemember that no game is perfect and there are some downsides even to the amazing Killing Floor. The gunplay, though decent, does feel rather rigid. Also, graphics are not top-notch, but remember the age of the game. Also, as previously stated, the weapon packs are rather pricy. Also, the game is rather boring when you take it on solo. It will give you some hours of enjoyment, but it WILL get boring. That is why I have low hours on this game. It is BORING in solo. If you want a blast in solo, I suggest something else.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 92/100\n\nCONCLUSION\nA good team-based run-and-gun zombie survival game.","timestamp_created":1433734438,"timestamp_updated":1433734438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16252622","author":{"steamid":"76561198056048739","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":8328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6056,"last_played":1531539607},"language":"english","review":"Well, where to begin?\nPros:\n-fast paced action\n-well made gunplay, every weapon feels unique and balanced\n-rewarding teamwork\n-different perks to have fun with\n-a diverse range of unique enemies\n-funny british humor\n\nCons:\n-only two different gamemodes (objective and vanilla)\n-vanilla can get boring after a while\n-the grinding takes millenia\n-some enemies can get really annoying (siren, crawler)\n\n8/10- Despite some flaws, the game is fun and action packed!

KIlling Floor - игра интересной судьбы. Все началось еще с мода для UT 2004 и выросло в отдельную игру. Понять, чем же так крут КФ по скринам не просто. Да и как обьяснить то чувство когда монстр с бензопилой рубит заваренную тобой дверь, а у тебя осталась последняя обойма в дробовике...\nKilling Floor умеет создавать такие ситуации, которые легко могут поспорить по атмосферности и ужасу с Resident Evil в его лучше годы. \nЭто черта уже делает КФ уникальным и никак не похожим на Left for Dead который в конечном счете оказывается лишь соревновательным шутером, но никак не хоррором. Здесь же есть страх, атмосфера реального выживания ( на сложности выше среднего конечно). \nБолее того КФ это шутер, где у всех есть специализация: огнеметчик, медик, спецназовец ( основная сила), инженер ( сварщик и любитель дробовиков), берсерк ( соответственно любитель холодного оружия).\nКаждая специализация важна и нужна и только в кооперации с другими игра полностью оживает, а вы получаете максимальное удовольствие от процесса, пусть вы можете в итоге где-то и ошибиться.\nА ошибиться здесь легко: заварили все двери? Что ж удачи вам в тактическом отступлении от босса или бензопильщика! Пока вы разварите ворота вас скушают. Не помогаете друзям по команде и изображаете одиночку? Скорее всего вы умрете первым. Тут таких не любит никто.\nНе смотря на всю старость движка игра не выглядит очень устаревшей и никак не мешает погрузиться в атмосферу жесткого выживания. \nСловом,  Killing Floor образчик крепкого кооперативного отстрела противников разной степени крутости.

In Killing Floor the main goal is to survive multiple waves of mutants trying to kill you. The plot is no there but it doesn't matter cause Killing Floor is really fun. You can have a team of 6 people and try to survive while zed's try to kill you and the different zed's are scary and grotesque. The game even though old looks quite good. For the price of the game you get a lot of content. There's a lot of official maps and a lot of custom ones too so you can keep playing. With friends this game is extremely fun. The game is also quite challenging and you will need to work like a team if you want to survive. The game let's you choose from different classes like Support specialist who uses shotguns and can weld doors faster than anyone, medic who supports the team when they need a heal, sharpshooter who uses pistols and rifles and inflicts more head shot damage and others which suits all play styles. There are a couple problems like a lot of bugs and a very unfriendly community, but there are some gems. Overall this game is incredibly fun and if you don't own it, you need to get it straight away.

all of the other zombie-focused first-person shooters, Killing Floor stands out for a number of ways. For one thing, the level of gore is plenty. Flying limbs, exploding heads, mutilated corpses, and blood aplenty makes Killing Floor a visceral and bloody treat for the eyes. Second of all, the soundtrack is completely hardcore, full of rock and metal tracks that match the action in the game. Thirdly, the online community is great. In comparison to most other games, Killing Floor is full of players who are respectful, nice, and helpful to new players. Lastly, and most importantly, the shooting is perfect and the gameplay is addictive. It's full of powerful weaponry and factors that make every shot count. It's tight, responsive, and fun, especially when ZED Time activates. Plus, it's highly addictive, with those \"Just one last match\" moments that turn into hours and hours of playing. On top of that, Killing Floor looks and sounds really good, and comes with plenty of content for offline and online play. It's a game that gives more than $20 worth of content, and is the essential game that people need on Steam.","timestamp_created":1433037884,"timestamp_updated":1433037884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521664619445800781","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16079471","author":{"steamid":"76561198099641571","num_games_owned":264,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":1427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1313,"last_played":1470151352},"language":"german","review":"Damals hat es weniger gekostet.","timestamp_created":1432999839,"timestamp_updated":1432999839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16079100","author":{"steamid":"76561198034949300","num_games_owned":385,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":509,"last_played":1441380821},"language":"english","review":"I LIVE, I DIE, I LIVE AGAIN.","timestamp_created":1432998672,"timestamp_updated":1432998672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16078825","author":{"steamid":"76561198136642455","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1457086661},"language":"russian","review":"Норм мне пойдет","timestamp_created":1432997717,"timestamp_updated":1432997717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16077515","author":{"steamid":"76561198125756190","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1,"last_played":1432310576},"language":"russian","review":"Игра норм, но не стоит 10 баксов","timestamp_created":1432993005,"timestamp_updated":1432993005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16075790","author":{"steamid":"76561198154163994","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":2221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1642,"last_played":1480782269},"language":"russian","review":"Игра оч классная, когда играешь за снайперов, то ты наносишь с хеда over 9000 dmg.\n10 хедшодов из 10","timestamp_created":1432986114,"timestamp_updated":1432986114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520760536193847656","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16070412","author":{"steamid":"76561198010236275","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":3110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3110,"last_played":1428903578},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor is a pretty good co-op FPS with qualities reminiscent of of Left 4 Dead, but distinguishing differences; where L4D sees cooperation in its core mechanics, Killing Floor relies a little more on perks to distinguish player strengths and weaknesses, establishing each player's team roles in any given situation. The end result is a very coop-oriented gameplay, that also ends up making each player feel a little more individualized.\n\nAs with any coop experience, Killing Floor is the most fun when you have friends you know using voice chat. There's a good deal of strategy and tense situations to be had in this game, so it's a good way to spend a Saturday night.\n\nI will say that I'm not fond of the leveling up system, because nothing really changes strategy-wise as you move up the ranks. The core is good though, and if you're just looking for a friendly coop game where you're shooting zombies, there aren't many better contenders.","timestamp_created":1432959725,"timestamp_updated":1432959725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516828298568725586","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16068273","author":{"steamid":"76561198127654345","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":592,"last_played":1521341666},"language":"english","review":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1432947825,"timestamp_updated":1432947825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16066965","author":{"steamid":"76561198170037901","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":614,"last_played":1641521574},"language":"english","review":"best game out their. i love just how you can explode zombies using a machinegun while you run amok inside of hell! i had the free 2 day trial, best 2 days spent on steam!","timestamp_created":1432941578,"timestamp_updated":1432941578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16065616","author":{"steamid":"76561198108629361","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":729,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":656,"last_played":1432493440},"language":"brazilian","review":"Apesar de se um jogo bem antigo consiste em ter uma jogabilidade incrivel apesar de sua dificuldade em alguns casos.","timestamp_created":1432935963,"timestamp_updated":1432935963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16063261","author":{"steamid":"76561198128275896","num_games_owned":826,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":775,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":316,"last_played":1475762616},"language":"english","review":"Funny Game,Get alot of stuff inside Like Slow-mo  kill and Insane Shotgun,but DLC cost a lot :/. 7/10-SITN.","timestamp_created":1432927827,"timestamp_updated":1432927827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528301894664764404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16058311","author":{"steamid":"76561198097800694","num_games_owned":801,"num_reviews":78,"playtime_forever":280,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":280,"last_played":1420309311},"language":"japanese","review":"サイレンちゃんに萌えるゲーム。\n君も彼女の黄色い声を聴けばたちまちサイレンちゃんのファンになってしまうだろう。","timestamp_created":1432911476,"timestamp_updated":1432911476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.398101657629013062","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0r6L0M0Cd/ygPQ=="}
