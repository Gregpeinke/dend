Don't get me wrong, it's a great game and if you liked the first you'll love the second, but some of the puzzles felt a tiny bit...  well...  fillery to me.  Then there are a few that made me want to throw my computer against the wall in frustration.  But a good puzzle SHOULD taunt the player a bit.  The solution should be JUST out of reach.

Makes zero sense and feels like help only small children or really absentminded people would need.\n - A magical help rotates and puts you at the precise middle of each portal you go through (removing all sideways momentum in relation to the portal, so you no longer can fall into and come out of a portal at an angle)\n - No exploration allowed since you can only put the portals on pre-assigned spots, of which there are only very few. So essentially there is a straight line path for you to walk on and view the beautiful areas from. Big disappointment.\n - All puzzles are trivial because of there being only an extremely limited number of places to put your portals. So few, that to solve any puzzle, you just walk in, look around, and then almost instantly see the solution to them all.\n - The physics are broken if you don't want the annoying help. As in it no longer follows basic physics principles of the normal world thereby making some puzzles impossible. Normal physics dictate (like in Portal 1) that speed and angle going in equals you flying out with the same speed and going at the same angle. This is no longer true in Portal 2 since you only ever fly directly out the portals (again, no explanation given why the portals no longer just are two sides of the same hole). In essence this means, that if you have any sideways motion (in relation to the portal) going into a portal, your speed out will be your speed directly towards + your speed sideways to the portal, which just makes no sense.\n - So to recap the above: some puzzles are absolutely impossble if you don't let the magical help essentially play the game for you. You are only there to plop down a few portals and then let the game play itself.\n - Physics of the world is broken too. You can paint with magical speed reversing paint and put a portal on it, which sounds cool and it should be. But for some reason the portals have a border that you can hit even though logic dictates, that either you hit the ground or you fall through the portal, which is just a hole. But no, you hit a magical invisible border in stead making you just stand there in stead of bouncing up or going through the portal. Again, you need to let the game play itself to avoid this.\n\nTL;DR:\nGame has departed from the basic tenent of simply being fun with normal physics since physics no longer follow normal rules. It's so easy as to be trivial and you are not even allowed to explore the otherwise beautiful areas.","timestamp_created":1471711696,"timestamp_updated":1493573587,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.385954052209854126","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25034128","author":{"steamid":"76561198202096691","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":471,"last_played":1479235719},"language":"turkish","review":"Hiç düşünmeyin bu oyun indirimdeyse alın geçin.Beğenmezseniz sizde sorun vardır.\n","timestamp_created":1471705275,"timestamp_updated":1471705275,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25033623","author":{"steamid":"76561198028134949","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":868,"last_played":1468056763},"language":"english","review":"This is Portal 2.. who reads review to make his decision of buying this game?","timestamp_created":1471703689,"timestamp_updated":1471703689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25032543","author":{"steamid":"76561198096240908","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":283,"last_played":1569916919},"language":"schinese","review":"8.5/10\n非常出色的一款游戏，想玩就玩一关，不想玩也就放着，不会想去删掉；\n虽然游戏模式上简单，但是玩起来却要动脑筋，耗时间，还可以和朋友一起想想；在现在半成品游戏这么多的情况下，想到这款如此纯粹的游戏，我只能说我湿了。\n强烈推荐。\n虽然也许G胖子还是不会数3。","timestamp_created":1471699765,"timestamp_updated":1471699765,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25032289","author":{"steamid":"76561198053993573","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189,"last_played":1562939815},"language":"italian","review":"Bella storia segreta nascosta dietro al gioco","timestamp_created":1471698782,"timestamp_updated":1471698782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25031462","author":{"steamid":"76561198198702107","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1826,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1283,"last_played":1609547309},"language":"russian","review":"Portal 2 очень интересная и запутанная игра и испытания подобраны под разных людей.Там где один тупит 2 недели, другой может пройти за пять минут.
