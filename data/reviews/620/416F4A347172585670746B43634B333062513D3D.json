Po chwili okazuje się, że Chell spała przez ostatnie kilkaset lat w komorze hibernacyjnej, kiedy to cały budynek badawczy Aperture Science ulegał destrukcji. Wraz z nowym kompanem próbuje ona wydostać się laboratorium. Po krótkim czasie docierają do finałowego poziomu znanego z pierwszej części Portala, gdzie odnajdują GlaDOS. Niestety na skustek zupełnego przypadku zostaje ona uruchomiona. Pełna wściekłości GlaDOS, pamiętając kto doprowadził do jej wcześniejszego uśpienia, postanawia dać głównej bohaterce drugą szansę – wszystko dla dobra nauki.\n\nTak też rozpoczyna się właściwa rozgrywka Portala 2, która może trwać nawet do 8-9 godzin. Nieprawdziwe, są więc doniesienia graczy o krótkim czterogodzinnym wątku fabularnym. Oczywiście przechodząc grę kolejny raz, gdy znamy już wszystkie rozwiązania zagadek, jest to możliwe, lecz za pierwszym razem nie ma takiej możliwości (no chyba, ze jesteście geniuszami!)\n\n \nWraz z rozwojem fabuły, nie będziemy ograniczać się tylko do sterylno-pedantycznych, chłodnych poziomów, konstruowanych przez GlaDOS. Odwiedzimy np. starą część Aperture Science z lat 60', gdy to prowadził ją pierwotny założyciel firmy – Cave Johanson. Dzięki tej wycieczce dowiemy się też kilku interesujących informacji dotyczących m.in. tego, że Portal oficjalnie należy do uniwersum Half-Life'a, a w latach 60' centra badawcze Black Mesa i Aperture Science mocno ze sobą konkurowały.\n\nPrócz trybu dla pojedynczego gracza, w grze znajdziemy również co-op, który rozszerza grę o kolejne sześć godzin. Oczywiście rozgrywka w nim jest fabularyzowana i ściśle łączy się z końcówką gry. W tym trybie możemy się wcielić w jednego z dwóch robotów testowych o imionach Atlas i P-Body. Jak działa tu kooperacja? Każdy z robotów posiada swojego Gravity Guna, który może otworzyć maksymalnie dwa portale – odpowiednio niebieski i pomarańczowy dla Atlasa, i czerwony i żółty dla P-Body. Zagadki konstruowane przez GlaDOS są oczywiście bardziej wymagające - w końcu co dwie głowy to nie jedna. Do co-op'a dodano także trzy ciekawe mechanizmy: pierwszy, to specjalny system oznaczania, pozwalający pokazać naszemu kompanowi co, gdzie i w jakim miejscu ma ustawić/przestawić/stworzyć. Drugim mechanizmem są gesty, dzięki którym wraz z naszym przyjacielem możemy przybić piątkę, odtańczyć taniec radości i tym podobne. Trzecim zaś jest możliwość podejrzenia co nasz kolega widzi ze swojej perspektywy.\n\n \n\nCo ciekawe, w Portalu 2, pierwszy raz w historii, gracze mogą pograć ze sobą online cross-platformowo. Niestety dotyczy to tylko posiadaczy konsoli PlayStation 3,komputerów klasy PC i Maców. Wszystko dzięki systemowi Steam, który trafił tutaj na konsole PS3 – tak więc nabijając sobie pucharki, również odpowiednio zdobywacie osiągnięcia na koncie „pary”. Do tego kupując grę Portal 2 na PlayStation 3 dostajemy wersję pecetową całkowicie za darmo. Jak widać Sony z Valve coraz bardziej zacieśniają między sobą więzi. Choć jeszcze nie tak dawno mieli oni olbrzymie poblemy z konwersją jakiejkolwiek swojej gry na system PlayStation.\n\nPortale to nie wszystko – z taką właśnie ideą musieli wyjść twórcy tworząc koleją cześć pecetowego megahitu. W dwójce dodano wiele ciekawych elementów utrudniających, jak i w jakimś stopniu ułatwiających/urozmaicających rozgrywkę. Nowością są min. niebieskie, przezroczyste ścieżki świetlne po których możemy chodzić, tunele grawitacyjne, które jak winda pchają nas bezwładnie w jednym kierunku, czy też; specjalne żele. Niebieski – odbijający, pomarańczowy – zmiejszający tarcie; oraz trzeci w kolorze białym – pozwalający nam tworzyć portale w każdym niemallże miejscu. Pod koniec gry te wszystkei dodatki łączą się ze sobą, tworząc arcytrudne zagwozdki, które zatrzymają nie jednego zręcznego gracza na kilka minut.\n\nPodsumowując - Portal 2, to gra która zmusza graczy do myślenia i swoistego kombinowania, a nie tylko ciągłego chowania się i naciskania spustu jak to ma miejsce w dzisiejszych produkcjach. Nie zawodzi ona również na żadnej płaszczyźnie (choć ekrany ładowania czasem trwają dłużej, niż przejście nie jednego poziomu). To co przykuwa do ekranu na te kilka pełnych zabawy godzin to przede wszystkim robocikowy klimat, świetnie napisane humorystyczne monologi, idealna animacja postaci, trudne zagadki, poziomy pełne szczegółów, czy sama GLaDOS. Valve udowadnia kolejny raz, że wie jak zrobić grę wręcz idealną, dopieszczoną do samego końca, taką do której nie będzie się można praktycznie w żąden sposób przyczepić. Portal 2 jest grą wyjątkową. Must have obecnego roku. Trzeba w to zagrać: „for science... you monster...”","timestamp_created":1483116706,"timestamp_updated":1483117109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.644420087337493896","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28834451","author":{"steamid":"76561198332675300","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1596073995},"language":"english","review":"A very interesting game.
