Half life это то с чего собственно и началась одна из самых популярнейших серий игр. В свое время игра была невероятным прорывом в истории компьютерных игр, и мир узнал кто такой Гордон Фримен.За всю игру Гордон не промолвил ни слова и безжалостно истреблял монстров, которые в результате неудачного эксперимента ворвались в наш мир.Когда я проходил эту игру впервые, то был восхищен потрясающим геймплеем, отличнейшей графикой и неимоверно затягивающим сюжетом. Помню как с друзьями после школы играли в неё в компьютерном клубе по мультиплееру, один на один, два на два и.т.д.Сейчас я уже воспринимаю Half Life как игру которая изменила многое как в игровой индустрии так и в моем понимании о компьютерных играх. В наше время она уже не так востребована как ранее, но в неё до сих пор играет множество геймеров по всему миру.","timestamp_created":1485939146,"timestamp_updated":1485939222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536159932613372803","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29615522","author":{"steamid":"76561198201426297","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1312,"last_played":1484788551},"language":"english","review":"This game is an amazing classic.

Господи, прошло уже 18 лет, а Half-Life до сих пор считается одной из лучших игр в жанре шутеров. Графика - по тем временам - верх реализма, сейчас же - лучше чем в доброй половине современных игр. Сюжет - простой до невозможности, но в то же время очень и очень интересный. Выбор орудий убийства - не обширный, но вполне хватит повеселиться от души\n\n10/10 расквашеных в кашу хедкрабов.","timestamp_created":1484933050,"timestamp_updated":1484933050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29367307","author":{"steamid":"76561198062701382","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1000,"last_played":1504568535},"language":"english","review":"I've known about the Half-Life game since I was just a kid but never thought anything of it. It was included in a game bundle I had purchased, one day I just booted it up out of boredom/curiousity. My initial thoughts were wow this is so much like Portal 1 and 2 (not realizing until a few minutes later it was Valve developed) which really held my interest. After playing the first chapter or two I was hooked. It was one of those games I couldn't put down (rare for me) and continued all the way to the end. I can't believe I never knew how amazing this game was and why the series was so popular.\n\ntl;dr Absolutely the best FPS (besides HL2) I have ever played.","timestamp_created":1484878307,"timestamp_updated":1484878307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29367137","author":{"steamid":"76561198173247890","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":100,"last_played":1533762371},"language":"english","review":"This game is fun.

Unlike other shooters where its a \"kill all who you see without a second thought\" this game is more puzzle than anything. Need to get to that door all the way up there?
