I recommend getting this because not only that it's a zombie game, but also because it has a feel to the game. The game doens't require high graphics card and it can handle mine fine. The game has a challenge to it and it gets pretty intense at some parts. The game has a slow mo to it so whenever the game goes to slow motion, you have time to get headshots and money. Overall, this game is fun and you should consider getting it for the price.

Okay technically it's mutants but they're pretty much zombies.\n\nYou are British.\n\nAnd you have a gun.\n\n\nThere's been a lot of games like this. Shoot the \"zombies\" while in a group. Killing Floor is one of the better implementations, and kind of uses zombies in a game well. It's a fad, and it has been for awhile, and it's really overdone. But it's not entirely without reason. \n\nKilling Floor can get away with a lot because it's deliberately tongue in cheek. Your character makes sarcastic remarks, and there's a sassy merchant who uses a lot of innuendo. My take on it is that she's not actually interested in you that way, and at some level she is trying to get you to buy her wares... but she does seem like a pretty nice arms merchant. And it's important to keep a good attitude during the Zombie Apocolypse. Especially if there's a bunch of big scary well armed men. That you just sold the arms to....\n\nAnd you may be giving ideas...\n\nGameplay has you picking from one of several roles, such as snipers (Is that infected big and scary? Take them out from far away), pyros (clear out groups. With fire), medics, and so on. Coordination is important. And it's essential in harder difficulties (I can't tackle those for one!)\n\nGood sarcastic fun.

It lets you, but there really isn't any fun in it. The fun is in working along side friends, or even new players, to survive hordes of terrifying zombies.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, I absolutely reccomend this game to just about everyone who isn't sick of, or scared shitless by, zombie survival games. The gunplay is solid, I have noticed next to no glicthes, and in the later waves, things can really get hectic.\n\nIn game you select a perk (to be gone over later). Once the game begins and you complete the first wave, you are directed to a shop that has opened up somewhere on the map to by weapons, armor, and ammo with cash earned from killing zeds.\n\nWhile there are DLC weapon packs available, you by no means HAVE to buy them ,as some are simply golden reskins of other weapons. Those that aren't, while adding interesting new weapons, by no means unbalance the game. The skin packs that are available make no changes to gameplay, as your character model doesn't change your stats.\n\nSpeaking of stats. There are multiple classes to chose from in the game, including: Commando, Marksman, FIrebug, Demolitionist, Support Specialist, Medic, and berserker. Every class can use every type of weapon, but each class also gets specific discounts on a TYPE of weapon, a well as boosts related to that waepon type. Aslo, you can level up all of your perks, no matter which one you are using in a game. For example if you are a medic, but you blow a lot of zeds up with grenades, that grenade damage will progress you demolitionist class. A rundown of each of these follows.\n\nCommando: This is your basic run and gun class. You get a discout on assault/battle rifles, and damange, accuracy, and reload speed bounses along side. The final class perk is the ability to reveal the invisible zeds at a  certain distance away from you. While this can be helpful, those zeds are normally easy to detect on their own. To rank up your commando perk, you must kill zeds with assault rifles, as well as get a certain amount of kills against a specific type of zed, the invisible ones. Overall this class is good if you like assault rifles, but I'm not really sure it's specialty skill is all that useful.\n\nMarksman: For the sniper in you. This class focuses on the use of high powered, accuracy based weapons. You get a discount on all sniper/DMR rifles, a bouns to reload speed, kickback, damange, and headshot damage to all of those weapons. Do NOT get this class confused as a \"camper\" class, because in this game, you CANNOT camp on your own, and even with your friends it isn't reccomended.\n\nFirebug: BURN BABY BURN! This class is based on flame weapons. you get a discount on all fire based weapons, increasded damage with them, as well as HUGE resistance to fire damage. That's all there is to say about this. (also, it goes great with the TF2 pyro skin that is unlocked by default...)\n\nDemolitionist: KABOOM BABY! Simple, you get explosives, and you blow stuff up. This class recieves a discount on grenades, explosives weapons, as well as the ability to carry multiple sets of pipe bombs for setting traps. there is also the bonus to explosive damage, and explosives resistance.\n\nSupport specialist: This class likes their shotguns. You recieve a discount on shotguns, as well as bonus damage, accuracy, and reload speed. the special thing about this character is a boost to welding efficency. all characters come with welders for welding and unwelding doors. welded doors cannot be opened, hence becoming impassible, but they also must be broken down before any zeds can get through, making it a good way to seal off one entrance to a building, hence funneling zeds into your perfectly planned crossfire. The support speicalst is faster and welding and unwelding, and his welder recharges faster than any other class.\n\nMedic: \"If you aint dead, I'll keep you that way\" This class is based on healing your allies. While every other class' grenade is based on a simple explosion, the medics grenade creates a green cloud AOE effect that damages zeds inside it, and heals your allies inside it. good for if your beserker is on the front lines. You also recieve a HUGE discount on medic guns (which is good, because those are the most expensive in the game). Medic guns allow you to fire healing darts at your allies from a distance. You also recieve bonus' to medic gun clip size, and damage. the other perks of this class include better body armor, healing recharge rate, and healing potentcy. Finally, resistance to damage dealt by the \"bloat\" special zed, which spits acid barf at you. (pleasant right?...)\n\nBerserker: CHAAAAAARGE!!!!! This class if your melee class. you get discount on all melee weapons, and increased damage. you also gain immunity to being held in place by \"clots\" the basic zed, which normally would grab a hold of you and keep you in place.\n\nThere you have it, a rundown of each class, as well as basic thoughts on the game. so, Grab your friends, grab your guns, and get killin!","timestamp_created":1385578567,"timestamp_updated":1385578567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7789085","author":{"steamid":"76561198026879905","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":5684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5626,"last_played":1546750555},"language":"english","review":"`","timestamp_created":1385577996,"timestamp_updated":1510723003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7789042","author":{"steamid":"76561198056537277","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4984,"last_played":1485708952},"language":"english","review":"foda","timestamp_created":1385577894,"timestamp_updated":1385577894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7788613","author":{"steamid":"76561198022965744","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":28453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27307,"last_played":1590320886},"language":"french","review":"Si vous aimez défoncer des spécimens qui veulent vous bouffer a coup de shotgun ,de lance-flammes ,de katana ,et tout un tas d'armes mit a votre disposition et qu'en plus de sa vous avez des amies qui son comme vous je vous promet que vous aurez aucun regrets a mettre moins de 20 euros dans ce jeu.","timestamp_created":1385576964,"timestamp_updated":1385576964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7788524","author":{"steamid":"76561197986236936","num_games_owned":427,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":8410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7451,"last_played":1480905779},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor is not the prettiest game I've ever played, the animations are pretty awkward and the movement feels awfully slow, but it is without a doubt one of the best games I own.

Perks are useful, if a little slow to upgrade. I've only managed to max one of 6 classes, the others all being just over halfway complete. The guns are powerful, accurate, and great fun to shoot. The continuous support of the developer has kept this long running game fresh and fun with new levels and weapons. DLC is a little overpriced but not necessary to enjoy the full game.
