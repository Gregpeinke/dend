This lead to a 150 hour experience of trying to get the cube into the ending hallway. Over the time that I wasn't playing it was constantly permeating my thoughts, wondering what to do next, it finally came to me, I needed to leave the cube on the button and walk to the elevator, this was scary for me because I have trouble exploring on my own. This still took around 10 hours walking into the walls constantly, but eventually, I made it into the elevator. Once I made it into the next chamber I fell into the pit with the cube, it took a couple hours of thinking about how I managed to escape the other pit, then I remembered that I have a portal gun, which again aided my escape from the pit. The next cube wasn't that bad, only taking me 20 hours to figure out how to do this, the solution of portaling over to the platform on the other side was incredible, the challenge of moving the cubes onto the button was tough because there was 2 cubes and 2 buttons but i got through it eventually. The difficult glass section right after this chamber was really tough, I'm not entirely sure how I did it but around 10 hours after I got there I accidentally did something that caused me to fall from the top of the top room. I then walked to the elevator taking me a couple hours. I'm currently in chamber 6 stuck, I have died to the energy ball around ~12,000 times within the last 245 hours, I think this is nearing the end of the game.\n\n**Edit 9 (1,082 hours 10/28/21): finally, continuing my playthrough of portal, i decided that I did want to go into 04, that internal debate lasted for around 35 hours, eventually when i started it took me 20 hours to find the cube, when i did find it, nothing got better, i got stuck in the pit for around 25 hours because i wasnt able to place portals, the issue was that i was holding the cube, so it didnt let me shoot. when i dropped the cube i was able to shoot, leading me to the top, next to the button. im heading to the elevator doors now, its been taking a long time.\n\n**Edit 8 (1,000 hours 8/2/21): after taking it in, i finally went into the elevator, i am currently still debating on starting the next chamber.\n\n**Edit 7 (968 hours 7/15/21): I was stuck in the pit for around 130 hours until i realized that I have a portal gun, in which, i placed a portal, this brought me up to the next area, this place had me stumped, i was lost and confused for around 45 hours, then I realized that i had the portal gun yet again. Once i realized yet again that I had a portal gun, i was able to portal over to the end, I realized that I was moving through this game too fast, so i decided to wait here for a few more hours to take in the experience.\n\n**Edit 6 (800 hours 6/1/21): To start, i am now in chamber 3, chamber 2 had me stumped for hours, to start, i didn't realize that i had to walk out of the elevator, to start the dialogue, i was awaiting Glados to aid me with information, telling me how exactly to start, it took about 13 hours until i decided to venture off on my own, once i did, the dialogue started. Honestly the rest of chamber 2 wasn't really hard, it took a few more hours, for me to realize that down the steps was where the portal opened, once i did, it didn't get any easier, as I didn't read how to shoot the portal, as it went away too quickly. This combined with me not knowing that i can only shoot on unobstructed white walls, i was in a pickle. For hours, I attempted to shoot through the hole that it starts out shooting at, this, was an issue, eventually, I built up the courage to attempt shooting the portal elsewhere, this brought me up to the next area, with a large wall with a door, I walked to the end, and went up the elevator. This is where I was stuck for a few hours, because i looked away from the door, when I actually looked back at the door it was opened, when i went through to the elevator i ended up in chamber 3, i actually fell into the pit and thats where i am stuck now.\n\n**Edit 5 (720 hours 5/10/21): I am enthralled at how rich the story is from this game, i managed to defeat the difficult moving portal puzzle at record pace, thankfully this only took around 50 hours of gameplay, i was stumped for a while, gazing at the portals, and for a few hours i got stuck behind the portal, now i am past that and have went through the electric wall, this was scary, however, i didn't die, so i am able to ride up to the next chamber, i think I'm pretty far in this game so far.\n\n**Edit 4 (669 hours 4/20/21): My friend just told me that you can actually walk through the electric wall, this was very misleading from glados, as she said that no items could pass through, judging by the fact that i am an item this makes no sense. Besides that, I am now in the elevator, is this near the end of the game?\n\n**Edit 3 (669 hours 4/20/21): I have now made it past the room with the box, however, there is an electric wall, I have no clue what to do now as glados said something along the lines of \"The Emancapation Grill will emancipate any items going through it\" this likely includes me, i have no clue what to do now and i dont know if thats what she said, as she said this 40 hours of play time ago. Please help, I am now officially stuck and need some help, please.\n\n**Edit 2 (at 615 hours, 4/9/21): I have placed the box on the button and am now puzzled, does anyone have any idea of how to proceed, thanks\n\n**Edit (at 581 hours, 2/28/21): I have now started portal, I am now passed the first portal, I am really excited to finally beat this game**\n\n**Initial comment (at 436 hours, 7/21/19): This game is amazing, so many hours of menu music, i think i'm going to start the game soon.","timestamp_created":1563772823,"timestamp_updated":1659403125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54220218","author":{"steamid":"76561198151552299","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1588973790},"language":"english","review":"It's portal - of course it's amazing!","timestamp_created":1563755557,"timestamp_updated":1563755557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54218347","author":{"steamid":"76561197998829258","num_games_owned":1086,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1563744548},"language":"english","review":"Pretty basic puzzle game where nothing interesting happens at all.
