Great! Everyone always praises the Quake games and i never really managed to get into them but maybe with this game i could figure out what everyone loved so much. Unfortunately this game is basically dead. Other then AI there isn't many people to play against. Most of the servers are really high ping for me anyways so the servers i can enter are limited. Even if i could join each and every server without having to worry about ping it wouldn't mean anything because only a handful of servers actually have bots in it. The others are just empty. So thats kind of sad but well is the game any good? I mean... Its not bad but its nothing awesome either. Imagine Half Life like the original except its a bit faster, you are stuck in an arena of some sort and you run around collecting weapons and ammo and shooting other players in the face. Its really meh.\n\n+A lot of weapons. Rocket launchers, shotguns, a crowbar, double barrel shotgun, some weird double barreled machine gun thing that fires really slow bullets for some reason?\n+The graphics and sounds are alright. Gameplay is pretty fun. Its like a slightly sped up Half Life. I think this is supposed to be somehow connected to the old Quake games but i never really played those so i wouldn't know. Gameplay is basically run around, collect things like armor, weapons, ammo and health and kill enemies. As the name suggests its a Deathmatch game so everyone fights for themselves. It can get pretty chaotic.\n+Most of the weapons suck and feel absolutely useless except for the rocket launcher. The rocket launcher is simply awesome. It does a shit ton of damage, you can boost yourself with it kind of like a rocket jump from Team Fortress 2 that concept probably originated in these older games but the first time i ever did rocket jumping was in TF2 so thats the one i'll use as reference. But yeah the rocket launcher does a lot of damage, can boost you and its incredibly fun to use. Rockets travel somewhat slowly so you need to kind of predict where your enemy will be by the time the rocket reaches him. That depends on range too of course you can just point blank fire these things too. Either way it feels awesome once you hit someone directly with a rocket from distance. The only downside would be its incredibly easy to kill yourself with it and it doesn't have enough ammo. Either way best gun. Every other gun is absolutely useless in comparison.\n\n+/- maps are meh. Nothing awesome, nothing awful.\n\n-Can't join most servers because of my high ping.\n-Basically dead player base.\n-Explosives are UNFAIRLY powerful. You really don't need any other weapon. A lot of health, armor and the rocket launcher with a lot of ammo is all you need. Now against real players maybe this won't work so well but i could only play in a single server against AI and i could kick their ass with this setup pretty realiably. If i can do it then you definitely can. Now on the bright side using the rocket launcher is incredibly fun as i said previously. However its so OP to the point where every other gun is just... not needed. Why would you use anything else? Just find where this thing spawns, find where its ammo spawns, find where the health and armor packs are and keep going between these places. Its just such a good weapon that everything else becomes absolutely useless against it. The only weapon that could somewhat counter the rocket launcher was some sort of grenade launcher. Using that thing was harder but it still fired an explosive. I think that might be the issue. Explosives are too powerful. Rocket launcher or grenade launcher doesn't matter. The only reason the rocket launcher is superior is because i had an easier time finding it and ammo for it and it was easier to use. Its just too OP man.\n\nIts not necessarily a bad game its just really meh. There is nothing to really praise but that doesn't mean its shit. It can be fun. I just think the rocket launcher is too OP and i have like 2 servers that i can play on. Every other server either has too high ping for me or has no players and no AI in it for me to fight against. This really isn't a game you need. If you get this from the Valve Complete Pack then great but on its own its really not a game you should purchase. If it had more players and better servers that i could connect to then i would probably give this a thumbs up.","timestamp_created":1658980514,"timestamp_updated":1658980514,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119511198","author":{"steamid":"76561199161971581","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":97,"last_played":1660393370},"language":"russian","review":"Квейк на максималках, если бы кто нибудь играл, и были бы сервера с норм пингом было бы оч круто, а игра то крутая, весит мало зато разнообразия дохера","timestamp_created":1658846410,"timestamp_updated":1658846410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119499488","author":{"steamid":"76561199050594270","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1658831020},"language":"russian","review":"классная игра\nбыла\nа сейчасу мерла","timestamp_created":1658831065,"timestamp_updated":1658831065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119364252","author":{"steamid":"76561198335411960","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1658640457},"language":"spanish","review":"mi infancia. el juego esta verdaderamente muerto pero siempre entretiene","timestamp_created":1658640503,"timestamp_updated":1658640503,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119323738","author":{"steamid":"76561198351056702","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":25,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1604342774},"language":"english","review":"it's a fun little game but there's almost nobody playing this, so you'll rarely experience a match above like 2 people.
