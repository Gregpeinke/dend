I absolutely loved it. It changed the fps gaming forever. I recently repurchased it having completed the, for me at least, disappointing Half-Life 2. The original Half Life is challenging and fascinating; its story has depth and unlike HL2, it is not just endless gunplay.  There are a number of elements here that make this game a supreme classic. I say that despite more recent great improvements in rendering and game physics. Now, sixteen years later, some of the graphics seem a little primitive – there is only three of four faces (and voices) that return over and over again despite having been killed several times over – but this is of little consequence when the game is so inventive.  \n\nLet me give a couple of examples: Exploring Black Mesa is a joy. It is vast and labyrinthine and you are given time and space to explore its dark secrets without constantly having to fight off enemies.  Often you can use stealth in order to progress rather than wading in all the time firing both barrels. Creeping up behind and dispatching an enemy without alerting his comrades takes skill and courage; sniping your opponents with the crossbow rather than getting into a bloody fire-fight is extremely satisfying.  The pace of the game is thus perfect. You are given time to breath before moving on to the next scenario. The story also is very well conceived.  This is very rare and certainly not the case for HL2. [Spoiler alert] You assume, as you work your way through the beginning of the original Half Life, that the soldiers are there to rescue you from the invading aliens. The first time I played it I was genuinely shocked when this transpired not to be the case (my naivety I suppose). This story also makes sense and more is revealed as you continue along its path. It is also hugely inventive. The alien land Xen is really alien. Gravity works differently here (very impressively) and the alien machinery bares no recognisable relationship to human machines – I’m thinking here about the butterflies flying to the beams to open the portal. This is amazing to look at and experience and makes travelling through and exploring this world a real delight. The floating islands (reminiscent of Roger Dene’s artwork for the Yes albums) are fantastic – in the every sense of that word.

Ein Spiel aus dem Jahre 1998. Lohnt es sich überhaupt so ein Spiel zu spielen? Ist die Graphik überhaupt zu ertragen?\n\nIn meinem Fall kann ich sagen: JA!\nWir spielen Gordon Freeman, einen Wissenschaftler in Black Mesa, als eine Alien-Invasion losbricht und kämpfen uns, zu Beginn nur mit einem Brecheisen (später mehr Waffen) durch die Alien-Massen. Und dabei wird auf die individuelle Weise von Half-Life die Geschichte erzählt. Keine Cutscenes, keine erklärenden Texte.

Why?\nCause it's amazing! Solid FPS gameplay, solid puzzling and good old 90's game difficulty.\nThis game, like many said already, is a MASTERPIECE!\n\n[b]You probably full of reading the pros so let me list the cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Shotgun is absolutely terrible even medium range. Get close and it is a beast of a gun.\n[*] Rifle's spread is insane, long range fights take 50 bullets instead of 15 in close quarters.\n[*] Pistol and Rifle ammo are shared, which removes significant liberty once you run out.\n[*] Probably a bug, the crowbar stops swinging after a first hit. Very bad killing Headcrabs.\n[*] Some things you must do are not that obvious, forcing you to check guides to progress.\n[*] Grenade throwing feels weird somehow. I only kinda got the hang of it at the very end.\n[*] Movement is slippery vs modern day games. Acceleration is also very high.\n[*] You cannot have more than two NPC's following you.\n[*] Army units are bullet sponges on hard.\n[*] Xen is frustrating for the lack of ammo.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Now for some pros I feel I must stress:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] You can save some colleagues and there are dialogs when they meet other friendlies.\n[*] The game is long, with a nice story stitched out behind it, which is told as you move on.\n[*] The player is mute. This is more of a preference than a pro, yet I'd say it fits brilliantly.\n[*] The game always introduces you to new enemies and situations with ease.\n[*] When you feel comfortable with certain enemies, the game throw you a new challenge.\n[*] You never really feel safe with sudden appearances of enemies in front or behind you.\n[*] You vs Aliens vs Humans in a three-way fight is very cool to have.\n[*] HD Pack to improve textures (I always play without though).\n[*] Has a Source remake named Black Mesa, yet it is still a joy to play this one.\n[*] Has easter eggs and the good old secret stashes, but not stupidly well hidden ones.\n[/list]\n\n\nIf you're \"Should I or should I not play?\" right now, do yourself a favor and try to play it. Because it's a masterpiece that has one of the highest metascores of all times and because you can't know if you like it unless you try it, right?

Half-Life is boring by 2015 standards.\n\nI got this game so excited to play it and was so disappointed. It's just outdated not for somebody who hasn't ever played it before. My friends who played it when it came out love it to death, but I just can't get into it. My bar is set higher, I guess. The action is really slow and the weapons are clunky.\n\nIt also never ends. Given, I was a bit bored, but I thought it was almost over and was excited to be done, finally. Then I discovered there were many more levels still to go! Parts were very good, but I found myself really bored playing it, and really hating that I was making myself play it just because of the fact that it was the legendary Half-Life. I think I have two or three more levels still to go... I'm not even sure. And I took a step back and asked myself: what is this? The things I'm doing aren't fun. They were not fun.\n\nSome specific complaints: There's a lot of tedious wandering around the confusing levels. The assault rifle seems to do no damage. There are many weapons, but I only used a few. There is not a lot of variation. The enemies take a lot of rounds to go down. Your vitals and energy being recharged is weird. There is not a whole lot of plot. The human soldiers are all played by the same voice actor, which is actually pretty funny. Dialogue is really cheesy in a game with such high standards. I got stuck a lot, making me very frustrated and upset and usually made me quit or look up the solution online, which is never fun. Big shoutout to my man, Big Mac Davis on youtube, for his level walkthroughs, I couldn't have done it without you.\n\nThis review is not meant to be an attack on Half-Life fans, it's just a perspective from someone that is probably shared by most of the people who have never played it before.\n\nIf you still want to play Half-Life, consider Black Mesa, expecially if you already have an application it'll work with. Look up Black Mesa! It is basically a redux of HL with enhanced visuals and gameplay. The story is identical.","timestamp_created":1425617159,"timestamp_updated":1425617159,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.291068375110626221","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14749107","author":{"steamid":"76561198154787905","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":485,"last_played":1605801383},"language":"spanish","review":"Una revolución, un juego que juegas en el 2014 (me los pasé hace unos mesos) y no te parece tan viejo","timestamp_created":1425584304,"timestamp_updated":1425584304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14746249","author":{"steamid":"76561198190725228","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":1657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":19,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1660493531},"language":"english","review":"Best Valve Game 99/10","timestamp_created":1425571767,"timestamp_updated":1425571767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518248140811920166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14744453","author":{"steamid":"76561198030049697","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1928,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":905,"last_played":1517148281},"language":"english","review":"I only just finished Blast Pit, and to be honest, I'm wondering, \"Why did I not play this game years ago???!!!\" If you love Valve, you WILL love Half-Life!","timestamp_created":1425563296,"timestamp_updated":1425563296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14743120","author":{"steamid":"76561198034539730","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":121,"last_played":1637421097},"language":"english","review":"classic! never gets old!","timestamp_created":1425555397,"timestamp_updated":1425555397,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14740077","author":{"steamid":"76561198092667430","num_games_owned":881,"num_reviews":407,"playtime_forever":394,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":126,"last_played":1588516658},"language":"turkish","review":"amazingggg","timestamp_created":1425530396,"timestamp_updated":1425530396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14736255","author":{"steamid":"76561198040221705","num_games_owned":557,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1425507745},"language":"english","review":"The first game of a new generation!

Hoje tenho todos os CD-ROM com excessão de CS, mas não pude joga-los devido a falta da CD-Key. *Sigh* \n     Esse ano decidi comprar o jogo na Steam e tive um bela surpresa, ele é melhor do que eu me lembrava. A história é certamente perfeita: complexa no entanto é executada de maneira simplória. Não existem cut-scenes no jogo para te atrapalhar, apenas dialogos e a bela introdução do jogo. Os personagens em sua maioria não são tão marcantes, mas trazem informações úteis pro andamento do jogo. Alguns são memoráveis como G-Man por exemplo. \n     A jogabilidade é totalmente simples. Fiquei meio invergonhado de ter feito o torturial da training room, mas foi útil no fim de tudo pricipalmente no capitulo 15: Xen. O Jogo marcou 1998 e marcou minha vida.

There is no denying that it had left a huge impact in gaming culture but does it still hold up to this day?\n\nThe answer is: Mostly\n\nThe game is great, a real blast to play. The story is menacing and top notch, the atmosphere is just fantastic and the pacing is really good. Now here is where I think the game is a little outdated. The combat I will admit is fun but I found it sometimes a bit jittery compared to something like Return to Caslte Wolfenstein which I played beforehand. It is still good combat but I was just spoiled with RtCW to fully enjoy it. \n\nThe puzzles I am honestly a bit mixed about. On the one hand they can be fun, I do remember some cool puzzles but other times it can get fustrating like with the platforming. There was this one puzzle where I had to activate a fan and use the fan to lift myself to get to the chute in the ceiling. I had to look at that one up. Am I stupid or is that just flawed game design? Please reply whether that kind of logic is viable?\n\nVisually it's nice whether you're using the HD texture pack or not. The music for what little there is pretty good and odd at the same time. I also encountered a couple of glitches such as missing sound and this one time I would just die by pressing this button.\n\nOkay so overall it is still great and I would recommend it dearly but there are just a couple of certain aspects I think people these days seem to sort of forget or forgive which is not a bad thing but I think we have to at least acknowledge their existence.
