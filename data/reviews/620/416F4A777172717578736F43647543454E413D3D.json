Portal 2 carries forth the the core likable elements from the predecessor in a charning, quirky sequel.\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\n\nPortal 2 is a sci-fi physics FPS-puzzle game taking place in a chronologically-ambiguous position in the Half-Life universe. Following the events unfolded in Portal, the sequel brings the faces old and new to the player between the continuity of the experiment courses. It has an entertaining cooperative mode to enjoy with a friend, and user-generated content from the \"Perpetual Testing Initiative\" that brings the inner mad scientist of the user to life with the ingame Puzzlemaker.\n\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\n\nTaking the place of the test subject \"Chell\" once more, the player accompanies her journey through the now-ruined Aperture Science facilities, meeting an old enemy and new faces along the way while solving the various puzzle challenges through the Enrichment Center's remains. The game also features some exploration of the past of Aperture Science, solving some possible loose ends and letting them know about the past of the lab complex. A dark humor-packed character development is noticeable between the messages left behind, and the new quirky characters introduced into the game.The co-op mode also reveals some details of Aperture through the portal experiment course between the two players.\n\n[h1]Singleplayer Mode[/h1]\n\nThe singleplayer mode is considerably similar to the first game's mechanics, though with a number of twists. New testing elements and various new puzzle-solving techniques make the player think, move and portal their way through the tests with trial and error, either involving the classic testing elements such as moving platforms, turrets and acid pits, or new elements such as lasers and redirection cubes, crusher plates, catapult plates, among others.\n\n[h1]Cooperative Mode[/h1]\n\nWithout some cooperation the players won't advance in this mode. (Literally. You really can't even get past the level selection if the players don't cooperate and play in such manner.) More advanced puzzle techniques such as timing and advanced portal placement are introduced with a fair amount of trust being in the hands of the partner player. The incompetence (or mischievousness) of either of the parts might end in hilarious failure results.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nUsing an upgraded Source Engine, the game is able to render great-looking environments at relatively low performance cost. Highly detailed testing environments, from the ruins of Old Aperture to the production lines of the upper facilities, you'll see yourself stopping for a few moments to admire the scenery on the areas with more visible attention to detail.\n\n[h1]Music and Sound[/h1]\n\nThe soundtrack of Portal 2 and its iconic eeriness, generally accompanied by the 'robotic' sounds inserted into the music tracks make Mike Morasky's work fit perfectly into the game.\nThe sound effects of the game, not unlike the soundtrack, are highly detailed. From the slight noises of the testing elements to the rampaging avalanche brought by things like crusher plates in the game, every sound aspect has a high level of detail.\nThe voice acting is priceless, the character dialogue (or, in most part, monologue) is now fitting to each character's personalities and role. Including names such as J. K. Simmons, Stephen Merchant and Ellen McLain, Portal 2's VA cast is noteworthy in that regard.\n\n[h1]Content Creation[/h1]\n\nAperture Science's Perpetual Testing Initiative -better known as the Ingame Puzzlemaker- is a tool both simple and intuictive to use. Simple controls and a range of elements available, the player can build test chambers to his heart's content with the tool. You can even export your maps to edit with the Portal 2 SDK, for further detailings like custom assets and elements.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nPortal 2 is worth picking up if you're a fan of puzzle games, sci-fi or some quirky humor. The co-op mode warrants some hours of fun with friends, and the puzzlemaker and user-generated content will assure you some extra replay value.","timestamp_created":1419739191,"timestamp_updated":1467956769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560278475284576416","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13654673","author":{"steamid":"76561198137447785","num_games_owned":707,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1423131596},"language":"english","review":"I

En parte por su mecánica de juego (heredada de otro juego más antiguo, pero muy bien traída aquí), en parte por atreverse a hacer un juego de puzzles, plataformas y acción SIN violencia por parte del jugador, pero en una parte muy considerable por la villana. GladOS, irónica y maníaca, una amenaza pensante dispuesta a exterminar toda forma de vida pero a la que no podías evitar quedarte escuchando, se convirtió en esa presencia permanente durante todo el juego que lo llevó de joya a clásico.\n\nVisto lo visto, parecía difícil hacer una secuela a la altura. Aunque la ya mítica cancioncita de los créditos dejaba la puerta muy, MUY abierta.\n\nPues bien, Portal 2 lo ha conseguido.\n\nHablemos de su jugabilidad, para empezar. Portal 2 retoma los puzzles con portales que tan bien funcionaron en la primera parte, y luego nos lleva tres pasos más allá con la inclusión de los geles. El resultado es un juego que encaja perfectamente en el universo de la primera parte, pero que hace que valga la pena haber pagado por una secuela. Y atención a la batalla final... Es al menos el doble de épica que en el original.\n\nAhora hablemos de los personajes. GladOS vuelve más oscura y ácida que en el juego anterior. Antes sólo intentaba matarte; ahora se ha vuelto mortalmente pasivo-agresiva y se dedica, literalmente, a insultarte durante prácticamente todo el juego. Pero ojo: insultos de alta gama. Por otra parte tenemos a Wheatley, un núcleo de personalidad neurótico y asustadizo que se convertirá en tu mejor aliado (a los que ya habéis jugado: dejad de reíros, coñe, que me los espoileáis). Y por otro, recién llegados del maravilloso mundo de las locuciones pregrabadas, Cave Johnson, fundador de Aperture Science, y su ayudante Caroline. De Cave Johnson sólo puedo decir que en versión original lo interpreta J.K. Simmons, y eso ya suele ser garantía de personaje interesante; de Caroline, no puedo decir nada... y no porque no haya nada que decir ;)\n\nPero para mi gusto, el auténtico punto fuerte de Portal 2 es... el argumento. Esta vez han conseguido darnos algo más que un juego de puzzles en el que sabes desde el principio que la voz que te habla no es trigo limpio; han construido una historia profunda, llena de giros y arraigada en los albores de la historia de Aperture, que nos lleva incluso a evolucionar psicológicamente a dos inteligencias artificiales. Una historia que nos mantiene intrigados y entretenidos, deseando saber más. Y eso, en un juego de puzzles, no es fácil. Eso sí: como es un juego de puzzles, todas las piezas acaban por encajar (y si no... prestad atención a la locución pregrabada del principio cuando dice con qué voltaje funcionan los núcleos de personalidad y quedáos con el dato).\n\nEn definitiva, Portal 2 ha supuesto una mejora muy sustancial con respecto a la primera parte. Yo recomiendo muy encarecidamente jugarlo. Con los altavoces puestos. Disfrutando del espectáculo.","timestamp_created":1419720762,"timestamp_updated":1419720762,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13649115","author":{"steamid":"76561198046576155","num_games_owned":385,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1067,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":742,"last_played":1451974541},"language":"russian","review":"Классика никогда не умрет!","timestamp_created":1419720064,"timestamp_updated":1419720064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488047808408737183","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13649061","author":{"steamid":"76561198114623945","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1540,"last_played":1592947614},"language":"english","review":"I hecking adore this game.

Skvělí humor, který tak nějak patří k téhle značce, se oproti minulému dílu dokonce ještě zdokonalil (pokud to vůbec šlo) a příběh je popravdě zajímavější než mnohé filmy . Další velmi důležitou věcí, kterou je třeba zmínit je podpora kooperačního režimu a především komunitní mapy. To byl skvělý nápad, protože hra tak má téměř nevyčerpatelný zdroj nových map.
