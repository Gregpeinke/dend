You play as one of four survivors in various movies (campaigns) about a zombie outbreak in North America.  The movies have a specific order and tell the story of the survivors as they make their way to the south. \n\n(Gameplay)\nL4D is a first person shooter that is all about awareness.  Listen for audio cues to know what your about to go up against and always keep your head moving.  All four survivors play exactly the same way with their only difference being their appearance/voice.  Their banter ads charm to the game and you will likely find a favorite.  They also alert you to enemy presence, making sound important.  The special infected require you to adopt different strategies and use all you tools to overcome them.  You carry one primary weapon with your secondary being the iconic 45.  You can also carry a throwable weapon for crowd control and pills for temporarily boosting your health.  Much of the tension in this game comes from scavenging for these items.  Should you go without a molotov or should you take the time to look for one?  Campaigns are made up of two to five chapters, each taking about 15-20 minutes to complete. Every campaign ends with a finale, where the survivors must defend themselves from two waves of infected as they wait for rescue.\n\nThere is a multiplayer component to the game with online matchmaking and LAN capabilities.  Play through every campaign with three other people or compete in versus.  In versus, four play as survivors and four play as the special infected.  The survivors play the game like campaign, except now the only special infected that spawn are those controlled by the other team.  In this asymetric style of verus (due to the abilities of the infected), coordination is key for both teams.\n\n(Design)\nEnvrionments are mostly static save for the occasional particle effects.  The game is dark to fit the tone and often times you will need to use your flashlight to aim.  Lighting effects are very good though, some of the best in a valve game in my opinion.  Enemy animations are great and the ambient sounds really ratchet up the scare factor.  There is nothing quite like your first playthrough of No Mercy.  Weapons sound great and reload animations are good as well.  \n\n(Final Comments)\nWhen asked what Left 4 Dead to buy, people often answer Left 4 Dead 2.  However, Left 4 Dead has a special place in my heart because of it's LAN party friendliness, which is where I first played it.  I recommend this game but if you want all that Left 4 Dead has to offer and more, you should consider buying the sequel.","timestamp_created":1408668222,"timestamp_updated":1408668222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11806568","author":{"steamid":"76561198083200501","num_games_owned":388,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":7727,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3378,"last_played":1636372447},"language":"russian","review":"Left 4 Dead была моей одной из первых и любимых игр на PC.

настоящее время уже никого не удивишь, написав обзор на данную игру. Но всё равно поделюсь своими мнениями и впечатлениями. В своё время Left 4 Dead произвёл фурор в игровой индустрии. Динамичный геймплей, режим кооператива, шустрые зомби, красивая картинка, которая и по сей день выглядит достойно. Настолько запоминающиеся локации, что спустя много лет, запустив игру, начинаешь видеть любимые места, где, когда то часами с друзьями проводил время. Играется и сегодня, причём с удовольствием. Лично мне нравится больше именно эта часть, чем вторая. Она более мрачная, ну и пусть что меньше миссий, чем во второй,- пофигу. Очень удачно реализовали режим от первого лица, который отличается от достойного наследника. Т.к в своё время, игру разрабатывали совсем другие ребята, а не Valve. Если Вы по какой либо причине упустили это творение, - срочно исправляйте ошибку ).\n\n9/10[/i][/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFoD4cwxT1U&index=3&list=PLqC1wVrxnL_rbKYmRvxejRUBF1PC-j98L\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz9QLELKszk&index=4&list=PLqC1wVrxnL_rbKYmRvxejRUBF1PC-j98L\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=297400303","timestamp_created":1407526161,"timestamp_updated":1418582496,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653964400291442871","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11603574","author":{"steamid":"76561198092153290","num_games_owned":301,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2565,"last_played":1464413237},"language":"brazilian","review":"Fantástico, o melhor FPS  com a temática que já joguei, é ainda melhor que o left 4 dead 2, recomendo :D","timestamp_created":1407517722,"timestamp_updated":1407517722,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.611413002014160156","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11602348","author":{"steamid":"76561198107067829","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12746,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1650,"last_played":1457080196},"language":"romanian","review":"RO : Un joc perfect, o grafică perfectă.\n\nEN : Good Game, realy nice graphics .\n\n","timestamp_created":1407511197,"timestamp_updated":1407511197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11596351","author":{"steamid":"76561198081771445","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3976,"last_played":1426326460},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшее во что играл 10/10\n","timestamp_created":1407468291,"timestamp_updated":1407468291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11595429","author":{"steamid":"76561198146766694","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":341,"last_played":1468375165},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores jogos de zombies que joguei, cheio de ação.

Left 4 Dead is a game originally developed by Turtle Rock Studios and later purchased and produced by Valve Software. the game is based on Counter-Strike: Source in a sense. you have the choice between 4 survivors (hence the name), each with their own personalities. a gameplay mechanic that has become common among games like this is a \"downed\" mechanic. if your health drops to zero, you don't immediately die. instead, you are downed. when downed, you are trapped on the ground with only your pistols with 300 temporary health until someone helps you. there are about 12 weapons in the game divided between 1 Pistol, 1 SMG, 2 Shotguns, 1 Assault Rifle, 1 Sniper Rifle, 2 Throwables, 3 Carryables, and 1 Mounted Minigun. there are 4 campaigns to traverse through (although 2 were added later for a total of 6), each with a completely different setting. there are also Special Infected in addition to the Common Infected in a similar manner as Resident Evil. there's the Boomer, a large fat zombie that vomits on you. it's vomit attracts a horde of infected. the Hunter is a zombie in a blue hoodie often crouching down. he pounces on you and tears you apart until someone gets him off. the Smoker is best known for the smoke he explodes into when he does. he has a long rope-like tongue he uses to drag his victims towards him. if he can't get a victim towards him, they may hang from the neck or become pinned against an object. the Tank, well, when you hear the word Tank, you probably think big and tough. this infected is the definition of giant zombie. he can outrun you at times, he can smash objects flying towards survivors, he can kill them very easily if downed, and he sends survivors flying towards their deaths if they are on a high place. he can also rip a giant piece of concrete out of the ground and throw it at survivors if he wants. his health is also pretty high. the odd infected out is the Witch. the Witch is a female zombie with silver hair and torn olive drab clothing. she is the zombie that makes loud crying noises. she is capable of instantly downing a survivor and can shred them quickly if nobody helps them. there are different settings and difficulties to choose from as well. i dare you to play Expert with just Pistols! hah! anyway, I hope my review helps. enjoy playing with your friends!","timestamp_created":1406946736,"timestamp_updated":1564762137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11512285","author":{"steamid":"76561198106144829","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":8203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1150,"last_played":1659085511},"language":"english","review":"Very good game with terrible and worthless bots :D","timestamp_created":1406929408,"timestamp_updated":1406929408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11508173","author":{"steamid":"76561198033176563","num_games_owned":336,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":27,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Quite good, only played 30mins as I prefer L4D2!

It is an excellent game. It is one-of-a-kind in that it has no learning curve, a great, replayable set of storylines, witty characters, and forced cooperation. \n\nThe game is different in that it turns the play into a movie that you create. There are movie posters showing the cast (the players) in an action shot, just like any real movie would have. There are ending credits, and it has various ways to make it feel like a movie in game (You learn about many of them in the developer commentary). \n\nThe first thing you do is jump into a game with 3 other people and die. A lot. But if your team mates help you, you become proficient rather quickly. There is no tutorial or level one. You join a game that experienced players may or may not be able to handle, and you learn to play. They don't coddle you. \n\nYou can't just shoot at anything that moves, either. You have to think before going rambo on the horde. There are special infected, such as boomers and witches, that often screw you over when you shoot them. It introduces a level of thinking to an already strategic game.\n\nThe game combines the great things in singleplayer games with those of multiplayer games. It has a plot. Well, many plots. They are all separate, but they loosely combine to create the overall storyline of the game. However, it is completely unnecessary to play them in order. They exist as standalone campaigns that many people never assosiate to eachother.\n\nThe game has almost endless replayability, as The Director, the games master AI, makes it different every time. There are different dialogues the characters may have, many humorous or relatable. In one small scene involving the characters talking to a person in a church, 25 different dialogues can play out. The characters have strong personalities, and you really get to know them. It all feels very close to home.\n\nThe game forces cooperation on the players. If one person makes a bad move, everyone's ass can get burnt (quite literally in some cases). Also, there are many things that happen, such as being incapacitated or dangling off a ledge that require a team mate's help, or you will die. No questions asked. \n\nThe game also has a lot of content, with 6 different campaigns (Thanks to the Sacrifice DLC) in both campaign and versus mode. They are not small, and are split up into many stages. There are also 20(?) survival maps that you can play. This all combines for nearly endless play time.\n\nThe game also rewards curiosity. Players who explore may find new supplies to help them on their way.\n\nYou can leave your computer without leaving the game. You just go idle, and a bot takes over your character while you let your pet in or burn your hands getting your last pop-tart from the toaster.\n\nMany people will tell you just to buy Left 4 Dead 2. While I have not played my copy yet, many other arguments I've heard are that Left 4 Dead 2 changes many of the original maps, and that it ports in the versus versions of the maps, not the campaign versions. This leads to a very different feel. Also, it includes all the left 4 dead content - which means more weapons that may ruin the feel, and more special infected which may ruin the game for some. Also, I assume the achievements wouldn't be there. I've also heard that the characters aren't as good or lively.\n\nEither way, it's a great game that I will always recommend to my friends. Sorry for the long review, but this game just stands out from the rest to me, and I had to try and get new players in. My only complaint is that not enough people play. So you can be the change! Buy this game, it will be worth your while. I promise.\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1406761330,"timestamp_updated":1406761330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11484066","author":{"steamid":"76561197997816612","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":45,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45,"last_played":1406606597},"language":"english","review":"Same boring crap over and over and over and over.

Now, most games usually have a small time period where they introduce the characters and the setting and such... This game does not do that, this game throws you into zombie infested locations and tells you to somehow cross the map without being brutally murdered. Sometimes I do wish this game had a more Story-Driven... you know, Story mode. But that is about the only thing I can complain about.\nTHE GOOD\n~Very Intense\n~Great Enemies\n~Awesome Level Design\n~You Can See Your Feet!!\nTHE BAD\n~No Real Story\n~Limited Weapons\nTHE FINAL OPINION\nOverall, this game is still great, even in 2014. It may lack a Borderlands level of weapons, And may not have the most detailed story, But L4D is probably the best zombie game ever made. 8.75/10","timestamp_created":1406330855,"timestamp_updated":1406330855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45bv2t8cCc+jDKw=="}
