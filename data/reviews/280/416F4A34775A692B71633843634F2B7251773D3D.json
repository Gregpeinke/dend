This is a port of the original Half-Life to the Source engine.\n\nThe gameplay is varied, containing combat, puzzle solving, and platforming. The story is interesting; however, the player must pay attention in order to get some of the more obscure plot points. There is plenty of enemy variety and a large number of weapons to use against them.\n\nThere are a few negatives: the platforming can require many attempts to get past certain sections and there is a large difficulty spike near the end.\n\nThe differences between Half-Life and Half-Life Source are improved water graphics and physics, the addition of ragdoll physics, better lighting, and 3D skyboxes.\n\nOverall Iwould give this game a strong recomendation of

\n1、加入了物理引擎，虽然物理引擎不能帮助你花式过关，但是让游戏增加了不少乐趣——比如  把陆战队用弩钉在墙上晃来晃去  用手雷把尸体炸飞起来......箱子和油桶推拉起来的手感趋近于半条命2  而且舒服很多\n2、新增了半条命2里的音效......比如砸玻璃的声音，撬棍砸金属物品的声音...等等等等   半条命2前段时间刚通关了一次...导致了听到这些熟悉的打击声音甚至让我在误以为玩半条命2...   感觉挺奇妙的\n3、武器手感变化，最直观的是mp5，感觉更真实了（虽然更不好用了，不过近战不错\n4、手电筒的光发生变化，变为和半条命2里一样的圆形光源了...在管道里匍匐的时候，开着手电筒

With less game breaking bugs and better textures.\n\nAt first when I started playing I didn't notice many different things as the game still looks a lot like the original Half Life. Apart from some different textures like the better models and water physics the game looks pretty much identical.\n\nMy biggest problem with the original version of Half Life was that the game was incredibly buggy. I encountered many game breaking bugs. This wasn't the case with Source. Apart from one chapter where I encountered texture pop ins, I didn't encounter much more.\n\nIn the end there's nothing more I can say about Half Life Source that I didn't say in my original review. It's a fantastic game and one of my favorite games to date. I highly suggest buying it if you haven't already and playing. \n\nNow which version do I recommend playing ? I suggest playing this instead of the original. But I do suggest getting the first one just for Opposing Force and Blue Shift. \n\nFinal Rating:\n8/10 - Worth Buying\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a like and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review. \n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","timestamp_created":1445891066,"timestamp_updated":1454103065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":79,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":"0.754514396190643311","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18696277","author":{"steamid":"76561198046549667","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":654,"last_played":1570679221},"language":"english","review":"I bought this game in source so i could get the textures for Gmod.

It's one of the few games that I remember playing, [b]and[/b] completing during that time. I would recommend Half-Life to anyone who hasn't played it, but for those who have, it just doesn't hold up over time. It's just not the same as playing it back in the 90s. Then again, many things aren't.\n\nThis source version of the game, doesn't do anything for me. The graphics are better, but that makes the game... \"less scary\". There is way too much lighting. Areas that used to be dark, and spooky, are now brightly lit, and the emenies aren't scary at all, because the newly done models, just don't have the same effect as the older, darker models.\n\nI remember nearly running from the room when the game originally came out, because it was just too scary. The new graphics, and brightly lit models, just put me to sleep.\n\nI find this source edition to be even less interesting, because it gives you instant access to every level in the game. So there is no challenge anymore. There is no reason to play the game from the start (there is no reason to save), because you can just pick any level you want, and start there. That might be fun for some people, but as soon as I saw that was an option, I was instantly turned off. Sure, this is an [b]option[/b], and you don't [b]have[/b] to play it that way, but just due to the fact that the levels are all open, is a turn off for me.\n\nIf you're looking for this game, because you think it's going to take you back to the 90s...

Everyone knows that. I don't need to bother describing Half-Life's gameplay in any detail. Long story short, I loved the game then and I still do. Its influence on the industry is virtually unparalleled and indirectly led to the creation of Steam in the first place!\n\nHowever, Half-Life: Source is a disappointment with a misleading title. I say \"misleading\" because having already played Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source, I expected this game to be a full HD remake of the original, with proper models and textures. Instead, all we got was the original 1998 models and textures running on the Source engine. We didn't even get the polygonal upgrades that Half-Life Blue Shift received. Sure, the physics and lighting are modern, but it's hard to notice when everything else is blocky and jagged. It makes this game seem pointless especially when the original 1998 game is still available and has a much larger community. \n\nIt's such a shame - I'm sure this game would've made a killing selling at full price if it were a proper HD remake. At least I didn't directly pay for this game - I got it as part of a much larger bundle.\n\nFortunately, not all is lost. The Black Mesa: Source mod (which I've played) has done what Valve failed to do - remake the campaign with proper HD graphics. Either play that game, or stick to the original 1998 game.

It starts of strong with and immersive experience and the best intro for a video game in my personal opinion. But I have to note that the last missions in Xen are the weakest missions in the game and a painfuly difficult boss fight with an ending not worth the struggle at the end, the ending leaves you asking more question than you did at the begining of the game but the Half-Life series is known for that.

Auch heute spiele ich es noch mindestens einmal im Jahr durch. Dementsprechend aufgeregt war ich damals, als es hieß, es käme eine neue Version auf Basis der Source-Engine. Ernüchternd war dann das Ergebnis: Anstatt dem von vielen Fans erhofften HD-Remake in dem Stil, was heute mit \n[url=store.steampowered.com/app/362890]Black Mesa[/url] spielbar ist, war HL Source leider nur ein Port auf die damals neue Source Engine mit nur wenigen Verbesserungen - vielmehr sogar vielen Verschlechterungen, meiner Meinung nach, denn es wurden u.a. auch Effekte aus Half-Life 2 wie das Wasser oder die zerbrechenden Glasscheiben übernommen, das Ragdoll wirkt seltsam und am schlimmsten: Teilweise auch Soundeffekte, was meiner Meinung nach ziemlich die Atmosphäre und das Feeling des Ur-Half-Lifes stört. Wenn ich jahrelang eben dieses Spiel gewohnt war, wirken diese Sachen einfach deplaziert und seltsam.\n\nIch persönlich bleibe lieber beim Original, oder wenn ich Lust auf die Source-Version habe: Black Mesa.","timestamp_created":1442085153,"timestamp_updated":1442085153,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":39,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.718859016895294189","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17984796","author":{"steamid":"76561198123645826","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":63,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":62,"last_played":1463341018},"language":"polish","review":"Gra nie różni się od oryginału niczym, oprócz silnika source.
