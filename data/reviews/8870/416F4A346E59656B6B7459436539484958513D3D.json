Totally mind-blowing if you ask from me. It ranges from Rainy Seashore to up the skies in the Floating City, and all the way down to deep bottom of the Ocean. And the best part, you don't need very powerful computer for this game to funtion properly. I played with the 2nd lowest graphics, had my fps constant, and still was stunned by the beautiful views. \n\nApart from landscape, the gameplay part is absolutely well-made.\nThe gameplay contains mainly shooting and puzzles.\n\nThe weapon models look really nice, and there are no bugs at all with animations.\nSome of the guns barrels even turn shining red from heat caused by constant shooting.\n\nYou can blow your enemies up with RPG, shoot them as full of holes as Swiss Cheese,\nAbilities that you can use to turn your enemies into piles of ash, or to skyrocket them million miles away.\nOf course you don't need to always kill everyone. The game let's you choose most of the time whether to shoot or to stay in stealthy mode, looking out for threats and staying in shadows.\n\nThe characters are easy to identify with.\nYou just want to sit and keep playing, because the story is so entertaining and addictive.\nYou want to see what's next, what is behind the next corner, what kind of enemies will you face.\n\nAnd, to be honest, there are merely no games without any bugs nowadays.\nI am talking about visual bugs, possible glitches and getting out of bounds.\nThe bugs i got never killed me or prevented me to continue my adventure.\nFor example, sometimes NPCs walked on places where they shouldn't have walked, Like on walls.\n\nBut if you're into that kind of stuff, like i am, you're gonna find yourself going to places you were not supposed to go, and trying to find your way inside buildings, or outside areas, where you never was meant to be at.\n\nWhen i realized the credits were about to roll, i was a bit disappointed about the length of the game.\nIt took me 14 hours to complete all the side missions, and main quest.\n\nIt's not a long game, but it's very enjoyable. There's a lot of replay value too. Personally, that was one of the best Singleplayer shooters i've ever played. Totally recommended.\n\nThanks for reading, hopefully this helped.\n\n-Nate","timestamp_created":1469890507,"timestamp_updated":1469890507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":51,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.788977563381195068","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24615993","author":{"steamid":"76561197979993993","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":712,"last_played":1501257222},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is one of the most surprising games I have ever played.

You can tell that there was an enormous amount of thought put into every detail, down to the very last corner. Bioshock Infinite is my favorite game to date, no question about it. \n\nTo start, the art direction is very good. Everything is arranged to be very appealing, and the colors are very balanced. I loved just walking around the city and soaking it all up. There are 1912 style shops to go into, and they are all populated. In one area, there is even a good, three-minute quartet that you can just sit and listen to. I was very impressed with the magnitude of everything. Seldom are you placed in a small, dark room or hallway. Most of the game is set in colorful areas with large statues and airy buildings. \n\nI liked that it didn't actually put you in the dark, but gave a dark feeling when it was appropriate. As per the Bioshock games, some of the events are quite dark-- and I liked the uneasy feeling without the dark corridors of Rapture. \n\nCombat is a step up from other games in the genre. The introduction of \"skylines\" allows you to jump quickly from place to place, making everything very fast paced. I didn't quite like the inventory management as much as in the original Bioshock, however. I found it much harder to deal with my Vigors, mainly because you couldn't just scroll through them like in the other game. Still, you get used to it-- that's a fairly minor gripe. \n\nI can't really say much about the story. If I told you what was so great about it, I'd spoil it for you. I can say that it puzzled me, and it was a few hours after finishing the game that I worked everything out. I felt like some of the points were repeated too much though. I get that they try to help everyone understand it well, but I'd rather just have it all thrown at me-- that way it's more fun to work out on my own. \n\nOverall, Irrational Games has gone above and beyond what anyone expected. The only way you'd find this game worse than the original is if you're somewhat nostalgic. Even if you didn't like the first or second game, I really suggest that you still give Bioshock Infinite a try. As a side note, there are a few things that you won't quite understand if you skip the first game. They are little details, but in a game like Bioshock Infinite, it's those little details that really count.","timestamp_created":1469800692,"timestamp_updated":1469800692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24595681","author":{"steamid":"76561198096386388","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1950,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1920,"last_played":1524155436},"language":"english","review":"Amazing! 10/10\n\nBest single-player shooter game I've played in my entire life.\nPrepare to get jaw-dropped by the story.","timestamp_created":1469798267,"timestamp_updated":1469798267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24595367","author":{"steamid":"76561198129817618","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1004,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":887,"last_played":1519500172},"language":"english","review":"If you like films with twisted ends, you should try this.

Natürlich wären da natürlich ein paar riesige Meinungs Probleme, wie der Rassismus, aber ich beziehe mich hier alleine auf das ambiente, welches in den ersten 30 minuten des Spiels sehr überzeugt.

[/h1]《生化奇兵》是一个带着蒸汽朋克风格的幻想故事，本身带有强烈的政治暗喻。作为一部着力描写人性在欲望支配下扭曲和覆灭的游戏，《生化奇兵》系列带给玩家的不只是简简单单的关于主人公历经艰险最终战胜强敌的故事。在《生化奇兵：无限》中，游戏从阴暗的海底城搬到了明媚的天空城，游戏画面也从之前的昏暗压抑转变成了明亮鲜艳。但其中对于种种人性丑陋面的刻画并没有随着画风的转换而改变，反而变得更加入木三分，淋漓尽致。\n[quote=author] “不要认为游戏中的世界距离自己很遥远，其实天空城就在你我身边。一切不合实际的欲望都是由自己心中的嫉恨所导致，选择道德还是屈从于欲望从此沦为行尸走肉，选择权在你的手上！”\t[/quote]\n《生化奇兵：无限》有着极其惊艳的画面表现，初次见到“天空之城”的玩家必然会为眼前那充满童话色彩的景色所震撼，棉花糖一样的白云上漂浮着精致的建筑，横跨天际的铁轨上急驶着老式的电车，远处宏伟的雕像旁游荡着浮夸的飞空艇，回望身边，城市的人们全穿着得体的衣服，友善的微笑，过着无忧无虑的生活，一切都显得超凡脱俗、一尘不染……但这真的是人类该有的生活吗？眼前唯美的画面中隐隐的流露出一股让人不安的虚伪来。\n\n[h1] 一.游戏设定——10分 [/h1] \n《无限》的剧情是非常有野心的，极其的复杂和恢弘，充满了隐喻和反思，还出人意料的将该系列前两部作品包容了进去，最后的悲剧结尾也让整个故事显得更耐人寻味。但最大的问题是，这些都是我在通关之后，读了背景资料才弄明白的，在实际通关过程中，从中期开始我基本就已经陷入了巨大的迷茫之中，搞不清故事的发展了，[u] 《无限》在讲故事方面有着巨大的缺陷 [/u] 尽管这是个很出色的故事，但并没有让玩家以比较轻松的方式完全理解，不得不说是游戏较为失败的一点。一旦玩家搞不清故事的缘由，本就重复度很高的战斗将变得十分无趣。另外，故事基调从中期开始变得缓和。故事的展开是一点一滴的，并且游戏玩法往往复复，重复性十分高。有些故意拖慢游戏节奏的嫌疑\n游戏剧情设定在1912年，玩家由前作环境封闭的极乐城来到了巨大的浮空城哥伦比亚城。这所浮空城在美国崛起为世界霸主之初，被构想为浮空的美国梦标志，它由一群深深为之着迷的人们放飞到遥远的海岸上空。\n本该作为追求梦想的全新标志的浮空城，忽然在云端凭空消失，不知去向。玩家所扮演一名特工布克被派往消失的城市解救一名自幼便被囚禁在那儿的Elizabeth来还清自己所欠下的债务。但等主角成功接触到了Elizabeth并准备将她带往目的地的时候，事情发生了变故。两人不但受到当权者的追赶，还受到反对派追杀，而看守Elizabeth的那只机械大鸟也对两人穷追不舍，一路逃亡和战斗中，主人公慢慢发现原来事情远不是自己想象的那么简单......。\n入手之初，我觉得这特别像猥琐大叔去拯救受困萝莉的故事。但随着剧情深入和一些偶然，我发现游戏制作者在游戏中大大小小的地方埋下一些有深意带暗指的文字。从民主自由到对社会形态的批判。制作组也在游戏中发表了他们对政府对意识形态的独特理解，对民主自由表达了自己的看法。如果你注意到了这些，你会发现其实结局都是“意料之外，情理之中”。\n\n[h1] 二.游戏画面——9分 [/h1] \n整体画面鲜艳明亮而不油腻，虽然有些卡通风格，但这也更好的烘托了游戏所全力塑造的蒸汽朋克背景。\n相对前两代改变了忧郁的画风，游戏中到处一派和谐融洽的“美国社会”的缩影，人民生活在政府所编制和创造的美梦中，到处都是其乐融融的乌托邦。\n游戏中对细节刻画的非常到位，四处张贴着带有诡异风格的爱国海报，屋内的生活品和各种装饰摆设似乎也带有奇怪的感觉。\n制作组引入了一套全新的AI人工智能系统，所以在游戏中我们会看到不管是路人还是一些特定人物，他们会随着玩家的行动而做出应有的反应，比如当你靠近一对正在交谈的人时，他们会停止交谈而讲目光转向你。等你走后他们才会继续刚才的话题。\n女主Elizabeth作为一直陪伴在主人公身边的重要角色，她不再是让玩家不停保护的花瓶形象，她善良纯真，有着自己的喜怒哀乐，她会让旅程变得短暂、难忘。她会与场景互动，与男主进行应景的对话，表情、穿着也随进程改变。[u]  举个例子，男主进女厕，她会吐槽还会一脸不爽  [/u]战斗时也不会拖累玩家反而会给与你大量援助，这样神一样的妹纸，她居然只是一个NPC！\n\n[h1] 三.游戏音乐/音效——10分 [/h1] \n音乐部分为整个游戏的灵魂所在，当时的天空城被极为盛行的美国优越主义所主导，城内随处播放着导游浓烈的爱国主义色彩的音乐。虽然轻快阳光，但是听多了反而会有一种孤寂的感觉，隐隐产生只有天空城才是世界中心的感觉\n在音效方面，空中之城无处不在的风声，群众交谈声，嘈杂熙攘声，战斗时的交火声和技能爆裂声非常自然的融入在一起\n [b]  Perfect [/b]\n\n[h1] 四.游戏操作——9分

\n主人公右手持枪，左手释放技能，游戏战斗风格血腥暴力，同时玩家也会在游戏中“上蹿下跳”，各种挂索飞行，因此游戏虽然为RPG，但实际战斗效果流畅爽快非常出色。\n缺点是频繁的战斗并不像想象中的那么有趣，重复度非常的高。\n虽然玩家有很多的战术可选，但因为技能都简单粗暴，切换时还必须暂停游戏，所以在非特定情况下，玩家并不会有不断切换战术技能的欲望。基本确定了一种有效的打法后，就会长期使用。再加上技能升级费用很高，也极大限制了玩家后期的战术选择。\n\n[h1]

Infinite is a game that I tried to enjoy as hard as I can but failed. Same goes for the first game. But I've seen so many people saying that this game is on par with games like The Last of Us, Life is Strange or Uncharted 4; that it is a masterpiece and has a great story. So I decided to check it out and I had really high expectations. Don't get me wrong, I liked the idea and atmosphere at first but then it just became so boring that I found it hard to even finish the game. Story is mediocre and weird but I loved Elizabeth's character and that's what helped me to survive the playthrough. \n\nGameplay was only interesting for an hour or two. Several superpowers, weapons, a hook and a huge letdown called \"a tear\" which is basically like a portal but can bring in only few same objects into your aid. The map design is almost a straight line with no other options to choose from. For gameplay that's pretty much it and nothing more. Sure, there are collectables but why should I bother if everything else was a disappointment.\n \nOptimization was good and I really have to give props for beautiful and vibrant graphics, music and voice acting. I picked Japanese dub and it was spot on, don't know about other languages. \n\nSo was it enjoyable for me? Absolutely not. Should you buy this game? Maybe, as a lot of people love it but for me it's just an overhyped game.\n\n[h1]5.5/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1469607928,"timestamp_updated":1469607928,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.428228437900543213","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24551617","author":{"steamid":"76561198079088978","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2275,"last_played":1600715063},"language":"english","review":"Finally, Ken Levine gives you the power to use your left hand and right hand at the same time.

Единственно что в ней прекрасно - это сюжет, он тут охрененный, хотя местами немного все затянуто. Вообще, ощущения от этой игры у меня остались двоякие - с одной стороны вроде есть что-то, но с другой как-то все натужно. Вообще, в первые 30 минут игры я восхищался обстановкой в игре, атмосферой, казалось что все живые, но.... потом я осознал, что всем насрать что ты там вытворяешь, ты 5 минут стоишь рядом, на тебя не обращают внимания, ты пригаешь по бочкам - да всем насрать, это очень растроило.\nПоэтому, решил что надо просто пробежать сюжет. К 5-му часу игры меня задолбало все, боевка однотипная, толпа народу, но сложности, когда ты с Элизабет, бои почти не представляют. Ах да, за Элизабет отдельный плюс, у единственной лицо не деревянное, все остальные какие-то стремные, имеются ввиду женские персонажи. Но под конец я ОХ*ЕЛ от лихо изменившегося сюжета и от концовки, ради нее и стоит проходить игру.\nИгра достаточно интересная, но немного однообразная в плане геймплея.

While it's a bit unfair to compare it to it's older Bioshock cousins, Infinite doesn't bring in anything new to the table to a run of the mill linear single person shooter. You could probably argue having a competent and useful companion (she gives pick-ups from time to time) through the playtime might be a feature not seen before, but I digress.\n\nIf you're like me, you'll play the game once and never find a reason to pick it up again. It's a narrative heavy game and any choices you make are (for the sake of irony I'd guess) not actually important. With that one can reasonably say this is an expensive Telltale game.\n\nContrary to that, however is the simple fact that Bioshock Infinite is a very solid game. It runs very well for me and many of my collegues. The pacing is gloriously smooth and the progression is very intuitive. While everything may be indistinguishable from another shooter, I have to give credit that everything is done quite well and I never once felt like I was fighting the game itself.\n\nAll in all, it's no blockbuster, but it's worth a go if on sale.","timestamp_created":1469506752,"timestamp_updated":1469506805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24530381","author":{"steamid":"76561198085617995","num_games_owned":613,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":524,"last_played":1469771392},"language":"schinese","review":"可怜我的Mac居然一启动就闪退，只能换台电脑玩了。","timestamp_created":1469505980,"timestamp_updated":1469505980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24529728","author":{"steamid":"76561198044229786","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1245,"last_played":1640046269},"language":"english","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1469501444,"timestamp_updated":1469501444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511350750923156738","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24528155","author":{"steamid":"76561198128139363","num_games_owned":436,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":882,"last_played":1500286113},"language":"english","review":"This game is excellent.
