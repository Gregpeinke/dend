It's a puzzle game to say the least, but it also remains perfectly presented for those with a liking for quantum physics, all with a touch of dark humour. It's quite rare to see a Steam user with a huge game library that doesn't include Portal nowadays. Heck, this game was my very first purchase.\n\nYou awaken in the deserted Enrichment Center of Aperture Laboratories; a fictional science research corporation, located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Known for the creation of the handheld portal gun, as well as the heavy rivalry the complex has between the Black Mesa Research Facility. (The scientific complex focused in Half-Life. Half-Life and Portal both share the same universe.) in Portal, you play as the silent protagonist, Chell, from a first-person perspective as you are challenged to navigate through a series of cryptic chambers, all the while being accompanied by the voice of the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (GlaDOS for short.) which the idiopathic robot subsequently reveals the rest of the plot to the player, through various and long-winded narration throughout the game. And what is this reward you get for all this mind-wrecking work? Why it's none other than cake! \n\nWhile on the subject of sweet chocolate butter-milk frosting, assembled with maraschino cherries on top, this all turns out to be a deliberate and false sense of security, as you're sent to be burnt to a crisp by GlaDOS. As you narrowly escape death, you navigate through the many things that Aperture Laboratories would have wanted to keep as a secret to the rest of the world. You soon (or later, as this game has a way of messing with your head.) find yourself exploring the air vents, empty corners with obscure writings on the wall, the sewers of the facility, as well as the abandoned, deserted offices of those who mysteriously left the complex, along with empty food supplies and crude drawings that uncovers a much darker history of the laboratories.\n\nWhat strikes me most surprised is this game's ingenius concept and profound knowledge of linear momentum and physics. Your only weapon in the game, if you can call it a weapon, is the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. It's main and only ability is to create two distinct portals, an orange and blue portal, which both create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in three-dimensional space. Keep in mind that neither portal are both an entrance or an exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. This unique concept will soon be taken to the test, as you explore, solve and escape through 19 mind-wrecking chambers all the while keeping your distance both far and dangerously close to heavily armed turret bots.\n\nBut, you're not alone in this deranged prison of a laboratory, your square-buddy (and probably only buddy.) known as the Companion Cube, will accompany you throughout a few of these chambers, as it has a handful of most needed traits; involving you using it as an extra step for those hard-to-reach places, using it as a shield against deadly laser spheres and deflecting them into switch mechanisms, and even going as so far to hold out weight-activated button switches. Sadly, with every chamber completed thanks to your Companion Cube, you will have to eventually abandon it and leave it for trash, in the Emergency Intelligence Incinerator. What a true friend to the end!\n\nWhen cracking down to the lifespan of this game's story, it's actually pretty short. But, with each new chamber you progress through as well as the difficulty beginning to rise at a much faster pace, the longer the chambers will begin to mess with your head and could leave you stuck for a good couple of hours, completely stumped. I'm guilty to say that I even needed a guide to deal with a couple of these cryptic and twisted chambers. But then again, that really ruined the experience for me a little, considering I like to figure things out much more independently. So, if you can unwrap things around your mind quick and efficiently, you may experience the amazement and creativity for yourself. I'm pretty jealous in fact.\n\nThis game is a big recommendation for me. The scientific aspect of portal and three-dimensional space used in this game is best described as baffling. Valve must have been truly blessed to ever release this game, as it touched the hearts of kids, adults and professional scientists alike.","timestamp_created":1409402899,"timestamp_updated":1650133793,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":116,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.848810195922851563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11919632","author":{"steamid":"76561198020306845","num_games_owned":1093,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":717,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":597,"last_played":1515328412},"language":"danish","review":"Really good game, makes your brain spin out.","timestamp_created":1409395457,"timestamp_updated":1409395457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11917075","author":{"steamid":"76561198113991191","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":798,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1502505001},"language":"english","review":"A Very fun puzzle game.

The one-note nature of the puzzles has some merit, but the whole game is [i]about[/i] the portals, so that's not it.  The FPS controls will prove a barrier to non-gamers, limiting accessibility, but, again, this springs from a selection of engine that I don't think is wrong.  A couple of the puzzles were a little obtuse, but once you figured them out, they made sense, and anyway, you wouldn't want it to be [i]too[/i] easy.  The main reason I don't like physics puzzlers is that their engine is too sensitive or finicky, and even once you figure out the solution, it takes a frustrating number of repetitions to implement it.  This never bothered me in Portal, though (probably because you're not stacking things, it's always just one box and some portals).  Timed sections are a little annoying, and the final boss a tad out-of-place, but that's really minor.  The idea that everyone else thinks it's great, so I should disagree is just childish.\nNope, it's perfect (or as close as a game can get).","timestamp_created":1409186183,"timestamp_updated":1409186183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538709700107574463","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11888539","author":{"steamid":"76561198006394590","num_games_owned":5646,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":343,"last_played":1409090633},"language":"english","review":"A fun little puzzle romp that has some decent ideas but it is sadly let down by its campaign length, I managed to finish the game in 5 hrs its not worth a purchase unless its on sale imo.","timestamp_created":1409165765,"timestamp_updated":1409165765,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11887832","author":{"steamid":"76561198087198670","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1062,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":831,"last_played":1418660248},"language":"brazilian","review":"A ideia do jogo é muito boa!

One such game company that has brought that innovation is Valve. \n  In 2007, when their last game was yet another (but refined) FPS, they released Portal. Arguably one of the most innovative games out there and yet one of the shortest. The story is a fairly simple premise: it tells the tale of a female test subject in a science facility named Chell who is there to test the portal gun. A device that enables the user to shoot 2 linked holes (portals) on non-metal sufaces. With this knowledge, Chell must solve 19 puzzles or \"test chambers\" guided by a female computer program all in the name of science. And cake. Without spoiling the details, that's as simple as the story will possibly get. It's a setup that's very interesting and possibly humorous to some, while at the same time makes the levels or \"test chambers\" seem as if everything is there for a reason. \nOf course, the gameplay is what really matters and Portal's gameplay is excelent. It's a first-person-style game but rather than shooting bullets, you shoot portals (as described earlier). As such, every single test is designed to use these portals along with other features. My problem is that as fun as these tests are, they're very easy and very short. Portal has a good amount of content including many other challenges.

I won't spoil much (but then again everyone knows this game) but the first half of the game is really just preparation for the later levels, where you have to escape Aperture Science and take down its hostile A.I., GLaDOS. The game starts out with simple puzzles, introducing concepts which get used later on in more difficult puzzles, such as flinging, and teaches you to associate certain objects with other objects. You only get one item throughout the game - the Portal Gun, which is upgraded very early on - and there's no time limit to complete the chambers. Even the final boss, which is timed, gives you more than enough time. Add a dark sense of humour and a well-written, minimalist cast on top, and you have a masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1408993308,"timestamp_updated":1409020430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11863579","author":{"steamid":"76561198081119587","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":216,"last_played":1408990943},"language":"english","review":"As I left they thanked me for being in the frontal position.\n\n...
