Many people think that its a run and gun but they couldn't be more wrong. Sure you could run and gun it but you will loose a lot of health. The game encourages you to use your tools and equipment to plan out a course of action, think like a theorist. the enemy you fight are memorable and the AI was amazing for its time while still standing well today. While there is a story there isn't really any focus on it and is really told by the environment. If you want story play the Half-Life 2 games.
