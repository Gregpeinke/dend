Portal is a prime example of that. Thrust into a indoor testing facility setting, you begin the game waiting and wondering what to do. The moment the first ever blue portal appears, you KNOW it's going to be a unique experience, which it certainly is. Playing with the mechanics of the portals is a seriously original concept and a breath of fresh air in gaming, not to mention that playing with momentum and physics can be really good fun and put to good use, particularly in the later stages of the game. When people talk about Portal, they'll probably talk about GlaDos, the AI character that guides you and how entertaining she is. Sure, she has her funny lines but she never really seemed as good as what I'd heard about her. Also, this game is pretty short to be honest. It's easy to beat it in a day and the challenges on the side don't extend it too much unless you're a die-hard completionist, in my opinion. However, if you look past the length, Portal is a great game to keep your attention for a while and has some genuinely great moments and gameplay. If you're not interested in the challenges, pick it up during a sale. If you're more of a completionist, pick it up at any time you want. 8/10 (Great)","timestamp_created":1387630666,"timestamp_updated":1387630666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8166334","author":{"steamid":"76561198025282599","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1527341001},"language":"english","review":"Great Game","timestamp_created":1387629364,"timestamp_updated":1387629364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8165592","author":{"steamid":"76561198089885455","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":339,"last_played":1394340285},"language":"russian","review":"Действительно интересная игра-головоломка,не похожая на другие игры.Всем рекомендую поиграть.","timestamp_created":1387627116,"timestamp_updated":1387627116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8162776","author":{"steamid":"76561198041570148","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":859,"last_played":1434483308},"language":"english","review":"review: overrated, one off game\nconclusion: not worth 10 bucks","timestamp_created":1387618185,"timestamp_updated":1387618185,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.428187668323516846","comment_count":22,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8161485","author":{"steamid":"76561198028337969","num_games_owned":293,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":510,"last_played":1592482909},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра с замечательным продолжением для хорошего прогрева мозгов, заставляя их думать, действовать, решать.
