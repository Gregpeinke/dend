Everyone need to try this amazing game!\n\nEdit:\nI just wanted to add, after completing the game in under 4 hours, that the game is a bit on the short side. So I wouldn't recomend buying this at full price.

Młodzi programiści znaleźli przy tym wszystkim miejsce w firmie Gabe Newella, a swój pomysł rozwinęli i udoskonalili, wpasowując go w ramy uniwersum „Half-Life’a”.\n\n[h1] FABUŁA [/h1]\n[i]Śpijcie spokojnie, zestawienie bez większych spoilerów![/i]\nChell jest młodą kobietą, której przypada wątpliwy zaszczyt udziału w przetestowaniu najnowszego wynalazku korporacji Aperture Science — technologii umożliwiającej ekspresowe przeniesienie się z jednego miejsca do drugiego. Prościej mówiąc: teleportacja staje się możliwa! Dziewczyna przeprowadzana jest przez dziewiętnaście pomieszczeń testujących sprawność i wydajność urządzenia, a w całej przygodzie towarzyszy jej komputerowy głos sugerujący, że nagrodą na końcu eksperymentu będzie... ciasto. Z tym że narracja komputera szybko zmienia ton, a ciasto okazuje się być kłamstwem.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2824062997\nScenariusz w [b]Portalu[/b] jest miłą niespodzianką, bo od pierwszych minut nikt się nie spodziewał, że będzie on tak rozbudowany. Pisząc to, mam na myśli oczywiście gatunek gier logicznych, który nie potrzebuje nad wyraz wybuchowej oprawy fabularnej, gdyż sprzedaje się samą mechaniką. Niemniej jednak historię sprawnie i solidnie opracowano, dzięki czemu zaskakuje w najmniej oczekiwanych momentach. Kiedy weźmie się jeszcze pod uwagę fakt, iż dzieje się to w ramach uniwersum słynnego „Half-Life’a”, poziom zaskoczenia wzrasta. Bo wszystko zaczyna się… zazębiać i dzień wydaje się po tym o wiele lepszy.\n\n[h1] MECHANIKA/ROZGRYWKA [/h1]\nGracz rzecz jasna przejmuje stery nad ciałem Chell, która dzierży Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, czyli prościej mówiąc, pistolet portalowy. Urządzenie to pozwala na stworzenie dwóch połączonych ze sobą portali — jednego niebieskiego, drugiego pomarańczowego. Wejście w jeden powoduje, że wyjdziemy z drugiego, podobnie jak z przedmiotami, które do niego wrzucimy. To tyle! Reszta zależy od poziomu, na którym się znajdziemy. Oficjalne czeka na nas dziewiętnaście komór testowych, ale w praktyce zabawa na tym się nie skończy. Naszym zadaniem jest przedostanie się z jednej windy, do drugiej, ale po drodze czekają nas nie tylko wysokie ściany, czy nieosiągalne segmenty, ale również drzwi, które trzeba otworzyć, umieszczając na wielkim, czerwonym przycisku jakiś przedmiot. Taka zabawa będzie wymagała od nas nie tylko wysiłku intelektualnego, ale również niemałej inwencji twórczej.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2824062511\nPistolet portalowy ma jednak swoje ograniczenia i jednym z nich jest fakt, iż portal może być stworzony tylko na płaskich, nieprzezroczystych lub półprzezroczystych i nieruchomych powierzchniach. Należy również zwrócić uwagę na rozbudowaną fizykę, dzięki czemu odpowiednio ustawione portale mogą służyć jak nieskończona trampolina, albo katapulta — z czego akurat wielokrotnie będzie trzeba korzystać. Zasady te nie są trudne do ogarnięcia, ale końcowe poziomy dadzą nam popalić, gdyż nie będzie się liczyło tam jedynie strategiczne podejście i wyobraźnia przestrzenna, ale również refleks. Rozgrywka na padzie jest przez to cholernie niewygodna.\n\n[h1] OPRAWA GRAFICZNA [/h1]\nPatrząc na oprawę graficzną, [b]Portal[/b] nie jest żadnym znaczącym technologicznym osiągnięciem, ale śmiga na tym samym silniku, co „Half-Life 2” i wygląda dobrze. Z teksturami nie było większego problemu, jako że większość jest brudno-biała, a to, co nie jest białe, czerpie z assetów przygotowanych pod inne gry Valve. Nawet po latach nie czuć w tym wszystkim monotonni, a gra nie męczy oka. Sterylna stylistyka nie tylko wygląda dobrze, ale również skupia uwagę gracza na łamigłówkach, nie ściągając jej na nic poza tym. Source nawet dobrze poradził sobie z mechaniką lustra, którą zastosowano w portalach i przy większej „portalowej pętli”. Produkcja się nie wykracza, a silnik nie wybucha, tylko równomiernie wykonuje obliczenia.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2824062667\n[h1] UDŹWIĘKOWIENIE/MUZYKA [/h1]\nWarstwa dźwiękowa również została stworzona w minimalistyczny sposób, ale mimo to stoi na wysokim poziomie. Subtelna muzyka elektroniczna, stanowiąca podkład dźwiękowy podkreśla tajemniczy klimat rozgrywki, nie dekoncentrując gracza. Szczególnie przyjemny okazuje się głos narratorki i kompanki naszych przygód, GLaDOS, złośliwie opisującej w czasie rzeczywistym naszą progresję. Wiele docinek z jej strony, jakieś humorzaste komentarze i nawet zaśpiewana piosenka (sic!) brzmią po prostu genialnie. Zasługi za tę świetną robotę może zgarnąć jedynie sama Ellen McLain, wcielająca się w gadający komputer.\n\n[h1] PODSUMOWANIE [/h1]\nJak tak szerzej spojrzeć, [b]Portal[/b] ma tylko jedną wadę — jest niesamowicie krótki. Jego ukończenie to około trzy godzinki, a dodatkowe mapy i wyzwania to maksymalnie kolejne dwie godziny. Bo wszystko tutaj się sprawdza, nawet po latach od premiery. Wciąż czuć, że produkcja wyznaczyła swoisty kierunek dla gatunku, który twórcy próbują odwzorować. [b]Portal[/b] to po prostu świetna, doskonale dopracowana i wymagająca gra, którą trzeba poznać samemu.\n\n[quote=Szynka013]Jeżeli moja recenzja pomogła Ci przy podjęciu decyzji nad zakupem, będę wdzięczny, jeśli zaobserwujesz moją [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33046115-Fridge-Friends/]stronę kuratora Steam[/url], co na pewno zmotywuje mnie do dalszej pracy.[/quote]","timestamp_created":1450954707,"timestamp_updated":1656607242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580419540405273438","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19903141","author":{"steamid":"76561197990830168","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":279,"last_played":1417693201},"language":"english","review":"I like cookies!","timestamp_created":1450953426,"timestamp_updated":1451215859,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19901991","author":{"steamid":"76561198262623409","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":118,"last_played":1612600803},"language":"schinese","review":"masterpiece","timestamp_created":1450949956,"timestamp_updated":1450949956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19901573","author":{"steamid":"76561198009504997","num_games_owned":1011,"num_reviews":170,"playtime_forever":114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":55,"last_played":1539938003},"language":"english","review":"Exactly when I was thinking FPS game genre had nothing else to show us after the awesome Half-Life, Valve shut my mouth with this astonishing immortal gem.
