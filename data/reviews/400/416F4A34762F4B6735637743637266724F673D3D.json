It does the classic thing of showing you a bunch of tricks and skills and then testing your mastery of those skills at the end.

Portal is darker, cheeky in its think-fast-or-die encounters, and sometimes frustrating in its twitchy timed puzzles. I never felt comfortable trying to aim and shoot two portals under a very short window of time but this game makes you do it several times in the latter stages of the game.

It's awesome.\nThe puzzles are the right amount of challenging, interesting, and it tells a great story (you just may have to look for it a bit) The dialogue is very impressive for a game, and fortunately doesn't get repititive like many other games with character dialogue. The main character, Chell, is always silent, so it's up to you to decide who she might be, her personality, likes, and dislikes. This way, the character you play as can be anyone you want it to. The graphics are nice, they run okay and look good too. And GLaDOS, she is hilarious. Even if you hate dark humour, she makes it funny. Always. And the portals. Whoever came up with these portals is a genious. \n\nPeople have also said that the gameplay time is short (2 hours) but if you are like me and know nothing about Portal like I used to, it should get you 4-5 hours of gameplay time. And there's plenty of mods and stuff to keep you busy with it after you finish the game.\n\nThe only complaint I might have (I'm not sure if anything can be done about it, but if it can, it should have been done in 2011.) is that the art in Portal and Portal 2 are very different. As far as the story goes, all that SHOULD have happened would be the facility gets overgrown and ruined. However, many familiar things from the first game are changed to a different style in Portal 2, such as GLaDOS, the Cores, Doors, Elevators, etc. I feel both games should have been modified to have a more consistent art style, aside from the ruined and overgrown bits. (Either that or a decent explanation as to WHY things look different)\n\nOverall, I recommend this game. BUT before you run off and buy it because of my persuasive and detailed arguement, get the Portal and Portal 2 bundle. It's a better deal, and once you finish Portal, you will be dying to get Portal 2.","timestamp_created":1429477482,"timestamp_updated":1444518192,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15454648","author":{"steamid":"76561198038533621","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":94,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":75,"last_played":1477112548},"language":"english","review":"Perfect game","timestamp_created":1429474344,"timestamp_updated":1429474344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15453844","author":{"steamid":"76561198110555238","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":168,"last_played":1447020171},"language":"english","review":"this game is awesome and companion cube so help full and i enjoyed not going out side for 5 days and nights on portal","timestamp_created":1429470950,"timestamp_updated":1429470950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15453269","author":{"steamid":"76561198064107730","num_games_owned":310,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":70,"last_played":1597085353},"language":"english","review":"2muchpuzzle4me\n\n\n10/10 -IGN","timestamp_created":1429468608,"timestamp_updated":1429468608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15452268","author":{"steamid":"76561198111868436","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":209,"last_played":1429464731},"language":"english","review":"This game is legendary.","timestamp_created":1429464817,"timestamp_updated":1429464933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15449366","author":{"steamid":"76561198119781669","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1638396523},"language":"english","review":"Portal é um jogo Simples de Quebra Cabeça é também de Opnião cada coisa tem Sentido no jogo! pena que ele é pequeno mais Vale a pena Comprar :) quando é da Valve é Perfeito!","timestamp_created":1429453566,"timestamp_updated":1429453700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548304200172424316","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15449215","author":{"steamid":"76561198071572715","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":758,"last_played":1459699531},"language":"english","review":"Having played through this game about 5 times now, I can safely say that this is one of the best games i've ever played!\n\nStory, atmosphere and humor...\n\n\n\nAlso: Cake","timestamp_created":1429452916,"timestamp_updated":1429452916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15449145","author":{"steamid":"76561198155184661","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":167,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":167,"last_played":1429987145},"language":"russian","review":"Игра нереально крутая!!!
