Portal was a revolutionary game, bringing puzzle games into a level never conceived before, making it one of the best rated masterpiece of all times, along with Half Life. Portal 2 simply adds what the first portal was missing, what had to be improved was done, thus making it hard for me to find cons for my preview. It's an evergreen game with a still enjoyable graphic, Always keeping your mind busy in a very good way.\n\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n\n[*][u]GAME MECHANICS[/u]: As far as I know, nobody thought about the concept of portals to be implemented into a videogame for puzzle solving quests, it was a winning revolutionary bet rightly awarded, especially for its time, when most of videogame genres and ideas were already out and making something unseen and original was extremely difficult. I couldn't find any problem at all into the portal's mechanic, everything's perfect and works like a charm! That's the biggest credit they could get from this game, Worth a standing ovation. A positive footnote, I really appreciated how they removed Portal's deadly features, something I hate on the first Portal is the dead traps and features, making it almost a platforming survival more than a puzzle solving game. You can still die in Portal 2, but you never feel hunted or in true danger.\n\n[*][u]CHARACTERS[/u]: Chell is a big hole missing in the game, as if she never existed in the game at all. The hole left by the protagonist is greatly filled by all other characters. Glados' humour is something I never get tired of, Wheatley's goofy and blabbery speech is hilarious, Cave Johnson's style is very funny. It's not easy to give such depths on the very few characters appearing in the game, it doesn't make the story feel \"empty and alone\" at all.\n\n[*][u]PUZZLES[/u]: Unlike other puzzle games with a plot, you don't need to find objects and randomly use them around the world, puzzles are more sudoku style, where all you need is your mind and find solutions procedurally. It's the best way to make puzzles not too frustrating, they give motivation to find the solution and once you find it, gives you the biggest gratification you could experience in a videogame, at least to me. Their difficulties are well balanced, none are impossible or randomly found, it forces you to play the game the way they meant, and you will love it.\n\n[*][u]COOP/EDITOR[/u]: The game has two features boosting dramatically the longevity of the game: Coop and the room editor. Coop is one of the best I ever experienced, some puzzles are extremely hard to solve because it doesn't just requires 2 smart minds, it also involves an extremely needed cooperation about understanding the puzzle solutions, if only one understand the solution, the level won't be solved until your mate understand it too. I have played Coop with a friend of mine and we agreed to avoid chat to give hints or explain the solution, we enjoyed to solve it together in a silent way or trying to use the in game gesture system, which I find brilliant, The editor gives the chance to build and play custom maps, making the game endless and giving the chance to express your ability or creativity. It's plenty of rooms in the workshop amd ot was a very smart choice. The editor seems quite empty and too basic, but I found very complex user made rooms around, I suppose there are external editors or mods to \"force\" more objects.\n\n[*][u]STORY[/u]: Not the best story, almost absent, especially in the first Portal. There's almost no story in the game, but I believe it's Worth a positive note the way they tried to explain the background story about the first Portal, Portal 2, Aperture Science and even Half Life. The \"blast from the past\" in the old Aperture Laboratories made the story very enjoyable, my favoutire feature after puzzle solving mechanics, along with characters' humors. It was a nice and smart way to add a story where there's not much of it, not a true pros but a very positive note Worth a mention\n[/list]\n\n\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n\n[*][u]STORY'S LONGEVITY[/u]: The first time I played this game, it took me 2-3 days (without grinding it) to complete, not too short but I wouldn't call it a long lasting one. I completed it a few more times until now I was able to finish it under 6 hours, which is way too short for my tastes. I believe it would have been nicer to double the story length to make it long enough for the first run, not too short for the next ones, doubling the puzzles would have made it harder to remember them all for the next runs. My guess is they focused more on the editor and coop to increase longevity, but making more puzzle rooms would have been a better choice in my opinion.\n[/list]\n\nFinal words: This game is a must and should be tried at least once by everyone, I recommend it with a good discounted price because of its age and longevity.","timestamp_created":1502041023,"timestamp_updated":1511538178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34064651","author":{"steamid":"76561198170435682","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3613,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1775,"last_played":1537940329},"language":"russian","review":"Игра супер!
