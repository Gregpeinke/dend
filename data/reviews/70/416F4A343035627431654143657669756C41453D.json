finally managed to finish the game.\n\nHalf Life is a game that is composed of \"set pieces\" that as you progress through the game become more, and more elaborate, as difficult, as spectacular, as insane.\n\nThe whole game is a Science Fiction adventure, and one incredibly memorable at that, the whole thing feels like a journey that you're clearly taking part in.\n\nThis illusion gets created by letting the player play through the eyes of the game's main protagonist Gordon Freeman, that though you never hear him speak, or react in any other way than the one you want him to, it still has managed to become a \"gaming\" icon.\n\nThis is because however unlikely certain situations may appear to be possible to overcome, enemies to defeat, or obstacles to surpass, the game always finds a way to make it seem pausible that you may succeed, and you have to if you want to finish the game, obviously.\n\nNow the problem that I have with some of this sequences is that at first their design seems brilliant, and simple, but as you keep progressing through the game, this \"set pieces\" can become jarring, disorganized, and, or messy, and frustrating to complete.\n\nIt is not only the fact that you'll have to repeat certain sections over and over again, some that simply rely in pure \"trial, and error\".\n\nbut also, there are ones that are incredibly cryptic, and while they simply do require a bit of patience, and thinking on the players side, more often than not, even whilst comprehending what is it that you need to do, the controls, and systems, simply work against you.\n\nAt one point I was done with a massive firefight against a couple of soldiers and a tank, since the game is an \"old-school first person shooter\" I had to rely in getting health pickups, my health was all the way down to four, of a hundred...\n\nRight when I got through a doorway that was supposed to allow me to continue, I immediately got killed by a turret that was placed to edge of the door I had just walked through, luckily I had a saved right before it happened.\n\nBut tell me?\n\nHow the f**k are you supposed to know that was going to happen unless it had happened to you at first?\n\nThere's no way to know about it, the only thing that could give you some input that the turret was there, is a sound that they produce when they're active, but in the midst of everything crumbling around you, the explosion of the tank, the gunfire, and the flow of adrenaline that that leaves you with, you probably won't be able to listen to that.\n\nThere are other cases, other examples, near the end of the game there's a section that requires you to shoot at an enemy enough times you scare it away from you so it can destroy a wall and form a path through which you can continue.\n\nFirst time it happened tho, the enemy didn't react, I had to reload another save file in order to get through it.\n\nAnd then the last couple of sections, they require some horrible form of platforming, that doesn't even feel like it was designed with the systems the game had presented at that point in mind, it feels much more as if it's one of those cases you have to do everything in your power, whether it is what the game requires you to do, or not, in other to complete those parts.\n\nOther times the enemies simply fill in the screen, and you don't get enough ammo to take all of them at once, even if you have to, it gets frustrating after a while, it is annoying, and most of the times, you have to improvise.\n\nWhether this was intended or not, that's besides the point, it is not enjoyable for me.\n\nHowever...\n\nThis where mere moments near the end of the game that turn an otherwise incredible experience in a bit of a \"slog\", crazy part is that when finishing the game though, as frustrated as I was, not even from loosing, but just from playing it, I felt this incredible sense of accomplishment that surpassed any sort of high score, or challenge in any other game I have played recently, it became clear to me that this game's brillance comes from offering the player a journey in which you actually feel you're part of, in which you feel as the hero, that partake in every event leading to the imminent continuation of an incredible narrative, that didn't come in the form of a cutscene, or text.\n\nBut instead, in pure gameplay experience, everything in this game you get to experience it through the players eyes, it is an incredible masterpiece in videogame design because of it, and even if it hasn't aged that well in some aspects, it has in plenty of others, and it still manages to trascend, and offer, the same experience that made it timeless in the first place, it is in my opinion, a clear example of what videogames can offer when handling the medium, with the respect, and care, it deserves.","timestamp_created":1514841883,"timestamp_updated":1514841883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38950026","author":{"steamid":"76561198400045242","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1580351661},"language":"spanish","review":"sin

game from a simpler time.\n\nOne thing that annoyes me the most about modern games, yes I'm looking at you Metro, is the fact that you are basically only watching cutscene after cutscene and you're barely even allowed to do anything yourself. \nEverything that looks remotely like it could be fun happens in cutscenes.\n\nIn Half life everything story releated happens while you're playing, without ever being interrupted. Characters talk to you when you run past and if you don't wanna listen to what they have to say you can just run by without caring, it's up to you.\n\nAlso the game doesn't bother explaining everything to the point that even a 3 year old would understand it, the leveldesign is so well thought out that you'll never even end up asking yourself what to do. If you can't take the most obvious route (because of a locked door for example), all you have to do is look around and you'll find other paths to take, or at least clues of what you are looking for. That is much better than markers all over the map or an annoying AI running with you telling you the same hint over and over again.\n\nOne thing that bothered me a little bit would be how ridiculously inaccurate certain guns are, but overall the gunplay and movement feels very solid and obviously familiar for cs players.\n\nIt's a tiny download, you can grab it for under $2 during steam sales, it runs on every toaster and is an absolute pillar in the world of gaming, why are you even reading reviews?\n\nVolvo pls, we are waiting :(","timestamp_created":1514719230,"timestamp_updated":1514719230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497942358255386353","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38895698","author":{"steamid":"76561198405162594","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1558137760},"language":"turkish","review":"HALF LİFE GÜZEL BİR OYNAMASINI BİLENE DAHADA GÜZEL","timestamp_created":1514714613,"timestamp_updated":1514714613,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38895184","author":{"steamid":"76561198196537449","num_games_owned":316,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":177,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":168,"last_played":1594676130},"language":"german","review":"Wenn man sich FPS Fan nennt muss man es gespielt haben.","timestamp_created":1514713480,"timestamp_updated":1514713480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515759289264678955","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38894557","author":{"steamid":"76561198164739582","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":95,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":95,"last_played":1514350830},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏很经典，玩着很难受\n半个小时成孕妇\n到头来：头晕、恶心、想吐。","timestamp_created":1514711980,"timestamp_updated":1514711980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38893450","author":{"steamid":"76561198335878710","num_games_owned":379,"num_reviews":97,"playtime_forever":134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":116,"last_played":1577974321},"language":"schinese","review":"小时候没零花钱，经常去电脑房站着看人家玩半条命，一看就是一天，我记得还有那个什么丢飞盘的模式，已经记不大清了。。。唉，一晃就过去20多年了","timestamp_created":1514709235,"timestamp_updated":1514709235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ405bt1eACeviulAE="}
