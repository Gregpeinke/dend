The gun mechanics are very smooth, and I can actually carry a gun around knowing that I actually feel protected by it.  And when the slow motion activates? Probably the most satisfying thing you will ever encounter in your life.  It makes me feel like a badass if anything.  The game is not that hard to get used to, and overall it's just an amazing game. I reccomend you pick it up right now if you are still thinking it over. Trust me, you won't regret it.\n\nThe only problem I have with this game, is that there seems to be an awfully lot of DLC.

Plus you also don't have to be that specfic class to level up, for instance if you used a med pack on another teammate, it will count towards the medic class even though you are a support class. \n\nThe maps are not the same level design, they are all unqiue maps that offer different ways and strategies to defend against the enemy.\n\nThere is a weight system in which a player can't buy all the weapons as this would slow the player down in movement speed.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe leveling of perks can get quite tedious meanig when you hit level 2 and higher with a class, the level gap to level up a class can take a very long time to do and as a result can become quite a grinding experiance.\n\nSince this is an old game, hosting a server is a real pain to do and so often you will just end up joining someone elses server since its too comlicated to set up as it requres certian ports to be opened on a router and etc. \n\nOn top of hosting a server can be very complicated to do, if you want to use steam workshops mods, they have to be on your own hosted server for the custo content you want in your game. \n\nI would of liked a sprint button than not just using the knife.\n\nCan be very furstrating when you die as you loose all of the weapons you had aquired in the current session but the money is saved however you don't gain anymore money when you have died in a round.\n\nOverall:\n\nBut overall this is a good game to pick up and play with friends if you looking for a fps wave defense game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1405362864,"timestamp_updated":1405362864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11235221","author":{"steamid":"76561198103494595","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":1460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":420,"last_played":1558980850},"language":"german","review":"Geiles Zombiespiel für Coop.
