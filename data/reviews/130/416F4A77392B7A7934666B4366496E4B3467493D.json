Впрочем, состоящая из потягивания пивка череда рабочих дней нарушается внезапным инцидентом, познакомившим мирных землян с куда более интересными формами жизни. А теперь давайте разберём шутер по запчастям.\n\nПлюсы:\nНесмотря на общую линейность геймплея, в Blue Shift интересные для исследования локации. Игра весьма короткая — прохождение займёт примерно три часа.\nИгра дополняет сюжет первой части и Opposing Force. Нельзя не упомянуть доктора Розенберга — первого уникального персонажа в серии, с которым вы будете постоянно взаимодействовать.\nУ Барни нет защитного костюма или энергетического жилета — восстанавливать свою броню с помощью зарядников он не может. К тому же, герой ходит с весьма урезанным арсеналом: всё это делает перестрелки более напряжёнными.\nГеймплейно Blue Shift напоминает предшественников — это всё такой же боевик от первого лица.\nВизуально игра слабо отличается от предков, но именно с Blue Shift на ПК впервые пришёл High Definition Pack — набор качественных моделей, взятых из Dreamcast-версии Half-Life.\nBlue Shift отличается синеватым интерфейсом, цитирующим цвет Барни Калхауна и его рубашки.\n\nМинусы:\nПо сравнению с переполненной новым контентом Opposing Force, в Blue Shift нет ничего радикально нового. Сеттинг представляет из себя всю ту же подземную лабораторию с парочкой новых зон.\nКомпозитора Криса Дженсена решили лишний раз не напрягать — весь саундтрек Blue Shift позаимствован из Opposing Force.\n\nВывод [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/31943256] читайте на VALVe MEMES!

Соответственно он не может подзаряжать свою броню энергией, а вынужден искать на уровнях сменные бронежилеты. В остальном геймплей за него не особо отличается от геймплея за Гордона Фримена. Даже тренировочный уровень повторяет таковой из оригинальной игры практически один-в-один.\n\nАрсенал у Барни тоже победнее, чем у двух других персонажей - в основном это стандартное земное оружие: ни мощных армейских образцов, ни научных прототипов, ни инопланетных живых пушек, ни каких либо иных новинок.\n\nБестиарий тут тоже поменьше чем и в основной игре, и в предыдущем аддоне. Без самых мощных монстров из мира Зен, без чёрных оперативников, и уж тем более без расы Икс  И даже боссов нет.\n\nДа и масштаб истории поприземлённее. Барни не спасает мир от вторжения, а просто пытается сбежать из \"Чёрной Мезы\" и по возможности помочь другим людям сделать то же самое.\n\nТак что \"Blue Shift\" по сравнению с \"Opposing Force\" - это шаг назад. Но означает ли это что он плох? Да ни в коем случае!\nНесмотря на меньший размах и меньшую продолжительность (длительность примерно в три раза короче основной игры), это отличная игра. Всё тот же увлекательный геймплей, великолепный дизайн уровней и множество интересных мосентов и ситуаций.\n\nСколь-либо серьёзных багов я не встретил. \nРазве что персонажи, катающиеся на монорельсе или ездящие на лифте, двигались не плавно, а довольно неприятно подёргивались, но таких моментов буквалино два-три за всю игру.\nИ названия сохранений были написаны какой-то абракадабра (как при сбившейся кодировке), при том что с остальными текстами всё в полном порядке. И то не факт, что проблема тут в самой игре, а не в русификаторе или в моей винде.\n\nИтого: Отличный аддон, хоть и немного уступающий \"Opposing Force\".

I'm used to how the game works.\n\nIn this though, I found myself constantly low on ammo and health, and I finally ran out of both. I'm seriously contemplating not even finishing this game, and I'm only about 1.5 hours in. You need SOME kind of gun + ammo in order to fight some of these aliens... it's ridiculous with a crowbar.\n\nEdit: I did try again and isolated the ranged aliens 1 at a time by rounding corners and playing peek-a-boo with them. Then I waited until I was sort of close and they started to fire up for their ranged attack. Once that happened, I approached, hit with a crowbar, immediately backed up again, and repeated until they were dead...\n\nI did find more ammo after beating that area and beat the game, but it was a bit obtuse to play through that, so I'll keep the downvote. It would have been nice to at least have that infinite-ammo homing gun you get from the fat aliens or something.\n\nAlso, unlike other reviewers I didn't find this game particularly short. It was a little shorter than regular Half Life but not by much, there's plenty of gameplay.","timestamp_created":1623358818,"timestamp_updated":1623634769,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93505556","author":{"steamid":"76561198990599820","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1595194590},"language":"english","review":"this is a ripoff of half-life 1","timestamp_created":1623318397,"timestamp_updated":1623318397,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93500694","author":{"steamid":"76561198354581459","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37,"last_played":1637576587},"language":"english","review":"Half Life Blue Shift.
