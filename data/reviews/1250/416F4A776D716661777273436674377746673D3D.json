Handcannon, killing floor will surely have a weapon for you.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, to say the least...\nThe servers rarely crash (dependant on whether you're on the dedicated or not) and the weapons are pretty balanced when it comes to classes, no class is greatly overpowered but that being said, classes like the firebug and the demo are however easier to rack up large numbers of kills with in my experience.\nThe matches consist of 11 waves with each wave progessively getting harder due to the addition of zed species and quantity of zeds with the 11th wave being the climax where a character called 'The Patriarch' spawns and must be defeated in order to complete the wave and have victory declared.\nThe trader opens in between waves for a short predetermined amount of time and allows players to buy weapons, armour and ammunition.\n\nDifficulties vary with difficulties being in their respective order: Beginner, Normal, Hard, Suicidal, Nightmare.\nBeginner is the easiest gamemode with the trader being open the longest and zeds having the least amount of health, Nightmare on the otherhand has a shorter trading time and zeds are alot stronger.\nTo supplement this, Ammunition and weapons don't spawn on the map so players can't pick them up forcing players to either switch to Berzerker due to it's infinite amount of ammo or force them to coordinate their attacks in order to preserve ammunition.\n\nLastly, as a Veteran of this game, character dlc's aren't that usefull but the weapons expansion dlc's aren't neccessary to be bought because if one person has it, they can buy the weapons and drop them for all people to use therefore voiding the need to buy these packs.\n\nCheers\n-Raptor","timestamp_created":1355700313,"timestamp_updated":1355700313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"715886","author":{"steamid":"76561197976365835","num_games_owned":291,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":9304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8975,"last_played":1402487885},"language":"english","review":"Well the amount of hours I logged in speak for themselves. This game is only fun if you you're playing multiplayer. Its boring and too hard on solo. You can join a server with up to 6 people for ordinary game mode, and the modded servers allow up to 30 people. It is hands down the best and most fun co-up survival game I ever plated. The metacritic score does this game no justice because it was the best €4 I ever spent. \nI could not recomment the game any more.\n\nFor the system requirements it asks, it looks really really good. I have nothing but fun playing it. The only drawback is sometimes it difficult to find a good server with a good set of 5 playing on the highest (Hell on Earth Difficulty). Can be fustrating at the highest difficulties and you need to reach lv6 (highest level) and the rest of your team also needs to be that high of a level to stand a chance surviving the 10 rounds (11th round is boss fight). The game basically consists of surviving wave after wave and you have a choce of 7 perks, all which have their positives and negatives and advantages in certain maps/situations/gameplay tactic. So picking a class later on to become very good at is important, but for the beginning is irrelevant. You become better with time, but I think you need 100hrs to achieve maximum efficiency with a couple of the 7 classes. So it is a big time investment if you want to master all the perks but the game is so much fun and the devs really update it often so the time flies by.\nTripwire made an amazing game here and although they did sell 1million + copies of this game, it deserves more and they deserve support since they are player friendly and are very active with the gaming community and constantly add new achievements, DLC and events even though the game has age. So I definitely recommend it without a doubt, especially if you like co-op games like Left4Dead. This game is everything left 4 dead should have been but wasn't! and in no way does Left4Dead deserve a higher score than this or higher popularity for that matter. Thats all I have to say about it.\n\n88/100","timestamp_created":1355698940,"timestamp_updated":1355698940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4790881","author":{"steamid":"76561198041885822","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3425,"last_played":1430946855},"language":"english","review":"GET THIS GAME\n","timestamp_created":1355697533,"timestamp_updated":1355697533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5839379","author":{"steamid":"76561198055516659","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1229,"last_played":1483221580},"language":"english","review":"JUST BUY THIS GAME NOW.","timestamp_created":1355696290,"timestamp_updated":1355696290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"669236","author":{"steamid":"76561197974908986","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":4176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2682,"last_played":1600591353},"language":"english","review":"Killing floor is awesome, free DLC and all you could ever want in a zombie game, badass co-op and achievments galore!","timestamp_created":1355688625,"timestamp_updated":1355688625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2809598","author":{"steamid":"76561198012943326","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5873,"last_played":1428791516},"language":"english","review":"YOU'RE ALL LIKE *POP POP POP* THEN THE ZEDS ARE ALL LIKE DROPPIN' AN' STUFF.
