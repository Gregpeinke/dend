The controls are still mostly comfortable, level design is creative, the enemies are surprisingly dangerous, and although the graphics are noticeably dated there is a kind of cheesy retro appeal to them, even if they aren't as impressive as they were back in the 90's. If you're looking for a good FPS game and have never tried this, or if you want to see where Valve began their mark in the gaming industry, than you can't go wrong with Half-Life. I give it a solid 5/5.","timestamp_created":1602811714,"timestamp_updated":1602811714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77621493","author":{"steamid":"76561199032559944","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":63,"last_played":1653678424},"language":"english","review":"lemme tell you something its a fucking master peice","timestamp_created":1602803833,"timestamp_updated":1602803833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77620343","author":{"steamid":"76561199013519587","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":3654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":389,"last_played":1648507206},"language":"english","review":"Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.\nPlease remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines.","timestamp_created":1602801678,"timestamp_updated":1602801678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw65abl/UCd8eMqAI="}
