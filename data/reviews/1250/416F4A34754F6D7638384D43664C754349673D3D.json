After playing a few rounds at the beginner difficulty, getting loads of \"Dosh\" and taking out the fiercest of foes with a wide variety of class-themed weapons, it might even feel a bit too easy. \n\nWhat I strongly suggest, especially if playing multi-player, is that you stop right there.  Start a new long game on Normal, find a perk that fits your playing style (Give them all a fair shake, you might be surprised by what you prefer!)  and start killing wave after wave of the patriarch's minions.  While the weapons can all be used universally, the perk you chose will dictate which ones your player will benefit from, and will be more efficient with.  \n\nAfter a few rounds of an increasing variety of fodder, you may notice a handsome gentleman with spiked arms and a glowing abdomen wandering around.  I highly suggest everyone stop what they are doing and greet him together as a group.  He is not always in such a good mood, as you will soon find.  This game is all about building up your perks, buying bigger and better weapons, learning the key points of each map and hunkering down for safety until you are overwhelmed and forced to relocate.  Of course, all of this goes out the window when you make it to the final level.  Those of you who are new to the game will understand when you get there, and to the experienced vets, please try to keep in mind that at perk level 0, nothing was ever easy!\n\nWhile this game is best played with friends, the Killing Floor community is overall pleasant and welcoming to new players.","timestamp_created":1391638054,"timestamp_updated":1479969010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49977487325668335","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8988305","author":{"steamid":"76561198035715212","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1414528757},"language":"portuguese","review":"epic game \n","timestamp_created":1391636213,"timestamp_updated":1391636213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8988127","author":{"steamid":"76561198079425592","num_games_owned":440,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1463,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":732,"last_played":1493080270},"language":"english","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ZOMBIE KILLING GAMES NEXT TO LEFT 4 DEAD SERIES","timestamp_created":1391635245,"timestamp_updated":1391635245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8987647","author":{"steamid":"76561198045723952","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":50638,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43401,"last_played":1451085920},"language":"english","review":"Quite a fun game.

Killing Floor is a great multiplayer class-based team game.  The details and animations on the guns in this game stand out for the release date, and the gameplay and sorta silly humor throughout the game is frankly pretty freakin' entertaining once you get the hang of it and/or find some some friendly/cooperative higher level players in your matches when you're starting out. I say it's a multiplayer game even though it's fully playable solo, because for me the FUN is in multiplayer, as well as map design favoring multiplayer for the ability to camp, at least at Hard difficulty and below.  You're not going to be able to solo a whole map very well above beginner difficulty until your perk(s) of choice are leveled up a bit anyways.  But just hang in there and read the community guides on how to play each class and you'll be taking names and laughing those weakling Zeds in no time.\n\nThe alternative gameplay in Objective Mode is a nice change of pace that throws in a few additional things to do besides survive the wave-based zombie combat, with some workshop maps featuring a totally different type of gameplay for completion (Haunted Hotel for one... haven't finished it, but it's quite interesting).  \n\nMy biggest problem with this game isn't with the gameplay or anything, it's just is that some online servers or very occasionally a solo match don't save stats for your perk leveling or award achievements when they should.  I've had this problem on OSX and Linux, (but more on OSX, of course) but I don't know about on Windows.  I think the multiplayer servers are all community run, in which case it's hard to point the finger at Tripwire for compatability issues or non-whitelisted stuff on them, but it is frustrating sometimes if you spend an hour to get a map achievement and have it not work at the end.  I just add the ones that I know work to my favorite server list and check those first when I'm looking for a game before going to the full server list.  But if you can live with that risk or don't care about achievements, the gameplay, maps, difficulties, events, achievements, and sorta goofy humor offer ridiculous replay value.","timestamp_created":1391478953,"timestamp_updated":1415536990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8966872","author":{"steamid":"76561198077331092","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3843,"last_played":1481939127},"language":"english","review":"fun","timestamp_created":1391463834,"timestamp_updated":1391463834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8965163","author":{"steamid":"76561198055731271","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1847,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1634,"last_played":1448596198},"language":"english","review":"This game is amazing, easy to run and loads of fun for hours on end.

It never gets old or boring for me no matter how many times i play it. It's difficult and the igher rounds can become a real challenege if you don't prepair in the right way early on. I still have issues with the game itself at times. It's pretty frequent the issues i run into this game. The weapon dlcs are also a great buy as well, i normally don't pay for dlc on steam but KF i've bought almost all of the weapons ones. Playing by yourself is a great way to kill time, but plaing online is a real challenege and defianatly a blast to do if you have the right teammates. You have a set of about 6 different classes all of which you level up by using weapons and sometimes equipment in their field. The higher the level of the class the cheaper you can buy the guns for it and the more powerful they become, faster you can reload, and also different perks depending on the class. The enemys are pretty well balanced with a good mixture of powerful enemys and weaker ones. You can also use different enemies for your advantage and get them to kill the zeds for you(Fleshpoun and Bloater).\nThe workshop for this game is also really good. You can find all sorts of things in there to enhance the gameplay. Adding new guns to the game(LMG, Snipers, Assault Rifles etc) you can add maps made by the community that are well done and balnced out, and also get different game modes and also some pretty cool mods to change the whole game up and give it a different field (Aliens mod)\nAs much as i hate dealing with a game that has issues i still love Killing Floor becasue it's iconic to me and one of the best PC games i've played. It's a game that sticks out there from all the rest and it's one that's fun and challenging all at the same time.\n(os being used is Mac)","timestamp_created":1391422386,"timestamp_updated":1391422386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55058366060256958","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8958852","author":{"steamid":"76561198025178151","num_games_owned":1004,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17973,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4893,"last_played":1654913386},"language":"english","review":"Hours of gory fun for the whole dysfunctional family","timestamp_created":1391403640,"timestamp_updated":1391403640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530916810035705566","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8957671","author":{"steamid":"76561198046107171","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1839,"last_played":1454803023},"language":"english","review":"This game really only works if you have others to play it with, but een without that, it can be fun if the team you're stuck with is decent.

Если L4D играет на кооперативности действий, атмосфере и прочих факторах, у KF это также получается, но по своему. Кооперативность L4D заключается в правильном и своевременном реагировании на определенные факторы, к примеру появление Танка и Охотника, не имея за собой особой тактической подоплеки, а только исключительно действия спинным мозгом, то KF имеет минимальную тактическую составляющую. Если это не ощущается на нижних уровнях сложности, то это ощущается на поздних. Без правильной выкладки, и правильного сочетания - ачивки за пройденный уровень на Аде на Земле вам не видать.И это сочетается с простым, как 2 рубля, геймплеем, но при этом захватывающим и забавным. То есть L4D в плане фана однозначно проигрывает KF. Насчет атмосферы. В L4D, для меня, ее нет. Возможно я не воспринимаю тематику зомби апокалипсиса так серьезно в этой игре, как например в RE2, но правда - все что дается в игре это полупустые жилые(иногда не жилые) районы, с редкими элементами апокалипсиса, вроде записей на стене в убежищах. Что имеет в противовесе KF? Залитые кетчупом уровни, модели выпотрошенных монстров(статичных), горящие машины и т.д, кратко говоря - я чувствую апокалипсис в KF гораздо явственнее чем в L4D. Туда же мобы, боссы и т.д. Не буду скрывать очевиднейшего - KF во многом была задумана как треш игра, не претендующая на атмосферность и т.д, но у нее она есть, за счет отличного дизайна. \nВ заключение хочу сказать что эта игра - это лучший образец треш зомби шутера, который я видел в своей жизни. На эту игру часто идут скидки, так что если вам не жаль 60-100 рублей - купите и оцените.

There's a good number of maps with new ones added during holidays, several difficulty settings to prevent the game from ever becoming too easy, and heaps of achievements to shoot for. The British accents remain amusing even after 300 hours of gameplay. This game's biggest flaw is the lack of a campaign/story mode, but, thankfully, Tripwire has made two \"Objective\" maps, in which you must complete objectives to proceed. Hopefully they will make many more as they are an excellent addition to this game. Still, the multiplayer in this game is great and you can get some laughs from welding your teammates into a useless room. My favourite part is using the welder on teammates - it hurts them even when there is no friendly fire and pretty much nobody knows about this, which makes it all the more amusing. Good thing nobody reads these reviews, so you can weld the hell out of them and they still won't know what hit'em! Just weld a door and slide your piping hot welder into your teammate's face.","timestamp_created":1391152057,"timestamp_updated":1391152085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8918141","author":{"steamid":"76561198038553274","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":42915,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40203,"last_played":1441156887},"language":"japanese","review":"There's bunch of mods, so u wont be fed up with this game.","timestamp_created":1391147683,"timestamp_updated":1391147683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499108701944351196","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8917948","author":{"steamid":"76561198002516655","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":563,"last_played":1466917929},"language":"english","review":"Very fun game both online and offline, but beware non-vanilla multiplayer servers.
