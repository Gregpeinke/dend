Opposing Force is quite the challenge in my opinion. You take the role of Adrian Shepard, a marine who was sent to clean up Black Mesa after the incident, however like Gordon Freeman, once he enters Black Mesa he is faced with the challenge of having to fight his way through Xen's Aliens and Black Ops, who were sent to clean up the marines because they failed their mission. Game play remains the same with some new but minor mechanics. Stealth is something that is necessary in this game as there are enemies who are much, much stronger & charging in might get you killed in an instant. It could just be me, but because of the strength increase for enemies, this makes this game super difficult which isn't a bad thing, but coming from Half-Life which was more moderate with it's difficulty, it seems a little overwhelming. Overall, Story remains similar to Half-Life, game play is similar, sound & video is excellent for it's time, this truly is a great game that I recommend you play after completing the original Half-Life. 7/10","timestamp_created":1655338358,"timestamp_updated":1655338358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117034855","author":{"steamid":"76561199148191703","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6848,"last_played":1655317618},"language":"english","review":"good expansion","timestamp_created":1655317227,"timestamp_updated":1655317227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117017512","author":{"steamid":"76561199071246552","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":898,"last_played":1656401230},"language":"english","review":"An expanded HL experience.","timestamp_created":1655292134,"timestamp_updated":1655292134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548151552677154541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117013908","author":{"steamid":"76561198272960884","num_games_owned":345,"num_reviews":143,"playtime_forever":358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":358,"last_played":1655284711},"language":"turkish","review":"Half-Life evreninin ara oyunu.

Here, they are revealed to be the fictional Hazardous Environment Combat Unit, or HECU for short, and they seem to pull equipment and stuff from every other branch of the military. Anyways, when Adrian's squad is sent to help contain the Xen invasion of Black Mesa, their Osprey gets shot down, and Adrian is separated from them. When he comes to, the military is ordering a complete evacuation of Black Mesa, and so he tries to reach the extraction while shooting any and all aliens that come his way, only to discover that the Black Ops soldiers from HL1 were not sent as backup for the HECU Marines, but to remove EVERYTHING, including the Marines, from the area. To make matters worse, [i]ANOTHER[/i] group of aliens, Race X, starts invading, and are hostile to both the humans AND the aliens from Xen. It ends up coming down to Adrian to stop them too.\n\nIf you liked the gameplay of Half-Life 1, you're going to like this one too. Its still rather fun and challenging at times. The new toys Adrian Shepard gets to play with here, like a sniper rifle, machine gun, and various alien weaponry, are great, along with any returning weapons. Sometimes you'll come across friendly NPCs in the form of HECU Marines, and they add a level of fun to combat, and are occasionally important to progress. When there is music, it is STILL absolutely fantastic.\n\nThis expansion pack is a solid recommend from me.","timestamp_created":1654754704,"timestamp_updated":1654807874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116707315","author":{"steamid":"76561198154044164","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":725,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":725,"last_played":1654732192},"language":"english","review":"good but definitely harder than Half Life","timestamp_created":1654748866,"timestamp_updated":1654748866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116691571","author":{"steamid":"76561198816961040","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":47,"playtime_at_review":1233,"last_played":1659539952},"language":"english","review":"better than half life in my opinion because more guns and better multiplayer","timestamp_created":1654718260,"timestamp_updated":1654718260,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116690098","author":{"steamid":"76561198277050034","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":472,"last_played":1654795106},"language":"english","review":"pretty good","timestamp_created":1654716106,"timestamp_updated":1654716106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116686091","author":{"steamid":"76561199179546530","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":986,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":541,"last_played":1656000928},"language":"turkish","review":".","timestamp_created":1654710066,"timestamp_updated":1654710066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116665871","author":{"steamid":"76561198864069994","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":141,"last_played":1654252324},"language":"russian","review":" люблю когда gman закрывает перед мною двери. выглядит как предательство из какого-то фильма. игра классная, советую","timestamp_created":1654674450,"timestamp_updated":1654674450,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116657362","author":{"steamid":"76561198315786174","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":928,"last_played":1659483638},"language":"english","review":"A better Half Life 2 than HL2- Lemme explain\nHalf-Life 2 is a great game that greatly advances the plotline of the Half Life series, but Opposing Force is a better direct sequel to HL1. \nAnd unlike HL1 + 2, it does what it sets out to do much quicker.

If you really, [i]really[/i] want more Half-Life, Opposing Force will probably do it for you. There's some pretty neat ideas scattered throughout. But put up against how great Half-Life is really makes you appreciate a lot of the clever visual cuing and other level design tricks that Valve uses to make one cohesive journey.\n\nThere is some neat new stuff introduced in the game, but a number of them are pretty flawed. You can get AI squad members to fight with you, occasionally, for a little bit. They aren't particularly competent, and can't navigate difficult terrain, so even if they do survive for a while, eventually you'll be forced to leave them behind. You can climb and swing from ropes, but it never quite works the way you expect it to, and ultimately just made me wish they had all been just ladders, instead. Night vision goggles replace the Half-Life flashlight. While the original Half-Life flashlight is pretty bad, having your whole screen green for long periods of time is also annoying, and with the amount of dark sections in this, you better get used to green. Also, the voltigore nests are just annoying.\n\nThat said, there are some nice new weapons included, including a couple alien weapons that are actually useful, unlike the Hivehand. There are some neat new enemies, and getting to see some areas from the base game from a different perspective is neat.\n\nUltimately, this isn't a bad expansion, but it also isn't easy to recommend.

most.","timestamp_created":1654566579,"timestamp_updated":1654566579,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460643798112869263","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116591442","author":{"steamid":"76561198994736079","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":2105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":134,"playtime_at_review":1633,"last_played":1659625291},"language":"turkish","review":"Xen'i

Особо спойлерить не буду, но если есть выбор между Blue Shift и Opposing Force советую в первую очередь купить второе.","timestamp_created":1654364195,"timestamp_updated":1654364195,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116479358","author":{"steamid":"76561199094210542","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":433,"last_played":1657493996},"language":"spanish","review":"messi","timestamp_created":1654359113,"timestamp_updated":1654359113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116445432","author":{"steamid":"76561198306871460","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1654296920},"language":"english","review":"Very good!
