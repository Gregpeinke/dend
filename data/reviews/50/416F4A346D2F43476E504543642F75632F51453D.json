The guards are different, the guns are different, the flashlight is different, even the zombies look different. What truly differentiates it is its focus. This game has a story of course, but it's a progression is a lot more focused on harder combat, a lot more platforming and a lot more utilising of NPCs; it's less lever turning or sequence solving than what there was in Halflife 1. It's a different experience, but it still feels like Halflife 1 and is still fun to play, Corporal Shepherd is also a cool character and he has some pretty cool interactions Gordon Freeman never managed to have. The stories of Halflife 1 and Opposing Force aren't just completely isolated either, there's plenty of brilliant crossovers between both.\n\nI will say, however, that while the ending was cool, the final sort of \"hurdle\" was kind of easy, even on a hard difficulty, but the rest of the game can be very hard, more so than the first as there is a lot less handholding as it expects the player to already to be accustomed to Halflife.","timestamp_created":1586123498,"timestamp_updated":1586123649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536723136901855469","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66704187","author":{"steamid":"76561198116467219","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":330,"last_played":1586108503},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life!
