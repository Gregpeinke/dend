В нем мы ближе знакомимся с главным союзником-женщиной, к которой может возникнуть симпатия, потому что она выглядит привлекательно, вся такая застенчевая и милая. Здесь мы все так же воюем против коалиции противников и спасаем планету. В отличии от Half-Life 2, эта игра проходится намного быстрее, привносит очень мало нового геймплея. Да, сюжет продолжается, герои лучше раскрываются (кроме главного конечно же), перестрелки все так же веселые и эпичные (на момент выхода игры).

This is what an expansion should be: an extension of both the story and the gameplay.  On the side of the story, you get to see what happens after the big events of HL2.  In that sense, it is a bit of an epilogue, or at least a transition to what happens after City 17.  Here, your goal is just to escape it, and you do that with Alyx, who in 2020, is still one of the best companions one has in gaming. I'll stick with what I said in my HL2 review: Valve writes some of the very best dialogue in gaming.  Games usually suck at dialogue and characterization; writing is generally quite poor in games.  But Valve knocks it out of the park every single time.  Alyx is an absolute treat to have as a partner: competent, effective, and written as an actual real person.  I can see how revolutionary it was to have this game appear 15 years ago.  The gameplay is great too; though I wish there were more opportunities for sniping, as that crossbow never gets old to use.  Anyways, this game still holds up extremely well in 2020: its action-packed, kinetic, and you're always kept on your toes.  10/10.","timestamp_created":1588060754,"timestamp_updated":1588060754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68163847","author":{"steamid":"76561198067743804","num_games_owned":330,"num_reviews":123,"playtime_forever":185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":185,"last_played":1588060189},"language":"english","review":"-Look Up!

Overall it's a fun romp, and mercifully free of tired vehicle sections.\n\nAlyx Vance is a blueprint for useful AI companions: Unlimited ammo, competent aiming, and unlimited health. Her quips are inoffensive enough, and she serves her purpose in the game's plot with her magic taser wand.\n\nThere is an unfortunate escort segment during the last chapter, wherein you're tasked with ushering the same suicidal robots (civilians with bad AI) you had in Half-Life 2. It consists of doing five laps back and forth, across a train terminal and a courtyard.\n\nBack and forth, and the same old problems occur as your AI squadmates directly disobey orders to move to a location or group up on you. The best strategy is just to come in hot and fast, otherwise they're likely to get gibbed by some Combine shotgunner.\n\nBesides that pace-destroying padding of a set-piece, this is worth picking up and adds some very welcome intrigue to the overarching Half-Life plot.","timestamp_created":1588057386,"timestamp_updated":1588057579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68161130","author":{"steamid":"76561198419044494","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1588055897},"language":"english","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1588056047,"timestamp_updated":1589546243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68149060","author":{"steamid":"76561198037246920","num_games_owned":1145,"num_reviews":150,"playtime_forever":259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":259,"last_played":1588028585},"language":"english","review":"Pretty much the exact same as the main game but it felt a little more interactive with the other characters and it felt like they made even more improvements on it.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1588034803,"timestamp_updated":1588034803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68148694","author":{"steamid":"76561198975838351","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1611281885},"language":"german","review":"<3","timestamp_created":1588034228,"timestamp_updated":1588034228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68142959","author":{"steamid":"76561197961580359","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":941,"last_played":1588177837},"language":"french","review":"Très boen","timestamp_created":1588024796,"timestamp_updated":1588024796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68123853","author":{"steamid":"76561198131063540","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1587569581},"language":"koreana","review":"재밌어요","timestamp_created":1587999936,"timestamp_updated":1587999936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68112503","author":{"steamid":"76561198825780056","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":290,"last_played":1587985521},"language":"english","review":"Good continuing of the previous game","timestamp_created":1587985550,"timestamp_updated":1587985550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq5HU3fECd4fqgwI="}
