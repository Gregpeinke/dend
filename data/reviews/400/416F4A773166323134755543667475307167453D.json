The usage of portals is an innovative and now-classic game mechanic that you can't really go wrong with.

A short but sweet game, not bad by any means, but not quite thinking with portals yet.

Öncelikle hikâyemiz, Cave Johnson tarafından 1952 senesinde duş perdesi üretmek için kurulmuş fakat daha sonra rakip firma olan Black Mesa gibi bilimin merkezine dönüşmüş olan Aperture Science içerisinde geçiyor. Kadın ana karakter Chell'i yönettiğimiz yapım, gözlerimizi açtığımız cam ile çevrili bir odada başlıyor. GLaDOS adı verilen yüksek yapay zeka sisteminin yönettiği bu tesiste, Aperture Science'ın en son teknolojilerinden birisi olan portal silahı için bir denek olarak yer alıyor ve çeşitli testlere tabi tutuluyoruz. Hikâyenin devamında olaylar karışıyor ve dallanıp budaklanıyor fakat Spoiler olmaması adına herhangi bir bilgi vermeyi düşünmüyorum. Senaryo dışında diğer noktalara göz atmamız gerekirse öncelikle seslendirmeler ve efektlerden bahsetmek istiyorum. Şahsen karakterlerin seslendirmeleri o kadar güzel ki oyunu oynarken keyifleniyor hatta GLaDOS bize laf sokarken bile eğleniyordum. Grafiklere ve kaplama detaylarına geçersek şahsen çıkış yapmış olduğu döneme göre oldukça başarılı bir iş çıkarıldığını söyleyebilirim. Zaten bildiğiniz üzere Source motoru ile yapıldığından Source'un karakteristik noktalarını gerek grafiksel gerekse mekaniksel olarak üzerinde fazlasıyla taşıyor. Oynanış dinamikleri olarak da göz atarsak şahsen son derece keyifli ve tatmin edici bir oynanış sunuyor diyebilirim. Yapım hakkında eleştireceğim tek nokta koşu mekaniğinin oyunda yer almıyor oluşu, koşamıyorsunuz bildiğiniz. Bunun haricinde eleştirilebilecek ve olumsuz bakılabilecek herhangi bir yönü bulunmuyor. Yapılan türkçe olumsuz incelemelere baktığımda tipik bir \"[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/]Portal 2[/url] daha güzel oyun bunu almayın\" yorumları var, adeta saçmalık. Her neyse, eğer farklı bir oyun deneyimi arıyorsanız veyahut gelecek temalı yapımlar ilginizi çekiyorsa kütüphanenize eklemenizi kesinlikle ama kesinlikle tavsiye ederim.\n\n13.04.2022 tarihli güncelleme notu: Yapımcı firma [url=https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/valve]Valve[/url], yine kendisine ait olan oyun konsolu Steam Deck için uyumluluk güncellemesi yayınladı.
