The physics are top-notch as always with Valve, but it's the story and voice-acting that really make this a classic.  GLADoS reprises her role as the snarky, evil supercomputer but there's also Wheatley, a well-meaning but bumbling and neurotic helper robot who sounds like he comes direct from a sitcom like The Office.  Mere voiceovers tell an intriguing and humorous story, and Wheatley's baleful single lens \"eye\" conveys more emotion than many Hollywood actors.
