Would you go for that? No? Well, I'm not finished. What if I had a first person shooter with terrible shooting? Still no? What about a platformer that's just in first person and you can't see your own feet? Or an action adventure game with long, unskippable cut scenes and no final boss battle? Oh, also, it ends with a cliff hanger. Would you like that? Well apparently if you mix all those things together you get the greatest game of all time. All it's missing is quick time events. \n\nOf course the only reason I ever bought this game is because I had been told for years how it was one of the greatest games ever made and so when it went on sale I jumped at the chance and I absolutely hated it. Of course I played it all the way through just so no one could accuse me of leaving too soon. I'm sorry, this game might have been something special back in 2004 (the year that San Andreas, Star Wars Battlefront, and Halo 2 came out) but it definitely doesn't hold up now. \n\nFirst of all, the parts I liked about it were the road trip sections. You ride either a small water craft or ATV across a dangerous wasteland and stop to pick up supplies as you please. Meanwhile, innumerable aliens and soldiers await around every corner. There are few, if any, cut scenes and most of the physics puzzles that take advantage of the then impressive and innovative physics engines occur in these sections. However, these sections only take up about 1/3rd of the game.\n\nAlso, the gravity gun, a device that pulls objects within a certain range toward you and shoots them forcefully away or gently piles them on top of other objects, was fairly interesting and cathartic, especially when you upgrade it toward the end of the game and use it to lay waste to all things before you. \n\nOut of everything HL2 pretends to be, foremost is perhaps a first person shooter. However, this might be one of the most generic shooters I've ever played. For supposedly being a futuristic game, all of the guns are shockingly bog-standard, outside of a plasma rifle that has the special ability of shooting a slow energy ball that bounces around a bit and is easily dodged by enemies. Also, the guns are incredibly boring to shoot, except for maybe the magnum revolver, and I might just be being generous. They all sound and kick like pellet guns, even the shotgun. One unique weapon is a gland you can throw like a grenade that commands giant bugs to kill your enemies. This was my favorite weapon because the bugs would kill everything and I wouldn't have to do anything. That's when I realized that I hated the shooting so much that I opted for the weapon that let me avoid doing it. \n\nAlso, the enemy variety is garbage. For the most part, you fight annoying little drones, soldiers, jumping bugs, and zombies oh boy how original are we? I'll talk about about the jumping bugs when I gripe about the horror aspects but right now I want to harp on how boring it is to shoot dozens and dozens and dozens of generic soldiers. The only variety comes when they change the color of their armor, and that just means that they have more health and deal more damage. Color me thrilled. There's little or no strategy involved, mostly because 90% of all combat happens in stifling corridors. So, either they run right out and charge you or they take potshots at you from cover you can't see, often while those intolerable drones swarm you like mosquitos. It's so frustrating. Half the time soldiers jump out at you like jack in the boxes with no chance for you to prepare, making those levels feel like the longest rail shooter. The other half of the time the game will pelt you with endless enemies without distinguishing which circumstance you're in, and you don't realize it until you've run out of ammo and died a thousand times that you're expected to keep moving or shoot a giant robot. Really, the combat feels like a chore. \n\nNow let's talk level design. It's just the worst. There's something so deliberate, generic, and clinical about the production design that makes everything feel unreal and keeps the atmosphere from ever sinking in. Furthermore, the levels themselves are either cramped, linear corridors that shepherd you forward like livestock or they're obtuse open spaces with no clue as to where you're supposed to go next. Dozens of times I ended up backtracking for minutes to see if I missed a ladder or a door, only to find that what I thought was a corner of a room actually opened into yet another corridor that blended into the endless concrete walls, or what I thought was a pile of debris was actually a hole in the ground. Sometimes, the way forward is opened by a scripted event, like an explosion indistinguishable from the thousands of other explosions you've heard throughout the game, but if you happen to be hiding in cover like a sane person you'll miss the scripted  event. The worst part of these levels is that each and every one is too long. Even the levels I liked wore out their welcome by the time I finished them. Too much padding and filler of endless grey halls and piles of meticulously stacked garbage.\n\nThe most frustrating part of the level design for me is the inclusion of a ridiculous amount of required precision platforming sections. First of all, it's a first person game. Secondly, you can't see your feet so there's often no telling if you'll make the jump or not. Lastly, your character bounces violently off of walls, slides an extra six inches forwards upon landing, or gets caught up on one or two pixels of texture that kill your jump altogether. Essentially, the platforming is garbage but there's no avoiding it.\n\nThe game also has a few oddly placed horror elements. There is a spider like bug that jumps out at you and creates zombies, some of which run and some of which throw other bugs at you. I won't lie, at first these bugs really make your skin crawl, especially when they hide and wait in dark corners, requiring you to use your flashlight (whose power for some reason is also tied to your sprint meter). However, they really lose their edge after the hundredth time they jump out at you. Furthermore, after the designated haunted sawmill town level they continue to show up in random places, raising my blood pressure in irritation every single time. There are also larger jumping bugs that appear when you move on sand, which you can eventually turn to your side. Not scary, but keeps you moving along at a good pace until you aren't sure where you're supposed to go next. Lastly, there are these long tongues descending from the ceiling that slowly lift you up and eat you. They are just there to annoy you and thankfully are gone after the first half of the game. \n\nLastly, the story is fine. It's about starting a resistance against the most boring dictatorship of all time. The problem is that there are only two likeable characters in the entire game: The one legged scientist man you see three times and the midwestern resistance fighter  who shows up for one level. Your love interest is annoying and sans any chemistry, the main villain reminds me of a high school principal, and the only other characters are resistance allies that only serve to run out and get killed immediately or get in my way when I'm shooting the rocket launcher, killing us both. The main problem with the writing is that the story is told in extremely long expository conversations that technically aren't cut scenes but can't be ended early and can't be bypassed and are thus essentially cut scenes.\n\nAll in all, a frustrating game that isn't worth the time required to play it. Don't hold your breath for Half Life 3.","timestamp_created":1563074076,"timestamp_updated":1563074475,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477635473012924194","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54084512","author":{"steamid":"76561198357598638","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":541,"last_played":1573271296},"language":"english","review":"this game i recommend it 5/5. its awesome. tbh this game makes me dizzy while playing it because u need to think about it same as examination/IQ. to find where the answers. yes of cause the graphic is okay. the characters also cool.","timestamp_created":1563072577,"timestamp_updated":1563072577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54082783","author":{"steamid":"76561198071288823","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":900,"last_played":1562993394},"language":"english","review":"Its Half Life 2","timestamp_created":1563062169,"timestamp_updated":1563062169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480686694383621216","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54081444","author":{"steamid":"76561198446363797","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":15008,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14990,"last_played":1568123429},"language":"german","review":"Nice game!","timestamp_created":1563055457,"timestamp_updated":1563055457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.609819293022155762","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54081209","author":{"steamid":"76561198341445051","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":86,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1563502222},"language":"russian","review":"Даже сейчас в 2к19, игра выглядит просто божественно, когда я был подростком, эта была любовь - с первого взгляда.","timestamp_created":1563054295,"timestamp_updated":1563054295,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54080622","author":{"steamid":"76561198157488132","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":242,"last_played":1562354575},"language":"english","review":"Thank you Valve, from the bottom of my heart, for this truly  amazing, timeless masterpiece of a two-part video game series.
