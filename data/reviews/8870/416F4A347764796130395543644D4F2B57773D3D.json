Great fucking idea Booker. Why didn't you? Apparently Booker wanted to live the high life and choose the First Lady Airship instead, a hard to get, behind-closed-doors airship. It just shows that Bioshock Infinate has a weak storyline disguised as something great. And it fooled lots of people to. 50,000 people. I dont have time to explain this games bullshit.

Os visuais, os cenarios! São lindos! A quantidade de detalhes é absurda, o jogo é \"vivo\", pessoas conversando, trabalhando, interagindo, é incrivel.\n\n Um ponto negativo para alguns é que o gameplay não é tão interessante, na verdade é meio enjoativo e simples. Não é ruim, longe disso, mas tambem não é nada excepcional. E as 2 dlc da história, burial at sea episodio 1 e 2, eu pessoalmente não gostei muito do segundo episodio, do gameplay dele, mas isso se deve a eu não gostar muito de games stealth, e esse segundo episodio muda o gameplay para focar bastante nisso.

Por onde começar? Talvez em 2013. Quando o jogo começou a ganhar mais atenção (apesar de seus vários atrasos no lançamento), eu não ia muito com a cara dele não. Já conhecia os dois jogos anteriores da trilogia e já era um grande fã, olhei torto pra Infinite por que era uma mudança bem radical. Quer dizer, um jogo de ação? Uma cidade no ar? Onde estava Rapture? Onde estavam os big daddies? As littles sisters? Enfim. Passei um bom tempo sem sequer ter a oportunidade de jogar Bioshock Infinite, mas aqui e ali eu sempre via notícias do jogo, e alguns pedaços de gameplays do começo do mesmo, e vi que a trilogia estava numa promoção imperdível nessa Summer Sale de 2016 e decidi dar uma chance a Columbia. \n\nE eu quebrei a cara.\n\nEu não fazia ideia do quanto esse jogo era fantástico, muito menos que sua história era tão bem elaborada e complexa (eu realmente cheguei a repetir o final duas vezes e fiquei re-passando a história mentalmente pra ter certeza de que entendi tudo). Bioshock Infinite supera os dois primeiros em quase todos os aspectos (exceto o fato de você carregar um maldito Drill no segundo jogo xD ). Columbia é lindíssima, e rica em detalhes. Os gráficos são muito lindos, a trilha sonora é fantástica e cai como uma luva em cada momento. As personalidades do Booker e da Elizabeth são muito bem criadas e cativantes, além da dublagem dos mesmos que também são fantásticas. O jogo em geral é bem divertido e felizmente não estica a história demais, nem apressa demais. Cada momento de revelação de atinge de verdade. Por ser uma mudança radical dos dois primeiros, talvez se você for um fã do Bio 1 e do Bio 2, não goste do Infinite, mas o oposto também acontece. Talvez você não tenha gostado dos dois primeiros, mas goste do Infinite.

Muoversi a Columbia è uno spettacolo per gli occhi, anche più che muoversi a Rapture e riesce a dare un senso di ingabbiamento, proprio come nei capitoli precedenti, anche se sopsesa nell'aria. Ottimo comparto tecnico e doppiaggio.\n\nRiesce ad incanalare diverse emozioni: tensione, paura, preoccupazione, amore. Tutto in un unico rapporto tra soli due personaggi, Brooker DeWitt ed Elisabeth.\n\nQuest'ultima merita un paragrafo a parte: è un personaggio particolare, ben caratterizzato e di cui mi sono praticamente innamorato.

Das Game raubt einem tatsächlich den Atem.

Bei Games als auch bei Filmen. Tja, ich wurde geknackt ... \n\n-Extrem gut ausgearbeitete Welt (Lückenlos)\n-Steampunk (ja ok, Steampunk passt eher ins Viktorianische-England ... wie nennt man das sosnst) wissenschaftlich und plausibel dargestellt. Lückenlos. Scheint, dass sich das Team Hilfe von einigen Wissenschaftlern geholt hat.\n-Spielmechanik ist sehr gut und perfekt ausgebaut, Es ist nahezu unmöglich alà CoD durch Horden von Gegner zu metzeln ... Man muss denken und auch mal zusehen nicht den großen Krieger zu spielen.\n\n-Tolle Animationen\n-Spitzen Graphic (selbst jetzt, 3 Jahre, nach dem Release noch !!!)\n-Gut ausgearbeitete Videos, die man nicht skippen will, da spannend, interessant, oder sogar sehr relevant !\n-Sehr geiles Designe ! Von den einzelnen Soldaten, über die normalen Bewohner Columbias bis hin zu den Charakteren. Ich muss zugeben, Elizabeth kam rüber wie ein wasch echter Mensch (Großes Lob an die Synchro). Vorallem bei der Strand-Szene. Bei vielen Animationen dachte ich immer, dass es soooo real aussieht (Bewegungsabläufe und und und ...). Und das gilt eigentlich auch für die anderen Charaktere.\n-Extrem gute, packende, realistische und spannende Dialoge.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nContras:\n-Ich hatte nur einmal das Gefühl, dass es zu sehr in Richtung Ego-Shooter alà CoD geht (wo sag ich jetzt nciht, da Spoiler).

I was expecting to go into this game thinking it would be a crummy/average game, but my expectations raised through the roof almost a quarter into the game. You don't even have to play the other Bioshock games to be caught up with the story, it's a whole new plot. This game can definitely be considered an emotional roller coaster that most people should get on immediately. I usually don't get affected by games from an emotional perspective, but this game definitely got me to feel something I usually don't feel with most games. The player can truly relate to the characters and the story in general which makes it much more enjoyable. I am currently in the middle of playing this game for the second time and will probably end up playing it a third. If you're worried that you cannot run the game, take it from someone who has a below average computer. If you change up some of the video settings in the option menu and run it in windowed mode, you should be able to run it fine. I had nearly 60 FPS and I can't even get 30 on Minecraft. I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone.","timestamp_created":1467381771,"timestamp_updated":1467381771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23985377","author":{"steamid":"76561198281816324","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1012,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":696,"last_played":1467180627},"language":"english","review":"I restrained from using Vigors as believed in my aiming and shooting skills in FPS genre.\nI apologize to Elizabeth for reviving me countless times because of my stupid stubbornness.
