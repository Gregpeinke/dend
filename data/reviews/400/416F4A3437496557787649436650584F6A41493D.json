Portal.\nИгра, просто культовая. Знают о ней практически все, и играла в неё немалое количество. \nПоиграл я в это чудо, только в 2020 году. И мне жаль, что так поздно.\nПосле, я приобрёл её в Стиме, и поставил задачу, собрать все достижения. И я это сделал. Для 100% прохождения мне понадобилось 7 часов.\nИ многие говорили что выполнить все нормативы ОЧЕНЬ сложно. И действительно. Когда я смотрел их прохождения, я думал что никогда это не пройду. Но в итоге мне понадобилось немного времени, терпения, и мой скилл. И вуаля, я сделал ТО, что сделало только 1.8% игроков, в культовой игре. Очень собой горжусь.\n\nСюжет: Пускай это и называют техно-бэткой. Но сюжет интересный. Пускай и такой лёгкий, и не запутанный. Но простой и понятный. Он мне приглянулся, и при первом прохождении, мне было интересно что будет дальше. Короче за сюжет плюс.\n\nГеймплей: Нечего сказать, просто ВО. Замечательная головоломка. Не сказал, что прям сложная, но при первом прохождении заставляет подумать. В камерах очень много решений может быть. И иногда, я удивлялся когда находил новые решения головоломок. \nОсобенно порадовали усложнённые камеры, очень круто спроектированы. Кроме 17-ой. Ужасная.\nЧто насчёт нормативов. Нужно сделать минимальное количество порталов, пройти за минимальное время, и минимум шагов. Первые два, ясные и понятные, но вот 3-ие. Просто ужасное решение. Нормативы где нужно сделать минимум шагов самые тупые, которые можно было придумать. Но в целом, привыкаешь, и становиться не так сложно. Удивляло, то, что некоторые места, будто кроме как багами, невозможно пройти некоторые нормативы. Будто сами разрабы, их понаставили.\n\nМузыка:. Её особо нет, и это минус. Нет хороших, запоминающихся треков.\n\nИтоги: Просто замечательная игра.

Ad introdurci ai test dopo essere stati svegliati, sarà la voce di GLaDOS, un IA che sembra gestire l’intero centro di ricerca. Il background narrativo è risicato, ma capiremo lentamente le sfaccettature della trama proprio grazie a GLaDOS. L’IA infatti è molto particolare. E’ stata progettata per essere incoraggiante e disponibile, cosa che si può intuire fin da subito attraverso il suo tono di voce, tuttavia i suoi intenti sono ben lontani dall aiutarci nel prosieguo dei test. Essendo la protagonista muta ed essendoci una totale assenza di npc, è GLaDOS che arricchisce, con il suo humor nero, l’esperienza del giocatore. GLaDOS non solo ci introduce le meccaniche di gioco e ci fornisce informazioni sulla trama, ma il suo tono e soprattutto i suoi discorsi, contribuisco a creare un'atmosfera singolare ed è sostanzialmente lei che dirige la trama, facendoci sentire praticamente in balia delle sue scelte. Vi è anche una lieve impronta psicologica che viene data alla trama, non solo con il rapporto con l’IA ma anche con alcuni elementi dei puzzle, impronta marcata sempre da GLaDOS, che sembra voglia farci soffrire. Così attraverso i discorsi e le azioni di GLaDOS il gioco alterna in maniera perfetta macabro ed esilarante in un assortimento unico.\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nSi basa fondamentalmente sull’utilizzo della Portal Gun. Attraverso di essa sarà possibile creare 2 portali su superfici apposite. I due portali creano un collegamento visivo e fisico tra loro, ciò permette a qualsiasi cosa di attraversarli. Altra particolarità dei portali è che essi conservano la quantità di moto di chi o cosa li oltrepassa. In questo modo si possono creare diverse possibilità e soluzioni per la risoluzione dei puzzle. Vi sono però dei limiti, per esempio non si possono creare più di due portali(uno blu ed uno arancione), creare un altro portale dello stesso colore in un altro luogo farà sparire quello precedente ma non altererà in alcun modo quello dell’altro colore ed infine vi sono, nei livelli più avanzati, barriere che resettano la portal gun, chiudendo se attraversati qualsiasi portale. I Rompicapo sono estremamente vari e progressivamente complicati, risultando in una buona sfida. Avremo la possibilità di spostare oggetti e saranno a volte presenti torrette robot e sfere di energia che possono causare la morte della protagonista.\n[h1]Comparto Tecnico[/h1]\nSeppur del 2007, l’estrema semplicità ed asetticità delle stanze e del complesso di ricerca in generale, graficamente il Source Engine si difende bene. Solo alcune texture in bassa risoluzione e degli effetti luce e particellari non perfetti ma nel complesso risulta gradevole anche grazie alle fluide animazioni di oggetti nello scenario. La colonna sonora ricalca l’atmosfera che GLaDOS crea con i suoi discorsi, risultando un po dark e misteriosa e per gran parte del titolo calma e pacata, quasi a dare, oltre al leggero sensazione di macabro mistero, un suono rilassante al soggetto dei test. Memorabile “Still Alive” nei titoli di coda.\n[h1]Conclusione[/h1]\nUn antagonista dall’eccellente caratterizzazione, un'ambientazione tanto sterile quanto d’atmosfera, rompicapo ben studiati e variegati, meccaniche semplici ma estremamente efficaci e divertenti. Una combinazione di elementi riuscitissimi che eclissano i pochissimi difetti riscontrabili nel comparto tecnico, nella longevità e nella storia non troppo bene approfondita ma ben narrata.

However, as someone who has completed this game by earning all of the steam achievements: don't. The physics engine is way too janky and save files are super inconsistent. The advanced maps are somewhat fun, but the Portal challenges are just a huge pain, even with a tutorial. Everything is way too inconsistent and RNG based, and the time limits are way too tight. Granted, they are supposed to be challenges, but that doesn't mean that they should be torture. Most of these aspects were largely fixed in the sequel, so if you want to challenge yourself in a fun way, maybe try that one instead. However, don't try the time challenges unless you really think you are that skilled of a gamer.","timestamp_created":1591496922,"timestamp_updated":1591496922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70416220","author":{"steamid":"76561198857823914","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1642708119},"language":"english","review":"no walter white DLC","timestamp_created":1591492493,"timestamp_updated":1657327728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47IeWxvICfPXOjAI="}
