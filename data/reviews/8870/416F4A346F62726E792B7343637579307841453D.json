Racism, anarchy, slavery, time travel, alternate realities, quantum physics, death, terrible parenting, the list could go on. And through simple character interactions, cutscenes, optional quests and voxophone recordings (in game audiolog collectibles), and enough patience, you could piece together one of the most complex and mind-blowing stories I've ever had the pleasure to experience.\nI recommend not only this game, but, I also recommend the Burial at the Sea DLC, as well the previous 2 BioShock games, because the story of those games and the mechanics are incredible.","timestamp_created":1561774346,"timestamp_updated":1561774346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51573609","author":{"steamid":"76561197970629266","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1562030494},"language":"english","review":"Its good","timestamp_created":1561774280,"timestamp_updated":1561774280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51572121","author":{"steamid":"76561198842524922","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":512,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":64,"last_played":1655030306},"language":"russian","review":"[table]\n[tr]    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU9xBU71NTg\n[td][h1][i]⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀♫ Hey Violet: Smash Into You ♫⠀⠀⠀⠀[/i][/h1]\n[h1]───────⚪───────────────────────────────────[/h1]\n⠀▐▐ ⠀►▏ ⠀⠀──○─ 🔊 ⠀₁:₂₅ / ₃:₅₀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ᴴᴰ⚙ ❐ ⊏⊐[/td]","timestamp_created":1561774153,"timestamp_updated":1605277362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51571791","author":{"steamid":"76561198079129732","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1027,"last_played":1639006344},"language":"brazilian","review":"extremamente lindo e tocante","timestamp_created":1561774122,"timestamp_updated":1561774122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51571346","author":{"steamid":"76561198113240661","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":556,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":526,"last_played":1621830253},"language":"english","review":"This game is goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood.","timestamp_created":1561774084,"timestamp_updated":1561774084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51570539","author":{"steamid":"76561198215904236","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":605,"playtime_at_review":288,"last_played":1659972342},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun senaryo ve diğer her şey olarak acayip sarıyor.

Infinite, es un increíble juego, siendo en mi opinión el mejor de la trilogía.\nVeo que se ha logrado un enlace casi perfecto entre Elizabeth y Booker, siendo sus conversaciones casi naturales, siendo pocos los momentos en los que no parecen conversaciones normales entre dos personas (teniendo en cuenta las preguntas y diálogos que tendrían dos personas en tal situación claramente).\nSu final, a pesar de ser algo confuso (y un final abierto), es impactante y  te deja pensando un buen rato.\nEn esta entrega, se le quita importancia a los vigorizadores (Plásmidos), lo cual es desaprovechar las posibilidades de el juego, siendo que no es completamente necesario utilizarlos como en Bioshock 1 (Bioshock 2 no, ya que no esta dirigido por Ken Levine), además de que los vigorizadores son muchos menos comparados con los de la primera entrega.\nA opinión personal fue una gran desición cambiar de escenario, siendo en este juego, la ciudad de Columbia, a diferencia de en anteriores entregas, la cual es la ciudad de Rapture, aunque si es que en momentos se extraña Rapture, es por eso que los DLC ocurran en Rapture, fue una magnífica idea.\nLos gráficos son épicos, inclusive en las resoluciones más bajas, la iluminación es magnífica y esta muy bien lograda.\nLos bugs, no son muchos, pero existen, (SPOILER) al cambiar de dimensión por primera vez, y vamos a la armería, al bajar, las señora Lin, nos impide el paso, siendo esto algo molesto, aunque no tan difícil de solucionar.\nUn trabajo magnífico por parte de Irrational

Приобретена была в составе набора на распродаже, большего я не порекомендую никому на нее потратить. \nОднообразный и поразительно унылый геймплей. \nНужно серьезно постараться, чтобы остаться и без ресурсов, и без патронов, т.к. ваша спутница постоянно будет вас отвлекать своими \"находками\".\nДа и запороть игру можно только если упорно промахиваться по кнопке \"F\".\nСюжет не зацепил. Игра была закончена, закрыта, и забылась напрочь через несколько минут.\nПочти всё наигранное время - это удерживание себя перед монитором и попытка найти то, за что игра снискала такие восторженные отзывы.","timestamp_created":1561646471,"timestamp_updated":1561646471,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.453563541173934937","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51494388","author":{"steamid":"76561198812439490","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3049,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3018,"last_played":1566140714},"language":"tchinese","review":"不愧是第九藝術 玩了兩三次依舊震撼和驚喜","timestamp_created":1561635892,"timestamp_updated":1561635892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51494292","author":{"steamid":"76561198107686976","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1766,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1169,"last_played":1572685143},"language":"schinese","review":"什么是第九艺术？我想，生化奇兵：无限完美地诠释了游戏艺术。惊艳绝伦的天空之城哥伦比亚、与气氛融为一体的配乐、种类繁多的枪械魔法及其组合出的不同战术、扣人心弦的剧情、多样化的叙事。还有，那个无法忘记的天使——伊丽莎白Elizabeth","timestamp_created":1561635631,"timestamp_updated":1561635631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51493824","author":{"steamid":"76561198240113372","num_games_owned":1696,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":24676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3219,"last_played":1623402330},"language":"turkish","review":"HAVE A NİCE DAY FOR  YOU\n\n[td]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiXpD6wjFp0\n\nhttps://youtu.be/P9XcDKNoZ1g\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AsbyoZitBrk","timestamp_created":1561634340,"timestamp_updated":1624544527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.645145416259765625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51493444","author":{"steamid":"76561198318427333","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":3940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1033,"last_played":1656935344},"language":"russian","review":"Классная игра,развязка незаурядная!
