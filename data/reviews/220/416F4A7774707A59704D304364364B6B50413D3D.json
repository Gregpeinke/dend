Хотя я уверен, что все они в неё играли.\n\nПроходил эту игру тысячу раз.\nЭто классическая стрелялка от первого лица с отличным игровым шаблоном - опыт игрока тонко с оркестрован. Сильно развито пространственное взаимоотношение игрока с миром. Отличная физика, есть простые физические голволомки. На момент выпуска игра распологала на то время продвинутую систему лицевой анимации - персонажи дейстивтельно живые и правдоподопные.\nОтличная атмосфера, интересный вымышленный мир, история и сюжет. Игровой процесс разнообразный, имеет занимательную прогрессию, так что фактор скуки пониженный.\n\nИгровой мир довольно глубок, имея свои загадки. Игроку всё не объясняют, так что ему/ей по большей части придётся всё додумывать самостоятельно. История отчасти повествуется не словами, а действиями и общими картинами. Персонажи уникальны, продуманы и взаимосвязаны между собой, включая главного героя, который, однако, всё время молчит.\n\nЧто насчёт графики, то на момент 2015 года она немножко устарела. Её можно улучшить с помощью некоторых модов. Один из таких называется Cinematic Mod, который переделывает все туры, добавляет красивые графические эффекты и повышает сложность, и тем самым увеличивая удовольствие от повторного переигрывания.\n\nИгра отличная.

After replaying Half Life 2, I've appreciated it more, but it still has some really glaring issues.\n\nNow, Half Life 2 is pretty much a must-own for any Steam gamer, as it offers a view of a truly revolutionary game. However, its main issues lie mostly in the overall length and story. So a large portion of the game (specifically the Highway, Sandtraps, and Nova Prospekt levels) feel like filler and drag on for far too long, and end up getting really tedious. You're also stripped of story for almost the entire middle section.\n\nHalf Life 2 really shines in the beginning and end levels. The first level in the game is perhaps the best introduction of any game I've ever played, and the following levels are strong as well. The ending levels are also excellent.\n\nOverall, Half Life 2 is really a game anyone should buy, just don't expect it to outshine every other FPS.\n\n7/10","timestamp_created":1431996335,"timestamp_updated":1431996335,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15892984","author":{"steamid":"76561198057397426","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":586,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":534,"last_played":1428478826},"language":"english","review":"fun.","timestamp_created":1431994460,"timestamp_updated":1431994460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15892523","author":{"steamid":"76561198009360703","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":712,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":712,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Yea this was good, right till the end scene, and then we have the mod for Half Life 2 :D\n\nI enjoyed the lost coast!\n\nValve Bring Back Left 4 Dead 2","timestamp_created":1431992084,"timestamp_updated":1431992084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15890364","author":{"steamid":"76561198020262609","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":1504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1447,"last_played":1505853331},"language":"english","review":"The epic sci-fi tale continues...","timestamp_created":1431980233,"timestamp_updated":1431980233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531976282596588135","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15890272","author":{"steamid":"76561198030720390","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":4360,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4347,"last_played":1439486651},"language":"english","review":"What can you say about Half Life 2 that hasn't already been said? \n\nIts a great game, though its starting to show its age.\n\nWill there be a Half Life 3?

We are coterminous. There is no distance between us. No false veils of time or space may intervene. We see you still in Black Mesa. Clearly we see you in the Nihilanth's chamber. We bear witness to the bright eternity of the Nihilanth's demise. You leap, you fall, we see you flash between the barriers. We are there still, in observance of your final stroke. While our own lay scattered at your feet, you severed the vortal cord that bound the Nihilanth to life, and to us. That sharp spur of hope has not dulled to this day. For once the lesser master lay defeated, we knew the greater must also fall in time.\n\nFor a brief time you joined with us. You are one. Between the worlds. Communion of the Vortessence. And that other: a deeper mystery. No deeper than the void itself. We cannot forget those whose cords you cut. Forgiveness is not ours to bestow. Unity of purpose, the shattering of common shackles, a single road we tread. Your song we sing and shall sing for eternity. No matter the consequences of this struggle. You have brought us grief and jubilation beyond measure. With you beside us, a talisman of victory, the day of freedom draws nigh.\n\nYour bright face obscures your darker mask. We call you sib, although your mind and meaning are a mystery to us. Far distant eyes look out through yours. Something secret steers us both. We shall not name it. We have endured these chafing bonds for eons, yet a single moment of further servitude seems intolerable! How often have we slipped our yoke, only to find it choking us again. Let this war end in either total victory or our extinction. No further compromise shall we allow. We take our stand beside you, here, upon this miserable rock.\n\nThe way ahead is dark for the moment. What seems to you a sacrifice is merely, to us, an oscillation. We do not fear the interval of darkness. We are a tapestry woven of Vortessence. It is the same for you if only you would see it. How many are there in you? Whose hopes and dreams do you encompass? Could you but see the eyes inside your own, the minds in your mind, you would see how much we share.\n\n We are you, Freeman. And you are us.","timestamp_created":1431507423,"timestamp_updated":1431507423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":219,"votes_funny":52,"weighted_vote_score":"0.835225522518157959","comment_count":11,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15808638","author":{"steamid":"76561198009671381","num_games_owned":2507,"num_reviews":307,"playtime_forever":2019,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2017,"last_played":1527193303},"language":"english","review":"It's a good game.I recommend you buy and play it.","timestamp_created":1431496977,"timestamp_updated":1431635107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15808126","author":{"steamid":"76561198066845611","num_games_owned":277,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1565,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1454,"last_played":1390910933},"language":"brazilian","review":"Half Life 1 foi o jogo do ano, Half Life 2 foi o jogo da decada, provavelmente Half Life 3 será o jogo do seculo\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1431491687,"timestamp_updated":1517448737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15807883","author":{"steamid":"76561197997773645","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":3842,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3842,"last_played":1515534153},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite games of all time and i'm pretty sure most people would say the same. Played it when when i got steam. My dad played it first mostly (since then has retired because, well, raging lol. I just love the story. playing it over and over. I have it on my ps3. I use to play the whole series once a month for like 3 years. I had a schedule when i played. Come home from school friday ( do homework first , or didn't have any) Play half life 2  then it ends at 9pm or something. Next day 5am play episode 1 then after that i start episode 2. always ended at 12pm. I wish i could do this now but can't cause im F u c k ing working friday nights and saturday nights. I have a good time when i'm scheduling it, because it's like nostaliga for me. Btw i can't spell cause im reveiwing most games in my account. Half life: Alyx. Won't be playing that until i get out of the military probabley. valve is trolling everyone to buy a $1000 vr headset which i don't care. never played half life 1 ever. I started playing blackmesa last year. but stopped cause they didn't have the xen maps and the game has been out for ike 6 years lmao.
