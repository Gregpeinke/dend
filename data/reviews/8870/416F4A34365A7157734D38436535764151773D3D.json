Y cuando digo cierre no me refiero a que cada personaje cierra su ciclo luego de jugar Panteón Marino sino, más bien, te ayuda a comprender porque pasa lo que pasa. Entonces, atando cabos... podés comprender completamente la historia y trazar una línea en los hechos.\n\nEl punto fuerte y por el cual recomiendo con propiedad esta obra de arte devenida en videojuego, es la historia y sus \"constantes y variables\" que giran en torno a ella. Es un mandato obligado jugar los anteriores 2 y si continuas con Infinite, es imperativo adquirir los DLC para ponerle la frutilla de la torta a esta fantástica historia.\nRealmente fue un placer jugarlo y entenderlo. Obviamente aún no alcancé todos los logros pero, ahora que ya fue finalizado, puedo alcanzarlos jugando de una manera mas relajada.\n\nLe otorgo un puntaje 11/10!!!","timestamp_created":1440870819,"timestamp_updated":1440870819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17776804","author":{"steamid":"76561198078811373","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1937,"last_played":1441904264},"language":"english","review":"This game is literally driving me crazy!

Unlike the first two games, now you're not a survivor or a Monstrous-like creature who roam an underwater city, now you're Booker DeWitt, a war veteran with unknown debts and now tasked to rescue a girl in a flying city, Columbia.\nColumbia, unlike rapture, is a beatiful city. Everyone's happy until you showed up and accused for being a false sheperd. Now the whole city is your enemy, and you must fight your way to save Elizabeth, a Mysterious girl guarded by a giant steam-powered beast known as The Songbird and of course the ruler of the city, Comstock.\n\nThe game now is not about survival, it's about a fight. So, you're not spending time collecting medkits and eve or planning an attack on splicers like the first two games, It's a whole different genre. In Bioshock: infinite, the combat is fast, more weapons and ammunitions so you don't need to save ammunitions like in the first two games. Also there are Vigors, pretty much like Plasmids, but with the fast combat system, using these superpowers is much more fun as you can combine one vigor with others. and you don't have to worry about the Salts (Eve version of Bioshock Infinite) or ammunitions and medkits, because Elizabeth is one of the best NPC Companion ever (She'll find those things in a fight) \nAnd for the world and the story, it's pretty good. The vibe and the music of the game is awesome.

Прохождение по аналогии с предыдущими биошоками, но с доработками конечно же. К примеру, в предыдущих биошоках персонаж таскал с собой тучу оружия и в бою игрок превращался в пианиста, потому как приходилось постоянно переключаться между разным оружием и разными видами патронов(кто играл, тот знает). Здесь же проще: что под ногами валялось, то схватил и пошел стрелять, с собой носишь только два оружия, пистолет (постянно) и что-либо посерьезнее (из того что находишь у убитых противников или в процессе исследования местности). Тоников, как в прошлых частях игры, нет, их роль заменила одежда, которая обладает определенными свойствами. Плазмиды схожи по свойствам с предыдущими играми (пока не все собрал).

The developers of the game wen't all out with this one and it turned out just fine. The game visually looks like a painting and it's a beautiful site to behold. Often I stop and take in all that I am looking at. The people in the background doing their own thing, Barbershop quartet. But I feel that all of this really overshadows the rest of the game. Is Bioshock Infinite overrated? Yes, but I still think it's worthy of a playthrough. I feel that too many people praized this game eventhough it's not that amazing as people say it is. If you like a story with a FPS Style themed game, than you would enjoy this for sure.\n\nSo, here's the story. The story is about the protagonist of the game, Booker dewitt who has find a girl named Elizabeth and bring to her back to a certain person in New York. Once he finds Elizabeth, you'll be surprised at how good and realistic they made her. Almost all the time through the game, her character was very spontanious. The voice acting in the game is very satisfying. The combat in the game is also pretty satisfying as well. I played with the sniper rifle pretty much the whole time in my playthrough because I found it awesome to see the enemies head blow off when shoot. I found this game also to be a handy tool to improve your aim in games. And with the new addition of vigors, you'll have more variation in your kills. Something that was a little disappointing in the game was the half non and half linear level design and I love games where you can explore everything in the level but this game sort of lacks that. I also don't like that you walk in an empty room, go into the next door, all enemies and you kill them, walk into another empty area and walk upstairs and more enemies and kill them all and then another empty area. If you know what I am talking about, you'll understand what I mean. \n\nBut this is the thing that I truly dislike the most about the game. It's too damn easy! Yes, when you are in combat, Elizabeth often throws you ammo, salts, and health whenever something is low and I actually don't like the idea of that. I also don't like when you press a key on the keyboard and there's an arrow that points you in the right direction. I'd rather ignore all of these things and enjoy the game without it being this easy. I'd like a challenge with these types of games. There are different types of big daddy's in this game now and they are like elderly people put into this body to prolong their life. Without spoilers I would like to say my opinions of the ending. Let me just say, ending are not always that easy when people make a game and this ending is a little illogical at first, but on further notice you begin to think more about it and you kind of reflect about everything that happened in the game. Apart from that I would give it a 7/10. You should better play the original Bioshock because that is a true classic. This game got too much praize for what it was actually not, but I'd still reccommend it.","timestamp_created":1440747633,"timestamp_updated":1440801169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588161885738372803","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17748174","author":{"steamid":"76561198061964475","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":579,"last_played":1483808186},"language":"english","review":"Great game with a great story.

The whole concept of infinite universes and 'constants and variables' is an ever present theme throughout the series. \n\nAfter completing the base game, I was left with a few questions, but the two follow-up DLCs: Burial at Sea 1 & 2, gave me such an emotional and satisfying ending that I was left with no ill-feelings. I'll just say straight up that if you love a good story, which is so massive and complex, yet understandable, this game is perfect for you.\n\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\n----------------------------------\nBioshock Infinite has some very enjoyable gameplay. Combining FPS, with rapid skylines, and vigors (special abilities), makes this game mind blowingly awesome. Every shot, every power, feels impactful. The visual detail is stunning for a game which has an almost 'cartoony' feel to it. Riding skylines, and hopping from location to location feels amazing and action-filled as you quickly hop off to take down an enemy, only to run back and swing along looking for your next target. \n\nFor the more tactical players, setting off vigor traps, or possessing enemy structures can turn the tide of battle in an instant. \n\nThe weapons....oh man the weapons. The time period of this game brings back all the 'old-school' weapons which have a certain kind of feel to them which can't be explained. The detail of the gun models, the sounds, the firing rate, and the damage it inflicts just gives a satisfying feeling at the end of a battle. There are all kinds of weapons for any kind of player. Snipers, pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers, and a ton more. \n\nGameplay wise, this game deserves a playthrough at the very least...but no, there's more...\n\n[b]Characters[/b]\n----------------------------------\nOh my god, where do I begin?? First off, Elizabeth is possibly the most lovable, attractive, helpful character I've ever seen in a game, period.\n\nThe voice actors for both Booker, and Elizabeth are simply amazing. They made the characters feel so real, so personal, and the story could not have gone anywhere without top quality voice actors.\n\n\n\nThere's literally paragraphs upon paragraphs I could write about this masterpiece of a game, but no, buy this game and it's DLCs. Play it. Enjoy it. \n\n9.9/10 [spoiler] I wanted Elizabeth to live :'( [/spoiler]\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The story will toy with and minipulate your emotions with such a great force it may trigger you to cry or feel empty simply just wanting more you might cry or drop a tear like i did. Honestly this is game is completly worth the price along with the hole Bioshock series it makes you think morally and actually is a piece of art that should be preserved. The city is amazing. It can be a fast paced shooter. But if you give the game lets say a 4month break the story will be so great that you wont forget a single event. The charectors are perfect and feel like real people in every way and no other game will make me feel the same way Infinite did. In my personal opinion its a very sad and happy story that honestly prooves games are much more than just a form of entertainment and shooting, so no this game deserves to be credited and that everyone who thinks games are just stupid and useless they should play this and then think of how games can be art just as much as movies and books are. The DLC burial at sea seams to lack in PC mouse/ keyboard control and is way easier on a controller but the story is solid and is a mandatory get to understand the story even greater.

Ведь я небыл знаком с играми Кена Левина, а со студией Irrational Games не был знаком вообще и поэтому в серьёз её не воспринял. Как сильно я ошибался! \n    Утопия в летающем городе и Колумбия заставили меня передумать. Ещё надо отдать должное Анне Молевой, которая \"подарила\" внешность Элизабет. Её история по свойму грусна и драмматична. 20 лет в огромной башне, из друзей только огромная птица и гора книг. По сути ребёнок во взрослом теле, который может открывать разрывы ( дырки в другое, паралельное измерение). Почти всё время игры проведённое с ней, мы наблюдаем как она превращается из маленького ребёнка в душе во что-то по своему пугающее, а в конце игры у неё варабатывается пофигизм ко всему живому кроме Комстока. К стати пара слов о нём. Он вместе с Лютэс поднял колумбию в воздух, и населил её идиотами которые свято верят что Комсток пророк и несёт слово Бога. К моему удивлению Лютэсы не конченые психи, как кажется на первый взгляд. Ведь это именно они начали эту историю с возвращением Анны ДеВитт обратно Букеру, однако в реальности где она Элизабет ДеВитт этого не помнит.\n    Так вот эта игра мне нравится за то, как игроков втягивают в происходящие события, как игрока привязывают к персонажам. Ведь большую часть игры Элизабет является аппаратом поддержания жизнедеятельности, оборонным комплексом и соледобывающем заводом. И когда нас с ней разлучают то испытываешь потребность в её помощи, или просто становится скучно и всё превращается в тупой экшн без смысла. \n     И в заключении хочется сказать что в игре: хорошо мотивированные и продуманные персонажи, отличный сюжет, хорошая картинка, приятный саундтрек \"Will the Circle be Unbroken\" (который слышится почти во всех ключевых сценах игры)  ну и в триллере Nico-Vega постарались. В игре почти нет недочётов (сам говорить не рискну ведь для каждого они свои). Ну а если вы не уснули и дочитали это до конца, то меня игра ОЧЕНЬ ОЧЕНЬ ОЧЕНЬ сильно потрясла и удивила (даже стыдно что купил со скидкой), всем советую, 11 баллов из 10.","timestamp_created":1440506330,"timestamp_updated":1440506330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17707454","author":{"steamid":"76561198044897586","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":2321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1586615462},"language":"english","review":"good game, but its a complete rip-off of home alone 2","timestamp_created":1440501604,"timestamp_updated":1440682928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499421536922454834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17706687","author":{"steamid":"76561198122537872","num_games_owned":353,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":1140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":790,"last_played":1533806985},"language":"russian","review":"Игра просто великолепная","timestamp_created":1440497107,"timestamp_updated":1440497107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476211458444595337","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17704556","author":{"steamid":"76561198016656566","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":1320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1142,"last_played":1573386177},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is the third Bioshock title and takes place in 1912 where you play as Booker DeWitt an investigator that is sent to find a girl named Elizabeth in a floating city called Columbia to erase his debt.\n\nThe atmosphere in Bioshock Infinite is very different than the first two games as it takes place in a city in the sky. The graphics are amazing. I really like the characters and voice acting in Bioshock Infinite. Bioshock Infinite's story is very great. The story is quite confusing and the ending is truly mind-blowing. You don't have to play the first two games to understand Bioshock Infinite.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is a little weaker than the first two games as you can only use two weapons at a time. The weapons in Bioshock Infinite are a little bit boring. The missions get boring as you progress. You can't save the game at any time unlike its predecessors. You can only rely on autosave which is annoying sometimes.\n\nNevertheless, Bioshock Infinite is still an outstanding game. If you like the game, I suggest getting the Burial at Sea DLC.
