C'è veramente qualcosa da dire su questo titolo: è un puzzle game in cui si interagisce con pochi nemici, quindi la I.A. non è un dato importante in quanto veramente ci saremo solo noi e quello che viene chiamato \"Environment\" nelle modalità PvE; non ci sono nemici che ci inseguono, ci sparano ecc. di cui misurare l'intelligenza artificiale, mentre gli aiuti che ci vengono dagli altri personaggi sono, come potremmo dire, già incamerati nel gioco, scriptati diciamo, e non dipendenti da una I.A. autonoma e calibrata: ciò che conta è la nostra astuzia e intelligenza. Ancora, sempre parlando di lati tecnici, la grafica è ottima e fluida e così nitida nelle texture che si leggono distintamente anche le scritte piccole a distanza ravvicinata; il sonoro, dai rumori al doppiaggio dei personaggi (il cosidetto \"voice acting\"), è assolutamente perfetto e anche l'italiano (fortunatamente confinato ai sottotitoli, poiché le voci in originale sono fantastiche) è ben implementato in traduzioni corrette.\nVenendo al gameplay, be' anche qui si potrebbero spendere fiumi di parole: se il primo Portal aveva portato una ventata di freschezza, originalità e innovazione e difendeva lo schema apparentemente basilare del suo gameplay tramite una varietà garantita dall'uso ogni volta diverso dei portali che spesso venivano uniti ad altri aspetti dell'ambiente per formare la soluzione dell'enigma, qui in Portal 2 assistiamo a qualcosa di ancora più incredibile: non più \"solo\" l'uso versatile e variegato dei portali, ma numerose altre innovazioni (trampolini, barriere, raggi trasportatori invertibili, vernici con proprietà diverse ecc.), compreso un nuovo tipo di cubo, che rendono il gameplay estremamente variegato, profondo e sempre divertente; un solo appunto, però devo fare: rispetto al primo Portal, forse a causa delle dimensioni maggiori dell'ambiente di gioco, ho notato, ma posso sbagliarmi, che alcuni enigmi hanno un solo percorso di soluzione più elaborato, mentre in Portal potevi risolvere lo stesso enigma in più modi; ma forse ciò è dovuto alla mia noobbagine nel trovare sempre solo una strada xD\nVenendo al dato della longevità, che era la nota più dolente del vecchio Portal, be' è molto più elevata: io ho finito in questa mia prima volta questo Portal 2 in 14 ore, circa il triplo delle 5 del primo titolo; verosimilmente questo gioco si finisce in 8-9 ore a fronte delle 3 dell'altro, siamo quindi sempre ad un notevole miglioramento.\nIl comparto narrativo e la sceneggiatura del gioco solo di prim'ordine: dialoghi incredibili, permeati di uno humour spesso nero, rendono il mondo di gioco così grottesco e al contempo inquietante da lasciare il segno e fanno sembrare i personaggi non delle I.A. artificiali (infatti noi saremo i soli umani presenti nel gioco...SPOILER xD) ma delle vere e proprie creature vive.\nIn conclusione, direi che questo è forse il miglior gioco a cui abbia avuto il piacere di giocare e la dimostrazione nitida che Valve sa fare giochi in single-player di spessore straordinario (smettessero di dedicarsi a quei maledetti multiplayer... -.-).\n11/10.\n\nPS: Non ho ancora giocato la modalità cooperativa e i livelli \"bonus\", non appena le porterò a termine entrambe aggiornerò questa recensione. Grazie di aver letto  ^______^\n\n------------------------------FOR NON ITALIAN VIEWERS ------------------------------------------------------------------\nSimply awesome masterpiece. It's original, different in every situation, deep, mature and full of serious black humour that call you to reflect on the human condition and his relationships with machine and A.I.
