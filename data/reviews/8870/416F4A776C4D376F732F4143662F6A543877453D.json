has nothing to do with the Bioshock series aside from maybe a slight reference jammed in at the end.\n\nThe combat system is jarring and the story is just crazy and confusing.  This game is everything that Bioshock 1 and 2 was not, and not in a good way.\n\nThe graphics and atmosphere were amazing, but it should have been advertised as something besides Bioshock.\n\nJust be aware, you are in for a bunch of running around lost hitting the \"N\" button constantly to trigger an arrow.  The combat is just boring with EVERY SINGLE ENCOUNTER being broadcast to you in the form of strange setup mechanics like summoning a barricade or turret, its confusing and stupid, but you will always know when a fight is coming.\n\nThe AI is just plain stupid, they will just run at you and attack, sometimes you have to go hunt them down when they get stuck on a wall because you cant open the door to the next level because you are stuck in combat.\n\nI played the game in about 8 hours and have no real interest in playing it again.  Truth be told I wanted the game to be over about 4-5 hours in.   \n\nThe game seems to want to be a movie, but lacks any character or direction.

else（指很特别）。本作的叙事节奏拿捏得很不错：前大半段的剧情，可以说充满了谜团，纵然真相逐渐被一点点地揭示，但仍然带来了更多的谜团。而接近结局时，谜团一个个解开，伏笔一个个回收，解释了包括但不限于：神秘委托人的身份、伊丽莎白力量的来源、“先知”的计划、以及主角那些回忆杀到底意味着什么。最后的最后，配合几乎超现实的表现手法，抛出了最令人震惊的真相，然后整个故事就这么结束了。\n\n所以说，本作的剧情实在能载入史册，就算是在所有有关（剧透警告）[spoiler]时空穿越、平行世界[/spoiler]的作品里，也很少能见到这么优秀的作品。最重要的一点，就是本作的主线足够完整，设定的逻辑基本自洽，伏笔贯穿整部作品，最后回收，可以看出是深思熟虑过的，而不是像某些作品里，把各种设定硬搬出来，只是为了给剧情的逻辑漏洞亡羊补牢。\n\n本作有两个剧情DLC，名字是“海葬”（Burial at Sea），两个DLC是这个故事的两个部分。这两个部分，各自都是一个较为完整的故事，而整个合起来，又会形成一个更加庞大的结构。它们和主线有一定的关系，也和系列的前两作有关系。虽然我没玩过前两作，不过据我了解，DLC的故事发生在前两作的发生地——销魂城（Rapture）中，而Booker和伊丽莎白出于某种奇妙原因再次相会，并也将遇见系列前两作中的一些代表性角色。相信和我一样玩完主线的玩家，看到这个开头肯定又是满头问号。\n\n不过可喜的是，这DLC在我看来并不是画蛇添足、狗尾续貂，而是确确实实在写了又一段宛如神来之笔的故事的同时，又对系列三部作品中的一些空白都有了补充作用。至于怎么理解这DLC和三部作品的关系，就很有发挥的空间了，尤其是在考虑到本作最根本的设定——（剧透警告）[spoiler]平行世界[/spoiler]时。不过就我而言，即使我自己会去看其他人的看法，以便得知我错过的游戏中的细节，而对于游戏没直说的部分，我还是选择相信自己的解读，那就是——基本不解读。毕竟要知道，人都有过度解读艺术作品的倾向。\n\n叽里呱啦了一堆，强行用不剧透的语言夸了一把本作的剧情，下面我就说说本作的其他方面。\n\n美术当然是很厉害了，很多场景都非常壮观，完美呈现了那个不可能的世界。音乐...说老实话，不太有存在感，不过这也说明它们很契合作品的氛围。而游戏实际玩法——FPS的部分，我也说了我不会评价，就当做吐槽吧：\n\n我个人是除了小时候碰过的CF之流以外，从来没玩过FPS的。你可能会觉得我这样的玩家相当罕见，我也承认我的喜好比较...偏。至于原因，我总结出了以下的一些理由（借口）：\n\n1.我太菜了：反应慢（被打好一会都反应不过来谁在打我）、手残（人体描边大师）、策略性差（莽就完了）、路痴（绕着绕着就开始找不着北了）、选择焦虑（策略性差也是导致这个的原因）......（这个省略号用的真是充满了心酸）\n2.好吧，我承认我就是不喜欢射击游戏。\n\n所以我为什么要买这款游戏？说实话，我买来就是为了瞻仰剧情，结果确实没让我失望。事实上，我也是见到打了很低的折扣才买的，犹豫了很久，原因就是我没玩过也不喜欢FPS。所以我感谢开发组提供了宝宝难度，让我这样基本等同残疾的玩家也能通关。Respect！（这句话请配合电影《寄生虫》里那个魔性的画面食用）\n\nDLC的氛围比本作本体阴暗了不止一点，应该更接近系列前两作的氛围吧。玩法也从本体中爽快的突突突，变成了基本上算“生存恐怖”的模式：弹药和补给极少，很多时候需要潜行，玩得有点憋屈。不过宝宝难度还是挺容易的，跑就完了，就是路有点难认，再次感谢开发组提供了一定的导航系统。\n\n行了，能说的我都说完了。我认为本作就凭这个剧情都值得买，至于值不值全价，就看你怎么想了，我觉得像现在这段打折（持续到2020.3.4）的价格就非常值。至于像我一样因为不擅长FPS而迟疑的，也大可放心。\n\n唯一想吐槽的是这个繁中翻译，大部分是翻对了，不过还是有很多没翻出来的，当然比机翻要好一些，大概。\n\n总而言之，强烈推荐。","timestamp_created":1582342539,"timestamp_updated":1582432741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":49,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.817592918872833252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63907506","author":{"steamid":"76561198276908312","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1583749424},"language":"schinese","review":"这剧情不去拿个奥斯卡都nm可惜","timestamp_created":1582341579,"timestamp_updated":1582341579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63906334","author":{"steamid":"76561198133626571","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":243,"last_played":1584198455},"language":"english","review":"My
