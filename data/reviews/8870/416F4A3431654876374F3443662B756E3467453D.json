Apesar de parecer frágil, Elizabeth é uma personagem muito forte e inteligente, e logo fica claro que Booker não conseguiria seguir em frente sem sua ajuda. Além disso, é extremamente carismática e interage o tempo todo. Enquanto exploramos o jogo, Elizabeth pode encontrar moedas, lockpicks, e diversos itens. Já nos combates, ela não precisa ser protegida, e coleta munição, \"sais\" e kits médicos para ajudar.\n\nAs vozes em inglês são excelentes e retratam muito bem o sentimento dos personagens.\n\nA ambientação é muito bem feita, Columbia é linda e realmente soa como os Céus na Terra. Os habitantes, por outro lado, não foram bem trabalhados. Lembre-se que esse é um jogo de 2013, então haverá limitações.\n\nÉ um jogo muito lindo e emocionante.

Loading this level causes the game to seize, lock you in place, drain your shields, and play a loud buzzing sound (it's essentially a soft-lock).  Messing with the graphic settings (including V-Sync and other related settings like FPS Lock) does not provide a successful workaround.  Look it up online yourself if you don't believe me -- many others had this glitch when the game was first released and it doesn't appear this bug has been fixed (which is shocking).  So although this was on track to be one of my favorite FPS games of all time, I unfortunately cannot recommend it to anyone unless you feel like sinking 10-15 hours into the campaign only to be halted by this issue.

Прошел игру за 13 часов вместе с DLC. Что хочется сказать? Игра выпущена в 2013 году, но она как по мне лучше многих игр выпущенных за все это время. Я играл в многие игры но они проходились просто так или надоедали и удалялись с компьютера. Но эту я прошел на одном дыхании - за два дня. В начале когда скачивал ожидал простой шутер с простым сюжетом, но уже через час игры я кардинально поменял свое мнение. Хотел все пройти за одну ночь, но поскольку учусь в ВУЗе пришлось отложить до следующего вечера. Когда пришел финал - я захотел плакать и как-то попытаться изменить концовку, но игра оказалась только с одним возможным окончанием. Очень жалко как и Элизабет, так и Букера. Выбрал ей кулон с соловьем. Пощадил Слейта, но потом застрелил найдя его в пыточной. Эхх, хочется рассказать больше, но слишком эмоциональная игра и больше не хочется задумываться над концом, и так все сложно. Заслуженно \"Игра 2013 года\" и хочется больше таких игр.

Apenas lo pasé hace mucho en la Xbox 360 dije que era uno de mis juegos favoritos, muchos años después para tener la colección en Steam volví a pasarlo y sostengo lo que dije. Es una obra de arte en todo sentido, siguiendo el mismo nivel del Bioshock original, es un juego que tenes que jugar si sos fan de los single players. No creo encontrar puntos negativos en este juego, tal vez la historia es un poco confusa, pero es increible de igual manera una vez que hilas todos los cabos. \n\nEl arte es estupenda, el estilo es único, y el gameplay sublime. Los personajes son muy buenos, sobre todo Elizabeth. Los enemigos muy creativos. Y la inmersión es lo mejor de todo. \n\nRecomiendo también los DLC Burial at Sea. Para revivir la nostalgia también del 1 con el estilo del Infinite. \n\nEn fin, este juego en mi opinión es recomendable al 100%. Un 10/10.

Yeni başlayacak olanlar  imkanınız varsa önce orjinal seriyi oynamanız. Zira hikaye Rapture City ile epey bağlantılı. İlk fırsatta değerlendirip oynamanızı tavsiye ederim. Ayrıca ana senaryodan sonra Burial at Sea Episode bölümlerini de kaçırmayın. Son olarak Türkçeye çevrilmiş Rapture City isimli bir kitapta var. Bioshock evreni harcayacağınız süreye değer.","timestamp_created":1575632322,"timestamp_updated":1585589787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59337479","author":{"steamid":"76561198411155195","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":649,"last_played":1580233008},"language":"schinese","review":"买就完事了，这是一个神作\n","timestamp_created":1575630062,"timestamp_updated":1575630062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59334541","author":{"steamid":"76561198127163464","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":775,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":710,"last_played":1611462065},"language":"english","review":"very good game","timestamp_created":1575625752,"timestamp_updated":1575625752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59334127","author":{"steamid":"76561198058300641","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":3683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1958,"last_played":1576812193},"language":"english","review":"Hard enough to be challenging and a story line that makes sense","timestamp_created":1575625142,"timestamp_updated":1575625142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59327756","author":{"steamid":"76561198066241408","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1635,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":922,"last_played":1576228385},"language":"koreana","review":"생각날때 마다 다시 한번하는 게임","timestamp_created":1575614167,"timestamp_updated":1575614167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59326857","author":{"steamid":"76561198250953152","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":691,"last_played":1615736723},"language":"english","review":"I have an upcoming physics test.\n","timestamp_created":1575612536,"timestamp_updated":1575612536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59326230","author":{"steamid":"76561198353143316","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":687,"last_played":1638112527},"language":"schinese","review":"太好玩了","timestamp_created":1575611372,"timestamp_updated":1575611372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59326143","author":{"steamid":"76561198284882272","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1658895049},"language":"schinese","review":"nice game","timestamp_created":1575611207,"timestamp_updated":1575611207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41eHv7O4Cf+un4gE="}
