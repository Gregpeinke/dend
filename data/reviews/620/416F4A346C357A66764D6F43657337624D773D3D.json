You wanted to read some reviews before buying this game and you quickly got fed up with most of the 'most helpful' reviews giving absolutely no real information about what the game is like. Instead, you get the feeling that anybody who's played this game has sustained permanent brain damage. To not go on any longer, here are 5 reasons why I think Portal 2 is one of the best games I've ever played.\n\n1. Graphics: The game is beautiful! Portal (1) looked great and it was released in 2007. Portal 2 looks 10x better! The game doesn't use too many resources so an average gaming PC or laptop will run it at max settings without a problem.\n\n2. Physics: One of the greatest elements of this game is the amazing physics. You will have great fun discovering how to use the portals and other tools supplied to navigate and solve the well thought out puzzles. The game requires you to use forward momentum, perfect timing and fast thinking (amongst many other things) to complete puzzles. There is never a dull moment.\n\n3. Pacing: The developers has again achieved a perfect sweet spot between making the puzzles challenging but not impossible. The game starts out with a few simple puzzles that really help you understand the basics of the game and how you can best use the portals and other tools to your advantage. After that the game gradually ramps up the difficulty keeping the game challenging and fun. With some patience and perseverance you can play through this whole game without having to consult a single walkthrough.\n\n4. Dark Humor: Portal 2 returns with more characters than Portal 1 and the scripts are again absolutely hilarious. The game treats you as what you are a test subject and the machines are as you would expect them to be, cold and calculating in carrying out their agenda. However, I have to admit that GLaDOS was funnier in Portal 1.\n\n5. Story & Uniqueness: This game continues the surprisingly compelling story of Portal 1. I didn't think a puzzle game would have any decent kind of story but boy, was I wrong! Portal 2 is in a class of its own as an fps puzzle game that offers many hours of fun, challenging puzzles and great, hilarious scripts. My only regret is taking so long to finally play it.\n\nP.S: these 5 points apply to both Portal (1) and Portal 2. I highly recommend you play Portal (1) first because it helps you paint a more complete picture of the full story and there are plenty of references to Portal (1) in Portal 2, including some steps in solving puzzles.\n\nThanks for reading. Do yourself a favor and buy this game!\n","timestamp_created":1419469523,"timestamp_updated":1419469523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13579868","author":{"steamid":"76561198114204888","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":951,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":405,"last_played":1569779083},"language":"english","review":"Fun and one of the best puzzle games of the decade.

Though while it was interesting, exciting and original, it did not feel like a complete game, but more like a demo.  Portal 2 took the ideas of the original and pushed the limits into a full fledged game.  With new puzzle items like jump panels, different gel types (i.e. speed boost and jump boost), light tunnels, a new co-op gameplay option and a much more intense storyline, this sequel sets a new standard for sequels.  The puzzles can go from absolutely simple to quite complex, but nothing too outside of the box that you will be completely stuck.
