I'm not too late to write a review for this am I? Nah, let's get started! First here's a short GOODS and NOT-SO-GOODS list to give you a basic idea of all the pro's and cons of the game. If you're looking for a more in-depth review you can scroll to the bottom.\n\nGOODS:\n+ Plot. It gets more complex and intruiging as the story goes on but it never feels TOO overwhelming. The pacing and the \"show don't tell\" approach make it a fantastic experience.\n+ Setting. The world of Columbia is amazingly stylized and if you can suspend your disbelief a little it becomes surprisingly immersive. The game also looks beautiful as I'm sure you can tell.\n+ Writing. There's a lot of character in the main cast, but even background characters have well-recorded lines that add more depth to the world you're in. Dialogue in proper dosages.\n+ Challenigng combat. I know for many this is a controversial subject of the game; \"Ludonaritive Dissonance\" and all that but I'm going to be easy here: it's fun. I think the violence fits the game fine and doesn't feel out of place. It starts of simple but get's more challenging as the game goes on. Read more about this below.\n+ Unique. Though some would argue it doesn't innovate at all; Bioshock Infinite still manages to combine all it's aspects to deliver a truly novel experience.\n+ Music and atmosphere. This game seems carefully crafted with a great sense of detail. This shines through in both the music and how most 'scenes' in the game play out. I'm sure it was playtested a lot.\n+ DLC is decent. I was personally disappointed by Burial at Sea (save for the amazing first look at a \"living\" Rapture) But in the end I found Clash in the Clouds, the more basic \"survival arena\" mode, to be far more entertaining then first anticipated. \n+ It's archaic and a bit bare-bones; but your abilities can be upgraded as you progress. More health, salts, shield and the possibility to upgrade your guns and vigors isnt much but it's enough to keep you trying to find more cash in the flying city. \n+ Proper options and difficulty settings so you can make the game as easy or hard as you want it to be. I believe the achievements are fun for the completionists among us.\n\nNOT-SO-GOODS\n- As hinted before: people might think there is \"ludonarritive dissonance\" as they believe the gratuitous violence doesn't fit the main characters of the game; Elizabeth and Booker. I do NOT agree. But since many people do feel that way it has to be mentioned. More below.\n- A limited experience as it's a single player game with a very linear plot. Very little room to explore or follow your own path. Goes double for the Burial at Sea DLC. It's a VERY solid linear experience though, just sad there's no big replay value for the common gamer.\n- The standard combat music get's really repetitive after a while. Such a shame as the rest of the game's score is great.\n- Some people dislike the \"narrative through scattered audio logs\"-cliche, which is understandable. It's a bit too \"easy\" I guess. Doesn't bother me much though! I'm one of those people who read all of 2016's DOOM''s logs and backstories and loved it. ^^; \n- People who know what this game looked like before release really hate how much was cut from the final product. You won't notice much if you're ignorant of it, but it's still a factor.\n- Elizabeth's design has a little bit too much \"Male gaze\" going on. Forgivable to some because her character as a whole is just great.\n- Far from the best combat we've seen from modern shooters. Thankfully this game has more to offer then just headshots.\n\nAnd that's all for the lists, I'll just go off on a small tangent on any thing I couldn't mention and that'll be everything. Let me start by adressing the \"ludonarrative dissonance\"-issue: I believe people make too many assumptions. They say Booker acts too kind for the horrible things he does. Columbia looks too pretty to be a bad place. Elizabeth is too sweet to make some of the decisions she does. I got one simlpe retort: appearances can be deceiving is one of the central subjects of the game. And how many times have we heard of nice people that have done horrible things either because they were forced to, had no other choice or had to do something drastic to protect the things they held dear? And with that I say; there is no ludonaritive dissonance. Just people with poor knowledge of how complex human beings and their feelings are, their lack of understanding is not because of the game but because of themselves.\n\nI believe the 'limited' combat is great. Many people really disliked the fact you can only hold 2 weapons at all times but to me it just felt like I had to prepare better when I was out of combat while also improvising when you're in the heat of battle with the weapons that your enemies drop. You don't have an entire catalog of explosives on you to get you out of any hairy situation that pops up; sometimes you just need to survive by the skin of your teeth so you better learn to do do both preperation and improvisation to be succesfull. Also makes it more interesting when you choose your favourite weapons to upgrade.\n\nAnd finally I'd like to mention; (SPOILERS) the ending makes no sense according to the game's own rules. Many Youtube video's try to explain it all, but the answer is simple: the writers just bit off a bit more then they could chew. There's an infinite amount of Bookers and Elizabeths; drowning one Booker in a few timelines won't change that. On top of that: Elizabeth would never have her timespace-warping abilities if Comstock never existed so it's a full paradox. If she actually did manage to kill all infinite versions of Booker she killed herself as well... which means she could've never grown up to... kill herself? Yeah, see what I mean? Burial at Sea makes this even more of a mess; but I should quit here before we get in too deep.\n(Get it? In too deep? Because Rapture's on the sea floor? No? Bad joke? Dammit!)\n\nSo that's all I have to say. In the end I absolutely recommend this title!\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask.

The ending will leave you dazzled making you think what really happened. The combat is fun, fast and a little challenging sometimes. Inclusion of vigor traps gives a whole new depth to combat.\n\nI played the game after original BioShock and what I found was a completely different world as opposed to first. Main story should take roughly 20 hours. The world is beautiful, full of inhabitants and most importantly intact and not destroyed (until you decide to show up). After defeating enemies in an area they dont respawn like the splicers did in BioShock, so you can take a leisurely walk and take in all the panoramas and beautiful shades of floating city of Columbia.\n\nI highly recommend playing both Burial at the Sea episodes especially if you have played the original BioShock. Episode One gives a completely different perspective of city of Rapture and feels great with all the updated graphics and some new guns in your arsenal. I loved episode two because you get to play as Elizabeth and get to see what happened in the city of Rapture before your arrival in the original.\n\nHave fun playing it! :)","timestamp_created":1511519419,"timestamp_updated":1511519419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37304106","author":{"steamid":"76561198073458839","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":81,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":81,"last_played":1451402154},"language":"french","review":"Un bijou !","timestamp_created":1511519382,"timestamp_updated":1511519382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37303296","author":{"steamid":"76561198149519294","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":595,"last_played":1517125029},"language":"schinese","review":"[b]没有绝对的光明，即使在无限美好的哥伦比亚。[/b]\n[b]没有绝对的黑暗，即使在动荡不安的天空之城。[/b]\n[h1] 伊丽莎白\t[/h1]\n[h1] By and by,by and by\t[/h1]","timestamp_created":1511519012,"timestamp_updated":1511523252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517045438289642334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37303183","author":{"steamid":"76561198152640545","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":830,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1,"last_played":1628716212},"language":"german","review":"Dieses Spiel ist wirklich wunderschön gestaltet. \nDas Ende dieses Spieles hat mich wirklich so sehr mitgenommen, ich konnte Tage danach immernoch an nichts anderes denken.

新故事，跟主线流程没有任何关联。建议没玩过前作的先去把1和2玩了再来玩这个DLC剧情，如果没玩过1和2可能这个DLC会玩的不明不白，不知到啥意思。玩过1和2再打DLC就可以明白不少东西了。\n\n不要被剧透啊，这种神剧情被剧透就是真的难受。索然无味。\n0 条留言\t \b订阅留言帖

Suivi d'une arène de bataille fermée suivie d'un autre couloir etc etc\n\nEn bref un jeu qui est tout sauf un bioshock vraiment trop cher pour aucune originalité.","timestamp_created":1511512953,"timestamp_updated":1511512953,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48908647894859314","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37289051","author":{"steamid":"76561198122097135","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":13351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6765,"last_played":1608022552},"language":"russian","review":"Найс!","timestamp_created":1511512303,"timestamp_updated":1511512303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37288632","author":{"steamid":"76561198062218634","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1074,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1074,"last_played":1503752698},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games ever created and a great successor of the Bioshock franchise.
