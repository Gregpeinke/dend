Gostei tanto que quando ele entrou em promoção na Steam comprei-o novamente mas não joguei em seguida pois fazia pouco tempo que eu tinha jogado no console. E ele ficou mofando na minha bibilioteca por mais de um ano sem nunca ser instalado.\n\nCom o lançamento de PORTAL STORIES: MEL resolvi fazer uma sessão remember de PORTAL 2 antes de jogar esse mod e mais uma vez me encantei com o jogo.\n\nPortal 2 é um exemplo de como um bom jogo deve ser: Divertido, bem feito e viciante.\n\nO capricho com que esse jogo foi feito impressiona qualquer um. Não existe um detalhe no jogo em que vc olha e diga: \"Há... Isso poderia ser melhor\".\n\nOs desenvolvedores e responsáveis pelo level desing são verdadeiros artistas. Quando se anda pelo jogo se tem a sensação de realmente estar dentro daquele \"cenário\". A escala de tamanho dos objetos e cenários (do menor ao absurdamente maior) é milimetricamente proporcional. \n\nOs sons do ambiente no jogo (barulhos de metal caindo, mecanismos em movimento, elevadores, etc...) são ótimos e perfeitamente adequados ao cenário nos mínimos detalhes. \n\nO trabalho dos atores que dublaram os personagens é sensacional e simplesmente perfeita. Não foram poucas as vezes em que parei de jogar para ficar rindo das \"tiradas\" sarcásticas dos personagens. \n\nTodos esses fatores somados fazem com que a imersão no jogo seja uma experiência única.\n\nPoucas vezes na historia dos jogos eletrônicos a produção de um jogo atingiu o patamar de capricho e excelência de Portal 2 em todos os sentidos.\n\nCom certeza um jogo obrigatório para qualquer pessoa que goste de jogos eletrônicos.","timestamp_created":1437465526,"timestamp_updated":1437465526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17152018","author":{"steamid":"76561198166767839","num_games_owned":469,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1304,"last_played":1508344160},"language":"english","review":"It would be better if more people play co-op :/","timestamp_created":1437459400,"timestamp_updated":1478653288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17151821","author":{"steamid":"76561198183469805","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1183,"last_played":1483045943},"language":"brazilian","review":"I really loved this game, it's incredibly good!
