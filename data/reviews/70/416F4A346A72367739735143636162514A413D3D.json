This game is highly recommended so I gave it a try. I can imagine this game was very cool when it came out, but you can see it's very old. Nevertheless, this game is still very good, but don't get hyped up for playing this game.

great games, great stories to tell, and Half-Life 1 is no exception.\n\nI will start with the pros, and end with the cons.\n\nPros:\n\n+ For people who care about graphics, this game actully looks better then any game released in 1998, it contains nice textures/materials, good models, and awesome map design, there are gibs, but if you don't like gibs you sadly can't turn it off from my knowledge, there probaly is an console command out there which can help you.\n\n+ The gameplay, is great for an singleplayer FPS, shooting at all sorts of aliens, and swinging your crowbar into a box, or a window, or a scientist.\n\n+ Storage space, according to Steam, HL1 is 556 MB, not a lot, and can be downloaded in seconds with decent internet.\n\n+ Specifications, this game can be run by 99% of the computers that are made after 1998.\n\n+ Loading times, Most loading times are very quick, i own an HDD so it takes about 2 seconds to load max, but i think that if you have an SSD, that it will be loaded incredibly quickly.\n\n+ Amazing soundtrack, they fit the game well.\n\n+ There is a training mode, which is rare in recent games.\n\n+ Auto-Save\n\n+ Multiplayer, There is multiplayer for HL1, well, not like sven-coop where you can play the whole HL1 story with other people, but some deathmatch maps that are quite fun.\n\n+ Easter eggs.\n\n+ Great voice acting.\n\nCons:\n\n- When you first play it, the game feels like a maze, as nobody tells you where to go, you just have to figure everything out yourself.\n\n- You don't feel like saving Scientists or Guards, as they treat you like some peasent in the beginning, it makes you feel disconnected to the game world.\n\n- You can't select a chapter as there is no system to start at a chapter , you have to manually open the console and put in the \"Map\" command.\n\n- Lack of graphics settings, i know this game is from 1998, but atleast add an option to change Gibs, AA, etc.\n\n- Akward death animations, when an enemy dies, it just flops to the ground, this is because the game doesn't have real physics, only for the minor things.\n","timestamp_created":1396171269,"timestamp_updated":1503673200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9670296","author":{"steamid":"76561198044078559","num_games_owned":365,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1602,"last_played":1585624917},"language":"spanish","review":"Solo

A scientist who works for the Black Mesa facility. And an experiment you took part in has gone completely awry, unleashing an extraterestrial invasion, and now all hell has broken loose in Black Mesa. Your main goal is to survive and to stop the invasion, using the help of surviving Black Mesa employees, whatever you can get your hands on and your own bare wits.\n\nEven if it is over a decade old, Half Life has aged very, very well. In fact it seems to do some things better than most Modern shooters - you can hold a heck of a lot of weapons for example, a great feature that barely has any presence in shooters nowadays. The gunplay is intense but fair, and you have a huge multitude of weapons to utilise - and they are all great and feel powerful. Enemy types are plentiful, varied and can get pretty darn tough as the game progresses. The enemy AI itself is intelligent and fierce - especially the soldiers who know how to flank well and work together. There are friendly NPC's as well, which are actually helpful: Security guards can help deliver covering fire and scientists can unlock doors and heal you if you are low on health. The game also takes good advantage of the environmental elements around it, technically making almost everything a threat or obstacle - some bridges can be destroyed which may require you to find another way around it, wet floors are obviously slippy so you need to be careful not to slide into an elevator shaft - Did I also mention that elevators in this game are barely ever safe? All of these great uses of particular stage elements called for some fantastically designed levels and puzzles that require a skilled gamer to complete.\n\nGraphically, I will admit the game does look a bit blocky by today's standards and the character animations are pretty wooden, but each level within Half Life looks worlds apart from one another, especially the last part of the game, trust me, it's amazing, that's all I'm saying about it, I'm not gonna spoil it. The character and enemy designs themselves, most notably the aliens, are really creative, unique and varied. The real time cutscenes were cutting edge back in the day and even though the choppy and kinda unexistant character animations during these cutscenes are now dated in a sense, the fact that they are REAL TIME just makes them very immersive and makes you feel part of a great story.\n\nWhen it comes to audio, the soundeffects are great and fits Half Life's sci-fi tone, and the guns are LOUD. The music tracks, although few and far between, are fantastic and give off great atmosphere. The voiceacting is also great, even if the recordings are a bit grainy.\n\nIf there was anything I thought that did detract from the overall quality from the game, is the fact that sometimes the player can get glitched in certain parts of the environment, so they can't move, therefore they would need to restart from the last save... but then again this barely ever happens.\n\nTl;dr Half Life is a groundbreaking FPS that has stood the test of time and I still consider it as one of the best shooters ever made, if not the best. An immersive, action packed, incredibly varied FPS that makes you feel like an action hero. Highly recommended to anyone who has at least an interest in videogames.","timestamp_created":1395876724,"timestamp_updated":1398249706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571271538734436035","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9634376","author":{"steamid":"76561198037325028","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":770,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":770,"last_played":1377334734},"language":"spanish","review":"¿Qué decir de Half-Life?
