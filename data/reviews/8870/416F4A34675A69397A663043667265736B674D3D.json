[b] 生化奇兵第三代，如梦如幻般的游戏体验。 [/b] [/h1]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n一扫前两代阴暗的环境氛围。相比于前两代的海底城，这一代的故事背景将设定在天空之城上（它叫哥伦比亚城），一个天堂般的城市。新风格下，夜晚没有太多的阴暗，给我的感觉更多的是一种宁静的感觉（战斗除外）；白天下滤镜也是充满着温馨，带了一丝丝悠闲。与前作风格变化之大让我想到马克思佩恩系列。\n\n[hr][/hr]\n时间线大约在本系列第一代故事发生之前，游玩时间大概在10小时左右。1060MaxQ显卡运行下，平均四五十帧、偶尔会暴跌到二十几帧。\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1] 有三款DLC，分别为激战云端和海葬1&2。 [/h1]\n激战云端是一款闯关型DLC，武器基本可以自选，魔法需要杀敌存钱购买（升级也是），适合喜欢冲塔的玩家体验，只想体验剧情的可以忽略这个款DLC。海葬1&2是剧情型DLC，每部分别为2小时左右，成功地将3代剧情和1代剧情连接在了一起。\n\n[hr][/hr]\n剧情线有些凌乱，可能在游玩的过程中会经常懵逼。如果通关后还不理解，可以尝试去b站补全一下。我觉得本作的剧情还是值得去详细了解的，有涉及到一些时空悖论的知识点。\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1] 强烈夸赞本作运用在伊丽莎白女士身上的ai系统，可以体现工作室对伊丽莎白这个角色的巨大投入。 [/h1]\n在我玩过的所有游戏里，几乎友方ai都设计得不太尽人意，要么是给玩家增加难度，要么就是被设计得太傻太智障。但是玩了这一款游戏，我才知道原来友方ai也能设计得这么生动，仿佛眼前这个伊丽莎白就是真实存在一般。刚救出伊丽莎白在游乐场那一段，我没有着急玩下去，而是到处走走想看看伊丽莎白会做出什么出乎意料的动作。\n[b] 伊丽莎白她待不住，看到长椅她会去坐，看到窗户会去眺望，无聊了会靠在墙上歇息一会儿，能捡到硬币上交。战斗时从不让人操行，还时不时找到一瓶蓝药给玩家。听说玩家倒地了伊丽莎白还会跑过来扶起。有这样的ai真的是很完美的体验，更何况这个ai还是一个可爱的少女形象。 [/b]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1] [b] 注意： [/b] [/h1]\n[b] 有的朋友可能一开始游戏，还没进入画面就闪退了！\n这大概率是游戏文件缺失，没办法启动。\n听说原因在于这一文件在国区被ban掉了，导致下载的时候没法下载它，检查游戏完整性也查不出来。\n我们可以使用加速器，结点连接到外服区。在这种环境下再去检查游戏完整性，压根就能检查出来并下载。本人就是这样解决的。

It's quite an interesting story in my opinion despite the contradictions it inevitably stumbles into. \n\nThe gameplay however is nothing special, especially considering the quantity of FPS games available, many others do it far better than this, including a previous game in this very series. In my opinion Bioshock 2 has the best gameplay. The worst change in this game is that they only let you carry 2 guns at once, and yet give you extremely limited ammunition reserves such that a single fight will leave you on empty and require you to pick up new guns. This is annoying because you'll tend to want to upgrade guns you like using, but you won't be able to use them all the time due to the lack of ammo. Then you will be forced to pick up un-upgraded guns which makes things harder. I was also sad to see the hacking minigames removed in this game. In Bioshock 1 they got old fast since they took so long, but I really enjoyed the quick hacks in Bioshock 2 that you could do for extra bits here and there. \n\nOne of the worst parts of Bioshock 1 was the final boss fight. It was annoying and felt out of place in the game. I was disappointed therefore to see them bring a similar fight in to this game. ([spoiler]The Siren[/spoiler]) It's just a bullet sponge and spawns infinite grunts to constantly annoy you. Bad choice.\n\nThe scavenging is rather enjoyable in my opinion, with quite a few little hidden things if you take the time to look. This of course comes with the plentiful audio diaries present in the previous games for extra tidbits of story. \n\nOverall, I would say the story is rather interesting and enjoyable to follow, and scavenging the environment can be fun, but the fights in between leave much to be desired.","timestamp_created":1639281225,"timestamp_updated":1639281225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105679894","author":{"steamid":"76561198084118547","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":655,"last_played":1641322933},"language":"german","review":"Polished gameplay, insane Story and an immersive world\n\nwhats not to love?","timestamp_created":1639279044,"timestamp_updated":1639279044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105678635","author":{"steamid":"76561198430913210","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":382,"last_played":1659780621},"language":"schinese","review":"画面精美，好玩，对于一款2013年的游戏来说，确实不错","timestamp_created":1639277257,"timestamp_updated":1639277257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105676489","author":{"steamid":"76561197990330534","num_games_owned":507,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":759,"last_played":1639100156},"language":"english","review":"Just fun..","timestamp_created":1639273907,"timestamp_updated":1639273907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105669745","author":{"steamid":"76561198131261519","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1197,"last_played":1622423001},"language":"english","review":"8/10","timestamp_created":1639263845,"timestamp_updated":1639263900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105667799","author":{"steamid":"76561198437070697","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1636925350},"language":"english","review":"i like this game","timestamp_created":1639261354,"timestamp_updated":1639261354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105660796","author":{"steamid":"76561199186508797","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":482,"last_played":1642530228},"language":"english","review":"very good game","timestamp_created":1639253012,"timestamp_updated":1639253012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105658564","author":{"steamid":"76561198262156485","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":851,"last_played":1638240517},"language":"spanish","review":"Ya soy un adicto a rebuscar botín y darle a recoger sin mirar que estoy cogiendo.\nMe ha parecido que estoy constantemente en ascensores (cambios de mapa y pantallas de carga) supongo que es porque es un juego que salió para la PS3 y su disco duro.\n\nY qué necesidad había de poner a Elizabeth en ese traje de corset ¿¿no se supone que es una niña??

Хвалить игру можно долго, а Элизабет запала всем и каждому глубоко в геймерское сердце, поэтому про это я писать не буду, только с оговоркой, что Эл самый лучший напарник из всех игр. Графика даже для конца 2021 года остается на хорошем уровне, саунд дизайн в игре вышка и пушка. Cюжет просто отвал башки, особенно если проходить всю трилогию залпом и со всеми DLС, единственно, для меня вторая часть как то выпала из серии, хотя игра хорошая, но между первой и Infinite круг замкнулся. Касательно геймплея, то тут особого разнообразия нет, главный герой хавает соли, Эл ему их иногда подкидывает, как и патроны с монетками, убиваешь врагов и собственно всё. Также советую игру проходить на высоком уровне сложности, т.к. там есть хоть какой-то челлендж. Даже не представляю насколько скучно на низкой сложности.\nКак итог: потраченного времени стоит определенно вся серия и DLC\n10 уничтоженных утопичных городов из 10","timestamp_created":1639234610,"timestamp_updated":1639234610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503759384155273438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105638718","author":{"steamid":"76561199085579135","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1639311857},"language":"schinese","review":"神TM进去没简中","timestamp_created":1639229820,"timestamp_updated":1639229820,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105638680","author":{"steamid":"76561198346925020","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":258,"playtime_forever":1294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":911,"last_played":1639466695},"language":"brazilian","review":"3/5","timestamp_created":1639229789,"timestamp_updated":1639229789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105636906","author":{"steamid":"76561198354886641","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":182,"playtime_forever":783,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":783,"last_played":1595635250},"language":"schinese","review":"该说的别人都说了，我只想说开场真是震撼，我超喜欢开场教堂里的感觉。","timestamp_created":1639227895,"timestamp_updated":1639227895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105634482","author":{"steamid":"76561198181901915","num_games_owned":291,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":134,"last_played":1639225105},"language":"schinese","review":"玩着有点恶心，是生理上的恶心。","timestamp_created":1639225221,"timestamp_updated":1639225221,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617967128753662109","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105631048","author":{"steamid":"76561199022836222","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":297,"last_played":1639283466},"language":"schinese","review":"神作","timestamp_created":1639221036,"timestamp_updated":1639221036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105629667","author":{"steamid":"76561199210126512","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":429,"last_played":1650635021},"language":"thai","review":"มันมาก","timestamp_created":1639219275,"timestamp_updated":1639219275,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105629467","author":{"steamid":"76561198030982322","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":5865,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5865,"last_played":1639193102},"language":"english","review":"Great game!

The characters are also very interesting especially the Lutece Twins, those are just awesome but, if I had to make one complaint, it would be that Cornelius Slate and Daisy Fitzroy are a bit underdeveloped and I would like to have more of them in the game. The heavy hitters are so original, powerful (duuh) and challenging to fight! It's a master of a craft (but the Siren is a bit annoying). The twist at the end and the overall story is really good and makes for a good ending.\n\nOverall, BioShock Infinite is my 2nd favorite of the franchise, it's a beautiful game both story wise and
