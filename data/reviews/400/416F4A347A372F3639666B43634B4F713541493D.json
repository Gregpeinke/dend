The strongest factor that influenced my hype, is how highly rated this game is, considering how popular it is.\n\nThere is always a ratio between popularity and rating because the most common scenario is: A game is tremendously popular and even being really good, the amount of people who can vote and review for this game drastically affects the overall rating of it and because of that, generally speaking, popular games tends to have mixed reviews, The point I'm trying to bring here is: The more popular a games gets, the higher is the probability of it not being well scored.\n\nSo, for a game launched a decade ago and being one of the most played games on Steam, achieving such a thing of being immensely popular and still holding a high position in the ranking of the most well-rated games of all time, is definitely not an easy task. Honestly I believe it's very hard actually. It's a thing that definitely catched my curiosity but I didn't tried it for years thinking \"I guess it's good but not that masterpiece everyone keeps calling it.\" I was expecting a good game but not an awesome one. Turns out it went way beyond I expected.\n\nThe mechanic itself it's incredible, fascinating and unique... and there is no expiration date because I played it in 2021 and even after playing almost every kind of game, I still got fascinated by it. After a few minutes playing it, I felt the atmosphere was a bit unsettling. I didn't paid much attention to it in the beginning because I was blind by the portals mechanics itself. Through the chambers, my only friend seems to be an Artificial Inteligence who sporadically tell you some random informations and... jokes. Despite the fact you play with an I.A speaking to you the entire time, I felt the atmosphere was still unsettling in a mysterious way.\n\nEverytime I solved a puzzle, I spent a while analyzing what I had to do, I always got the feeling of \"Damn, that was so obvious how I didn't see that earlier.\" That was me after spenting 30 minutes trying to figure out where I should place a portal in one of the levels, then feeling so stupid after finding out the answer.\nThis game is definitely a memorable experience. Not a game that you play then completely forget about it after a few days. It's good in a way if someone ask me a recommendation, I would consider this game as one of the options!","timestamp_created":1623385404,"timestamp_updated":1638521694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93546821","author":{"steamid":"76561198346772087","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1648700648},"language":"english","review":"A masterpiece","timestamp_created":1623383472,"timestamp_updated":1623383472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93542094","author":{"steamid":"76561198443647625","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":146,"last_played":1623360037},"language":"english","review":"Very nice game.

Silah kullanıyoruz ama adam öldürmek için değil. Bizleri ışınlıyor bu silah. Böylece birbirinden farklı bulmacalarla oyunu oynuyoruz. Açıkçası daha iyi birşey beklediğimi söyleyebilirim. Oyunun oynanışı güzel tamam eyvallah, portal açıp bir oraya bir buraya uçmak iyi hissettiyor. Gizem duygusu felan harika çok iyi. Hikayede ortalamanın üstü güzel. Ama abi, 1993 yılının Prince Of Percia'sının \"Kardeşim kolumu çektin, ha şimdi o kol 1 saniye sonra kapanacak koş git kapıdan geç\" olayı olmasın be artık. Bu olaydan oldum olası nefret ederim. Ya kardeş ben bu oyunu biraz aksiyondan uzak kalayım sakin sakin bulmaca çözeyim diye oynadım. Elim ayağıma karışsın diye değil ya. Onun dışında bölüm tasarımları tamamen aynı. Hiç farklı bir yere gitmiyoruz birbirinin aynısı mekanlarda bulmaca çözüyoruz. Hani bulmacalarda öyle üst düzey keyifli falan da değil. Ortalama yani. Üzerine bu kanserlikle bulmacalarda hile yapınca oyunun keyfi iyice kaçıyor. Tam olarak aynı örnek gib değil ama ben Limboyu çok daha sevmiştim. Gizem duygusu 3 kat basıyordu. Bulmacalar tatminkar his veriyordu. Burda balon çözüyormuş gibi. Neyse efendim, Portal bir Valve klasiğidir. Güzel oyundur. Oynayın oynattırın. Benim özel zaafım var süreli çekilen kollara.
