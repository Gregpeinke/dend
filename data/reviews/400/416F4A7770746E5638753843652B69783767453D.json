Но, на моё удивление, игра меня за тянула...\nПростецкий до глубины души сюжет, настолько же легкая механика - эта игра пусть и имеет звание \"головоломки\", но шевелить мозгами тут приходится нечасто; Valve решили сотворить чистый виртуальный расслабон на два-три часика (+ часов 15 испытаний), чтобы в Portal'овском минимализме найти... ну, не знаю... гармонию что ли... Тут реально всё настолько просто сделано, что на игру можно повесить ярлык \"для детей с трех лет\", но при этом Valve смогли сделать всё качественно и эпично... Я даже не знаю, почему никто до них не использовал эту удивительную механику с порталами (ну, или не стал настолько известен), о которой писатели-фантасты заговорили ещё полвека назад, если не больше... Я действительно поражаюсь, насколько умело они сделали игру, запихнув туда сюжет, какой-никакой твист, босс-файт, прикольные саундтреки, высокую сложность (в испытаниях) и одновременно казуальность, не выходя при этом за рамки дедушкиного движка \"source\", сохраняя минимум геймплея...

While released as a freeware title inside the orange box at first, Portal feels like an indie title through its lack of any cutscenes, focus on gameplay, and lonely eerie tone. As the title suggests, you use futuristic portals to solve puzzles. Using a special gun, you place blue and orange portals that only link when both are placed on most surfaces. Portals transport you and other objects instantly through the other side, and your momentum is carried over, even when your direction and angle changes. Using this system and other obstacles like switches, boxes, and turrets, you complete challenges room by room until the very end of the game. Unlike other puzzle games, there is no forced time limit to complete puzzles other than occasional death, meaning that you are free to let your mind experiment on solving and not fretting over impending time. All puzzles in this game are creative, unique, and challenge your brain to think of creative solutions. As someone who is not good at puzzles, I never had to consult a guide or ask for assistance during this game. Puzzles are first small, gradually increasing in difficulty and scope. Gameplay is always the focus, and while object placement can be janky, the gameplay is nearly perfect. In perfect Valve fashion, all story is told through gameplay, still engaging the player without stopping them or slowing the game down. The testing theme, lack of music, high tech setting, passive aggressive threatening by the AI system and progressive danger of puzzles leave you feeling like a true lab rat. This gives the whole game  a sense of pseudo horror and unique character. As a proof of concept game and freeware inclusion inside of the orange box, there is no multi player and the campaign is very short. Even then, extra levels and speed optimization leaves some level of replayability. The very small price tag on Steam helps ease this fact, especially when on sale for even less. Overall this gets an 8/10 for solid mechanics, strong atmosphere, and creative freedom that lets anyone think with portals.","timestamp_created":1580317358,"timestamp_updated":1580317358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62634220","author":{"steamid":"76561198419625480","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":342,"last_played":1563547744},"language":"polish","review":"[h1] Portal [/h1]\n\n[b] TWÓRCY: [/b]\n[h1] Valve Software [/h1]\n\n[b] ROK WYDANIA: [/b]\n[h1] 2007 [/h1]\n\n[h1] ★★★★★★★★★★ 8/10 ★★★★★★★★★★ [/h1]\n\n[h1] 👍 PLUSY 👍 [/h1]\nFajny gameplay\nCiekawa grafika\n\n\n[h1] 👎 MINUSY 👎 [/h1]\nNie zauważyłem jakiś szczególnych wad\n\n\n[h1] FABUŁA [/h1]\nW grze wcielamy się w kobietę, która budzi się w jednym z pomieszczeń placówki naukowo-badawczej Aperture Science Enrichment Center, a jej zadaniem jest przetestowanie prototypowego urządzenia o nazwie Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device (ASHPD).

W odnajdywaniu dalszej drogi pomaga nam operująca kobiecym głosem sztuczna inteligencja, wydająca polecenia za pomocą systemu łączności. Jej wskazówki są bardzo cenne, zwłaszcza w początkowej fazie zmagań, gdy gracz musi szybko przyzwyczaić się do specyficznego charakteru rozgrywki.

you for helping us help you help us all.\n\nPROS: This is a triumph!  The puzzles are tight, well designed, and provide you with all the information you need to solve them.  They aren't exactly brain taxing, just enough to provide a solid challenge.  The maps are nice to look at, especially the last stage.  The sounds all have their own note to tell what's around the corner, and the few music tracks amp up the sensations running at the time.  The best is Ellen McLain's performance as GLaDOS.  The dark humor mixed with casual compliments and insults just skyrocket the quips to a whole new level.\n\nCONS: The story is a little lacking, though it opts to keep the fluff off to keep things nice and punchy.  The only real issue is that the last level, while something fresh to look at, can be a tad confusing or annoying to sort through, depending on the player.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS: These are a real hiccup to complete.  The majority can be moved through, with some having slightly different challenges to them, such as removing cameras.  Getting all the gold medals is an absolute chore, and many will find them not worth completing due to the rather steep curve to complete a few.\n\nFINAL: Portal is a magnificently designed puzzle game with great humor, fun puzzles, and a great mechanic in the portal gun to just seal the deal.  The small issues in the game are barely noticeable, and definitely not a deal breaker.  This is one of the must buy titles on Steam, and hands down is one of the better games you can play.","timestamp_created":1580273567,"timestamp_updated":1580273567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62604191","author":{"steamid":"76561198859213478","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":385,"last_played":1588453309},"language":"english","review":"good game. there is a robot. the robot is mad at you. \"grrr im a robot grrr i dont like you grrr im mad at you grrrr >:(\" - the robot in the game. oh and there is a gun that when you pew, it puts a hole in the wall.","timestamp_created":1580271419,"timestamp_updated":1580271419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62602920","author":{"steamid":"76561198049998888","num_games_owned":306,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1580268899},"language":"english","review":"It's a classic game.
