By that, I mean a lot of the surfaces and weapons are too reflective. In the beginning of Office Complex, you enter a dark hallway with a red door on your right and faulty wiring on your left. In this game, the floor looks like a glazed donut.\nThere are several places in the original that look far better.\n\nSomething to note is that the toggle for the HD models seem to use FAN models instead of the ones Gearbox made. It's been this way since 2013 and those models still go uncredited.\n[url=github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/2752] You can read about it here. [/url]\n\n[b] Spec requirements [/b] \nIf you can run Half-Life 2, you can run this with better performance since the detail is lower. Not that you'd want to run this.\n\n[b] Difficulty [/b]\nNothing to note here, although all the chapters are available to enter in a menu in the vein of Half-Life 2, which is a nice quality of life improvement.\nHOWEVER, all of the chapters are available instead of having to unlock them, meaning the chapters are kinda spoiled for you before you even start your playthrough.\n\n[b] Bugs [/b]\nThere are entire series on YouTube, [url=developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Half-Life:_Source_Bugs] and even a page on the Valve Developer community [/url] about bugs in this game.\nOne of the first bugs you'll encounter is at the beginning of the game when you see a scientist levitating above his chair. The subtle storytelling of Half-Life is also ruined when [spoiler] the soldier runs up the stairs to kill you instead of the scientist in \"We've Got Hostiles\". The whole point of this scene was to show you that the military is NOT here to save you and your pals. They were sent here for clean up. Thanks, Half-Life: Source for screwing up the story. [/spoiler]\nThere's bugs in the game that can probably give people seizures. No joke.\n\n[b] So, overall? [/b]\nIt seems this whole thing was a test to see how well you could port GoldSrc maps into Source. Then, they dumped this garbage out on the store for $9.99. Can you imagine buying this in 2004, excited to see Half-Life recreated with the graphics of the sequel? Some people weren't as fortunate and bought the game expecting this. It's the ENTIRE reason Black Mesa exists in the first place.\n\nI recommend this ONLY for Garry's Mod mounting.
