In dem ersten Spielabschnitt wird man von Brad Pitt, Pardon, Wheatly begleitet. Dieser wird vom deutschen Synchronsprecher von Brad Pitt gesprochen, er ist so ein bisschen der Tollpatsch in dem Spiel, hat aber auch aufjedenfall Humor.\n\nIn dem Spiel erfährt man auch, wie Aperture entstanden ist, oder GlaDOS was die Sekretärin von Cave Johnson (Das war der Firmengründer der vorher Duschvorhänge für das Militär entwickelt hat und dadurch reich geworden ist und hat Aperture gegründet, allerdings war dieser auch sehr von der Arbeit besessen und hatte nichts anderes im Kopf als Arbeit. In der Anfangsphase hat er Gele produziert. Was dem Spiel auch neue Gameplayinhalte bietet. Es gibt das Rückstoßgel, das Geschwindigkeitsgel und das Gel was aus Mondstein hergestellt wurde, mit den man anschließend Portale setzen kann. An dem Mondsteingel ist Cave Johnson später auch gestorben. Caroline die Sekretärin sollte Aperture übernehmen. \n\nIm Spiel erzählt Cave Johnson ob man wie Musik auch menschliches Gedächnis auf einer Disc speichern kann, dadurch das er es nicht mehr geschafft hat, aufgrund seiner Krankheit, wurde Caroline später dann zu GlaDOS.\n\nIch habe das Spiel sowohl mit Maus+Tastatur und auch mit Gamepad, den XboxOne Controller (invertiert) gespielt, insgesamt 3-5 Stunden braucht man um dieses Spiel durchzuspielen. Beide Steuerungsarten lassen sich super spielen und es gibt keine Probleme.\n\nCommunity Content gibt es auch, denn man hat die Möglichkeit eigene Testräume zu erstellen.\n\nDer Multiplayer ist auch sehr interessant, es handelt sich um eine Koop-Variante wo man auch nur durch kommt, wenn beide Mitspieler ein gesunden Menschenverstand haben :D.\n\nSoundtrack ist auch sehr gut, sehr elektrolastig, was den Titel aber gut tut, man kann es gut anhören, und passt auch zu den Testkammern.\n\nIst für mich ein Pflichtitel, denn man aufjedenfall kaufen sollte, auf einer Skala würde ich sagen 98% von 100 %, bei metacritic hat es ja auch ein Wert von 95%. Also ein Spiel was sich es lohnt zu spielen, Ein Manko ist eben nur, das die Spieldauer zu kurz ist, wie schon bei dem Vorgänger.","timestamp_created":1468009931,"timestamp_updated":1468009931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546884834766387939","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24190304","author":{"steamid":"76561198071076808","num_games_owned":1005,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":703,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":318,"last_played":1501872789},"language":"polish","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1468008226,"timestamp_updated":1468008226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24190191","author":{"steamid":"76561198079832177","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":788,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1617397250},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom e divertido, vale a pena","timestamp_created":1468007875,"timestamp_updated":1468007875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24190147","author":{"steamid":"76561198209043700","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2758,"last_played":1595105750},"language":"english","review":"Words can not discribe the complexity and surprises that this game has.

This is one of the best games I've ever played. \n\nPortal 2 is a perfect sequel. It captures the genius puzzle solving and learning curve of the first game and expands on it along with introducing new gameplay features that don't detract or feel unnecessary. Amazing voice acting by Ellen McLain, Stephen Merchant and J.K. Simmons paired with a hilarious script make it one of the funniest and most enjoyable games I've ever played. \n\nOn top of the stellar campaign, there is the co-op mode which is a blast. Working with a friend is a great addition to the formula, and it's backed by the same humour and wit found in the single player campaign. \n\nWhile the map creator took some time to launch, the wait was worth it. It's very easy to use, and very intuitive. Workshop for Portal 2 is absolutely amazing and a shining example of how it should be implemented. It's especially great because it's not just limited to single player maps; co-operative maps can be created too. \n\nAs it is a computer game, I just want to mention that at launch I didn't encounter any bugs or issues. It runs very well and visually I think it looks great.\n\nI'm pretty picky with scores. Few games I've played deserve a perfect 10/10, but Portal 2 is definitely one of them.","timestamp_created":1467957634,"timestamp_updated":1467957734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24174885","author":{"steamid":"76561198066290822","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":527,"last_played":1491801914},"language":"english","review":"What a nice sequel!","timestamp_created":1467957081,"timestamp_updated":1467957081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24174655","author":{"steamid":"76561198006639376","num_games_owned":414,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1467517480},"language":"english","review":"It's portal, again, what else is there to say?

Definitiv.[/b]\n\n[h1]Die Story[/h1]\nPortal 2 beginnt dort, wo Portal 1 NICHT aufgehört hat. Nach einer lehr langen Zeit im Hyperschlaf werdet ihr von einem kleinen Roboter namens Wheatley geweckt und versucht nun gemeinsam zu entkommen. Allerdings ist es nicht ganz einfach, den alten Ruinen von Aperture Science zu entkommen, weshalb ihr wieder auch durch alte bekannten Testkammern versuchen müsst, den Weg nach draußen zu finden. Die Story bietet im Vergleich zum 1. Teil viel mehr Abwechslung und auch einige interessante Informationen über Aperture Sience und unerwarteten Plottwists.\n\n[h1]Das Gameplay[/h1]\nUnd wie auch schon im 1. Teil, werden wir auch hier vor vielen Rätseln in Form von Testkammern gestellt. Allerdings gibt es nicht nur ein Bereich, wo wir getestet werden, sondern mehrere, die immer auf ein neues Konzept ausgelegt sind. Diese werden mit dem vorankommen immer komplexer. Dabei führt uns das Spiel erst mit einfachen Testkammern heran, damit der Spieler versteht, wie das neue Element funktioniert und lässt uns dann in größeren und komplexeren Kammern das gelernte umsetzen, oftmals mit weiteren Elementen. Das klappt wirklich sehr gut, weshalb neulinge dort gut reingeführt werden. Trotzem benötigt ihr ein gewisses Grundwissen, welches ihr in Portal 1 lernen müsst.\nZwischen den Bereichen sind wir auch in Gegenden unterwegs, die fast bis ins innere von Apeture Science reichen und einen Einblick geben, wie Apeture Science früher war. Das sorgt nicht nur für eine Abwechslungseiche Story, sondern nutzt auch das gelernte Gameplay.\nWas ich außerdem auch noch empfehlen kann, ist sich die Kommentare der Entwickler anzuhören, da diese einen sehr guten Einblick auf die Entwicklung von Portal 2 bringt und auch einige unbemerkte dinge oder insider zum vorschein bringen.\n\n[h1]Der Multiplayer[/h1]\nWer das Spiel schon zig mal durchgespielt hat, dem wird mit einem Freund im Multiplayer geholfen.\nDer Multiplayer besitzt eine eigene \"Handlung\" mit den Charakteren \"Atlas\" und \"P-Body\", bei dem ihr zusammen eine Anzahl an Testkammern mit einem bestimmten Gameplayelement schaffen müsst. Hier ist gute Teamarbeit gefragt, da man nur gemeinsam das Ziel erreicht. Deswegen ist es auch UNBEDINGT wichtig, es mit einem Freund zu spielen und sich via Teamspeak³ oder Skype oder was auch immer zu verständigen. Dabei wird auch jeder Fehler fürs Team bestraft und nicht für den einzelnen. Nachdem man einen Bereich geschafft hat, hat man den nächsten Freigeschaltet. Und die Anzahl der Bereiche ist groß genug, um locker einige Spielsunden beschäftigt zu sein. Sehr detailverliebt sind die Statistiken, die man in der Hauptwelt sehen kann. So können wir vergleichen, wer wie viele Schritte, Tode oder Kollaborationspunkte hat. Vorallem letzteres wird sehr... naja \"interessant\" verteilt.\n\n[h1]Die Technik[/h1]\nPortal 2 spielt sich nicht nur super, sondern sieht auch noch sehr gut aus. Die Atmosphäre passt sich super zu der Story an und man hat auch wirklich das Gefühl, dass sehr viel Zeit vergangen ist. Fast alles sieht zerstört und verwesen aus und der unterschied zwischen den noch intakten Testkammern und dem Zerstören inneren von Apeture Sience ist sehr gut merkbar.\nVon der Steuerung her hat sich das Spiel im Vergleich zum Vorgänger wenig geändert, was nicht weiter schlimm ist. Durch das zoomen und dem Anzeigen der Portale hinter Wänden hat man einen besseren Überblick, welches alles etwas angenehmer macht.\nEin absoluter Pluspunkt ist die Lokalisierung. Jeder einzelne Charakter hat seine passende Stimme. Weiterhin merkt man wunderbar die Gefühle der einzelnen Charaktere und wie sie es rüberbringen, vorallem mit dem Verlauf der Geschichte. Zudem wird auch hier wieder empfolen, die Geschichte und Hintergründe von Portal 1 zu wissen, um zu verstehen, warum eine Gewisse Person so reagiert.\n\n[h1]Pro/Kontra[/h1]\n+ tolle Lokalisierung\n+ auffrischende Gameplayelemente\n+ lange, unterhaltsame Story\n+ sehr gut gelungener Multiplayer\n- Bis jetzt noch nichts zu Portal 3 :(\n\n[h1]Bertung: [/h1]\n[b]\n9 von 10 Punkten\n\nEines der wohl besten Spiele der gesamten Videospielgeschichte. Für jeden, der auch 20€ übrig hat, kommt davon nicht drum rum.
