Странным способом попав в город, в буквальном смысле парящем над землёй на воздушных облаках, вы поражаетесь его красотой и эстетичностью. Люди приветливо встречают друг друга, все радуются очередному дню, готовятся к предстоящему празднику, по радио играют спокойные мелодии, навевающие прекрасное настроение. \n\nНо вскоре вы понимаете, что это всё простая ширма. На самом деле в прекрасном городе царит тоталитарность и буржуазизм. Богатые доминируют над бедными, угнетают и без зазрения совести убивают их. В каких то районах царит настоящая война. А в это время, государь Коллумбии - Пророк - говорит о светлом будущем и призывает всех жителей найти и уничтожить вас. Вам ничего не остаётся, кроме как прокладывать себе дорогу многочисленными трупами и кровавыми лужами, попутно удивляясь \"тёмной\" стороне Колумбии. \n\nНо вы не один. С вами бегает странноватая, но невероятно красивая и умная девушка Элизабет. Сначала она словно маленький ребёнок радует всему, что окружает вас и с оптимизмом смотрит на будущее, но судьба города меняет её. Меняет в тёмную сторону. Эта перемена в буквальном смысле поражает вас и вы не можете поверить, что ранее милая девушка может стать таким же, как и вы - убийцей. \n\nА между тем, события принимают иной оборот. В какой то момент вы словно оказываетесь в другом мире, в другой реальности, где всё протекает иначе, но и там есть опасность. А в конце вы засомневаетесь - а в настоящей ли вселенной вы? Что есть правда, а что есть ложь? Кто вы такой на самом деле, и кто такая Элизабет? Последние минуты игры в буквальном смысле рвут все мыслимые и немыслимые шаблоны.\n\nЭто необычная игра. Под динамичным экшеном скрывается нечто большее, что есть на самом деле. И это нечто должно поразить вас и не оставить равнодушным. Это уникальное явление в жанре боевик.\n\nЭто - BioShock Infinite.","timestamp_created":1454443757,"timestamp_updated":1454443757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":40,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.751248836517333984","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20917287","author":{"steamid":"76561198086164782","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":421,"last_played":1466160487},"language":"english","review":"Good story, decent graphics, lots of hours to put in.","timestamp_created":1454440742,"timestamp_updated":1454440742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20917219","author":{"steamid":"76561198110931194","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2928,"last_played":1527200971},"language":"russian","review":"Игра неимоверно шикарная.\nКонцовка выше всяких похвал, после неё проходить игру еще раз - одно удовольствие!","timestamp_created":1454440541,"timestamp_updated":1454440541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20915918","author":{"steamid":"76561198172055451","num_games_owned":341,"num_reviews":145,"playtime_forever":7059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":243,"last_played":1504132891},"language":"english","review":"Very good game with awesome graphics and so far i hav not experienced any glitches that brak the game!","timestamp_created":1454436454,"timestamp_updated":1454436454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50053173303604126","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20915114","author":{"steamid":"76561198255236584","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":629,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":389,"last_played":1456090021},"language":"italian","review":"è bello.","timestamp_created":1454433738,"timestamp_updated":1454433738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20914952","author":{"steamid":"76561198020315009","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":569,"last_played":1454772022},"language":"russian","review":"шик","timestamp_created":1454433210,"timestamp_updated":1454433210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20914298","author":{"steamid":"76561198159409763","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":903,"last_played":1587916558},"language":"russian","review":"Сказать, что я охренела от сюжета - это ничего не сказать.

Playing bioshock 1 and 2 will make the story make more sense.\n\nOk, im going to try to keep this review spoiler free so... give me a shot.\n\nThis game is probably one of the best i've ever played, and to be quite honest, youre going to find very very few (cough cough, the last of us) to none like it. The game sets you in a city in the sky, and through every turn you will find yourself in mystery. Will this happen? How is that possible? What if I don't make it? Where's that damn infusion? All common questions asked constantly thoughout the game. And in the end you will find yourself asking new questions. ([spoiler]Is she ok?! What if she dies? How does she do that?[/spoiler])\n\nNow, I can't really say much after this wihtout going into detail about the game and spoiling it, so were just gonna review it overall. I have never given a game a perfect 10/10. And lets face it: This game does not make that 10/10 cut. There are 4 aspects in an adventure game that must be flawless in order to recieve a perfect score from me.\n\n[4 pts] Story: \nHow its rated: \n-How well did the story flow? This game likes to dump the whole story on you, then answer the story's questions later. While this can make the story rocky, it doesn't leave you waiting too long for an answer.\n-Were there any important story aspects that were unanswered? Nope. [spoiler]Other than, What will she do now?[/spoiler]\n-Was it unpredictable? You know it.\n-How in-depth was it? Pretty in-depth. Like I said before, it dumps all the questions on you thoughout the game, then tends to them later. So it may seem shallow at the start, but you go to the deep end.\n-Did it keep me intrigued? Yes and no. There were, of course, some areas where I couldnt help but want to follow the story line because that was most important. But there were also important times in the story where I just wanted to stop and look for more g-dang Infusion and ammo and equipment. \n-Was it satisfiying? Yes, it makes me miss the characters too. (brb 2nd playthough)\n-Did it leave me asking for more?: The game in itself? Yes. Very very much. The DLCs do wrap everything up though. \n\n[Points earned: 4/4]\n\n[3 pts] Gameplay: \n-How well did it execute its format (FPS/RPG): Ok, let me start by saying that: I played this on hard, so those who played on just easy, might not agree with my points. When it boils down to it, most of the guns and gear have no real good use. You might stop and think in the beginning: \"wow gee wizz this gun is gear is gr8 m8!!!\", but later on you'll find that the gun/gear you've been using for awhile doesnt last, even with upgrades. And an infusion alone doesn't really have any significant impact. (except infusionS, you really gotta dedicate yourself to finding them, which is good). This kinda hurts the aspect of RPG sadly. As far as the gun-play goes. It's really good. Really friggin good. Has me watchin my ammo and the gun-play is pretty fair all in all (glitches can affect fairness).\n-Were there any overpowered/underpowered things that made the gameplay experience better/worse? Yeah. The fact that you couldn't really use all the guns due to their lack of power just made the game a bit stale at times. For what it's worth, I am the type of guy who loves a challenge, and this game provided. There wasn't an enemy that was too overpowered and made the game un-fun. But there were definetly times where I said \"this is BULLSHIT, HOW THE F*** DOES HE LIVE THOUGH THAT?\".\n-How is the AI?: Enemy AI is pretty good, but, as always, I do find at times that enemies will do things that are just straight up retarded. In terms of friendly AI (eliz), I like how she doesn't get in the way, but holy hell does she warp A LOT. \n-How are the gameplay mechanics?: Mechanically, this game's combat flows like water, atleast if youre smart about certain things, it is. (USE UR VIGORS, KIDS)\n-Replayability: TBA\n\n[Points earned: 2.5/3]\n \n[2 pts] Immersion: Immersion is pretty important in a story game.\n-How deep ware you immersed?: If there is one thing that this game does well, it's putting you in the moment story wise. The game really sets you in the mood of 1990, HOWEVER: There are many moments where immersion is broken due to things that woudn't happen realistically (ie. bodies becoming lockboxes when you turn around, Elizabeth warping all over the damn place, etc.) There is one area however that has 2 doors that lead to a black and emptty room for some reason. Not sure whether to put it in bugs or this category. Both were unlocked so...

This was to be the highlight of it, I mean look at the reviews, this game must be fantastic. Well I just don't get it. This is nothing like the first 2 games.\n\nIt starts off really promising, as with the previous games the atmosphere is amazing, it's like a walking tour (get used to those) through a fantasy land but something is brewing under the surface. As the tour continues things get disturbing and you realize you are there to do something bad. The people realize who you are and the atmosphere completely changes. It's quite remarkable technically and as a story build-up.\n\nBefore I go on I'd like to note the really strong racism in the game. I get why it's in there and I wasn't offended but they lay it on really thick and it's distracting at some points.\n\nAnyway, for me it it all starts falling apart a few hours into the game. The story gets very convoluted very fast. It's hard to follow because it makes assumptions that you know what their idea of multiple dimensions would be like and runs with it. It all makes sense to them, at one point the two main characters come to the same conclusion at the same time (jinks!) and I'm just left thinking, \"what?\".\n\nIt continues like that all the way to the end where nothing is explained and you aren't even sure how any of it relates to the rest of the series. You have to research the overall story to see how anything you just saw means anything at all. Turns out there are some super obscure references and you have to be a Bioshock guru to make those connections on your own. The DLC Burial at Sea part 2 is required to make sense of it. It's the true ending and it was a crappy way to do it. Even then I don't think I would have understood unless I had read up on the mess I saw prior.\n\nIf the story of a game requires fan theories or someone else to spell it out for you because it was so confusing is it really that great?\n\nThe game mechanics are dumbed down compared to first 2. It's a corridor shooter this time, with the standard action/calm cycles. There is little reason to explore because you will wind up in those areas later and the purpose for the area will make much more sense when you are supposed to be there. The amazing atmosphere you were treated to in the beginning feels unimportant, it means almost nothing that there is this amazing city in the sky.\n\nI just don't get the reviews on this game. It's not awful but there is nothing to gush over here and it's not a continuation of the Bioshock story. This is more like a spin-off, it's similar to the original but is mostly unrelated, except for Burial at Sea which sloppily ties the games together. As you can see this isn't called Bioshock 3, hopefully we'll get that someday.","timestamp_created":1454338487,"timestamp_updated":1482807472,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20894270","author":{"steamid":"76561198090385657","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2568,"last_played":1639174227},"language":"english","review":"This game had, perhaps, the most compelling narrative and cast of characters of any I've ever played. On that alone I would recommend it. It also builds upon the art style of previous Bioshock games, and successfully creates another incredible world and atmosphere all it's own that you'll love to explore. The Irrational team once again dives deep into the social issues of the time (19teens) that continue to plague us, albeit somewhat less intensely, today. The storytelling by way of events in game as well as recordings scattered around has also been polished from previous games. Your character, Booker Dewitt, is not a silent protagonist, and is the very definition of an anti-hero.\nFor the bad, the gameplay is definitely watered down from previous titles. I found it exciting and addictive, so much so that I poured hours into the dlc that's nothing but various battles (Clash in the Clouds) to earn character art and such, but the old system of modding and customizing your ability set has been streamlined considerably. The arsenal in particular is reduced, this is a two gun at a time game.\nOnce again, this game proved to be a ride like no other, so whether you are an old Bioshock fan or just enjoy a well told sorry with breathtaking visuals, you owe it to yourself to pick this bad boy up.","timestamp_created":1454338248,"timestamp_updated":1454338248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20893985","author":{"steamid":"76561198019521561","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":830,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":589,"last_played":1455184714},"language":"bulgarian","review":"Such a great game.

This game captivated me the whole way through and completely surpassed my expectations.  The story is absolutely fenomenal (albeit difficult to comprehend for some) and leaves you wanting more.\n\nThe whole journey through the story lasted me roughly 10 hours on hard difficulty.  I felt like every moment of gameplay was well handcrafted and beautifully done.  The setting, the story, and the interactions between everybody and everything really sold the game to me.\n\nI have not played any of the previous Bioshock games (yet), but I was able to understand the story and follow it the whole game without feeling like I was missing the punchline to the joke.\n\nI bought this game three years after its release date and I wish I could say that it showed its age.  For $7.49 during a sale, this game is well worth it.\n\n\n\nP.S. The DLC are great, but the first one is a bit shorter than one would expect.  All in all, a great experience only made better with the DLC.","timestamp_created":1454308248,"timestamp_updated":1480298300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20888281","author":{"steamid":"76561198128997856","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":480,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":408,"last_played":1454577129},"language":"russian","review":"На остров верущих пришел Атеист.

Gone are the more stealth oriented situations and cramped corridors of Rapture and in their place, we have the best combat in the series and a beautiful, bright (but pretty racist) Columbia. The presentation of the atmosphere and story is exceptional as expected, but this time you get a likable companion who really helps you and mostly stays out of your way. There's also well written dialogue and story moments between characters which the previous games couldn't really have in their setting.The story got a bit weird and hard to follow for me near the end but its paced very well still and ripe for analysis. And as for the music, you're in for a real treat if you listen closely. \n\nAnd NO HACKING MINIGAME at all this time. Instead you get to scrounge around your surroundings, which I already loved doing, to see more of the neat stuff hidden away.\n\nThe Clash in the Clouds dlc is ok if you like the combat but I get bored with wave based combat arena dlc's in general. \n\nNow, if you played BioShock 1 and loved it, you wouldn't be treating yourself if you didn't get the Burial at Sea dlc's. To me, they're one of the best dlc's I've ever played because they tie up the whole series so nicely and go back to the stealthy roots of BioShock and ease you back in until you're in a state of stealth based gameplay deeper than the previous games ever ventured and they somehow still manage to make it a rewarding journey.\n\nBless you, Papa

Ik ben gerustgesteld, dit derde spel is een volwaardig lid van de Bioshock-familie. Sterker nog, Infinite overstijgt de eerste twee (en vele andere) spelen op het gebied van verhaal, setting, game-play en grafisch design. Het is een genot voor de ogen om door de zwevende wereld van Colombia te dwalen. Het is zeer indrukwekkend om te zien hoeveel zorg er is besteed aan de gedetailleerde verbeelding van deze kleurrijke, maar duistere stad. Het verhaal is krankzinnig, maar zeer ingenieus en meeslepend. \n\nDe gameplay is voor een belangrijk deel vergelijkbaar met die van de eerdere delen. Er zijn een reeks \"psychokinetische\" krachten voor je linkerhand en een  grote variëteit aan wapens voor de rechterhand. In tegenstelling tot Bioshock 1 en 2, kun je maar twee wapens tegelijk bij je dragen, maar er liggen meer dan genoeg andere wapens verspeid over Columbia, zodat je vaak kunt wisselen. Nieuw is ook de mogelijkheid om je hangend te verplaatsen aan een soort achtbaanrail. De belangrijkste vernieuwing echter is de aanwezigheid van een AI-gestuurde hulp in de vorm van Elizabeth. Dit personage zorgt ervoor dat munitie en health op moeilijke momenten worden aangevuld. Ze is een trouwe bondgenoot (alhoewel?) in de strijd tegen de hordes vijanden die je pad kruisen.\n\nConcluderend: ik denk niet dat ik snel een spel zal tegenkomen dat beter is dan Bioshock Infinite, of het zal Half-life 3 moeten worden.
