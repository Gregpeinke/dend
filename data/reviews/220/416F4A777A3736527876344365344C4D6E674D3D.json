When I played the full game up to that point, it felt like finally being tall enough for a theme park ride that you have wanted to ride on for ages.

With memorable characters like Barney (still owes me a beer), Alyx (can do Assassin's Creed parkour), Kleiner (finds turkey-sized parasites cute), Eli (wants grandkids), Mossman (ok maybe not that good) and Breen (I would vote for him). The G-Man is by far my favourite.\n\nThe Source Engine really forms the feeling of Eastern Europe/Bulgaria (where the game is set) and makes the environment not only look, but feel, real. \n\nWhat this game achieves is, by video game standards (heck, even higher), being a genuinely good game. \n\nNow go ahead and invade Alcatraz with the help of an alien testicle!","timestamp_created":1643116785,"timestamp_updated":1643116785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108749871","author":{"steamid":"76561198985843543","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":916,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":916,"last_played":1638037535},"language":"russian","review":"NAZIS IS ATTACKING!!!","timestamp_created":1643110515,"timestamp_updated":1643110515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108748723","author":{"steamid":"76561199092801865","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":569,"last_played":1653068997},"language":"russian","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1643108789,"timestamp_updated":1643108789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108745950","author":{"steamid":"76561199037458321","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":813,"playtime_last_two_weeks":394,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1660491992},"language":"russian","review":"+","timestamp_created":1643104323,"timestamp_updated":1643104323,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108743789","author":{"steamid":"76561198228134084","num_games_owned":292,"num_reviews":114,"playtime_forever":660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1643145085},"language":"spanish","review":"Que se puede decir que no esté dicho sobre HL2, lejos el mejor juego de su generación, un adelantado a su época, una obra maestra en todos sus aspectos, la IA, la música, la historia, los personajes, el combate, los efectos de sonido, todo, absolutamente funciona perfecto en este, y en toda la saga HL.

Although the graphics haven't aged extremely well (and still were not cutting-edge by 2004), the gameplay and its mechanics make the base for one of the best storytelling FPS adventures out there.\n\nUp to this day, i have never played a better time-weighted game, where you're not spending too much time in the same environment or the opposite. The idea to use havoc's physics engine as a weapon with the gravity gun was total genius and the visual storytelling of each level was spot-on: Seeing the effects of the combine invasion in the city areas and even more in the coastal and canal areas makes up for interesting nature-construction environments, and the rotten town of Ravenholm, once lived by workers, now infected by all sorts of headcrabs, creates one of the best horror scenarios of the whole FPS scene, with its dim lighting, almost entirely used to lead the player to its objectives and not to just brighten the play area.\n\nThe mix of polished content and uncut beta assets makes a developer-side analysis of the game much more interesting, no wonder why there's such a healthy and durable part of the community that, still today, after 18 years, takes so much care in rebuilding each piece together and finding out the history of scrapped features. Not to mention, the beta content used in Ravenholm only makes the game more eerie and unsettling, with low detailing that leaves the player to wonder or with unexpected and unidentifiable sounds coming from all parts.\n\nThe game features one of the most arcadey styles of combat, with a wide variety of weapons, the iconic crowbar, if you run out of ammo, and the innovative gravity gun if you simply want to wreck stuff and have fun. If that doesn't suit your fighting style, there's loads of mods that enhance or change entirely the way the game plays. MMod, for example, adds multiple polishings to the game, such as reworked particle and visual effects, ironsight features, new viewmodel animations, new weapons and a multitude of other toggleable changes. If you're going for something more sillier or simply different, sites like gamebanana are out there for you to explore.\n\nThis game signifies the debut of Valve into the Source engine, underlooked nowadays, but incredibly capable if worked with properly. Its spaghetti code only limits the performance, but the accessibility renders it a viable choice for entry-level developers, as it's been in the past for a huge multitude of games.\nWith it came legendary official games like Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress 2 and the Portal series, as well as so called \"sourcemods\" like Garry's Mod, Insurgency and Fistful of Frags.\nHundreds, if not thousands of other sourcemods have spawned as games with similar gameplay mechanics, using the game's features with different stories and campaigns.\nIf the game already satisfies you as it is, but sounds repetitive and boring after 18 years, Synergy is on the steam market for free, to allow you to replay the game with your friends in Coop modes.\nOverall, this game has shown how much a Graphics engine is able to become a meme and a shared workspace for multiple types of development.","timestamp_created":1643042890,"timestamp_updated":1643042929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525000035762786865","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108692568","author":{"steamid":"76561198119058696","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":696,"last_played":1647142522},"language":"latam","review":"es un juego que no debe faltar en tu biblioteca. que haces que todavia no lo compraste?","timestamp_created":1643041233,"timestamp_updated":1643041233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108688484","author":{"steamid":"76561199142115052","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1011,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1011,"last_played":1643028916},"language":"czech","review":"This is the best PC game i ever played.","timestamp_created":1643036809,"timestamp_updated":1643036809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108688241","author":{"steamid":"76561199167149904","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":831,"last_played":1643036457},"language":"schinese","review":"一周目，感觉还不错","timestamp_created":1643036559,"timestamp_updated":1643036559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108687894","author":{"steamid":"76561199016030875","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1670,"last_played":1641695341},"language":"english","review":"I love this game.\n\n9/10\n\n:)","timestamp_created":1643036196,"timestamp_updated":1643036196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108687885","author":{"steamid":"76561199059535307","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":756,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":751,"last_played":1643211268},"language":"english","review":"I still have nightmares about that cat...","timestamp_created":1643036187,"timestamp_updated":1643036187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108683307","author":{"steamid":"76561198856381318","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":637,"last_played":1643030725},"language":"russian","review":"игра топ 10/10 всплакнул и вспомнил детство","timestamp_created":1643030902,"timestamp_updated":1643030902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz76Rxv4Ce4LMngM="}
