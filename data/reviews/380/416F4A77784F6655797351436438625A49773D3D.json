Разработчики из Valve, решив, что создание полноценного продолжения займёт слишком много времени, предлагают нам кушать игру по кусочкам, сделав систему эпизодов, что позволяет выпускать игры чаще. Трудно сказать, было ли это решение верным.\n\nИгра продолжается ровно в том месте, где мы и остановились в финале второй части. Реактор Цитадели взорван, однако его ядро всё ещё не стабильно и со временем сдетонирует подорвав весь город. Гордону и Аликс предстоит замедлить рекцию ядра и постаратся спасити жителей города. А так же спастись самим...\n\nИгра выходит спустя два года, предлагая нам окунутся ещё раз в историю вселенной Half-Life. Однако окунаемся мы буквально до колен, после чего игра быстро заканчивается, показывая нам смачный трейлер второго эпизода. Данная часть серии стала более динамичней, по сравнению с предшественником, однако заканчивается настолько быстро, что не успеваешь полностью насладится игрой. После двух то лет ожиданий, получаем чуть более чем трехчасовую кампанию. Отчего создается впечатление, что мы играем не в полноценную игру, а скорее в небольшое дополнение.\n\nГеймплей остался практически таким же. Понравилось лихое начало, где мы используя грави-пушку раскидываем солдат Альянса в разные стороны. В этой части схваток с зомби и мутантами стало больше. Так же было несколько необычно играть с Аликс, которая сопровождала нас практически всю игру. При этом AI был улучшен ещё больше. Наша напарница метко стреляет, перелазит через стенки, при подходе врагов слишком близко, может даже ударить с ноги или прикладом. Часто комментирует разные ситуации и делает подсказки в некоторых местах.\n\nПоявились пару новых врагов. Так же добавили технологию HDR, которую впоследствии перенесли и во вторую часть. Плюс были улучшения искуственного интелекта и анимации персонажей.\n\n[h1] Данный эпизод понравился своей динамичностью, однако малая продолжительность игры и практически отсутствие каких-либо новвоведений, не дают поставить игре более высокую оценку.\n\nОценка: 8/10 [/h1]","timestamp_created":1401094267,"timestamp_updated":1419160070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":136,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.837244629859924316","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10225227","author":{"steamid":"76561198042075548","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":440,"last_played":1619606015},"language":"english","review":"Hmmm, okay, another part to Half Life 2.

You run a lot, escort some people, get told to have sex over radio, shoot white guys (sorry \"combine\"), and jump around while you hit things with a crowbar.

Même en se mettant en tête de réaliser le succes de finir le jeu en ne tirant qu'une seule cartouche, le jeu reste trop simple, je n'imagine même pas si j'avais utilisé l'ensemble de l'armement mis à disposition. En ce qui concerne la durée de vie, c'est bien entendu trop court mais je ne trouve pas que cela gâche la fête de reprendre Gordon Freeman en main pour quelques heures: en effet bien qu'aucune nouveauté significative soit présente, on prend un véritable plaisir à pouvoir poursuivre une aventure qui débute directement là où nous avait laissé Half-Life 2. La dynamique de jeu apporte quand elle pas mal de chose sympa, je pense tout particulierement au moment où il faut éclairé les ennemis pour qu'Alix puisse les dézinguer ou la partie où elle est au sniper, et quelques autres passage vraiment excellent. L'ambiance sonore est toujours aussi bonne, et l'on retrouve la sensation de survie (de surtout devoir se dépatouiller) des précedents opus (mention spéciale pour le moment où se fait canarder par le Strider tout en devant escalader).

This game is certainly the weakest part of the Half-Life series. I personally enjoyed my time with it as it gave a better conclusion to Half-Life 2, this episode doesn't add  much when it comes to storyline or gameplay but I feel like anyone that is playing through the Half-Life games needs to play this game to experiance the Half-Life series as a whole. As you can see from my hours played it is a very short game but It was enjoyable none the less. If you are only playing through one Half-Life game I wouldn't recommend this one due to its length. In comparison to Episode 2 and the original Half-Life 2 this game just lacks something. But like I said if you are playing through the Half-Life series give it a shot and enjoy the horrible wait for Half-Life 3/Episode 3 like the rest of us!","timestamp_created":1394317196,"timestamp_updated":1394317196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9389002","author":{"steamid":"76561198070681274","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":902,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1611127673},"language":"english","review":"game is amazing nuff said","timestamp_created":1394309067,"timestamp_updated":1394309067,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9383794","author":{"steamid":"76561198081730381","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":321,"last_played":1422458103},"language":"french","review":"Un premier épisodes de Half Life avec une fin des plus stressantes !

The community had to wait 8 long years for the sequel and as soon as it came out it hit like a bomb. The game was an instant success and still is one precious gaming gem. It is a must have and must play for everyone, who wants to experience the evolution of the shooter-genre at first hand. No other game has had more influence on the genre since its release. The game is fast, the graphics are still very nice (keep in mind this was the first game with animated facial expressions!), the story is great (but you need to know what happened in HL), the AI is good and the sound effects and music are superb. \n\nYou like shooters?
