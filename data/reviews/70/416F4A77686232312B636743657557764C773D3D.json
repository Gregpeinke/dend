Even though HL was released in 1999 it still holds its own even to this very day and is still a total blast to play! \n\nSummary:\nYou are Dr. Gordon Freeman a scientist in the Black Mesa Research Facility that is late to work. Today was going to be an ordinary day doning on your Hazard Suit and testing in the Sector C Test Lab with a new specimen that was delivered by a very shady character known as the G-Man(an egotistical douche). While doing the test something went horribily, horribily wrong. Somehow the specimen created a link to your world and an alien demension. It is now your job to survive by any means necessary and get to the surface to get help!\n\nPros:\n-Very well paced including the difficultys spikes thoughout the game(SAVE OFTEN!!!)\n-Good amount of ememy variety! Some are very cunning and will work together to take you down. Watch your back!\nCons:\n-Some bugs thoughout the game but nothing gamebreaking\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone who likes the old classics or has never played Half-Life before. It'll take you a good 8-9 maybe 10 hours to beat Half-Life depending on what difficulty you are playing on and like I said before SAVE OFTEN!","timestamp_created":1414129099,"timestamp_updated":1414129099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.392311036586761475","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12605128","author":{"steamid":"76561198093260100","num_games_owned":532,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":847,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":519,"last_played":1585531333},"language":"spanish","review":"Bueno... el principio de todo.\nHace muchos años que este juego significo la infancia de muchos, horas y horas jugando en las cabinas con los amigos, de chico llegué a jugar la campaña pero no le preste la atención que debía.\nLos gráficos para su tiempo estuvieron buenos, ahora que steam saco el sountrack del juego, vaya que tiene excelentes temas, 10/10 IGN. \nDe la jugabilidad no me quejo por el año en que salio el juego, pero si que tienes muchas imprecisiones.\nEn cuanto a la historia, Gordon Freeman un capo de los capos, él solo contra aliens, militares etc. \nEl juego tiene muy pocos diálogos, así que tu solo debes ir sacando conclusiones y estar atento a todos los detalles.\nEl final te deja con unas intrigas, dicen que en la segunda parte te explican mas sobre G-man, el tipo de terno azul.\nExisten 2 spin- off que suceden paralelamente al primero, pero con otros personajes, tengo que jugar esos antes de la secuela.\nPara los que no entienden el final es simple, G-man le da dos opciones a Freeman, trabajar para él y vivir, te metes en el portal necesario para el half life 2, o ir a una batalla en la cual no  ganarás y terminarás muriendo, el verdadero final sería el primero, ya que de lo contrario no habría continuación.\nLa dificultad es un poco complicada, ahora, dicen que el source es un revienta huevos hasta en fácil, pero será para más adelante. \nJuegaso sin duda, todos deberían meterse en esta gran saga.","timestamp_created":1414120894,"timestamp_updated":1585440344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.585855364799499512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12601449","author":{"steamid":"76561198065413184","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":965,"last_played":1414096708},"language":"english","review":"For its time its amazing but i must say I cant remember a fun moment or anything positive tbh.

One day he shows up to work for an expirement and accidently lets alien creatures into his workplace. That is the basic premise of the game. I won't spoil any more story, you'll have to play it yourself. Gordan will meet many people along his journey such as some scientists and some army men. There is even a guy with short hair in a blue suit! \n\nWhile it can be confusing at some times, the game is pretty straightford. The game did come out in 1998, so naturally the graphics aren't photorealistic, but the are very snazzy for their time. The weapons range from the generic pistol to some snazzy alien weaponry.  There are 19 chapters, taking place in Black Mesa (an underground research facility), the New Mexico desert (My favourite parts), and Xen (a snazzy alien world). The game goes for roughly 18-22 hours, but you can always mod it. But what makes the gameplay unique is the lack of cutscenes. This really does add that extra bit of immersion. It makes you really believe you are Gordan. \n\nThe biggest flaw I can think of would be the sometimes confusing maps.

Prima di quel fatidico 1998, infatti, nessun altro titolo poteva vantare una simile potenza espressiva, con una storia che si sviluppa a mano a mano che il giocatore prosegue e un’ambientazione eccezionalmente ricca e dettagliata, frutto del genio dello scrittore di fantascienza Marc Laidlaw. Come spesso è stato sottolineato, la sua vera forza non risiede tanto nella storia (che anzi contiene parecchi elementi pulp), quanto nella sua narrazione. Se il livello d’immersione è ora considerato un elemento imprescindibile per il successo di qualsivoglia videogioco, il merito è soprattutto di [i]Half-Life[/i].\nCerto, stiamo parlando di un videogioco pubblicato nel secolo scorso. Alcuni giocatori potrebbero storcere il naso di fronte al comparto grafico, all’epoca superlativo ma oggi chiaramente obsoleto. Chiunque sia in grado di gettare lo sguardo appena più in là, tuttavia, si ritroverà tra le mani un gioiello che lo segnerà per sempre. Per questo non esito a consigliare vivamente [i]Half-Life[/i] a tutti: non solo ai giocatori della vecchia guardia, ma anche ai più giovani che vogliano rendere omaggio a quello che spesso è stato definito, a mio avviso non a torto, come uno dei più grandi capolavori della storia del videogioco.\nCiò detto, quale versione scegliere tra l’originale e [i]Half-Life: Source[/i]?

algunas cosas que te encontraras alrededor del juego y probaras 2 armas.La historia es extensa pero no dejara de emocionarte mas y mas,si quieres mas reto prueba las distintas dificultades hasta

juge y jamas dire que es malo porque este juego es muy especial.El modo multijugador me agrado en un gran principio pero despues empezaron a aparecer jugadores que abusan con el cañon tau y el modulo de recarga nadie podia jugar con estos jugadores presentes en la partida ademas de hacer spawnkill con el cañon tau en crossfire y otros mapas abandone este juego culpa de eso,No solo eso tenia que desinstalar y volver a instalar este juego por un hack o algo asi que causaba que mi juego no funcionara correctamente (Este se Apodaba \"Destroy\")y es la segunda razon por la cual abandone este

Si t'es un badass, tu finis dans l'impasse..\n\nLE truc à savoir c'est que ce titre à révolutionné le genre et des années plus tard peu de FPS savaient rassembler toutes ces innovations : éléments de décors destructibles, interactions avec les personnages, dialogues aléatoires riche des personnages qui se font la conversation, level design pensé comme une jeu de plate-forme façon Metroïd, logique et cohérence du parcours et du scénario qui distille lentement sur fond paranoïde : du régal lorsque l'on avait que du DOOM, que du HEXEN et consort !\n\n\nUn FPS intelligent, parfois difficile, mais résolument orienté action qui ne souffre pas plus que ça de graphismes dépassés, croyez-moi, n'écoutez pas les sirènes du remake \"Half-Life Source\" qui vend du HD mais en dégrandant le concept original.\n\nSi vous découvrez ce jeu donc, tentez plutôt celui-ci en mode original à la place de son remake raté intitulé \"Half-Life Source\" sinon lisez les critiques  comparatives AVANT, vous verrez à quel point l'original est meilleur.\n\n\n______________________\n\nLe Remake \"Half-Life Source\" \n______________________\n\nConcernant le remake (se trouvant aussi sur Steam à une autre page), il n'apportera rien (certainement pas une meilleur expérience de jeu, ni de magnifiques graphismes comme on l'aurait cru, ni même rien de notable d'ailleurs en dehors de nouveaux bugs qui n'existaient pas à l'époque d'Hal-Life, donc avec cette version simplement nommée Half-Life).\n\nHalf-Life Source est donc une erreur, une divergeance temporelle, un accident cosmique : il n'apporte rien et pire encore il :\n\n- supprime certain détails (moins gore par exemple)\n- lag en pleine action à cause du chargement des cellules (ce n'était pas le cas avant)\n- rend les temps de chargements carrément plus longs et détestables entre chaque niveaux\n- lisse la difficultée qui devient en mode le plus dur clairement casual (je suspecte la sélection de la difficulté d'être buggée puisque c'est un jeu d'enfant en mode extrême..........) \n- sans parler d'éléments de jeu originaux qui ont disaprus\n- contrairement aux nombreux bugs qui eux se sont invités en famille....\n\n...et surtout le remake Source rend ridicule l'eau ou textures soit disant HD car au final, le jeu reste vieux et ceux qui veulent découvrir cet excellent jeu devraient se tourner vers l'original pour au moins une raison : c'est l'original en bien et en mal! Et il est complet au moins.\n\nLe seul avantage du Source c'est de gérer les écrans plus larges mais à quel prix ?\n\n\nL'argument des nouvelles textures n'est pas recevable : le remake Source reste tout aussi out-dated visuellement (donc aucun intérêt sur ce point précis, vous ne baverez pas plus que devant l'original), les textures HD ne changent rien et n'ont rien de HD en réalité (elles sont même peu homogènes avec certaines plus laides que d'autres)..\n\n.. je crois même qu'un zeste de censure modère les effets de sang, bref sans compter des bugs et options de jeu passées à la trape...\n\nC'esr assez honteux en fait.. Même ceux qui ne connaissaient pas ce jeu, n'auraient rien à gagner à jouer avec son remake \"Source\", ce faux HD qui dénature l'original. \n\nEt honnêtement, ça passe tout à fait l'original sur des grands écrans (y'a juste un bord noir sur les côtés mais sans aucune déformation) et au moins c'est celui qui fut joué à l'époque dans les mêmes conditions.\n\n\"Petits jeunes\" (ou pas) qui découvrez cette mythique série, ne vous laissez pas abuser par les promesses du HD, elles ne sont pas tenues et imposent trop de nouvelles restrictions pour pouvoir vivre l'expérience originelle de Half-Life (lenteur des chargement, disparition d'éléments).","timestamp_created":1412999947,"timestamp_updated":1413012263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12441633","author":{"steamid":"76561198039357143","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":247,"last_played":1413220478},"language":"english","review":"This game is an atrocity, I can't believe this was the prior to my favorite game ever, Half-Life 2.

I also consider it to be one of the best games ever made. I know that statement is not as powerful coming from a random reviewer such as myself, but you can trust me that this game is just that brilliant. Just the fact that there are no literal \"levels\" or \"cutscenes\" makes this game feel like a real experience. The pacing of the game was just spot on, from the slow pace of the beginning to the more intense final battle on Xen. Every action sequence, puzzle and dialogue are balanced and not shoved into the player's throat immediately like some games today. If you can get pass the dated graphics (I think they still have their charm), this is an experience that every gamer needs to have at least sometime in their lives. I will actually say that I like Half-Life better than Half-Life 2.\n\nPros:\n* Amazing pace\n* Fantastic gameplay\n* Genuinely crafted to fine detail\n* Doesn't feel like you're playing a game, you feel like you are experiencing the story itself\n* Great tone with music, lighting and audio effects.\n\nCons:\n* The graphics can throw \"some\" people off, but you know what you're getting into if you're playing this game.\n* Other than that, I really don't have any cons with this game.\n","timestamp_created":1412909243,"timestamp_updated":1412909243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12429463","author":{"steamid":"76561198122588183","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":555,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":554,"last_played":1414355744},"language":"english","review":"It's a very old game, and the aiming is very finicky, and the game gets extremely diffucult!

Pourquoi alors je préserve tant de satisfaction pour ce titre à mes yeux cultissime parqu'il viellit trés bien au fil des ans, point de vue Intelligeance artificiel tjs autant réactive et impressionante (ya qu'a voir ça en mode difficile c'est un trés bon challenge de réussir sans trop de bléssure), les marines souvent réagissent de la même façon que nous (ils ce planquent et  observent pour bien canaliser la cible tout en comuniquant entre eux, puis ils savent trés bien venir vous chercher pour vous debusquer. \nSeul les graphismes presentent des trais de viellésse, mais j'ai rien à dire la dessus car je me replacerais tjs dans le contexte de son époque où il était beau il l'est tjs maintenant aussi pour moi (bien sur ça rebutera certains adeptes des jeux actuels avec des niveaux de détails impréssionants chaque époque est respectable de toute façon mais pitié de pas tomber dans le panneaux des comparaisons directes passé et présent...) \n\nLe gameplay est tjs autant prenant et bien foutu, une large palette d'armes bien varié (cette version posséde même une option HD pour profiter des nouveaux design des armes et PNJ inclus) d'ailleurs on les obtiens de maniére progressive dans chaque situation au fils de la progression. \nLe bestiaire est intéréssant bien que opposing forces le surpasse en terme de difficulté et variété mais ça reste quand même un trés beau boulo (ah la la black mesa un vrai paradis sur terre :) les batailles avec les geants mélangé aux autres qui electrifie c'est tjs top)\n\nUne exelente durrée de vie avec une variété d'environements trés bien réalisé, du labo aux dépots en passant par un silo habité puis plus tard par une surface militaire en plein desert débouchant sur un complexe high tech bourré de téléporteur pour terminer ensuite sur un monde extraterrestre extrement froid et tripant (noter que dans blue shift on y retourne pour y exploirer les cavernes et autres environs xeniens c'est assez sympa comme expédition)\nLes 2 bosses finaux ont une aparence physique grotesque (la grosse testicule qui pendoulle et le gros bébé tout diforme ^^) assez délirant ce qui n'empéche pas les combats d'être saisissants pour le coup c'est réussit.\n\nLe scénario est présent sans l'être vraiment, cette présence d'histoire mystérieuse de panne en chaine jusqu'a la catastophe avec un homme étrange qui nous observe en nous evaluant peut être finalement ça ne dévoile quasiment rien (juste une ''petite partie'' celle du périple de gordon) Black mesa est mystérieux mais le G Man lui est bcp plus que ça personne ne le connait est reste tjs un pilier de la saga inexpliqué.\n\nEn fait Half life est surtout un énorme jeu de tir trés poussé avec de l'exploration ce qui est un de ses plus grand atout car ça nous immerge dans une ambiance énormissime. Le gamplay souvent est ponctué par des phases de plateforme plus ou moins difficile et des phases d'actions envoutantes, tout ça avec une aventure en continue (seul quelques trés légés temps de chargement intérompt notre périples (pas de niveaux c'était une premiére à l'époque!)\n\nL'aventure est assez longue et capitvante elle ce boucle de maniére aléatoire celon sont niveau de performance.
