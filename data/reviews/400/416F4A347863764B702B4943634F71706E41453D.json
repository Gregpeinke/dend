El objetivo general del juego es escapar de Aperture Science Labs y descubrir los misterios del mismo, el juego inicia con acertijos muy sencillos pero para el final del juego pueden llegar a ser realmente desafiantes.\n\nAcompañando a esta mecánica de juego la ambientación del juego aporta balance y un entorno apropiado al juego, es importante entender que narrativamente hablando este juego pretende ser una comedia y toca tomarselo como tal, hay muchos huecos argumentales y la historia no se desarrolla particularmente bien, pero los comentarios dentro del juego son buenos, acordes a la tematica del juego y algunos cumplen con su cometido de dar risa, lo cual ayuda a la sensación de comodidad dentro del juego.\n\nEl único aspecto negativo a mi parecer es la duración, aproximadamente 2,5 horas para la campaña, y el uso del Source engine que suele traer consigo unos cuantos bugs aunque ninguno que sea realmente importante o efecte el juego de forma significativa.\n\nEn general le doy a Portal un 9.2/10","timestamp_created":1522115707,"timestamp_updated":1522115707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41074038","author":{"steamid":"76561198092630181","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1313,"last_played":1522113941},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely one of the best games in the world, a simply m u s t h a v e.","timestamp_created":1522113978,"timestamp_updated":1522113978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41073873","author":{"steamid":"76561198067176866","num_games_owned":1282,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1542855617},"language":"english","review":"I only just played this game, now, nearly 11 years after it was released. I remember my classmates in high school talking about this game but I only vaguely understood the mechanics as it was described to me and I thought it was probably over-hyped. I can say now certainly that it lives up to the hype and surpasses it. The puzzles are lovingly designed with painstaking attention to detail. The atmosphere really makes the game, with the subtle, understated story elements of the first portion culminating in one of the most notorious plot twists in video-game lore. The game is short, but thoroughly enjoyable throughout it's entirety. This also sets up the second game to build on the darker thematic elements by leaving so much mystery. \nThis game still holds up strongly 11 years later, with graphics options that are able to be scaled up.

It really isn't until halfway through the game where the puzzles become more complex and really take advantage of the game's central mechanic. Though to be honest, my biggest complaint about this title is the length. If you know what you are doing, you can beat this game in 3 hours or less. Now for $9.99, that's a bit up there. However, what is there is still fun and enjoyable. There are also challenge maps and developer commentary to keep you busy as well. Overall, if you enjoy puzzle platforms with an interesting mechanic, then by all means pick this one up.","timestamp_created":1521919144,"timestamp_updated":1521919144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41024379","author":{"steamid":"76561198148370405","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":279,"last_played":1521974116},"language":"turkish","review":"İnanılmaz güzel bir oyundu beyninizi zorluyor hem puzzle leri hem de oyundaki manyak robotun bilmeceli cümleleri ile gerçekten beyninizi patlatacak cinsten bir oyun arıyorsanız alın indirin","timestamp_created":1521918454,"timestamp_updated":1521918454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41022309","author":{"steamid":"76561198820391030","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1521909147},"language":"tchinese","review":"遊戲好玩，音樂好聽\n非常推薦\n美中不足的地方是中文會擠在一起\n如果能改善就太好了","timestamp_created":1521912598,"timestamp_updated":1521912598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41021742","author":{"steamid":"76561198354516755","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":16867,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14986,"last_played":1578594034},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1521910989,"timestamp_updated":1521910989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41020541","author":{"steamid":"76561198205961908","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":398,"last_played":1522008126},"language":"czech","review":"Logické hry nie su veľmi mojim sústom,čo však neznamená že sa nenájde výnimka.

Here's why:\n\n\n[h1]Story and the Characters[/h1]\n\nOne of the things that i really liked about Portal was its simplistic, yet unique and intriguing story. You get the sense of mysticism throughout the game, and  that \"something isn't right\" feeling doesn't go away either. So you also feel tense when you are going through Shell's assesment.  You also get this \"Half-Life\" vibe aswell, and if you are careful enough you can even see some details that are connecting the two universes. I also really liked the details that were somewhat hidden, such as the radios, Ratman's Dens, and the other easter eggs and references. \n\nCharacters were another important part of Portal.  I really enjoyed the awkard jokes and funny dialogues of GLaDOS throughout the game. As being the leading element, the narrator of the game, she is the most important character of the game in my opinion, and GLaDOS does justice to her role. After GLaDOS, the turrets were my second favorite. The contrast between the lethalness of the turrets and the cuteness of their voice was really amusing. Portal also managed to create an unforgettable character out of an inanimate object: The Companion Cube, which is really unique...\n\n\n[h1]Game Mechanics and the Environment[/h1]\n\nIf you ever listen to the commantaries of the game, you will learn that the developers of Portal created a new collision mechanic and modified their physics engine just for this game, so that the game would convey a more realistic feeling for the users, and to me that is amazing.The recursion and the enter-exit mechanics of the portals were also impressive. \n\nThe game itself, in the sense of level design, is actually a tutorial, with each chamber you learn a new game mechanic, and you get another type of chamber that is oriented for that new game mechanic (such as shooting two portals from the gun, double flinging etc). Almost until the last chamber, the game actually \"secretly\" improves the learning curve of the player. The game mechanics and the levels are so well incorporated into the game, that we don't even realize it, until the final boss fight. \n\n\n[h1]Extras, Soundtrack and the Community[/h1]\n\nI always liked the games having extras, such as Bonus levels, skins, challenges, commentaries etc, that are unlocked by skills and efforts, not just by a credit card. In this sense Portal falls into the first category, which i appreciate greatly.\n\nAnother key aspect is the soundtrack. Portal don't have much songs in the game. The soundtack until the last chamber is subtle, but effective, it creates this unnerving and tense environment that i mentioned before. The credit song \"Still Alive\" is also a really catchy and entertaining piece that will definitely be an unforgettable part of the game for me.\n\n\n\nBecause of all the reasons that i mentioned above, I believe that Portal is a classic game. However that being said, I also would like to mention a couple of problems with the game: the game could have been longer in my opinion, it even feels way shorter if you are playing for the second or the third time, with the knowledge of the game mechanics and the levels. So the replayability value of the game decreases a little bit. \n\nAnother thing that didn't clicked with me was the ending; it wasn't bad at all, but it felt too easy and a little bit repetitive for a final boss. It gave me the impression that the final part was cut. After dealing with many turrets in the previous chapters, which provided the \"action\" part of the game, i was expecting a little bit more...\n\nBut in any case, Portal is definitely a must if you want to play a unique, entertaining and a great game. I would recommend it to everyone... \n\n[h1]PS:[/h1] You could also checkout some mods such as \"Still Alive\" or \"Rexaura\" if you want to play more advanced chambers, i would also recommend them too!","timestamp_created":1521841896,"timestamp_updated":1542981512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40999307","author":{"steamid":"76561198338938233","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":95,"playtime_forever":816,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":816,"last_played":1521411614},"language":"english","review":"i have a mixed review for this game. it has 19 puzzles to solve, the first dozen were challenging and fun. then they got strange for me, in that i never grasped the way the some physical laws of the puzzles worked.  i had to check a walkthrough for hints on some puzzles.\n\nfurthermore, the bouncing and turning of the screen at times actually made me dizzy and queasy to the point i had to stop playing. i never did finish the last two levels, partly due to this.\n\nso it was innovative, clever for the most part, but for my old self, too much hand/eye work was needed to be fast enough to deal with at least some of the puzzles. i'm glad i bought it and enjoyed much of it. but i can't say i was thrilled with some of the puzzles where physics didn't make sense to me.\n\nso i'm recommending it, but i do have the issues mentioned above. i'm giving it 3.5 stars out of 5.","timestamp_created":1521830711,"timestamp_updated":1521830711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40996348","author":{"steamid":"76561198402568562","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1577359181},"language":"russian","review":"Игра отличная.

Вторая часть ещё круче, но проходите по хронологии, иначе весь кайф себе испортите.","timestamp_created":1521808205,"timestamp_updated":1521808205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40991713","author":{"steamid":"76561198071820455","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":146,"last_played":1623039877},"language":"english","review":"The cake is a lie!","timestamp_created":1521804688,"timestamp_updated":1521804688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40991252","author":{"steamid":"76561198291525938","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":3185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1371,"last_played":1649937430},"language":"french","review":"J'attend toujours ma part de gâteau..","timestamp_created":1521802743,"timestamp_updated":1639353762,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60000002384185791","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40990987","author":{"steamid":"76561198034218348","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":209,"last_played":1533120007},"language":"koreana","review":"포탈2를 위한 프롤로그","timestamp_created":1521801584,"timestamp_updated":1521801584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504504501819610596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40989924","author":{"steamid":"76561198420878122","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":87,"last_played":1544691760},"language":"russian","review":"игра крутая!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nособено тортик;) кто не понял пусть пройдёт\nитог:\n \n10 тортов из 10","timestamp_created":1521796806,"timestamp_updated":1521796806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40986373","author":{"steamid":"76561198312184090","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":57,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":57,"last_played":1506656899},"language":"spanish","review":"Wow","timestamp_created":1521775928,"timestamp_updated":1521775928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40985833","author":{"steamid":"76561198061873489","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1593025467},"language":"english","review":"8/10","timestamp_created":1521773133,"timestamp_updated":1521773133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460251063108444214","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40981737","author":{"steamid":"76561198799374814","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":12308,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1035,"last_played":1639887290},"language":"english","review":"Best game of the Decade.","timestamp_created":1521752642,"timestamp_updated":1521752642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558232903480529785","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40980440","author":{"steamid":"76561197998042773","num_games_owned":738,"num_reviews":375,"playtime_forever":290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":290,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"33000 people already reviewed this game.
