Так-же часто вам придется хитрым образом включать и выключать различные кнопки, механизмы и другие интересности. Во всем этом вам будут помогать только портальная пушка и извилины вашего головного мозга! Хоть здесь и есть враги в виде турелей, вам не удосужится воевать с ними огнестрельным оружием в Рембо стиле, напротив, придется действовать гораздо хитрее и осторожней.\n\nГрафика и озвучка вполне достойная, ни скажу что она сверх красивая, но и не ужасная - все в меру приятно. Сам минималистичный дизайн уровней и стилистика игры мне очень по душе.\n\nСюжет довольно прост, игра является как-бы мини предысторией ко второй части. Играем за неизвестную девушку, в неизвестном будущем, в неизвестной лаборатории, выполняя испытания неизвестной \"GLaDOS\". В принципе сценарий можно отодвинуть на второй план, ведь главное здесь это сами испытания, которых опять-же не так много как хотелось бы (в отличие от Portal 2), бонусом есть несколько усложненных карт. Одним словом, все-таки немного прокачать свой интеллект здесь вполне можно и нужно! Я не пожалел потраченного времени и думаю, провел его с пользой.\n\n[h1]Вполне достойная головоломка, любой ценитель логических игр обязан пройти все здешние задачки.\n\nОбщая оценка головоломки: [u]7 из 10[/u].[/h1]","timestamp_created":1434460784,"timestamp_updated":1511684277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529703021049499512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16441159","author":{"steamid":"76561198230918060","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":165,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":165,"last_played":1434454780},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego muy inteligente planteado y ejecutado de forma impecable pero muy muy corto.

It runs off the same Source engine used to this day from 2004.\n\n[b]What makes this game good?[/b]\n\nWell, this game defines how a puzzle game should be, showing that even a first person shooter(?) can be made into a great puzzle game. This game made you feel smart, and even when you didn't get a puzzle at first, you had the 'Aha!' moment once you do and you feel acomplished. \n\nPortal has a somewhat creepy and alone atmosphere throughout the game. There are hidden dens made by Rat-Man who makes schizophrenic drawings and writings in it, the entire labrotory is empty besides you and GLaDOS, you are constantly given pessimestic remarks and comments, and the feeling of waking up in a labrotory with little to no understanding of you signing up for it makes for a very sinister game that you have to experience to get.\n\nChell is a shell ( Get it?) of who you are and how you act. She doesn't talk because you take over her personality and goals. This works effectively, sometimes better than a developed character in a narrative story.\n\nThe game doesn't overstay it's welcome and has plenty replay value after you beat it. The game, while short, tries not to go way too far into territory of stretching a game to the point where it is boring and stale. To compensate, the developers offered ingame challenges and bonus maps to play after you are done, allowing more gameplay to be put into it.\n\nFor speedrunners, this is an extremely fun game to run and act as a way to speedrun other games. The game can be beaten in under 2 hours played regularly, under 1:30 hours with speed, and under 1 hour while speed running.\n\n[b]In Conclusion[/b]\n\nThis game did absolutely nothing wrong, while setting a standard for puzzles, offering unique gameplay, offering replayability, and being an overall fun game to play over.\n\nFor doing all this, this game gets a 10/10\n\nSide Note: I enjoy this game too much.","timestamp_created":1434353170,"timestamp_updated":1515304032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479452043771743774","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16410463","author":{"steamid":"76561198075494164","num_games_owned":552,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":121,"last_played":1434358476},"language":"english","review":"I desided to buy this game during the summer sale, along with the second one.
