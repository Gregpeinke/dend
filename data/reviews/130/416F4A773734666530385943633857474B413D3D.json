This time it only has single-player campaign, there is no multiplayer component. If you want to play some Deathmatch, you should better head toward HL1. It also came with HD models bundled in Retail, and so in Steam version too.\n\nNow, the single player campaign is quite short and doesn't include any kind of new features, whetever weapons or enemeis. And that may dissapoint you when compared to first expansion pack. The reason for it being this way - it wasn't made to be a full expansion pack. Instead, it's origin was to be a bonus content for Dreamcast version of HL1. Shame that it was cancelled when it was almost done. So, not to lose work that been done, Gearbox released it for PC serapately. Another thing you might notice is that it reuses Opposing Force (the first expansion pack) soundtrack\n\nIn this campaign you are Barney Calhoun, the random security guard, who owes Gordon a beer. And unlike every other security guards, he actually passed advanced movement training and can navigate doorways just fine. And stairs. And vents. And shoots many crabs. And he is no hero and his only wish is not to stop alien invasion, but just to get the hell out of here. Ok, he, like a proper hero, has to get the surviving personel out of facility into outside safety.  So, you are back into usual Half-Life busyness, shooting, solving \"puzzles\" and exlporing levels, with fair share of plot conversations with scienists. All while getting to use realistical only weapons (no Gauss Gun fun), with ammo somewhat limited for each one.There is no real climax final boss, the ending seem to be a bunch of strange teasers, so to say. Otherwise it should be pleasent and make sense. I could say, it's the least repetive experience compared to HL1 and OpForce, maybe it just ends before it gets stale.\n\nBut yes, it would have made nice bonus content for Dreamcast, but lacking expansion pack. At least it came packing with HD models and Opposing Force on retail in some regions. Some even say that it contains leftover Dreamcast version codes inside cue some dissapearing corpses. Though, HL1 and OpposingForce on Steam had them as well, strange. Another strange thing is that none the soldiers here ever threw normal grenades at me, they would just place down grenade and run when heavily wounded. And most curiously, it uses soundtrack of Opposing Force... Which doesn't feel right. Cheerful military drumbs beat when the security guard falls to his demise due to two zombies? As looking at the footage of Dreamcast version (it leaked to Internet, yes) it's supposed to use Half-Life soundtrack instead.","timestamp_created":1407526586,"timestamp_updated":1407526586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11603271","author":{"steamid":"76561198121207483","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":945,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1641700463},"language":"thai","review":"Its not as good as half life or opposing force.Freeman was going to have a normal day at work not going to happen.

In Blue Shift übernimmt der Spieler die Rolle von Barney Calhoun,einem Sicherheitsmann der Black Mesa und muss sich nach dem schiefgelaufenem Experiment aus der Anlage retten.\nSpielerisch biete diese Erweiterung leider keine nennenswerten Neuheiten und auch die Spielzeit ist relativ kurz gehalten. Zwar ist der Ablauf der Ereignisse in Black Mesa aus der Sicht mehrerer Beteiligter durchaus interessant, doch leider recht ausgereizt. Ich erinnere mich noch an ein Videospielmagazin(ich glaube es war die Gamestar),die witzelte ob man das nächste Addon dann aus der Sicht der Putzfrau spielen würde. Blue Shift ist nicht direkt schlecht und hat keine großen Macken,es mangelt einfach am Umfang.\nEin Pluspunkt bot damals(2001)lediglich das „High Definition Pack“,welches mit dem Spiel angeboten wurde und einige Texturen verbessert. Allerdings gilt das für die damalige Verkaufsversion. Soweit ich in Erfahrung bringen kann ist dieses Feature mittlerweile optional für die Half Life Spiele verfügbar.\nAlles in allem ist Blue Shift kein Pflichttitel und definitiv der schwächste Teil der Ur-Half Life's.\nWer sich davon nicht abschrecken lässt bekommt zwar kurze,jedoch solide Kost im typischen Half Life Stil geboten.\n\nDie Soldaten in Blue Shift sind in der Deutschen Version abermals zu Robotern geworden und Blut- sowie Splattereffekte wurden entfernt.

Как и другие дополнения от Gearbox, Half-Life: Opposing Force и Half-Life: Decay, Blue Shift изображает события, произошедшие в Half-Life, но c точки зрения другого персонажа: охранника «Чёрной Мезы» — Барни Калхауна. В роли Барни, игрок должен попытаться сбежать из секретной лаборатории, захваченной пришельцами из другого мира и отрядами HECU.\n\nВ отличие от первого дополнения Opposing Force, Half-Life: Blue Shift является автономным аддоном и не требует установленной на компьютере оригинальной версии Half-Life. Во время установки Blue Shift предлагает пользователю установить особый пакет улучшения графики «Half-Life High Definition Pack», включающий в себя обновлённые модели персонажей и оружия. Американский релиз Blue Shift также включает полную версию Opposing Force. Интернациональная версия предлагает только мультиплеерную версию Opposing Force: Capture the Flag.\n\nСторонними разработчиками осуществлялся перенос Blue Shift на движок Source, но он до сих пор не завершён.

It was Game of the Year back then for a reason and to me it will ALWAYS be one of the all-time greats in gaming. \n\nI don't feel that there is a bad extension to Half-Life, the vast multiplayer extensions and Opposing Force, and yes, even Blue Shift are worth their weight in gold. \n\nBlue Shift has received quite a bit of flack from the gaming community and the Half-Life fan base, and I can understand why it's not as popular as Half-Life itself or Opposing Force, but it really isn't deserving of a lot of the criticism it receives. The only real fault with the game is that it is incredibly short, so I don't feel it's worth it's full retail price, best to pick it up for cheap during a sale, but I still think it's a must-have for any Half-Life fan. This small expansion requires you to think before you make an action and to use your ammunition/armour wisely.\n\nIt is questionable as to whether this game is canon to the entire series, some say yes and some say no, but that doesn't really matter, the point is that it is another way to experience Half-Life through a different perspective, that of a Black Mesa Security Guard - Barny Calhoun. \nAs already mentioned, the game is short, VERY short, so you won't be playing for long, but it is still fun. There are no new weapons or enemies, I'm afraid, but if you have ever played Decay, this is a great storyline to experience as it goes along with that story extremely well (again, Valve proves their story-telling genius).\n\nI don't really have much else to say, so to sum it up in a few words: This game is, in my opinion, worth getting despite the flack it has received, but not at it's full retail price (unless you're loaded). You can not have Half-Life without Opposing Force and Blue Shift. Just remember - It's short and you won't be in-game for long, so don't be disappointed when you reach the end much sooner than you may think.","timestamp_created":1403253833,"timestamp_updated":1403253833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554140150547027588","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10520873","author":{"steamid":"76561198119008441","num_games_owned":235,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":193,"last_played":1390693337},"language":"spanish","review":"Half Life: Blue Shift es la segunda expansión del aclamado juego ''Half Life''. La expansión te pone en la piel del agente de seguridad Barney Calhoun, quien intentara desesperadamente escapar de las instalaciones de Black Mesa intentado ayudar a todo aquél que pueda. La premisa es completamente lo contrario que lo planteado en ''Half Life: Opposing Force''. El juego nos plantea un punto de vista diferente del accidente de Black Mesa poniéndonos en un lado neutral en la historia en vez de ser el héroe o el villano. Es una buena expansión, bastante divertida que da nuevos detalles de la historia sin profundizar en esta. El juego tiene menos variedad de armas que ''Half Life: Opposing Force'', pero esto más allá de ser malo a mi parecer te hace sentir más como un agente de seguridad que va más desprotegido que un soldado. Aún y así a nivel jugable se podría decir que es una pega. Otro punto negativo tiene es lo corto que es, más que la anterior expansión. Aparte no sé porque motivo no deja poner el juego en español cuando según me he informado si que existe una traducción al español. \n\nEn resumen, una divertida expansión que da más de lo mismo pero que consigue enganchar una vez más.","timestamp_created":1403142673,"timestamp_updated":1403685637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.635368406772613525","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10499155","author":{"steamid":"76561197986496984","num_games_owned":887,"num_reviews":179,"playtime_forever":223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1402197521},"language":"czech","review":"[i]„Hodně beden, málo zábavy.“[/i]\n\nJedná se o druhý datadisk ke hře [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/70/]Half-Life[/url]. Vaše jméno je Barney Calhoun, a pracujete jako člen ochranky, ve výzkumném komplexu Black Mesa. Po příjezdu do práce zjišťujete, že se vaši kolegové již potýkají s drobnými poruchami. Nezdá se ale, že by se mělo jednat o něco závažného, prostě jen náhodná souhra okolností. Následující události, vás ale brzy vyvedou z omylu...\n\nBlue Shift původně neměl na počítače vůbec vyjít. Byl vytvořen jako exkluzivní bonus pro hráče, kteří si zakoupí Half-Life pro konzoli Dreamcast. Z toho nakonec sešlo, a tak bylo rozhodnuto, že tento bonus bude vydán jako datadisk. Že se nejedná o plnohodnotné rozšíření, je na této hře ovšem velice znát.\n\nNejenže tento datadisk nepřináší nic nového, on dokonce obsahuje jen část z toho, co jste mohli najít už v původní hře. Dočkáte se tak pouze klasických zbraní, takže na ty mimozemské můžete zapomenout. Vyřazeni byli také někteří nepřátelé, a na jejich místo, žádní noví nepřišli.\n\nNejvětší slabinou tohoto přídavku, jsou ale špatně navržené lokace. Velká část hry se odehrává v dlouhých chodbách a tunelech, které nic zajímavého nenabízejí. Tedy pokud nemáte zálibu v rozbíjení beden, protože těch je všude plno.\n\nNepovedeným dojmem působí také prostornější místa, na kterých se odehrává většina přestřelek s vojáky. Jejich chování je vynikající, pokud se bojuje v členitém prostoru, toho se jim zde ale nedostává. Často se tak opakovala situace, kdy se voják rozhodl přemístit, ale jediné vhodné místo, bylo několik desítek metrů za ním. Otočil se proto zády ke mně, a dal se na zběsilý úprk. Z přestřelek se tak pravidelně stával nudný hon na zajíce.\n\nTento datadisk proto můžu doporučit jen těm, kteří musejí vědět, co Barney prožíval v komplexu Black Mesa.
