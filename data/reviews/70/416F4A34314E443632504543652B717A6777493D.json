Mais honnêtement, je suis déçu, on ma vendu ce jeu comme une légende, et honnêtement, je comprends. Pour l'époque les graphismes et le gameplay de Half-life devait être incroyables. Mais ça à très mal vieilli. \nPourquoi n'ai-je ni fini ni aimé Half-life ? Le personnage est une savonette malgré le fait que le jeu va a de nombreuses reprises vous demander de faire des sauts précis, monter les échelles est fastidieux au possible car il faut se souvenir que la barre espace ne sert a rien quand sur une échelle a part si vous voulez vite revenir au dernier checkpoint et pour finir ce jeu est tellement un labyrinthe que vous allez passez plus de temps a essayez de comprendre ou vous êtes qu'a essayé de tuer des aliens.\nMême après tout cela il reste un seul et unique problème. même après avoir cherché pendant plus de la moitié de mon temps de jeu je n'ai jamais trouvé la sortie de l'endroit dans lequel je me suis retrouvé, pas de sortie pas de retour en arrière niet ! Et dès que vous essayez de trouver quoi que ce soit sur internet, a propos de cela, on voit clairement que tout le monde prend un autre chemin, qui était bloqué durant ma partie, et que jamais il ne voit l'endroit dans lequel je me suis terrer. \nPour finir je dirais que l'arme symbolique de ce jeu, le pied de biche, ne sert a rien car il n'a aucune porté, ne fait pas tant de dégâts que ça et que les monstres vous tatanent quand vous essayez de les exterminer à grands coups d'arme contondante. De plus, les pnj meurent plus souvent que les monstres.","timestamp_created":1588027653,"timestamp_updated":1588027653,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.401459872722625732","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68142913","author":{"steamid":"76561198877335505","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":66,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":66,"last_played":1585096917},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games ever created.

Некое очарование конечно в этом было - огромные уровни с телепортами, двигающимися стенами, секретиками и разноцветными ключами. Увлекало, жаль правда что разработчик слабо контролировал действия игрока и вся повествовательная часть зачастую заключалась в экране текста между уровнями или коротенькой катсценкой. И попытки что то поменять в основном были вялые и не особо успешные.\n\nНо всё изменилось когда  ̶н̶а̶р̶о̶д̶ ̶о̶г̶н̶я̶ ̶н̶а̶ч̶а̶л̶ ̶в̶о̶й̶н̶у̶ вышла первая Халфа. Вместо лабиринта разработчики поместили игрока в огромную кишку, однако вовсе не из-за лени, а с вполне определённым умыслом. Теперь контроля над игроком и получаемым им опытом стало больше. А значит появилась возможность проводить его через более интересные, заранее срежиссированные ситуации и даже показывать ему сюжет непосредственно в геймплее - через детали окружения и кратковременные встречи с НПС. Всё это делало игрока активным участником событий и способствовало вовлечению в пускай и простенькую историю про очередной неудачный эксперимент и вторжение инопланетных сущностей. \n\nПервая Халфа несомненно важная часть истории шутеров от первого лица. Играть в неё интересно даже и сейчас, при условии что текстурки 98 года не пугают.
