Eu bato no peito e assumo que por mais que tenha demorado, completei o game sem olhar a solução dos puzzles na internet. Não foi fácil, tem hora que até cansa.\n\nO jogo possui um criador de mapa para os players compartilharem seus desafios com a comunidade.\n\nAgora o game possui um modo multiplayer, com dois novos personagens, com desafios que só podem ser resolvidos com trabalho em equipe. É possível jogar sem microfone, mas a experiência fica muito melhor com comunicação verbal entre os amigos.\n\nOs gráficos são muito bonitos, com serrilhados imperceptíveis, 60 FPS cravado sem drops, texturas bem feitas, efeitos de luz e partículas muito bons e muitos objetos sendo renderizados simultaneamente. Lembrando que é um jogo de 2011.\n\nA trilha sonora é expetacular. As vozes são muito fodas, de todos os personagens, as músicas e efeitos sonoros muito bem cronometrados, muito bem feitos.\n\nA ambientação é simplesmente fantástica. Tem cenas tão fodas que o jogo te faz sentir minúsculo na cena. \nHá animações sincronizadas de objetos pelo cenário, é tudo fantástico. Simplesmente fantástico.\n\nA animação de todos os robôs também é muito suave e muito bem feita.\n\nA jogabilidade é excelente. Pouquissímos botões. Tudo muito preciso, muito suave.\n\nA física é fantástica e dependemos dela para os puzzles. A física de todos os games da Valve dispensa comentários.\n\nNovamente, o enredo do jogo é fantástico e, talvez por isso, assim como na saga Half Life, a Valve tenha medo de anunciar um terceiro game para a saga, com medo de estragar o enredo dos games.\n\nHá vários secrets que desbloqueiam achievments, assim como Easter Eggs pelo game.\n\nUm detalhe que acaba se destacando pelo jogo é o sarcasmo de alguns personagens. Esse \"detalhe\" gera boas risadas.\n\nO jogo é fantástico, fica baratinho comprar em promoção, Portal e Portal 2 juntos, um pacote com duas cópias de Portal 2 para enviar uma para algum amigo.

Очень порадовало то, что Valve делает действительно необычные, с изюминкой, но не менее интересные и увлекательные игры.

И говорю я по большей части про AAA-проекты, которые могут привлечь своей графикой, кое-каким интересным геймплеем, но хватает таких игр на несколько часов, потом бросаешь в нежелании больше в такое играть.
