It's also probably one of the most fun games you can buy for the price. \n.....And it is, without a doubt, one of the best supported games ever released. The games is 5 years old, and they released new content several times a year every year up until the release of Killing Floor 2! \n.....The new content included new maps, custom weapons, and seasonal zeds. Fully developed content that was complete and stood on it's own. \n\n\n.....Basic gameplay:\nChoose a class, a difficulty level, and a map.\nSpawn into the map with up to five other players. \nKill zeds to earn cash and survive to the end of each round for bonus cash.\nUse the cash between rounds to buy ammo, armor, and better weapons for the next round.\nSurvive all of the rounds to face the partriarch. \nKill the patriarch and you've won.\nRinse and repeat.\n\n\n.....Details:\n\n.....Each class has inherent bonuses when using weapons designed for their class. But everyone can use all weapons, if they can afford them. \n\n.....Getting kills or killing specific zeds with a certain weapon levels your class. Each class has levels that grant significant bonuses to their roles. Increased ammo capacity, faster reloads, etc.\n\n.....You don't have to be using a certain class to level it. If you chose beserker but find yourself using a commandos weapon, you're still leveling your commando rank. You won't be able to take advantage of the commando bonuses that you've earned until you select the commando class. But this mechanic means that every kill you make is helping to advance your character. Even if you aren't using that specific class at that particular moment.\n\n.....You can change your class and weapon loadout after each round based on your teams needs or the zed type you will be facing the next round.\n\n.....Lots of maps and reasonable achievments give the game lots of replayability. \n\n\n.....The negative:\n\n.....It does take quite a while to achieve the highest levels for each class. However, it is very rewarding when you do. And you do not have to grind to achieve them. You simply play.\n\n.....The most diffucult levels, suicidal and hell on earth become monotonous. They are so difficult that your team must select certain classes, follow a certain plan, and act as a cohesive unit to survive. They take a long time to complete, so failing late in a game can be very tiresome.\n\n.....A very few of the achievments either require a significant effort from the entire team or sheer luck to complete. So if your teammates already have them it may be diffcult to get them.","timestamp_created":1309926622,"timestamp_updated":1428475907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2489619","author":{"steamid":"76561198008158447","num_games_owned":526,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":6610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6297,"last_played":1405563393},"language":"english","review":"Addictive game.
