It's pretentious, convoluted, and stupid; with worse gameplay than its predecessor. Gone are the RPG-lite elements from the original games, 'Plasmids' are replaced with generic feeling, off-brand, 'Vigors' (that you can't combine with gunplay like in BS2), you are limited to only two weapons at any one time, upgrades aren't visual anymore, enemies are mostly random cops or generic, red-clad, anarchists, and the setting is even more unbelivable than Rapture. \n\nScroll down the game page to see why people think they like this game: Elizabeth. This bland cartoon character that everyone seems to want to shag is simply insufferable, and she's with you 95% of the time... I swear the developers thought that is she just looked like a sexy Disney princess players would ignore how terrible of a character she is.\n\nElizabeth is part of the larger problem in Bioshock Infinite: the story. Gone is the fairly streamlined storytelling of the original, it's memorable characters, and interesting twists. Here, we have this convoluted multi-verse Inception thing that ends up feeling pretentious and dumb. The game wants to be this heady piece of fiction, maybe along the lines of Primer or something, but lands so far from the mark it's kind of embarrassing. \n\nP.S - I hate the Lettuce twins.","timestamp_created":1641447316,"timestamp_updated":1641447316,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.465048432350158691","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107427744","author":{"steamid":"76561198079455735","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":569,"last_played":1621445614},"language":"english","review":"A masterpiece of a game and a story. One of my all-time favorites, no hesitation. It was honestly bittersweet when I finished the story, bitter because it ended, sweet because I couldn't think of any other beautiful way to execute this masterpiece. Play this on your own or with someone else blindly because I don't have enough words to describe how beautiful it is.\n\nThe story was just an absolute beautiful mind-♥♥♥♥. I won't spoil the story for you, however I will say that the story isn't exactly written how some people prefer their stories to be written out. To help with that, I give this no story-spoiling advice which is [spoiler]pay attention to details, even if it seems like just little talk, otherwise you might end up feeling a little lost and confused. You may have to do some puzzles in your head to understand the story because the game leaves you to figure some things out.[/spoiler] If you're playing this for your first time, take in everything and enjoy it while it lasts. Not saying that there's no replay-ability, but the \"big swing\" is going to be the first time you play it. I wish I could blindly play it all over again.\n\nThe gameplay had unique elements to it that I enjoyed. As someone who's played plenty of FPS games before, learning how to play was a breeze, even with the extra fun mechanics added into the mix. The extra mechanics contributed to the art, its uniqueness, the magic, and tried to make it stand out from other FPS games. I won't spoil what those mechanics are, but they were fun and added extra flavor to the gameplay.\n\nI recommend this game 10000000%, no hesitation; it will always be one of my all-time favorites. I wish I could blindly replay this game all over again. I LOVE IT. Thank you so much for this masterpiece, Irrational Games and 2K, and thank you for checking out my review!

The game went through three different versions . one was the 2010 demo which was more horror related and felt more like bioshock. and the 2010 one still kind of had a horror vibe and showed off a ton of cool features that were cut that fundmentally made infinte a different game. the two different factions the vox and founders were going to be a bigger part of the plot then they were both suppost to equally as bad but thats not  really show in the game and neither is the on going conflict. there was suppose to be moral choice mechincs in the game and choices whether to remain out of combat or not. songbird was suppose a mini boss like the big daddy in bioshock 1 .  Bioshock infinites heavy hitter like the boys of silence were supposed to function differently and be heavy featured in the game. The game was also suppose more of a semi open world like bioshock 1 with rapture but feels like corridor shooter. slight spoiler head. the twist ending just feels like in was tacted on just to have one as it makes no sense and is filled with plot holes and whats more insulting is that you kind of have to get the dlc to explain the ending and even that is filled with plot holes and doesn't do a good job. I feel that this game was an attempt to make bioshock appeal to casuals as the box art and the combat actually shows.  a lot of people say cyberpunk 2077 was falsely advertized but cyberpunk I wasn't as disppointed with besides the buggy mess. This game was falsey adveritsed  because it was shown off way too early  as its a complety different game than was originally pitched on shown of.  I ultimately think some of the choices made to cut certain features was done not because of techincal limitations but to appeal to the casual shooter fan and that is a shame. again false adveritsing I don't think they did on purpose but it was a mistake to show off the game  when most of the stuff got cut.  The good the game looks graphicly amazing and the skylines are a fun addition and combat fun when using the powers and skylines. I still reccomend the game as it is fun but just not as good  as it could have been or show off. songbird unfortuntally is little more than a cutscene and and end of the game mechinic rather than a proper threat or boss that was promised.","timestamp_created":1641438927,"timestamp_updated":1641438927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107417724","author":{"steamid":"76561198070289001","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":556,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":556,"last_played":1641430076},"language":"schinese","review":"缺点-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n9小时通关，流程略短。\n汉化不是很完全，玩的繁中版本，基本只有UI是中文，对话没有字幕。\n游戏到后期怪血量都挺可观的\n\n优点-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n作为07年的游戏，画面十分出色，且不吃硬件性能\n剧情大家都在夸，真有这么牛逼么？是的，就是这么牛。\n\n分割线---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n至于喜不喜欢伊丽莎白，这就看个人了。人物建模不是很对口。\n总的来说，这九小时是段很独特的体验，推荐。\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1641432779,"timestamp_updated":1641432779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107415073","author":{"steamid":"76561198898427335","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1201,"last_played":1641429432},"language":"russian","review":"Очень сложно находить игры которые влияют на меня также сильно как повлияла BioShock Infinite.\n\nЯ не собираюсь писать спойлеры и хочу сказать, что это было блестящее завершение революции трилогии, и что эпизоды \"Погребение в море\" Первый и второй следует считать абсолютно обязательными, если вы хотите правильно играть в эту игру.\n\nЭта игра была одной из немногих игр, которые не раз доводили меня до слез.

Il punto è che definire Bioshock Infinite uno sparatutto sarebbe riduttivo, quasi sbagliato. Un videogame dove coinvolgimento sensoriale, emotivo e narrativo fanno veramente la differenza. Columbia è completamente diversa da Rapture - è uno spaccato delle contraddizioni della società americana dei primi ‘900. E’ un’esperienza di grande impatto, capace di sviluppare in ognuno di noi una forte empatia verso i protagonisti, e di farci gioire e soffrire con loro in ogni istante. E’ una delle massime espressioni artistiche in ambito videoludico, dove sapere e libertà espressiva si uniscono formando un mosaico che non può lasciare indifferenti. Bioshock Infinite è un gioco perfetto, con pochissimi difetti, ma che non si può non amare. Perché Bioshock Infinite è una di quelle produzioni che lasciano un segno nell’industria videoludica e nel giocatore, venendo ricordate a lungo.\n\nVoto: 9,5/10","timestamp_created":1641259386,"timestamp_updated":1641259386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107265512","author":{"steamid":"76561198416821366","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":639,"last_played":1641257843},"language":"schinese","review":"什么时候才能带她去巴黎","timestamp_created":1641258058,"timestamp_updated":1641258058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107265448","author":{"steamid":"76561198054353792","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1622,"last_played":1642106089},"language":"english","review":"Re-played years later, still stands up as a great game and story.","timestamp_created":1641257972,"timestamp_updated":1641257972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107260208","author":{"steamid":"76561199160155902","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1643938434},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo bão compra\n","timestamp_created":1641252200,"timestamp_updated":1641252200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107256777","author":{"steamid":"76561199131962140","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1641287778},"language":"russian","review":"Топчик!!!","timestamp_created":1641248777,"timestamp_updated":1641248777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107255021","author":{"steamid":"76561198219222627","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":871,"last_played":1637549778},"language":"english","review":"Does the game meet its potential?
