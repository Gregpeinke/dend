Well, in Half-Life 2: Episode Two, now you can...Well, sort of. Being the best of the Half-Life 2 Trilogy (At least in my opinion), Half-Life 2: Episode Two offers the best scenery a game can offer. It is also just the right length, not to long or to short! And most of the achievements are fairly easy to get...Only a few of them are challenging enough to be...Well, challenging! Read on for the full details...\n\n\nGameplay-Fairly smooth and straightforward it is. Non-Linear it is not. However, you do have the ablilty to explore the wilderness areas you encounter. But be prepared for comments and complaints from your female companion...XD! On slower systems, there may be some troubling aspects of the game, so be careful. Gameplay Score-8 out of 10.\n\nItems-The items found in the game are generally simple by nature. In fact, as is the case with all games in the Half-Life series, the variety of items is few and far between. All items are beneficial in some way or another, however, so don't be afraid to pick them up. Items Score-6 out of 10.\n\nWeapons-Plenty of interesting weapons to pick-up here, but again, there isn't lots in the variety category. However, most weapons have a primary and secondary firing modes, and some of them have rather interesting effects when one or both of these modes are used. Weapons Score-7 out of 10.\n\nAmmo-The overall quality of the ammo is very good. However, the quantity of ammo doesn't always guarantee victory or even survival. Use it sparingly. Ammo Score-6 out of 10.\n\nArmor-Yes, you do have armor in the game, however, instead of more than one kind, you have the ability to 'power up' your armor using charging stations. However, these and batteries are somewhat uncommon, so try to avoid getting struck to many times. Armor Score-5 out of 10.\n\nPlot-The overall quality and depth of the story behind the game here isn't bad, but it's not great either. It starts off pretty well, though. In fact, without spoiling to many details, it's been an ongoing cliffhanger for nearly 10 years running. This doesn't bode well for the future of the series...If it even has one. Plot Score-6 out of 10.\n\nCharacters-Most of the characters are likable and have good personalities, although some of them are just plain annoying or silly. This doesn't make them necessarily bad. It simply means they're not vital to the plot in any way, shape, or form. They're just 'simply out there'. Characters Score-7 out of 10.\n\nSound-The overall quality of the sound is most agreeable. However, please note any details on it can't be given here without a spoiler or two. Sound Score-7 out of 10.\n\nMusic-Unlike the sound, it's not always desirable to listen to the music in the background. It may prove more distracting than beneficial. Music Score-4 out of 10.\n\nGraphics-The overall quality of the graphics are surprisingly nice, even on slower systems! However, don't count on seeing anything stellar, such as is the case with games which were introduced later or even by different companies around the same time. Still though, the trees are nice to gaze upon and screenshot. Graphics Score-9 out of 10.\n\nFinal Score-This is a surprisingly nice game to play, just based on the above aspects I listed above. And speaking of which, did I mention taking a hike on this game is pretty much possible? It's true! All you have to do is walk through the tunnel after getting the boring yellow car. From there, take a hike through the pristine Paiute Mountains Wilderness of Colorado until you're ambushed at a barn. From there, drive until you don't have to do so anymore. After this, you can pretty much hike your way to the end of the game. Now this is what I call hiking awesomeness!","timestamp_created":1406743564,"timestamp_updated":1514578272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11469169","author":{"steamid":"76561198040891194","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":92,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":92,"last_played":1320912000},"language":"english","review":"Has got to be one of the most heartbreaking cliffhangers in video game history, with no continuation/conclusion to the story...","timestamp_created":1406668742,"timestamp_updated":1406668742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11463306","author":{"steamid":"76561198121414530","num_games_owned":655,"num_reviews":89,"playtime_forever":576,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":246,"last_played":1606207178},"language":"koreana","review":"흠... 에피소드1보다 재밌게 했다. 스토리가 짧긴 하지만...\n스토리를 대략 정리하면\n하프라이프2:17번지구에서 혁명\n에피소드1:시타델 코어로 인해 17번 지구를 탈출\n에피소드2:폭발로인해 생긴 거대한 포탈을 닫기위해 로켓발사\n다음 에피소드(아마):보리알리스호라는 배를 파괴하기위해 이동","timestamp_created":1406638910,"timestamp_updated":1406638910,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503627359867095947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11459170","author":{"steamid":"76561197974472255","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":945,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":945,"last_played":1406607215},"language":"english","review":"Great final chapter in hl2 but we all want more!","timestamp_created":1406607974,"timestamp_updated":1513911361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11457409","author":{"steamid":"76561198110098428","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":350,"last_played":1405956933},"language":"english","review":"I love this game but I can't recommend anyone getting it.
