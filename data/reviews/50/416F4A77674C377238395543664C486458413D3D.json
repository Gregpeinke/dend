Opposing Force is the standout Half-Life expansion with its bevy of original content. New weapons, enemies, and a new squadmate mechanic make this game a very different experience from the first one. How well it matches up to the original's quality is questionable however. Opposing Force is a decidedly quicker experience, forgoing the long introduction and introducing new weapons at a much faster pace. Many of these new weapons, such as the Shock Roach and Desert Eagle, are fun to try out and find the very different niches for them. Because Half-Life was influenced by Quake, Opposing Force adds its own spin on Quake's CTF Flail. \nWhere Opposing Force falls flat is in the squadmate mechanic, where you can command multiple soldiers to serve with you. Due to the narrow corridor-based aspect of the level design however, they'll be getting in your way more often than not. Fun story, if less interesting and nuanced than that of the first game.\nThe rope physics are adorably bad.\nIf you have to choose get this over Blue Shift.","timestamp_created":1473633868,"timestamp_updated":1499153338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55928647518157959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25449118","author":{"steamid":"76561197985409325","num_games_owned":944,"num_reviews":285,"playtime_forever":306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":305,"last_played":1579174695},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life: Opposing Force is an expansion pack made by Gearbox.

Pour sauver qui ? Gordon Freeman ! On peut d'ailleurs l'aperçevoir à un moment du jeu, quand il se téléporte vers la planète Xen.\nLe gameplay, par rapport au 1, ne change pas, ou peu. Il y a l'ajout de plusieurs armes, dont le sniper !\nAu niveau de l'histoire, comme d'hab', c'est assez obscure, on apprends pas grand chose de nouveau.\nAu niveau du déroulement des niveaux, on est moins dans le puzzle, et surtout dans la baston. On passe moins de temps à se creuser la cervelle pour savoir où passer. Certains aimeront, d'autres moins.\nOn a un boss final bien sympa comparé à HL1, car plus compliqué à tuer (mais tout aussi dégueulasse :D)\n\nLe seul aspect négatif qui apparait à mes yeux reste la durée de vie, 5-6h, ce qui est vraiment court, même pour une extension.\n\nBref, c'est un must-have si on veut poursuivre et rallonger notre temps dans l'univers de HL.

At many points in the game, the music cuts off. You're trying to do an epic battle, all while it's just gunfire around you. You can't throw the realism card down, mainly because this game is unrealistic as all get out.\n\nAnother problem is honestly the enemies, although, this is probably from the fact that I suck at most FPS games. The Race X aliens are extremely strong, and they make this the hardest of the Half Life games to beat.\n\nAlso, Boot Camp for some reason will not allow me to pass it. I get to the sniper section, and I hit the targets, yet they don't go down.\n\nWhy do I reccomend this game? Because essentially, it's probably the most story fueled one of the Half Life games, and yet it gets so little attention. It's a good game, and Gearbox did well with it.

Naszym zadaniem jest opanowanie sytuacji: Zaczynając na wyeliminowaniu stworów, a kończąc na uciszaniu (śmiertelnym) wszelkich naukowców, z biegiem czasu zaczynamy pościg za głównym bohaterem serii Gordonie Freemanie, by mierzyć się z coraz trudniejszymi wrogami.\n\nRozgrywka:\nTo po prostu Half-Life, więc formuła rozgrywki nie uległa znaczącym zmianom w stosunku do podstawowej wersji gry: Od czasu do czasu strzelamy, by zająć się spokojniejszymi rzeczami. takimi jak różnorakie łamigłówki czy współpraca z postaciami niezależnymi. Jeśli chodzi o ten aspekt względem podstawki z oczywistych względów możemy stanąć do walki ramię w ramię z innymi żołnierzami. Nie zmienia to jednak faktu, że przez większość gry jesteśmy samotni. Gra oferuje także szeroki zbiór przeciwników takich jak całkowicie nową „Rasę X”, której przedstawiciele często wdają się w walkę z Obcymi ze świata Xen. Napotykamy również ludzkich przeciwników w postaci zamaskowanych komandosów, którzy w obliczu porażki oddziałów wojskowych przybyli do Black Mesa w celu zniszczenia całego kompleksu, aby wyeliminować zagrożenie ze strony Obcych.\n\nMocne strony gry:\nPlusem jest rzucone nowe światło na historię z podstawki oraz możliwość pokierowania postacią po drugiej stronie barykady. Jeśli chodzi o samą resztę to wszystko jest na podobnym poziomie zaczynając od strzelania a kończąc na zagadkach. Wszystkie te mechaniki są przyjemne przez co mamy te same doznania, które mieliśmy grając w oryginał. Dodatek ten pełen jest świetnych scen popychających nas naprzód, a sam klimat także robi robotę. Odgłosy zniszczonych korytarzy w których głębi grasuje coś o czym nie wiemy robi klimat niczym z horroru mimo, że gra ta grafiką już nie grzeszy. \n\nSłabe strony gry: \nMimo że dodatek sam w sobie świetny to jest jednak strasznie krótki. Jeśli chodzi o inne minusy to można podać np. lekką schematyczność poziomów, sztuczną inteligencję i niewiele nowości.\n\nWerdykt:\nTen dodatek ma w sobie to co miał Half-Life. Przyjemną historię, dobry klimat i rozgrywkę, czy trzeba coś więcej dodawać?","timestamp_created":1470943774,"timestamp_updated":1606406683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598917722702026367","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24827323","author":{"steamid":"76561198059414192","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":669,"last_played":1409092818},"language":"hungarian","review":"Great.","timestamp_created":1470927644,"timestamp_updated":1569506606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24826835","author":{"steamid":"76561198043634213","num_games_owned":2354,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":362,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":362,"last_played":1470719625},"language":"russian","review":"Самая неоднозначная история, как по мне.

It includes new weapons and enemies and allows you to see the events of Half-Life 1 from a different perspective; meaning that you get different allies and enemies compared to the other Half-Life games. \n\nIt also has unique events that occur that make the game more interesting and not seem to short, such as adding new, larger enemies and in some cases bosses, all of which weren't seen in any other Half-Life games which makes this one more original. \n\nIn conclusion, I would recommend this game if you have already played the other games in the Half-Life 1 Anthology as it's graphics aren’t brilliant and the controls are quite difficult, which can take some time to get used to, and it's story wouldn't really make that much sense if you started with this one.","timestamp_created":1469274408,"timestamp_updated":1503990754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486472427845001221","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24474369","author":{"steamid":"76561198100814766","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":274,"last_played":1469257979},"language":"russian","review":"Нормас, отличное дополнение к хл","timestamp_created":1469258129,"timestamp_updated":1469258129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24466827","author":{"steamid":"76561198062889597","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":468,"last_played":1460298891},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая... мать его... игра... серии!","timestamp_created":1469220922,"timestamp_updated":1469220922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24461190","author":{"steamid":"76561198089944771","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":348,"last_played":1467302683},"language":"english","review":"This is one of the finest FPS games I've ever played. While Blue Shift was decent at best, this game is downright excellent. It feels right at home for a Half-Life game and is not alienated in any way, shape or form. It has amazing attention to detail and references to the original game feel very natural rather than being forced in to remind you that it's a Half-Life game. The puzzles in the game are challenging enough to be fun, but not on a level like Portal where it makes it the whole focus of the game. I was able to enjoy the new characters just as I did in the original, but there are two flaws with this game. Sometimes absurdley powerful enemys cake the map like an 11 year old's Mario Maker level. The other flaw is that it lacks music in some intense scenes making them a little underwhelming. Nonetheless, it's definetly worth the play.","timestamp_created":1469200958,"timestamp_updated":1469200958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54314720630645752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24459507","author":{"steamid":"76561198107660883","num_games_owned":358,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":288,"last_played":1468422099},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life: Opposing Force - обычная игра, пытающаяся выехать на популярности оригинала.

What I like about this game is how different it is as it puts you into the perspective of a US marine which  gives you a whole new side of the story that wasn't introduced in Half-Life or Blue Shift such as how they had no previous knowledge about how they were going to be ordered to kill all the scientists in the Black Mesa research facility and for the most part many soldiers disagree with this and retaliate against their instructors and try to make it out of this whole dilemma alive. Throughout the game you will encounter various scenarios and events in the game that you will recognize as events that took place in the original HL but showing how it impacted the marines. Another thing that makes this game different is the various weapons and enemies that are exclusive to this particular game which makes this game feel fresh and makes it have a different feel to it in comparison to the other Half-Life games.

It's interesting to play as a member of the HECU, and to see the Black Mesa Incident from his perspective. There's different abilities, such as climbing/swinging on ropes, and you get night vision instead of a flashlight. Some different weapons are available, such as a pipe wrench, a knife, a Desert Eagle, and a sniper rifle. One thing that I really liked is the fact that you can lead other Marines into combat, and make use of their abilities, like an engineer's ability to cut through locked doors, or the medic's ability to function like a mobile health station that never runs out.
