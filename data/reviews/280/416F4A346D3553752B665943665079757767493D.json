Resident Evil 2002. The Crash N. Sane Trilogy. There's a lot more, but to summarize, Half-Life: Source is NOT on that list. In fact, quality of the \"remaster\" aside, it's barely even that. It's a half-baked port of Half-Life with only two major intentional changes - the lighting and skyboxes - and several glitches and bugs that severely break the game. The physics puzzles in this game no longer function as intended due to the use of Half-Life 2's engine over the original source engine, and glitches at several points in the game can often soft lock, or in my personal experience, even HARD lock your save file. Enemies are now egregiously difficult to fight; difficulty is never bad, but keep in mind the original Half-Life was already fairly difficult on the normal setting. In Half-Life: Source, that difficulty is spiked to BS levels of difficult. Enemies mowing you down from 100% health in mere seconds difficult. The only benefit this game presents is the fact that the skyboxes are no longer blurry jpegs. But compared to every other gaping flaw in this \"remaster,\" it doesn't stack up. Play the original Half-Life instead, or, if you want a REAL remaster, Black Mesa (I personally recommend both, to be frank).","timestamp_created":1611624068,"timestamp_updated":1611624068,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538324952125549316","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85349534","author":{"steamid":"76561198350205118","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":413,"last_played":1633223162},"language":"english","review":"S T A P H","timestamp_created":1611612002,"timestamp_updated":1611612002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85347777","author":{"steamid":"76561198871919282","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1589594157},"language":"spanish","review":"Es completamente igual al Half Life 1 pero solo con pequeñas remodelaciones en el apartado gráfico que ni es notable.\nDebieron perfeccionar mejor el motor gráfico para este Half Life como por ejemplo del Half Life 2. \nBuen juego, no tengo queja sobre eso, pero aparte que el remodel es otra obra barata del original. \n\nRecordemos que el Source cuando salió el juego estaba en desarrollo por lo que sus avances son muy básicos\n\nMejoras en el agua y uno que otro sombreado se da pero el problema también son el aumento de bugs por el cambio.\n\nRECOMENDADO SI es tú primera vez comprando un producto de Half Life ya que mejora unas pequeñas cosillas y una que otra nueva animación.

If you've played half life before it's kind of a fun gimmick to have ragdoll physics and everything, and it's nice to be able to mount this to Gmod and SFM (we wouldn't have Half Life VR But The AI Is Self Aware without this!). If you want to experience Half Life, just get the original, and if you want a more modern/updated version of Half Life, get Black Mesa.","timestamp_created":1610518679,"timestamp_updated":1610518679,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514285683631896973","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84589834","author":{"steamid":"76561198353101646","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":185,"last_played":1628589779},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1610509463,"timestamp_updated":1610509463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84578240","author":{"steamid":"76561198982879885","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":943,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":943,"last_played":1610490838},"language":"spanish","review":"Un excelente juego que a pesar de los años que tiene todavía nos enseña que era un juego un tanto adelantado en su época.

This version has some problems and bugs that will kind of ruin the intended Half-Life experience. Sure, there are some aspects of the game that are better than the original Half-Life, such as lighting, ragdolls, better skyboxes, etc.\n\nHowever along with these features also come particular bugs. There are parts in the game that breaks your experience visually, some AI responses are broken, music cuts out once a new map loads, and there are times when the new textures just don't really help at all, and make the experience worse.\n\nTL;DR, there is not much difference in this version of Half-Life despite being called a remaster, and along a few better features come bad glitches and bugs as well.\n\nIf you have already played the original Half-Life 1 and would like a re-experience with little to no difference from the original, then this Source edition is for you.
