Unlike other games, Killing Floor heavily reinforces teamwork, communication, and offers multiple unique roles to players that are actually necessary and useful. \n\nThe game also discourages wanton recklessness and the typical CoD mindset. Suffice it to say, there will still be outliers and stupid people. Whether they're scavenging, greedily hoarding kills/money and overextending, or simply running off into the wilderness unarmed, there's bound to be one of them every once in a while, attempting to ruin the session for everyone else. \n\nKilling Floor attempts to creates an ultimatum where you can join forces or die alone. While you might not like who you're paired up with, the game will force you to work with them using the impending threat of a swift death.\n\nIn a world of boring CoD-esque first-person shooters , KF1 is a light in the darkness.","timestamp_created":1405173918,"timestamp_updated":1519047611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11199720","author":{"steamid":"76561198127863548","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":6080,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":888,"last_played":1583153327},"language":"russian","review":"ИГРА ЖЕСТЬ!!!!!!!
