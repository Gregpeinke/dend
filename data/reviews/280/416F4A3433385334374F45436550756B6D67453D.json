And, this wasn't what I was expecting back then... but I have since warmed up to this port (Ignore the 0.5 hours, for some reason I lost my old HL-2 content when the steam revamp happened).\n\nSo what is Half-Life: Source? Basically the exact same game as Half-Life, but with nicer visuals. Think of it as a very light HD Remaster like you see released on PS4 and Xbox One these days.  There isn't any additional content or anything, it is just the old classic with a fresh coat of paint on it. Now it does support the re-worked models from Blue Shift, which I don't remember being a thing at launch.\n\nNot alot else to add really. There are reports of bugs and weird glitches, but I've not really encountered anything myself  when I briefly re-visited it recently.\n\nWould I suggest getting this? Eh, why not? During a sale you can pick up the bundle it's in pretty cheap.

I still have the disk, but the Steam account used with it has long since vanished from my memory.  But believe it or not, I never could get into this game back then.  I was still too busy playing TF1.\n\nBut since that time I have decided to go back and play all of the games that I never had, or possibly did but just didn't play through.  And this game was at the top of my list.  It's amazing how well this game runs to this day.  And while I do still have the proper \"Period Correct\" computer to play this on, it plays just fine under my newer PC (FX-83XX w/ 8GB RAM & Win10).\n\nBeing a proper shooter with a great story line, the Half-Life game I remember has been much better as I have gotten older.  I can appreciate it much more now for what it was; one of the most \"modern\" of the classic shooters.  With twist at every turn, and an ability to catch you off guard with your ammo rationing, this game is great at making you want to backtrack to aquire more ammo. Having traditionally been a run & gun player, this game forced me to slow down and play.  This help me to appreciate exactly what made this game so special back in the day.\n\nAnother upside of this game is the Team Fortress Classic addon.  Which, believe it or not, still has quite a few active players to this day (Apr 2018).  If that doesn't say something about the longevity of this franchise, I don't know what does.\n\nIf you've never played it before, I would suggest at least giving it a once over to experience what it was like gaming back at the turn of the century.

На самом деле Half-Life Source- это та же Half-Life 1, но на движке Source с изменёнными эффектами, с добавлением Ragdollа, с переделанным Skyboxом и с исправлением некоторых скриптов которые в обычной Half-Life они были сделаны криво, но проблема в том, что игра не ремейк 1-й части, а просто перенесённая игра с движка Gold Source на движок Source с кучей багов, ошибок  и недочётов, как например в главе ,,Переработка отходов\" в одной локации ломаются эффекты, а в последующей главе на локации со снайпером ломается и Skybox. В целом Half-Life Source это та же самая игра только на движке Source с багами и недочётами в плане некоторых уровней которые терпится исправить.

The most nostalgic part about this game for me was the mods and people putting funny stuff in the game, either it was Crack-Life, Jamie's Mod, Half-Life Zombie Edition, or more. This game has been there in my childhood too and it has been in my past so I could definitely give this game a really good rating as well as the other games I have rated.\n\nThis game is one of the best old school shooters I have played and people back in the day who reviewed this game around 1998-1999 weren't wrong. It really was a huge hit and it was a hugely vast success for Valve. That is until their next game Half-Life 2 had came in and it was AMAZING.\n\nValve, again I wanna thank you very much for making these games.

If you're expecting the same level of quality from HL:S as HL2, you will be bitterly disappointed.\nThis is not a total conversion; it's just the original Half-Life on an engine it wasn't designed for. As such, the physics of Source aren't put to any sort of interesting use in this game, and at times end up completely broken. While ladders are universally a pain in Source games, here I actually cringe in dread any time I have to use them. When I reach the top of a ladder, for some reason I'll often launch off of it, missing what I was climbing to and taking fall damage. Why wasn't this fixed in playtesting? Was this game playtested?\nThere are more bugs than that, though. For example, if you press the button for a blast door when it hasn't finished closing, the button will remain in that state and become useless, preventing you from progressing. Also, the Tentacles deal 0 damage, making Blast Pit, one of the most tense portions of the original game, a complete joke.\nThe AI just sucks. The graphics aren't improved from the original, which makes it look hideous for a 2004 game. I could go on, but you get the point. It's just a mess overall.\n\nWhile this game isn't offensively bad, its only saving grace is that it's Half-Life. If you want the best possible Half-Life experience, play Black Mesa (though, as of me writing this, the Xen levels still haven't been released yet). If you want to play the original Half-Life, just play the original Half-Life. There's no significant reason to play this game, unless you've just been playing both those versions nonstop and want something a bit different.\n\n[h1]5/10, at least it's Half-Life.[/h1]","timestamp_created":1519934202,"timestamp_updated":1519934687,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.64820253849029541","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40471029","author":{"steamid":"76561198120266850","num_games_owned":2433,"num_reviews":154,"playtime_forever":1179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":610,"last_played":1559719236},"language":"english","review":"Pretty fun.
