Закончилась игра \"Half-Life 2\", на стоп кадре, мощного взрыва, а эпизод первый, продолжает её историю. Отмечу, что продолжение игры, по сценарию, короткая, но слишком усложнённая и интересная, затягивающая, всё больше думать, как выйти из той или иной ситуации. Играем за Фримана и в компании Алекс, которая до конца эпизода будет его сопровождать, цель эвакуация людей из Сити-17 и нейтрализация ядра в цитадели, который нарастил критическую массу для взрыва. Волком одиночкам, это может и не понравиться, гулять с ботом, но Алекс будет здорово помогать, ну и строить \"глазки\" Фриману. \nВсе, кто играл прошлую игру, подметили, под конец прохождения \"гравипушку версию 2.0\", хочу обрадовать, потому что в начале данной игры, проходя, через конфискатор оружия, она опять появиться. Правда только, в той части игры, где проходим сценарий в цитадели, за то любителям пошвырять \"комбайнов\", это принесет большое удовольствие. \nНовые враги в игре - сталкер и \"зомбайны\", как их нарекла Алекс, очень опасны и бьют больно по здоровью Фримана, поэтому для вас будет время, обдумать стратегии и планы, как с ними бороться.\nВообще в этой игре (я, её разделил на две части, цитадель и город), советую часто сохраняться, особенно в начале игры, потому что разрушающаяся цитадель, таит множество, смертельны ловушек.\nВот и всё, что я хотел написать, рекомендую, конечно, эту игру несмотря на дату выпуска, 1 июня 2006 года, всё равно найдутся, те кто в её не играл. Но, в первую очередь, советую играть, как задумано и по порядку выхода серий \"Half-Life\". ","timestamp_created":1506934445,"timestamp_updated":1506934445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.623986423015594482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35383741","author":{"steamid":"76561198120128971","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":1108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":549,"last_played":1656979503},"language":"english","review":"Good expansion for Half-Life 2 even tough it kinda gets boring after a while when you go trough the whole game with only one, city theme.","timestamp_created":1506868479,"timestamp_updated":1506868479,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35382522","author":{"steamid":"76561198031305632","num_games_owned":772,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":535,"last_played":1506607886},"language":"czech","review":"10/10♥\n","timestamp_created":1506866114,"timestamp_updated":1506866114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514503061771392822","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35367200","author":{"steamid":"76561198037079805","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":95,"playtime_forever":225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1506840986},"language":"english","review":"Pretty short but quite good.

The campaign can definitely be done in 3 hours. Tops. After that its achievement hunting and whatnot. Dont think anyone would go here unless they already played previous Half Life games.\n\nA lot of people seem so obsessed with this IP, but it has so many loopholes. In my HL2 review I mentioned the setting feels like its in Soviet Russia. I thought it was just the feeling until I have noticed shop letters being cyrillic and a hospital being written in Russian. So the game is definitely happening in that region, which raises the question, why is everyone speaking English, why are the main heroes there and why did they send off so many black people in this area? Asian-type people do live in that region, so they are more likely to be found, but this is weird.\n\nThe plot of the game doesnt really bring much either, as in, it contributes almost zero to the overall understanding of whats happening. What I can praise is Alyx as a companion, she has good animations and shows a lot of character. The gameplay is alright, but for the length and the price, this feels underwhelming. Honestly, unless you got this in a bundle, played the previous ones and want to know what happens next, I wouldnt recommend getting it or going through it.\n\nIt was an overall enjoyable experience, so i will rate it positive, but I would have given the product a neutral score if there was an option.\n\n6/10","timestamp_created":1506603388,"timestamp_updated":1658163780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35237410","author":{"steamid":"76561197994287096","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":279,"last_played":1506498247},"language":"english","review":"great

Dünya ilk oyunda açılan bir kapıdan giren varlıkların istilasıyla yüz yüze kalmıştı, olayların gelişimini oynarken görüyorduk. İkinci oyun ise kontrol kısmen sağlanmakla birlikte diktatörlük benzeri bir Combine istilası söz konusu.  Eski Black Mesa çalışanlarının da aralarında bulunduğu direnişçilere yardım etmek için bir trende ortaya çıkıyorduk. Trendeki adamın birisi biraz önce burada mıydın? Gibisinden bir soruyla gizemli gelişimizi irdeliyor fakat şaşırmıyordu niyeyse. Hikâyedeki en göze çarpan taraf Alyx isimli kızın partnerliğinde hareket etmemizdi. Kendisinden sonra gelen oyunlara yol gösterdiği bir başka tarafı da bu. Partner yardımlarıyla kapı açmak, bölümde ilerlemek, hikâyeyi dinlemek sonraki diğer oyunlarda da yer yer kullanıldı. Fazla uzatmadan dünyayı saran geçişin kaynağına doğru gittiğimiz bir yol var tabii öncesinde Alyx’in Profesör babasının kaçırılması durumu söz konusu. Genelde onun izinden gidiyoruz, akış bu yönde.

Episode 1, formerly known as Half-life: Aftermath, was the beginning of the new episodic style valve was realeasing new installments. This would give fans what they wanted without having them wait years and years for another game but with some understandable sacrifices. The game was a hit for fans of the previous installments and brought some new tech advancements into the game such as better lighting. The plot takes place right after the end of Half-life 2 and doesn't waste any time getting back into the meat of it.\n\nPROS:\n-The story is very well paced and put together very nicely as all the others. You play as Gordon Freeman again during the aftermath of the citadels destruction. Not spoiling the rest in case you haven't picked up a copy in the many years its existed.\n-The environment is very immersive as it is a long seamless road to the end of the game with, as the definition of seamless implies, zero cutscenes or immersion breaking interruptions.\n-The gunplay involves the same chaotic weapons from half-life 2. The arsenal available is pleasently loud, very powerful feeling, and quite fun to use when eliminating the enemy as per tradition.\n-Dialogue breaks are few, far between, and about a minute each if you even count them as such.\n-Same engine as hal-life 2 to no surprise but with very few legitimate puzzles to get your thinker going.\n-As with half-life 2, the ending is satasfying and closes things out with a nice bow ribbon.\n\nCONS: (Not even half-life is safe from sin, sorry) Please note that i am extremely aware that this game is sorta old.\n-Controls feel less floaty than half-life 1 but there's still some slip n sliding.\n-The combine is a painfully easy enemy throughout the entire game and even when their ranks change.\n-Various visual bugs and other graphical anomalies give the game a kind of rushed feeling.\n-The games puzzles and other logic based conundrums are bonehead easy and will just seem like annoyances on successive playthroughs.\n-Not much of a con but i found it quite odd that gordon gets his crowbar more towards the end dispite being his iconic weapon of choice.\n\nThis game is about as much of a must have as half-life 2. I picked the entire series up in a frantic buy in a summer sale and it was worth it. To me the episodes wern't very replayable, they arn't very exciting to play again and not very memorable. The games main critisim is it's length which is somthing that i fully agree with.

The complete lack of ANY communication for TEN YEARS is completly disgusting, It is disrepectful to the fans who supported valve for years. Its sad that valve doesnt even have the courtesy to tell their fans that half life is dead. It is clear that we will never get a satisfying ending to an amazing story. I personally am not interested in anything valve has released since Episode 2, and if the single player story driven masterpieces of recent years are anything to go by, its that valve only cares about its games as service titles, and not their narative driven campaigns. I am deeply upset that we will never get to explore the atmospheric and exciting universe of half life again. Valve prides themselves on their independance and flat workplace structure, but its clear there is a lack of focus. Valve, like too many companies in the video games industry, seem to be too blinded on following the money, they have left behind those that got them there in the first place...","timestamp_created":1504582818,"timestamp_updated":1504582818,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501811623573303223","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34748219","author":{"steamid":"76561198148429309","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1527216857},"language":"spanish","review":"Una continuacion decente, aunque al principio no puedes dejar esa sensacion de que algo no esta bien con el juego, lo llevan de una forma excelente y realmente se siente como una continuacion.\nPero se siente un poco aburrido al principio\n8/10","timestamp_created":1504578460,"timestamp_updated":1504578460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34745407","author":{"steamid":"76561198000213938","num_games_owned":300,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1504645119},"language":"english","review":"is gud","timestamp_created":1504564974,"timestamp_updated":1504564974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34741641","author":{"steamid":"76561198203247568","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":294,"last_played":1504550796},"language":"russian","review":"ну вот я и добрался до этого эпизода хайфлы , долго решался пройти   все полностью,  и вот настал тот момент когда я наконец  сделал это...  игра сама по  себе  прикольная но этот эпизод до жути короткий","timestamp_created":1504551374,"timestamp_updated":1504551374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34731806","author":{"steamid":"76561198329995705","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":267,"last_played":1612299531},"language":"spanish","review":"Al igual que el primer Half-Life tuvo sus dos expansiones, aquí Valve repite la mecánica: dos episodios que continúan la historia de Freeman, algo cortos, pero que juntos suman lo mismo que los juegos enteros.","timestamp_created":1504521260,"timestamp_updated":1504705125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504541695117950439","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34727361","author":{"steamid":"76561198146548547","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1504497995},"language":"english","review":"I hate most parts of this it never got any easier and most of the time it just kept throwing bullshit at me i only got pistol ammo almost the whole time and every time it was about to end one of the charecthers would say gordon and i well go distract the combine while you escape and would go ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
