Just judging by the official screenshots cycling above, you have the abilites to use special abilites in one hand and a weapon in the other.\n\nIn this game, you must rescue a girl that you know next to nothing about. Armed with a pistol and a key, you must wrest her from the clutches of Columbia, a city that would die to protect her and keep her there at all costs.\n\nThe game plays very similarly to the other two Bioshock games, but it is less restrictive in terms of combat, and where you can go. Instead of being trapped in an underwater room with dim lights in the corners, you get to zip around on skylines and pick off enemies one by one as Elizabeth follows along and tries not to get shot.\n\nAnd yes, you get to rescue the girl.\n\nWithout revealing too much about the game, the parallels between this one and the other two are crazy and mind-blowing. Everything you'd expect to find in a Bioshock game is here. You just need to look for it.","timestamp_created":1396101704,"timestamp_updated":1396101704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50113379955291748","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9663373","author":{"steamid":"76561198053247793","num_games_owned":804,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":1048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1048,"last_played":1396101580},"language":"english","review":"the game ... it's about lighthouses","timestamp_created":1396101701,"timestamp_updated":1396101701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.6198921799659729","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9663204","author":{"steamid":"76561198078191147","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":805,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":548,"last_played":1590416290},"language":"russian","review":"cool game\nнадо брать","timestamp_created":1396100518,"timestamp_updated":1402602350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9663097","author":{"steamid":"76561198061864491","num_games_owned":385,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":829,"last_played":1521571278},"language":"english","review":"The game was pretty awesome.

I always look forward to the next iteration to see how they can push photo-realism. But then you have games such as The Witcher 2 and Bioshock Infinite that make me think; \"Wow, that's beautiful\".\nWe could get into a discussion about artistic direction vs photo-realism and we'd be here all day, but suffice to say, Bioshock Infinite is a beautiful game and I take my hat off to the artists involved.\nThe story, including those of the DLC Episodes is really quite intriguing, but ONLY if you've played the original Bioshock. Without it, you're missing out on details that truly make this such an interesting game.\nFor me, the characters within the game were the thing that hooked me in the most. Booker and Elizabeth. A brilliant combination. I haven't played the 'Last of Us' on PS3, but I could quite imagine what has been written on that relationship could also be added here. Voice acting can go so wrong, but not in this game; I applaud the actors here.\nLastly, I reach the gameplay and that for me is where my enthusiasm dips. It's not that it's bad. Far from it; enemies react accordingly. But it's been done before. In Bioshock for instance.\nBut that's the main game and Episode 1. Episode 2 forces you to play as Elizabeth. And that invokes memories of Thief. Stealth, timing. And it helps to wrap up many of the story threads that have been unresolved.\nDo I recommend this game? Yes. I did truly enjoy it. Because ultimately, I was immersed.

The reason why this is one of my favorite games of 2013 is because of its immersive plot. The gameplay is basically the same if you played previous Bioshocks, use a vigor and grab a shotgun. There are a diversity of enemies but with the shotgun and bucking bronco, there isnt much of a challenge. The atmosphere and envionment of the game is beautiful, and personally prefer Columbia over Rapture. Booker and Elizabeth has such dynamic character development,and are unforgettable after playing through the entire game. Overall, Bioshock Infinite is a fun and engaging game, though combat can get tediously repetitive, but its managable, the main point of Bioshock Infinite is the beautiful atmosphere and importantly one of the best original stories that came out of 2013.\n\n-Burial at Sea Ep 1-\nThe First DLC of an amazing game brings us to the city of Rapture, before the downfall. The first half of the game is basically focused on the story, and lets you explore the beautiful city for a bit. The second half is where the usual run and gun combat happens, but with a bit less ammo, so dont be surprised that you ran out. For the cons, the entire DLC storyline can be completed in an hour and a half, didnt even realize that it was that short till I finished it. Overall decent DLC, but if your in it for the story, I will save you $15 and just go watch walkthroughs of Ep 1.\n\n-Burial at Sea Ep 2- \nThe Final Chapter of Burial at Sea lets you play Elizabeth from the Infinite Universe just to clear things up, and brings a whole new way to play thanks to the new stealth gameplay. Don't bother playing like Booker, Elizabeth doesn't carry that much ammo and she has less health, and there is no shield this time. The stealth mechanic is refreshing for Bioshock Infinite, though there are times where the AI is really blind as you can sneak in front of them and knock em out. Elizabeth can also crawl through vents and lockpicking is a big focus this time.Story-wise, there will be mind-fu*ks, like Infinites story,but as you progress,one major plot point made me dissapointed that I would not say, and is best for you to experience yourself. Overall Episode 2 is really fun and a fresh experience and actually worth the $15 in my opinion, compared to Episode 1.","timestamp_created":1396076505,"timestamp_updated":1396076528,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9660087","author":{"steamid":"76561198108147926","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2603,"last_played":1397660994},"language":"french","review":"Excellent mais un peu court.","timestamp_created":1396075738,"timestamp_updated":1396075738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9659874","author":{"steamid":"76561198069695657","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":705,"last_played":1547513700},"language":"english","review":"Wow, what a game.

The original Bioshock created tension through dark, creepy visuals and a sense of despairing, late-to-the-party decrepitude. Infinite switches from colourful and friendly to sinister on the turn of a dime, which is a pity, because the idea of a floating, neo-confederate new Eden held a lot of promise.\n\nThe gameplay is mediocre. Combat is bland and extremely easy on normal, while Vigors are generally unnecessary. AI is also fairly poor for such a modern game; there is a difference between zealotry and idiocy, and baton toting policemen climbing over their dead comrades to get into my crosshairs is in the latter category. Incidentally, the rave reviews that Elizabeth received are nonsensical - she deigns to gives you money and ammunition occasionally and is otherwise untargetable during battle. That's it. \n\nVisuals are good, yes, but there could have been so much more. Most buildings cannot be explored and progression is almost purely linear, unless you plan on backtracking exactly the way you came to open a missed chest or a locked door. As for the Skyhook mechanic... well, it's there. You can use it in combat if you like, but it's not very efficient unless the game decides that it's mandatory.\n\nAs for the plot, well, I don't know if I can stand the gameplay long enough to finish the damn thing. The dialogue isn't that great, so I doubt I'm going to be wowed by however the alternate-universe plot-majig is explained. Yahtzee did like this game, but nobody is perfect.","timestamp_created":1396046873,"timestamp_updated":1404226210,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523622035980224609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9656894","author":{"steamid":"76561197974929431","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":702,"last_played":1396046144},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite completely renewed my faith in Single Player games after taking a long hiatus from them. From the depth of the storyline to the gameplay, the game is really fantastic.

I have yet too see what another pass through the campaign is like so I can't say much to its replay value. But the only thing I was a tiny bit disappointed with was that I was a little confused in the end, it took a little twist into the really weird instead of just being a little far fetched.

Weapons were fun and easy to play.\n\nDesign and artwork is one of the best what i have seen in my gaming life. Style how the graphics were made was so detailed and floating islands with unique people and wonderful soundtrack nailed for me!\n\nGame had stuff to collect and they were challenging to find but it was always rewarding to find them.\n\nGraphics are stunning, so you cant play this with old school computer.

Милая, эмоциональная, очень часто помогвет в тот момент, когда это действительно необходимо. А ещё она дает тебе деньги (вот тут у меня произошел небольшой разрыв шаблона).\n Но вернемся к самой игре. Добавлено много динамичности и большой выбор оружия. Правда носить с собой можно только два вида. Энергетики выбираются по вкусу и стилю прохождения.

Bioshock 2 - модернизированный геймплей , разнообразие противников, интересные персонажи, грандиозное окончание дней Восторга. Bioshock infinite - к сожалению, менее увлекательный игровой процесс, с лихвой компенсирующийся великолепным, \"крышеснощим\" сюжетом, изумительная детализация мира.

This is not something I've looked forward to, but the day was always due to come. However, my experience with the game has finally drawn to a close no matter how much I wish my time in Columbia could go on.\n\nLike countless others, I preordered the game last year. Unlike many, I was not the biggest fan of the first two Bioshock games (they were okay, though the setting didn't connect with me). From the available information, I could tell Infinite would be different. I was not disappointed. \n\nI know the game has taken a lot of flak from critics, particularly in the time since initial release, but I wholeheartedly recommend the game to anyone who feels even the slightest interest in the game. In the year I've had to enjoy Bioshock Infinite, Steam tells me I've logged 58.5 hours. In that time, I've run through the main game at least three times, toyed with the Clash in the Clouds DLC for a bit, ran through each of the story DLCs a couple times, and chased all but a few pesky achievements. People can bash the gameplay or the plot all they want, but I enjoyed all of it. I'm greatly saddened in the likelihood I'll never explore Columbia again, except for when I inevitably replay the main game in a few years time.\n\nThe things I've loved most about my experience have been the setting and the story. The setting of Columbia, as I previously mentioned, resonates with me in a much deeper way than Rapture ever did. The art style and the color palette are gorgeous. The world-building lore was intriguing, and it made me want to explore every nook and cranny to soak up the vibe and get to know the city. The story has been widely criticized, but I personally have not been so affected by a AAA game or reallly any FPS, indie or otherwise, in years. This boils down to the Booker/Elizabeth relationship. They were both great characters and the ending of the main game (and to a lesser extent, the DLC) actually elicited an emotional response. \n\nAll good things come to an end and in spite of the game's title, I knew I couldn't infinitely experience fresh things in this game. I'm sorry to see Irrational close its doors, but I feel this is a respectable note to end on. I look forward to one day playing through with fresh eyes again. I'm sure it will hold up for me. \n\nDo yourself a favor and buy this game.","timestamp_created":1396018723,"timestamp_updated":1396018723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9652238","author":{"steamid":"76561198079874728","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":1573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1058,"last_played":1462617308},"language":"english","review":"[b]PROS:[/b]\n[b]• Excellent Storyline[/b]\n[b]• Visually Appealing World[/b]\n[b]• Amazing Gameplay[/b]\n[b]• Excellent - AI[/b]\n[b]• Excellent - UI[/b]\n[b]• Full Optimization[/b]\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n[b]• Light Bugs/Glitches[/b]\n[b]• Slightly Repetitive[/b]\n\n[b]9.5/10 \"Must Own\"[/b]","timestamp_created":1396017427,"timestamp_updated":1419979969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9652078","author":{"steamid":"76561197980070618","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":444,"last_played":1395684880},"language":"russian","review":"Итересный сюжет, но много \"воды\" и повторяющихся моментов, но в общем очень даже хорошо!","timestamp_created":1396016115,"timestamp_updated":1396016115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9651998","author":{"steamid":"76561198095700941","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2099,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1291,"last_played":1437929427},"language":"german","review":"Also wenn es ein Spiel zu entfehlen gibt, dann dieses!
