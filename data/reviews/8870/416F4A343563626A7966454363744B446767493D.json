My how i was very wrong. If you are a fan of the first two games in terms of game play you will find Infinite to have mastered the craft of the first two. In terms of story i still believe there is no beating the first game but i must say i do enjoy infinite's story a lot. The game is a masterful telling of an alternate world from the one of rapture where the flying city of Columbia is the center. Really i have nothing bad to say about this game and if your wondering if Infinite's story connects with the Rapture we know from the second game just play the two DLC Burial at Sea and you will see. Great game masterful work. Game play is a big improvement from the prior two games. You have gear pieces you can equip in order to gain certain effects to melee, personal body or weapons. Plenty of guns to choose from and the plasmids are a mix of old and new. If you enjoyed the first and second game, Bioshock infinite is a must as well.","timestamp_created":1587640815,"timestamp_updated":1587640815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67867658","author":{"steamid":"76561198810200098","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":1451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1001,"last_played":1587825068},"language":"turkish","review":"kesinlikle en iyi oyunlardan hikayesi daha ağır basıyor","timestamp_created":1587638876,"timestamp_updated":1587638876,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67861689","author":{"steamid":"76561198167069013","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":819,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1591474698},"language":"english","review":"It all comes together so well...a masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1587629366,"timestamp_updated":1587629366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67861107","author":{"steamid":"76561199000080276","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":827,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":713,"last_played":1621610578},"language":"russian","review":"Шикарно","timestamp_created":1587628355,"timestamp_updated":1587628355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67860334","author":{"steamid":"76561198353179696","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":862,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":862,"last_played":1587606938},"language":"english","review":"it's alright","timestamp_created":1587626920,"timestamp_updated":1587626920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67857356","author":{"steamid":"76561198366672751","num_games_owned":397,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":851,"last_played":1588568521},"language":"russian","review":"BGF - Best Game Forever","timestamp_created":1587621675,"timestamp_updated":1587738793,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.595448017120361328","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67857087","author":{"steamid":"76561198085469405","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2016,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1205,"last_played":1592278321},"language":"koreana","review":"그냥 진짜 몰입감이 장난아니다 2회차 플레이중 \n할인기간이 아니다 - 조금 한 10초 고민하고 사고 아직 안해봤는데 할인기간이면 그냥 바로 사라","timestamp_created":1587621163,"timestamp_updated":1587621163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67856707","author":{"steamid":"76561198805480185","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1630598445},"language":"tchinese","review":"把游戏做的像本小说一样，剧本的高乌托邦精神与现实交杂着，主人公一直反抗命运，却终究被命运玩弄。","timestamp_created":1587620500,"timestamp_updated":1587620500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67856445","author":{"steamid":"76561199019559004","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1062,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":927,"last_played":1598965783},"language":"schinese","review":"挺好，但也没吹那么好吧，游戏的剧情是相当好，绝对算得上“第九艺术”，尤其是惊艳的开头和令人回味的结尾，尽管游戏流程不长，一般7-10个小时可以全通关，（前提是你知道寻路键(*￣︶￣)），但是说实话，这中间的剧情、战斗比较臃肿重复。\n不过！！！！！！！不到五十块，就可以享受数小时的艺术体验，这真的很香，很值得买，毕竟，谁不喜欢伊丽莎白呢？(*￣︶￣)\n对了，dlc感觉不太行，玩玩本体就行","timestamp_created":1587619980,"timestamp_updated":1602906833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67855202","author":{"steamid":"76561198147594420","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2777,"last_played":1587367087},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente, una historia muy engarsada y que te lleva a giros argumentales que se disfrutan mucho;

Not saying the previous Bioshock games are bad (they are pretty good too), but this is way to good. Right now this is my second favourite FPS shooter, right behind Half Life 2. Now I am going to talk about different gameplay elements. \n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nStory was amazing! Without spoiling anything, the story leaves an after taste and also allows you to wanting to think about the story even after you finished. \n\n[h1]Characters:[/h1]\nCharacters are very fleshed out in this game, especially Elizabeth. The game shows a big different between Booker and Elizabeth, and how they see things. Elizabeth is also such a likeable character. \n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nNow the gameplay is what makes this game awesome. So instead of plasmids, you get access to something called vigours, which essentially act like plasmids (they are the same thing). But basically, you can use these vigours in battle, and it really adds to gameplay. In addition, I really love how they managed guns in this game. In previous Bioshock games (or in a lot of other FPS games) ,you have a selected amount of weapons, and you get access to all of those different weapons all the time. However in Bioshock Infinite, you only get 2 weapons everytime. Therefore, you need to adapt to these kind of gameplay. So for example, there are around 10 different types of guns in the game, and whenever one of your guns run out, you will need to select a different weapon either from crates, or from NPC drops. I really love this type of gameplay because it allows quicker gameplay. Moreover, Elizabeth is a great addition in combat, she often finds random things and toss it to you (which is also why I love her). So if you are running low on health, she will toss you a health pack, if you are running low on ammo, she will toss you some ammo and so on. Elizabeth also helps in battle by summoning (not really summoning, but I will use this word for now) turrets, health packs or covers to help you in battle. Personally, I am not a fan of this, but it is a welcoming addition. Besides guns and vigous, Booker also has access to a melee weapon called the SkyHook, and it is brutal. You can use the Skyhook to violently murder your enemies, as well as flying around on a skyline. Skylies are my favourite thing in the game. They allow Booker to climb on one, and esentially acts like a roller coaster and fly you around. On a skyline, you can fly around to shoot enemies, or you can land on enemies to do something called a skyline execution. A skyline execution is also violent, and often deals a ton of damage. Overall, gameplay is incredibly solid, and I will give it a 9/10. \n\n[h1]Performance:[/h1]\nBioshock Infinite is very well optimised. I tried playing this on my crappy macbook pro 2017, and surprisingly I am getting 40 fps at maximum settings possible, and Bioshock Infinite has pretty good graphics. \n\nOverall, this game is incredibly solid, and I will give it an overall score of 9/10","timestamp_created":1587552394,"timestamp_updated":1587552394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67809088","author":{"steamid":"76561198161128086","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":847,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":847,"last_played":1585664191},"language":"english","review":"Possibly the best Bioshock game out there.

That said, I have to agree with some (minor?) complaints other reviews have made, and also point out a few of my own. \n\n1) The Sky-Line system is pretty cool, but underutilized. They sell it as a means of transport around the city, but in reality it's singularly used in maybe 4 or 5 areas in a VERY localized and looped way, basically just allowing you to move around that specific arena to different high grounds and get the jump-attack on enemies and such; it is NOT used as actual transportation.\n\n2) The tear system is equally cool, but equally underutilized - it basically only shows up during large arena-style deathmatch fights with waves of mobs, and for the most part they don't really do anything particularly interesting with the system. You could pretty much ignore it completely in 99.9% of situations and it wouldn't change a thing.\n\n3) The two-gun limit is stupid and obnoxious. There are MANY different weapons in this game, most weapon types have two different variants, and both variants use their own unique ammo. It's annoying to have to drop a weapon you're carrying to pick one up and it made me never want to spend any money upgrading any of them. You never know if you're going to be coming across ammo for weapons you actually have or weapons you don't have, and if you swap weapons to the type of ammo that's dropping then suddenly ammo for the weapon you just ditched 3 minutes is all you'll find.\n\n4) The lack of ability to store (and later use) health packs and salt hypos like the last two BioShock games is baffling. Sometimes you've left running around looting trash cans for old food to restore tiny bits of your HP until you're full for 4 solid minutes because you couldn't pick up those you came across before when \"full.\"\n\n5) As others have mentioned, SEVERAL of the enemy-types in this game are such ridiculous bullet-sponges that you'll end up using up most if not all of your ammo for both weapons just trying to make it through that group of enemies, and then you're back to 5 minutes of hunting for scraps and looting bodies hoping they happen to be dropping one of the 18 ammo types the TWO guns you're carrying actually use - which most of the time, they're not.\n\n6) The lack of any proper map is ridiculous. Period.\n\nStill a good game, but flawed.","timestamp_created":1587491695,"timestamp_updated":1587491695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67768317","author":{"steamid":"76561198042056231","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2865,"last_played":1587738408},"language":"english","review":"This game has something else: it gives you feelings, it makes you think about life, about yourself, about your choices.

Все игры серии Bioshock представляют собой осмысление: как погоня за утопией, высокими идеалами и личные амбиции приводят к полному краху построенных империй. Если в первых двух играх представлена идеология объективизма Айн Рэнд, то в Bioshock Infinite не представлена одной какой-то идеологией, а отражает мир конца XIX - начала XX в., что только её углубляет. О достоинствах этой игры можно писать много, хотя есть и недостатки, но о них я не хочу писать. В общем, я люблю серию Bioshock (хотя и познакомился с ней только 2-3 года назад, а BI прошёл буквально на днях), но эта игра мне понравилась всё же больше предыдущих благодаря её атмосферности, сюжету, лору и плавной подачей истории. Рекомендую эту игру всем тем, кто не знаком с серией Bioshock или же прошёл первые две части (особенно, кому они понравились), но почему-то не сыграл в BI. На мой взгляд эта игра - лучшая в серии.","timestamp_created":1587420944,"timestamp_updated":1587426743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67711402","author":{"steamid":"76561198825474864","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6561,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3881,"last_played":1653620548},"language":"spanish","review":"simplemente bioshock","timestamp_created":1587420073,"timestamp_updated":1587420073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67711371","author":{"steamid":"76561198146063620","num_games_owned":487,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":519,"last_played":1587474621},"language":"english","review":"All they had to do was make Bioshock 3.

The second part was already better than the first one, but \"Bioshock: Infinite\" has overcome all possible expectations. \n\nThe storytelling was amazing: no long cutscenes or boring reading - just a fluid flow of the events. The environment was gorgeous and filled with so much stuff that it actually began to confuse you. The multilevel concept lures you into a false sense of open-world game, which is a smart move. \n\nThe choice of developers to move from multiple weapons to multiple Vigors (i.e. Plasmids) was genius as it diversified fights significantly. Although, I still mostly used 3, tops. But the variety of objects you can interact with makes it up for the lack of guns in your backpack. Believe me, you will forget about this aspect once you see what you are able to work with.\n\nThe soundtrack is outstanding, especially with some CCR popping out of nowhere.
