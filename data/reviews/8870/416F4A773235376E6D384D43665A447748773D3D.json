This is one of the worst games ever. I seriously tried to like this game. How did it sell so many copies? How did it get such great reviews?  These are just a couple of the questions i asked myself while playing this game. Maybe it is just because i played the first 2 Bioshock games, but i doubt it. I feel like the game was a quick job to get alot of money from a known franchise. This game is nothing like the first 2.\n\nIf you played Bioshock 1 & 2 and loved playing them, then avoid this game if you can. Although, if you've played Bioshock 1 & 2, you may feel compelled to finish the story. I think you will be seriously disapointed in this sequel for everything except the story.  \n\nPlay the first Bioshock if you've never played before.

I'll admit the graphics are beautiful, and the music and atmosphere to match. The storyline isn't what I expected, and this game has me wondering if it's gets any better later. Overally, dissapointed by the game. Still, I'll give credit where it's due, it's a worthy play if you dismiss the past games.","timestamp_created":1388216300,"timestamp_updated":1400051551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8357854","author":{"steamid":"76561198118554621","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113,"last_played":1440459815},"language":"english","review":"perty awesome\n","timestamp_created":1388213974,"timestamp_updated":1388213974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8357459","author":{"steamid":"76561198038376775","num_games_owned":389,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":496,"last_played":1388445772},"language":"english","review":"Best single player game of this genre!","timestamp_created":1388212530,"timestamp_updated":1388212530,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510385751724243164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8356927","author":{"steamid":"76561198057360399","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1523,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1408,"last_played":1420337039},"language":"brazilian","review":"O melhor jogo que joguei no ano e uma história de pirar o cabeção!","timestamp_created":1388210408,"timestamp_updated":1388210408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8356852","author":{"steamid":"76561198042266037","num_games_owned":339,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":904,"last_played":1503731457},"language":"english","review":"To be honest this doesn't really feel like a Bioshock game to me, but it isn't a bad game. What I mean by it's not really a Bioshock game is that it doesn't have that isolation feeling to it, you always have somebody following you around, who is honestly quite an annoying character in my opinion (shes too cliche), she throws you supplies which is nice but it totally kills that sense of having to scavenge for things like in the previous two titles, and finally the clastrophobic feelings you may experience in the others is completly gone an floating open city is really hard to sell a sense of lost freedom. \n\nIf you can look past all that then you will be in for a treat of a game. The gameplay is fun as hell although if you have played the other two on normal and thought it was a little tough you will want to set the difficulty to hard, the AI are pushovers. The story of Booker Dewitt and a couple of others is interesting but most are something you have already seen before. Other than some of the character models, the game is breathtaking in visuals, especially in the beggining. \n\nI personally would give this game a 8 out of 10, only because I have played the previous two and like the loneliness that those made me feel. When playing this game don't think of it as Bioshock think of it as a game with dumbed down Bioshock combat.","timestamp_created":1388210125,"timestamp_updated":1388210125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8356789","author":{"steamid":"76561198102711154","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3098,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1791,"last_played":1474774249},"language":"russian","review":"Сюжет кулл","timestamp_created":1388209868,"timestamp_updated":1388209868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8356710","author":{"steamid":"76561197972448343","num_games_owned":403,"num_reviews":313,"playtime_forever":1772,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1323,"last_played":1463115049},"language":"english","review":"I was upset that we were parting from Rapture and went into this game thinking that it might be a fun little spinoff.
