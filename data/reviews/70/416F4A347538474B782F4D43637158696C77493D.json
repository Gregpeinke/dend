Сюжет очень интересный, практически в каждой главе открываешь для себя нового и хорошо запоминающегося персонажа, в том числе и новые виды оружия, к слову их тут достаточно. Великолепные локации с красивыми эффектами выглядят завораживающе. Полное отсутствие кат-сцен заставляет погрузиться в игру ещё больше.

While not the worst game I've played, not by a long-shot, it is still not something I'd recommend.\n\nThe first issue I had where the movement controls.  I've played arena shooters so I know what a fast running speed fells like.  However, it feels like Gordon is wearing roller skates in this game.  Combine that with the precision platforming, (yes in a FPS), and you have a formula for frustration.\n\nThe game also has some lousy signposting even for 1998 standards.\n\nThen you have the enemies who do insane amounts of damage, especially at later levels, on even the easiest difficulty.  The hit detection can be wonky at times.  (Died on time to an enemy soldier despite me having his head right in my cross-hairs and firing full bore at nearly point blank range.) \n\nI lost count of the number of times I rolled my eyes at a cheap death.  It got boring.\n\nI really tried to like this game.  I wanted to love it, but I can't.  It got so bad that in order to just finish it I activated cheats, I was so fed up.\n\nI doubt I will ever replay this, and have no idea how this became a \"classic.\"\n\n4/10\n\n5/10 (with cheats

never played the half-life series and always heard good things about them, but I didn't have the consoles growing up so I never played them. Playing this in 2020, I enjoyed it, reminded me of simpler times. But I wasn't particularly wowed by it. Or at least not enough to understand the hype around the series. Looking at other shooters of the time, South Park 64, Quake II, Tom Clancy's Rainbox Six, Dark Forces II, it really was impressive. I remember the graphics from Dark Forces and Rainbow Six, so Half life did shine among them I'm sure.\n\nThe game was fun, the story was lacking, the long line from start to finish being mostly seemless was nice. That said, while little details like microwaving the soup until it explodes, the vending machines, little bits of dialogue saying hi to Freeman... all that was nice, but I felt there was a distinct lack of story. I only knew that I was Gordon, I was going into work for something. Then I go press a button because someone told me and all hell breaks loose. Then for some reason we're the ones who HAVE to go and do a bunch of stuff. I guess it's because Gordon's the only one with the hazard suit on? Or because he's the only scientist who hits the range and gym? I'm not sure. But putting that aside, when there was small bits of exposition it was barely enough to tell you a vague objective and I often was doing puzzles because I saw them and figure'd I just needed to do it, not because anyone explained why. I did the whole rocket-kills-the-alien puzzle without having any idea WHY I was doing it and it was only after the alien died that I realized that I was doing that to open up the hole to travel some more. Then, the game ends in the way that it does and we're left with no particular answers or clues as to why this strange person is giving us a portal home or what they really want. Is it the mystery that got people intrigued? I don't understand. I hope that by playing the second game I'll get it some more, but while the first half-life is fun, and was unique in some ways, it just seems like a solid game to me and something to inspire a million decadeslong memes about half-life 3 never ever. I guess I'll learn more later.\n\nGood game, worth the price, plays well on windows 10.

up.","timestamp_created":1595910144,"timestamp_updated":1595910144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73398866","author":{"steamid":"76561198986270211","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1081,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":597,"last_played":1628881252},"language":"english","review":"classic.

you thought all action games were the same...\"\n\n\"...Think again.\"\n- Half-Life Box.\n\nAbsolute Poetry and the best way to describe the game. \n\nHalf-Life isn't your Brother's quake, it isn't your papa's Doom, and it surely isn't your granddad's Wolf 3d. Half-Life is something else. The enemies are dangerous, always present, and their tactics always change. You can't just go in and shotgun a marine, then move on. No, because you will waste a lot of ammo on one of them, and by the time they are down, about 3 others have probably dog-piled you. You need to use every one of your weapons to their full effect, and find creative uses for all of them, in order to not only kill your enemies, but to also flush them from cover and into your gunfire. They know how to use their weapons like professionals (Because they're mostly army grunts), and you are nothing but a lonely scientist. What are you going to do to fight them?\n\nAnswer: Superior Intellect.\n\nBecause of this, Half-Life is an incredibly unique and fun action FPS which is doubtlessly timeless. While many prefer HL2, I will always have a soft spot for Half-life. And hey, if you are reading this review, then you can thank Half-Life for putting Valve on the map, and subsequently making Steam. So, there's that!\n\nHalf-Life is daunting, challenging, and tough as hell. But remember:\n\nRun.\nShoot.\nThink.\nLive.\n\nHλlf-Life gets a solid 8.9/10 from me.
