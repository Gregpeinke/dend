This game is overall just okay. I don't really have much of a stance on it. i mean it's a DLC following Barney Calhoun and his short journey to help the scientists and himself escape Black Mesa. It happens during Gordon's journey in the first game and makes it clear where you are in relation to Gordon. It's short and doesn't have much story wise. It's main purpose is to answer your question of \"what were the scientists and security guards I met along the way doing during all this?\" And it does well at explaining that. All the same criticisms I had for HL1 apply here except for difficulty and pacing. Thats why i give it a 6/10.","timestamp_created":1657297281,"timestamp_updated":1657297281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580890953540802002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118456019","author":{"steamid":"76561198295206088","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":85,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":85,"last_played":1657292950},"language":"english","review":"For its age, it's a pretty good game.

But the other features of Blue Shift show that the game is an expansion pack (We do not count it as an expansion pack, since the game is a continuation of other games but can work alone).\n\nWe play Gordon Freeman in Half-Life, a soldier in Opposing Force and a security guard in Blue Shift.\n\nOur play is about the events that a security guard called Barney lived in Black Mesa. Actually, the hero is Barney, but at the very beginning of the game, when we go to buy his safety clothes, we get our clothes in the room of someone named CALHOUN. So our name is CALHOUN. At the very beginning of the game, there is a classic start again (in all Half-Life games, we go to the center with a vehicle, that's the beginning). We see Gordon Freeman at the very beginning of the game. It passes in front of us (I mean, we come to Black Mesa with Gordon in the first game of Half-Life, or we see that episode again in this game).\n\nAt the very beginning of the game, we collect our items (weapon, ammo) again, and then when we are taking down the doctors somewhere, the creatures start to appear. Now we get to the actual game. In the future, we encounter many obstacles such as creatures and soldiers. The creatures are not that important, but the soldiers are very strong, they take you down in two minutes, so be careful.\n\nOur main goal at Blue Shift is to protect doctors. For example, if you kill a doctor, the game is over (You are fired). Apart from protecting the doctors, you also get help from them (Gordon Freeman helps us a lot in the last part of the game and saves us). Also in the final episode we help all the doctors escape.\n\nIn other Half-Life games, we fight a big creature in the last episode, but not in Blue Shift. We only fight normal creatures and soldiers throughout the game. Only in the last episode, all the soldiers are squeezing us very badly (we are no longer struggling with a giant creature anyway). You forcibly get away from the soldiers and enter the teleport and you end the game. Finally, we have a conversation with Gordon Freeman (the game is not over without Gordon Freeman). Then we say “Bye bye Black Mesa”.\n\nGearbox Software has found a very good common ground in the game. If you have finished other Half-Life games, you will see images from old games (especially Gordon Freeman's) during the Blue Shift game. This adds a different atmosphere to the game.\n\nThe locations of the game stretch from Black Mesa to outer space.\n\nThe only shortcoming of the game in terms of subject is that it is short (it's not that short when I say short, but it's not as long as Opposing Force). Although the subject is short, the developments in graphics and sounds make up for this shortcoming. The engine of the game is Half-Life's own engine. So there is no change. When the engine of the game is the same engine, the PC requested by the game is of course the same as other Half-Life games. You can play the game comfortably with a low system. Whether your graphics card is 8 MB with 3D Accelerator, you can enjoy the graphics of the game in the highest resolution.\n\nLet's get to the sounds. If there is an improvement in the graphics, will there be no sound? Would of course. Sounds are much fuller. It also plays music from time to time depending on the course of the game (something not found in other Half-Life games). Since the music playing in the background is usually played when the enemy is attacking you, it is perfectly compatible with your current situation.\nBlue Shift is a must-play game for Half-Life lovers. If you have played Half Life and finished Half Life, you should definitely play Blue Shift. Because the subjects intersect with each other, this gives people even more pleasure. I hope you will not encounter the difficulties of copy games. Be sure to play this game. I would like to add one last thing, Half Life has to release additional games like this to maintain its popularity. So you can see more different games like Blue Shift.

This will undoubtedly tell the back story of Barney and his involvement during the catastrophe of Black Mesa. Thus will give you an understanding of his role to come, his relationship with Freeman and his adaptation going fourth into Half Life 2.\n\nBlue-Shift very much so entwines itself into two other stories without any excessive elaboration. That of paths of Gordon Freeman (being the original Half-Life) and Adrian Sheppard (being Opposing Force). Many areas, perhaps actions and words will resonate as the story progresses and give you a \"fly on the wall perspective\" and interpretation of the events that unfolded for different persons within the Facility during the cataclysm.\n\nBlue-Shift is a reasonably quick game and you are given a slimmer but similar inventory of HL weapons used by Freeman as opposed to Sheppard, who deviates in this area due to his mission statement and employment. Blue-Shift does not diverge from its conservative HL roots compared to the original, levels are similar but different, puzzles need to be completed to advance, scripted scenes without cut-scenes and the continual use of chapters.\n\nBlue-Shift also came with an extra addition called the high definition pack, which comprised of better textures and models. I do applaud the devs in the early days, how Blue-Shift represents and perceives Black Mesa as more \"lively and livable\" with people going about their day, as opposed to the standpoint of other HL games. Furthermore as authentic as the half-life experience is being alone most of the time, Blue-Shift also incorporates more team work and interaction with scientists to achieve objectives.\n\nHowever the game did come with mixed reviews, critical of the games length, no new enemies or weapons, compared to the other expansion Opposing Force. This did extend to the depth of the high definition pack and by extension of the games characters. I believe its rated poorly compared to the others.\n\nThose reviews aside and as a long time gamer and Half-Life veteran myself I do believe they are are quite minor and it is nothing to compare to the likes of some modern games being released today.\n\nThe blue Half-Life as its called, is a nostalgic addition which takes many of us older gamers on a trip down memory lane. A  must play IMO as it does give perspective of a different protagonist and does wrap up their path until the events of HL2!\n\nI believe a remake for Blue-Shift is still in the works (hopefully comparable to Black mesa remake!) so watch this space.\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1657084851,"timestamp_updated":1657084851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.658039748668670654","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118303640","author":{"steamid":"76561198157788484","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":119,"last_played":1650223036},"language":"english","review":"Otis is the only good thing about this game","timestamp_created":1657083881,"timestamp_updated":1657083881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118300813","author":{"steamid":"76561198272312996","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":190,"playtime_forever":231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54,"last_played":1657139056},"language":"russian","review":"Хоть и короткое дополнение, но приятно рекомендую!","timestamp_created":1657079396,"timestamp_updated":1657079396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118294388","author":{"steamid":"76561199011707525","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":244,"last_played":1657069078},"language":"english","review":"Boring, doesn't feel like a Half-life game.

SI DESEA DEJAR ALGUNA SUGERENCIA PARA AYUDARME A SEGUIR MEJORANDO O SOLO PARA INFORMAR SOBRE ALGÚN ERROR O CUALQUIER  OTRA COSA, POR FAVOR SE AMABLE Y RESPETE LO QUE PONE A CONTINUACIÓN.\n\nSIN NADA MÁS QUE AÑADIR, DISFRUTA DE LA REVIEW:\n\n\n\nHalf-Life: Blue Shift es la segunda expansión oficial de la ya mencionada obra maestra que, haciendo uso de la misma fórmula que hizo genial al juego original y a la primera expansión, presenta una nueva aventura y protagonista.\n\n“PARECE QUE HOY VA A SER UN DÍA LARGO. ¡HASTA LUEGO CALHOUN!” GUARDIA ANÓNIMO DE BLACK MESA\n\n\n\nAl igual que en las anteriores aventuras, el punto más destacable es la historia. Nos ponemos en la piel de Barney Calhoun, uno de los tantos guardias de seguridad de las instalaciones que, como bien quedaría visto en el entrenamiento, previamente realizado, se dispone a realizar uno de los trabajos más aburridos y monótonos, sumado a las constantes quejas de los científicos. Lo que Calhoun desconoce es que su trabajo va a comenzar a tener una mayor relevancia cuando unos seres de otra dimensión entran en la nuestra, al mismo tiempo que los militares, conscientes de lo que está sucediendo, se disponen a llevar a cabo su misión: acabar con toda evidencia de lo sucedido.\nNuestra misión es, ahora sí que sí, ponernos en la piel de un guardia de seguridad y llevar a cabo su trabajo.\n\nEl título, como se puede demostrar presenta una nueva historia que, al igual que la anterior, en algunos tramos coincide con la trama de Half-Life. Sin pretender aburriros (como puede llegar a ser este juego para algunos), el producto podría denominarse en pocas palabras como un “mas de lo mismo”. Más aún, utiliza las mismas características que en los títulos anteriores: el protagonista, por conveniencia del guion, es el único que sobrevive a la catástrofe y el que tiene la oportunidad para escapar de Black Mesa.\n\n*NOTA: aquí me gustaría hacer énfasis en un detalle relevante. En Half-Life, Freeman era uno de los pocos que sobrevive al incidente, convirtiéndose al final en el único superviviente (centrándome exclusivamente en esta primera parte). En Half-Life esto le da un mayor protagonismo a Freeman e importancia, ya que es el único que logra hacer lo que ningún otro pudo hacer. Y este protagonismo se ve robada por otros personajes pertenecientes a estas aventuras, que también logran sobrevivir. Con esto no me mantengo en contra de las expansiones, pero, de esta manera el juego es predecible y no muestra nada nuevo que capte el interés del jugador.\n\nOtras características similares es la monotonía y la repetición de dirigirse de un lugar a otro; las armas, los enemigos y los personajes son los mismos (sin ningún intento por parte de GEARBOX de recuperar esos aspectos o de crear unos nuevos); el apartado gráfico es el mismo sin ninguna mejora aparente y, como no podía faltar, volvemos a XEN.\nLos dos únicos aspectos destacables y diferentes es la música que (sí que puede ser repetitiva en algunos casos) continúa siendo magnífica y grata; por supuesto, los diálogos han mejorado con respecto a los títulos anteriores.\n\n\n\n\nEn resumen, puede que haya desvelado demasiados aspectos de la trama que la hacen predecible, y soy consciente que no debería haberlo hecho, no obstante, veo la necesidad de advertir a los jugadores que se interesen por esta expansión.\nQuizá el análisis sea muy perezoso, simple y negativo, aunque se debe a que no nos encontramos nada nuevo.\nTampoco Blue Shift es malo, incluso le voy a dar un “RECOMENDADO” por respeto a lo que significa esta IP para muchas personas que disfrutan de los títulos de Valve sin embargo, no se lo recomendaría a ninguno que no sea seguidor de esta saga y que no quiera sumergirse mucho más en la historia. Dicho esto, me costará hacer una opinión de la siguiente expansión.","timestamp_created":1656863890,"timestamp_updated":1656864397,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118137165","author":{"steamid":"76561198408059323","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":443,"last_played":1656787685},"language":"english","review":"I like thrilling side stories that take place in the same time of the events of the main story, and this game nailed this concept idea\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1656862581,"timestamp_updated":1656862581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118127095","author":{"steamid":"76561199261660014","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":405,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":405,"last_played":1656464502},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life: Blue Shift is an expansion pack for the FPS video game Half-Life.

recommend playing Half Life first before this since Half Life: Blue Shift is more of a standalone DLC that further supports the story of Half Life as you assume the position as one of the security guards at the Black Mesa Research Facility. If you have played Half Life then expect the same experience with some more interactable puzzles and shootouts. The overall experience is short and sweet so that it does not overstay its welcome.\n\nMinor spoilers detailing the actions the Player (Barney Calhoun) takes on his journey:\n[spoiler] I would only say there is a minor discrepancy in the description for this game and what actually transpires in it. It claims that Calhoun has helped Gordon out of \"so many sticky situations\" but as the Player I felt like I have missed something. During my playthrough I felt like I only spied on Gordon during recognizable moments that happened in the Main Game rather than help him. Although I did appreciate how they managed to tie it all in to really make you feel like you are progressing alongside Gordon and to see how far he has gotten in his story compared to Calhoun's story. Perhaps the in-store description is referring to past events between Gordon and Calhoun which would explain Gordon's innate skills with firearms as he could of had training from his old friend Calhoun.
