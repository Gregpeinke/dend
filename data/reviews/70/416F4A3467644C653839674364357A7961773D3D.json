It hasn't aged well, I'm trying to say. And I have plenty of reasons why.\n\n[b]-LEVEL DESIGN-[/b]\nAtmospherically, Half-Life 1 is amazing. Really. The idea of a scientific complex falling into chaos all around you as you desperately try to escape is executed really well, and it's one of the most atmospheric games of its time.\nThat's where my positive points end. In terms of level design itself, Half-Life 1 is bad. Really bad. There's no map system which is inexcusable in a game so labryinthine. On top of that, a lot of the levels can get cryptic and annoying, some are nearly impossible if you don't have enough health. Like the dam in Surface Tension, where you have to dodge both a fish monster and helicoptor fire while also standing in place opening a valve for just long enough to start drowning. I've hit roadblocks throughout the whole game, barely going 15 minutes without hitting a dead end and being stuck for twice that time. At least, that's my experience.\nBlack Mesa does everything so much better. It's really the best version of HL1. If you want a better experience with this game, go get that. Who cares about Xen?\n\n[b]-Gameplay-[/b]\nHalf-Life's actual gameplay is its strong point. It has lots of unique weapons, all of which are really fun to use. Like, really. There are a LOT of weapons. They're all really cool. Other than that, it's okay. I really don't think I have to describe HALF-LIFE'S gameplay to you. [spoiler]Especially considering you most likely filtered reviews to \"Negative\" looking for something to be mad about.[/spoiler] But I do like the gameplay. However, as the levels went on, I started noticing a trend in my playstyle. I would just run past all the enemies, speedrunner-style. I don't really know why. Maybe it was the level design making fights unrewarding. Maybe I just wanted to beat the game to get it over with. But the most likely conclusion is that fighting enemies in HL1 is very unrewarding. In most cases you end up taking more damage by fighting than if you just dash through the area. And as mentioned, the level design doesn't help either. Nearly every enemy uses hitscan and sometimes you're pitted up against nearly 8 of them at once in a singe room.\n\n[b]-Rapid-fire of the smaller bits-[/b]\n[b]Music:[/b] The game uses music very sparingly. If there's a song, it'll only play once at a key point of the game. So most of the game is quite silent. That's okay, I guess. I don't like silent games, but It's just an excuse to use my own music. The songs it does play are pretty good, though.\n[b]Story:[/b] Easily the best part of the game. I already mentioned how much I like the atmosphere, but the story is pretty good. That's all I'll say.\n[b]Is it fun?:[/b] Kinda. Things go pretty well until you hit a killjoy roadblock. Something I really like about the game, though, is how small the hitboxes on projectiles are. You can hit someone through the tiniest crack in a wall with a crossbow without the bolt stopping in mid-air on the surrounding walls. If you can see the enemy, you can hit them. Can that be said for many other games? Refer to Level Design for my thoughts on the killjoys.\n\n[b]-Overall-[/b]\nLook, I get it. Half-Life 1 is a decent game. But it's not a masterpiece. It has a lot of flaws, and I generally didn't enjoy playing this. I really want to like the game, because it's HALF-LIFE. But too much of the game design frustrated me to the point of never wanting to play it again. I did beat the game. But it felt like a chore more than anything. I didn't enjoy Xen at all. Who does? Really though, if you want to play through the best version of Half-Life, go get Black Mesa. It fixes EVERYTHING this game does wrong, and improves on it. If you want a better first-party Half-Life experience, get HL2. It's way more fun in every way and has its own unique set of weapons.\nOverall, Half-Life 1: Good gameplay, ruined by awful level design. That being said though, it is quite moddable. Give the community creations a shot sometime, and you may like it better.

Bugs \n a. sometimes when in a vent and entering a new cell, you'll get stuck in the floor and be forced to reload, \n b. If you activate a valve but you are on the side, next to the wall then you get stuck, sometimes re-activating the valve fixes this, sometimes it doesn't\n\n2. Character speed, to start off I am not good at platforming and the game has multiple platforming areas, but the character is ALWAYS sprinting and you have to shift to walk.  This is extremely annoying when you are trying to jump onto a small space and you correct only to be launched off because Gordon is a sprint first walk later kind of guy.  They fixed this in HL2 but be prepared to have to retry puzzels multiple times.\n\nBesides this fun game, though HL2 is much better, still fun and worth the money.","timestamp_created":1482467814,"timestamp_updated":1482467880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28546218","author":{"steamid":"76561198197481558","num_games_owned":573,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":132,"last_played":1472605393},"language":"english","review":"Nice game still holds up even today for story","timestamp_created":1482461578,"timestamp_updated":1482461578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28544767","author":{"steamid":"76561198352056987","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1584301823},"language":"italian","review":"L'avevo completato da bambino e ora grazie a steam ho avuto la possibilità di rifare questa meraviglia di gioco...praticamente me lo sono mangiato, contando che l'ho appena finito e l'ho acquistato 2 giorni fa.

Absolutely. It's a great game. And yes, maybe it's graphics have aged a bit, but then so has System Shock's.

They might be aged like the graphics but they still got it.\n-Takes the silent protagonist to a whole new level. You'll really feel like you are Gordon Freeman - even if you're a bit mute.\n-The game has some choices that actually give you different endings for a little variety (not that they carry over to other games).\n-Despite being a FPS/Survival type game, Half-Life has a good story that is felt consistently throughout the game.\n-Balanced gameplay and various difficulties for those of varying confidence.\n-Unique enemies and weapons.\n\nCons\n-The graphics and sound might not always age well, but this is easily countered by nostalgia.\n-Though you can go about your journey in varying ways, it is, to an extent, very linear with little real choices. So if branching, choice-driven storylines are your thing, then this is a con. If not, ignore this.\n\nSo that's it from me. Not much I can say wrong about this game. And in my opinion, the cons were a bit of a stretch. So what are you waiting for? Get the game! Or wait for a sale...THEN get the game!\n\nJust don't hold your breath for Half Life 3.","timestamp_created":1482212166,"timestamp_updated":1659328714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47999998927116394","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28479215","author":{"steamid":"76561198297243509","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":619,"playtime_at_review":557,"last_played":1660532597},"language":"english","review":"Its a amazing game its was valves first game with out this game steam probouly woudnt exeast  the story is realy good.
