2 is a really fun game,especially with a friend.I was suprised by how the game is still holding up to today's graphics(at least from my point of view) and how well made and stractured it is as a whole,it has it's own artistic style which i adored and was also unbelievably funny.As for the story i thought you would be doing generic puzzle stuff however i was deeply mistaken,it combines a good story while also letting you be creative and the feeling you get after completing a level(chamber) is a  reward in itself.\nOverall , portal 2 is a must buy if you want to play something with a friend

As you can clearly see I am recommending it so it is a good game in my eyes and the product is worth the sale price (not full price though). I'd rate it 7/10. Shocked? Yeah, I know. If you're tired of reading the 'best game ever' and 'will completely blow your mind' review, then read on.. \n\n[NOTE: It's a 2011 game and rightfully will not be judged by 2020 standards just because I am playing it a decade later. Fair is fair]\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n\n1. Very good graphics for its time. No support for deeper options like AO, SGSSAA though. I personally used the Nvidia profile inspector to force OGSSAA. Looks quite good compared to Mass Effect 2, Skyrim and Witcher 2. \n\n2. The gameplay is undoubtedly the most unique and memorable of any FPSs (can it even be called that?) that I have ever played. A shooter(?) game with a non-lethal and unswappable gun while intuitive puzzle solving must have surely been the ground-breaker in 2011. \n\n3. Wonderful level design and world elements. very atmospheric and honestly those turrents asking \"are you still there?\" in that baby-ish girl-ish robotic voice is damn damn creepy. Whoever came up with that idea must be a (sick) genius. Still gives me the nightmares sometimes.\n\n[h2]CONS:[/h2]\n\n1. Piss poor excuse for a story. Most of the people I see playing this are playing P2 for the first time and haven't played P1. P1 didn't have that much of a story since it was quite short and was obviously an experimental game meant to judge how the gaming population picks up on this novelty. And I was honestly blown away by P1. Considering P2 came 4 years later, I obviously expected more story, more characters and more actual deep interaction. Boy was I wrong. (more on this at the bottom in the 'SPOILERS' section)\n\n2. Wheatly, the annoying-but-comic relief is much more annoying than comic and in the latter half of the game manages to only retain the annoying part. It tries to be a british(or australian maybe? Not that good with accents) version of CL4TP or Claptrap as we know him, from Borderlands series. Claptrap is very well written and even his annoyance is funny and entertaining while wheatly seems forced, rushed and repetitive.\n\n3. No FOV slider. Seriously? In a game where you have to be quite aware of your surroundings, it's very important that I am able to adjust my Field of View to suit my viewing angle. Yeah I know I can use the console, but so can I for key bindings. Will you remove that as well? This is even worse considering entire HL2 triology had adjustable FOV slider since 7 years ago.\n\n4. No new characters? Cool, so you killed the 'bad robot' in Portal 1 and are now awake after god knows how many years or decades or centuries? Guess again (more on this in the SPOILERS section)\n\n5. Last but not the least, this was my own personal expectation but I thought some puzzles could be co-op in single player. As in a more complex puzzle where the NPC solves a part and you solve a part instead of you solving the whole. Maybe add a timing clause to ramp up the difficulty a bit. Prince of Persia Two Thrones had this where Farah and the Prince occasionally co-op solve puzzles. Maybe it happens once or twice in Tomb Raider: Anniversary too.\n\n[h3]SPOILERS[/h3]\n\nBasically the entire game felt like an expansion pack/soft reboot for Portal 1 instead of a whole new game or a proper sequel. You introduce a comic relief (ughh) as a friend who then turns on you (who would've guessed, right? such innovation) after you defeat the enemy that you already \"killed\" in the first game who now turns and becomes your friend (ughhhhhh). If you wanted me to solves puzzles and clear room by room, should have skipped all the annoying dialogue and cut-scenes and told me so from the get go (Tomb Raider: Legend pulled this off marvellously). The softlocks where you had to sit for minutes to hear them incessantly babble were the bane of my existence. \n\n[b]TLDR:[/b] Overall, if this is your first portal game, or first game with any 'story' ever, then you're gonna like it. If you play story driven games and have finished portal 2, any part where you're not thinking hard to solve the puzzle is gonna be extremely boring. The gameplay and the world design are the only 2 things this game has to offer.
