You should consider playing the whole Half-Life franchise before, you grow up.\n\n As you're playing you'll realize how open and wide the environment is while still having a clear idea or path of what you should do (in the game) without indicators like a mini-map with indicators or anything like that, It is fairly straightforward and simple what you should do and where you should go, etc etc, As well as the more you immerse yourself basically all the early VALVE games the more you realize literally so many other game industries have \"copied\" (got inspired by valve games) half-life 1 - 4 has the same vibe as games we have now but they feel original the feel raw and basic yet so empowering \n\n-Portal 1,2\n-half-life 1\n-half-life blue shift          (we don't mention the green one) [we don't talk about that]\n-half-life 2 and other episodes \n-Left 4 dead 1,2\n-Counter strike franchise \n-Gary's mod\n-TF2\n\n\nThese games all hit hard and have so much orgasmic wholesomeness to them, They all possess mostly the same vibe in gaming although each game has its special feeling, Portal being Eire and lonely making you strive on completing objectives with music and sounds that fit your situation with amazing writing and storytelling with a deep thought of lore, half-life being completely original and deep lore that ties with portal making it way more diverse and incorporating rich gameplay and Puzzleish combat. They were one of the first games to introduce 3D zombie combat (mutant creatures) and a set goal (don't wanna spoil), And finally counter strike arguably the most famous shooter game there is, It has basically inspired counter-strike, valorant, and other games it was one of the first shooter games and a game that managed to incorporate strategy in-game vs other players it was originally a half-life 2 mod just like Garry's mod WHICH IS THE BEST SANDBOX GAME THERE IS gmod holds many precious memories of mine and I've had countless funny nights playing gmod with friends and having fun all around as well as having a wholesome community gmod is the best sandbox game period. Moving on to team fortress 1,2 Those games basically inspired Overwatch and valorant in terms of many features and genres as well as mechanics as you can see VALVE keeps coming up in every genre there is and having a big spot in each genre even serving as foundations in some genres like sandboxes and single-player storytelling.\n\nVALVE is great and their games are getting they never get old people have adored them for ages and sadly those days are coming to an end with the valve being relatively quiet and not living up to expectations on recent game \"innovations'. So I urge you to play and experience all the VALVE games, all of them.
