Just like any other Valve game, it plays the best on computer. Unfortunately I was in middle school when it came out and didn't have the money for a machine capable to play this game. I played it first in 2007 as a part of the Orange Box. Finally satisfied, I can say that I liked it a lot. It proably wasn't as amaze-balls as it would have been in 2004, but the graphics hold up very well considering. Bottom line is Halflife 2 is a classic and if you have Steam, it should be in your library.","timestamp_created":1426866898,"timestamp_updated":1426866898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxaD5m8wCerWPOQ=="}
