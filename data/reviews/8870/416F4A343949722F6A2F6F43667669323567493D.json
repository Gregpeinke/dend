I do like the boss, but the thing is dislike is how they only appear like around thrice the entire playthrough.\n-Third is the heater gun, either i missed something or some part, i didn't see a proper introduction of the weapon until i randomly came across it almost at the end of the game.\n-Lastly, the gears.

Though some design choices such as only allowing two guns to be held at any given time and slow inventory management seemed obscene to me, especially in a game that's based on high-octane action such as this. Nevertheless, I'd definitely recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1624041884,"timestamp_updated":1624041884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93965487","author":{"steamid":"76561198157417719","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":264,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1624053355},"language":"english","review":".,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999.\n","timestamp_created":1624041612,"timestamp_updated":1624041612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93964620","author":{"steamid":"76561198002188971","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":858,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":858,"last_played":1419912778},"language":"english","review":"Graphics still hold up to this day very nice game","timestamp_created":1624040387,"timestamp_updated":1624040387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93964422","author":{"steamid":"76561198060009725","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":602,"last_played":1624036186},"language":"french","review":"Gameplay may be boring after playing it several hours in a row, but the caracters and story really be worth the try.
