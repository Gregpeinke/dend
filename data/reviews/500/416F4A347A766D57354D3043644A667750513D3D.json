The game uses Valve's well known Source engine, released in 2008.  \n\nThe game is set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, you take control of one of four protagonists, which will be known as the \"Survivors\". They will be pitted against hordes of infected zombies in four different game modes, a single player mode which the three other characters are controlled by the AI. A co-op campaign mode,  an online versus mode and a four player survival mode. \n\nthe game play focuses mainly on cooperation and working as a team. You will see all the regular features included in other FPS games, such as outlined teammates throughout the world, so you know where they are all the time. A cool feature which I found to be a nice surprise was if a member of your team were to fall off a ledge, they won't automatically plunge to their death, they will manage to hold onto the ledge and the other team members may go and \"Help them up\" much like you would do if you were healing them. \n\nThe campaign mode has six levels, each containing anywhere between three and five individual chapters in them. Each of the chapters takes place in a set environment which allows the player to explore around to find little Easter eggs, pick ups - such as medi-packs, pain pills,  weapons and ammo. These points are supposedly randomly generated so each time you play, they will be scattered around in different spots. There are tons of rooms, tunnels and buildings to explore on every level, and there is no time limit either so you can roam around to your hearts content, provided you don't mind the odd zombie jumping out of the closet to try and eat your brains every now and again. \n\nEach of the Survivors are individually voice acted very well; and you can communicate with your team using quick menus. Some voice commands will sound off automatically such as when you are reloading, you'll let the rest of your team know so they can cover you. This to me was a small addition but added to the realism of the game. \n\nThroughout the game you will encounter a number of different zombies which have their own special attack or mutation, such as The Boomer, which is a bloated zombie that will spit bile onto the Survivors which attracts other zombies to your location. This again adds a lot of variety to the game so you don't feel as if you are just mowing through hoards of regular zombies all the time. \n\nThe graphics, while are running on an engine which is a number of years old now, still look awesome, and games today sometimes struggle to present them selves as well as Left 4 Dead. Even with settings right the way down on low, it still looks impressive - meaning any rig or potato will be able to run this. \n\nI played the single player campaign on normal mode; while I had no real issues finishing the game, apart from the last level, I still was satisfied with the level of challenge which was on offer, I can imagine the hard and advanced levels will be completely mind fumblingly hard though. I tried to play the campaign mode online, but sadly there weren't many games available at the time, but it is something I really want to try just to experience the co-op side of things on this game. \n\nPretty much every one owns Left 4 Dead already, and most will have probably already played it; but I really suggest people that haven't played it or at least purchased it but not tried it to play. You will not be disappointed and this is one of the classics of our generation that you need to experience. \n\nP.S - if anyone would like to have a play through the campaign with me, please add me or hit me up as I would welcome any opportunity to give it ago! \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

4 Dead is one of the most enjoyable co-op experiences out there. I emphasize \"co-op\" because that is where the game shines. Single player is alright by yourself and the AI is pretty good, but it just isn't well... as fun alone. You slog through, basically doing most of the shooting and not really experiencing what this game does best which is team work. Not to say that single player is bad, because its not. In fact, it can be quite fun, but it can easily feel mundane if that is all someone does. But when you get a couple of friends and play the game, it is simply one of the best gaming experiences out there. If you enjoy zombie games, this is a must purchase. If you are looking for a good co-op game, you should buy this game. If you are looking for a good single player experience, I wouldn't say an absolute no, but it will get boring quickly.","timestamp_created":1433787786,"timestamp_updated":1433787786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16253306","author":{"steamid":"76561198031262746","num_games_owned":265,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":350,"last_played":1431073935},"language":"tchinese","review":"充滿喪屍卻無恐懼感、滿屏游戲性而無游戲性。","timestamp_created":1433731408,"timestamp_updated":1433731408,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483028709888458252","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16220532","author":{"steamid":"76561197970682391","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":23003,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23003,"last_played":1410080702},"language":"english","review":"One of the best coop games out there","timestamp_created":1433585569,"timestamp_updated":1433585569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zvmW5M0CdJfwPQ=="}
