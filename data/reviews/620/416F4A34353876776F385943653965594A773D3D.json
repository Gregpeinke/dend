Portal 2 is a great buy. The campaign is great, it uses a combination of humor, and seriousness to bring the Plot together. Using quick thinking, and problem solving you (as the main character) have to solve a series of complex puzzles, to complete each \"test\". If/ when the Campaign get's boring there is always the \"Player Made\" courses that you can play on. Not intrested in that? Well Portal 2 also has a fun Co-Op mode that is great to play with you and a friend. Something about solving a puzzle using team work has always been something that I have been intrested in, while I game. I highly recommend purchasing this game if you haven't already!","timestamp_created":1401476943,"timestamp_updated":1401476943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10287920","author":{"steamid":"76561198109678785","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3841,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2403,"last_played":1505593596},"language":"german","review":"Einer der besten Denk- und Rätselspielen die ich je gezockt habe und ich freu mich schon auf Portal 3 :)","timestamp_created":1401468598,"timestamp_updated":1401468598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10287852","author":{"steamid":"76561198119715286","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":876,"last_played":1401590718},"language":"english","review":"If you are on the fence about buying this game, buy it. it is one the best games out there","timestamp_created":1401468280,"timestamp_updated":1401468280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10287260","author":{"steamid":"76561198099249961","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":466,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1453080902},"language":"russian","review":"Игра хорошая и очень даже ничего.Но одному немного скучновато.Так как охото больше побегать и подурачиться,что в одиночку не очень получается.","timestamp_created":1401464605,"timestamp_updated":1401464605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10286565","author":{"steamid":"76561198064026836","num_games_owned":289,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":357,"last_played":1656154579},"language":"english","review":"I'd recommend this game to anyone I meet.\nIt's a very very good sequel to Portal 1, which is also known as 'Portal', the first version of the game.\n\nYou guys should definitely play this game, it has new functions, of course, and also new characters!, Well but thats obvious.\nBut mainly, this game has such good graphics, a good storyline, functions with your controllers, and it has a coop mode aswell.\nAnd the only downside for me is, that it takes about 11.9 GB of RAM Space in your Laptops/PC or Mac, but meh.\n\nIn Portal 2, you can download custom maps STRAIGHT from the game itself, unlike Portal, where you have to move the .bsp file to the folder that contains it.\n\nIt also has custom coop maps that you can download, so you don't get bored to death playing the orginal ones over and over and over.\n\n*SPOILER ALERT*\nIt also has a few easter eggs :DDDDD WHICH IS AWESOME!!!\n\n*NO MORE SPOLERS :PPP*\nPortal 2 is mainly about the history of Aperture Science, relating how the robot GLaDOS got all out of control.\nSo, if you are interested on what the history of Aperture Science might be, download this game.\n\nAnd also if you want to have some 'fun' PLAY THIS GAME NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW!!!!
