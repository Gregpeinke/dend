It is wonky here and there due to Goldsrc not having the same power as today's engines (etc. No physics) and the enemy AI, but also the friendly, can be stupid (Friendly AI going straight to your trip mines).

Force is basically the original Half-Life in a more compact form.\nThe kicker is that you play as the 'bad guys' from the original, the HECU Marines.\n\nYou take control of Corporal Adrian Shephard, a 22 year old Marine sent headfirst into the aftermath of the Black Mesa incident. Fighting creatures from Xen, Black ops, and a new species known as Race X, OpFor details the journey of survival taken by Shephard trying to survive in a 'hazardous environment'\n\nYou gain access to a number of new weapons like the wrench, sniper rifle, and M249 machine gun as well as a number of other cool toys. Adrian's arsenal also shares some similarities to Gordon's with returning favourites such as the SPAS-12 and the Glock.\n\nOpposing Force is short but sweet, and a definite must play for fans of Half-Life or fans of FPS games in general.\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1614753165,"timestamp_updated":1614753689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87763320","author":{"steamid":"76561198883647464","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":416,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1633908251},"language":"english","review":"REALLY GREAT EXTESION PACK FOR HALF LIFE the ai seemed about wonkey but i loved this game","timestamp_created":1614746790,"timestamp_updated":1614746790,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87761941","author":{"steamid":"76561197976593553","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":209,"last_played":1658450002},"language":"english","review":"When the Force is Opposing.","timestamp_created":1614744028,"timestamp_updated":1614744028,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87759601","author":{"steamid":"76561199023829606","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":531,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1636357068},"language":"english","review":"a classic i played this when i was just a kid nostalgic forsure","timestamp_created":1614739493,"timestamp_updated":1614739493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87757037","author":{"steamid":"76561198954009460","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":463,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":463,"last_played":1608810521},"language":"english","review":"Short but a must play","timestamp_created":1614734595,"timestamp_updated":1614734595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87755747","author":{"steamid":"76561199042079534","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1721,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":354,"last_played":1652148095},"language":"english","review":"sick","timestamp_created":1614732128,"timestamp_updated":1625432458,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87752371","author":{"steamid":"76561198972437240","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":366,"last_played":1629081737},"language":"brazilian","review":"Assim que nem o Half Life original, esse é focado em coisas militares. num só isso, mas ele tem uma história boa. começando na base onde iremos enfrentar os aliens com armas diferentes, e terminando numa batalha entre o monstro do tempo. onde ele sai de um portal e o bixo pega, teremos que usar os lasers pra matar o monstro. matando ele o jogo termina.\n\npretendo pegar o half life blue shift pra conhecer melhor, já que, é a sequência do opposing force.\n\n\n~ seu amiguinho, Super.","timestamp_created":1614725877,"timestamp_updated":1614725877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87743610","author":{"steamid":"76561199124521225","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":364,"last_played":1614712914},"language":"english","review":"I found myself to be skipping online school just to continue this massively enthralling add on to half life.

Gespielt wird wieder in der Black Mesa Research Facility. \nDu schlüpfst in die Rolle von Corporal Adrian Shephard, ein Teamführer der US Marines. Und das ist echt gut gelungen. \n\nDer Name Opposing Force ist eine Anspielung auf ein physikalisches Phänomen. Opposing Force spielt dabei auf das dritte Newtonsche Gesetz an, wo die entgegengerichtete Kraft im Englischen „Opposing Force“ genannt wird.\nAber das nur so am Rande als Hintergrundwissen.\n\nDas Spiel beinhaltet neue taktische Möglichkeiten: So ist es jetzt möglich, an Seilen hochzuklettern oder sich von einem Seil zum nächsten zu schwingen. Zudem ist häufig die Zusammenarbeit mit anderen Soldaten notwendig, um z. B. einen gemeinsamen Angriff zu starten oder sich von einem Pionier eine verschlossene Tür aufschweißen zu lassen. Häufig findet man auch Sanitäter, die neben Unterstützung mit der Pistole auch Heilung von Wunden bieten.\n\nZudem gibt es auch neue Arten von außerirdischen Gegnern. Anders als bei Half-Life selbst, wurden die menschlichen Gegner in der deutschen Version diesmal nicht durch Roboter ersetzt.\n\nDas Spiel setzt nicht die Handlung fort, sondern sie verläuft parallel zu den Ereignissen von Half-Life. Während Gordon Freeman durch Black Mesa eilt, wirst du als Shephard mit einem Team dorthin geschickt, um den Wissenschaftler auszuschalten. Die Transportmaschine wird jedoch beschossen und stürzt ab. Du mußt dich alleine durch Black Mesa schlagen, wobei dich nicht nur außerirdische Wesen aufhalten, sondern auch die Black Ops. Diese wurden geschickt, um nicht nur die Vorgänge in Black Mesa zu vertuschen, sondern auch die Marines auszuschalten, die daran beteiligt waren.\n\nDu kehrst als Militärspezialist zur Black Mesa Research Facility zurück. Dein Auftrag: Gordon Freeman zu eliminieren. \n... nö, weiter erzähle ich nicht.\nAlso mach dich auf und finde selbst heraus was da los ist.\nGenial gemachtes sehr witziges FPS, mit Tiefgang. \n \nMeine Gruppe und mein Archiv mit über 2.750 Reviews hier:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/hoi4deu\nIch habe etliches Recherchiert*.\n\n👑 Powered by HoI 4 Deu  Kuratorengruppe auf deutsch/englisch 👑\n⠀⠀⠀🎉 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30388691/]\n Folgen [/url] \nund mehr Reviews von mir entdecken 🎊\n\n\n[h1] Half-Life: Opposing Force [/h1]\n* SciFi Action from 1999.\n\nOriginally an add-on to Half-Life, it is now a standalone game. Again, the game is played in the Black Mesa Research Facility.\nYou take on the role of Corporal Adrian Shephard, a team leader in the US Marines. And that worked out really well.\n\nThe name opposing force is an allusion to a physical phenomenon. Opposing force alludes to Newton's third law, where the opposing force is called \"opposing force\" in English.\nBut only as a side note as background knowledge.\n\nThe game includes new tactical options: It is now possible to climb up ropes or swing from one rope to the next. In addition, cooperation with other soldiers is often necessary in order to e.g. B. to launch a joint attack or to have a pioneer weld a locked door open. Often one can also find paramedics who offer not only support with the pistol but also healing of wounds.\n\nThere are also new types of alien enemies. In contrast to Half-Life itself, this time the human opponents were not replaced by robots in the German version.\n\nThe game does not continue the storyline, but rather runs parallel to the events of Half-Life. While Gordon Freeman rushes through Black Mesa, you are sent there as Shephard with a team to take down the scientist. However, the transport machine is shot at and crashes. You have to fight your way alone through Black Mesa, where you are not only stopped by extraterrestrial beings, but also by the Black Ops. These were sent to not only cover up what was going on at Black Mesa, but also to take out the Marines who were involved.\n\nYou return to the Black Mesa Research Facility as a military specialist. Your mission: to eliminate Gordon Freeman.\n... nope, I won't tell any further.\nSo get up and find out for yourself what's going on.\nIngeniously made, very funny FPS, with depth.\n \nMy group and my archive with over 2,750 reviews here:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/hoi4deu\nI did a lot of research *.\n\n👑 Powered by HoI 4 Deu Curators group in German / English 👑\n⠀⠀⠀🎉 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30388691/] \nFollow [/url] \nand discover more reviews from me 🎊\n","timestamp_created":1614417454,"timestamp_updated":1614417454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":35,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.806265115737915039","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87520833","author":{"steamid":"76561198071133240","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":394,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1614412301},"language":"english","review":"If you liked Half-Life or Black Mesa Source you're gonna like this, this expansion adds upon the original with a new perspective, new weapons, a long campaign, and new bits of lore surrounding the Black mesa Incident.","timestamp_created":1614402871,"timestamp_updated":1614402871,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87497296","author":{"steamid":"76561198071829990","num_games_owned":458,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1614447131},"language":"russian","review":"Классика","timestamp_created":1614368210,"timestamp_updated":1614368210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87495738","author":{"steamid":"76561198958930177","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":783,"last_played":1657833658},"language":"english","review":"you dont just play as god you play as the person you send to FUCKING KILL GOD","timestamp_created":1614366273,"timestamp_updated":1614366273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566618859767913818","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87478484","author":{"steamid":"76561198184133171","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":991,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":319,"last_played":1654358737},"language":"russian","review":"nice\n","timestamp_created":1614346771,"timestamp_updated":1649318695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87463993","author":{"steamid":"76561199108533093","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":260,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":129,"last_played":1656467829},"language":"english","review":"This game makes you think alot different about the HECU, aka the guys that go shooting at you because you saw the xen, or the aliens.

Единственная проблема, с которой вы можете столкнуться - это проблема с мышкой, в частности, Вы не сможете двигать камерой, но это решается очень просто: либо найти специальное руководство по этому поводу, либо включить в настройках мыши \"Raw Mouse Input\". В целом, игра 9/10.","timestamp_created":1614196422,"timestamp_updated":1614196422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518813073635101318","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87364464","author":{"steamid":"76561198379101167","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":428,"last_played":1613875500},"language":"english","review":"i put my hand inside a barnacle's anus.","timestamp_created":1614187961,"timestamp_updated":1614187961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87353333","author":{"steamid":"76561199127495609","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1614192863},"language":"spanish","review":":)\n","timestamp_created":1614175551,"timestamp_updated":1614175551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87340046","author":{"steamid":"76561198802394003","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":491,"last_played":1659747462},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1614157735,"timestamp_updated":1614157735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87337081","author":{"steamid":"76561198987043953","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":397,"last_played":1611056792},"language":"turkish","review":"..","timestamp_created":1614153320,"timestamp_updated":1625825761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5KDC6fcCeYeVzQI="}
