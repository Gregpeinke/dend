It has guns, it has cool hand powers, it's in a fancy city where cities shouldn't be, and that's where the similarities end. Not that that's a bad thing. Infinite is a narrative game with its own style and universe, and it does it really damn well. The story of this game is certainly a handful, but it's genuinely fascinating, especially when you start to realize how the game spends its entire 10-hour playtime building it from the ground up. Also the graphics are great, even by today's standards. It's a storytelling masterpiece in game form, and y'know, the gameplay isn't half bad either.","timestamp_created":1591944898,"timestamp_updated":1591944898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70662136","author":{"steamid":"76561198862561334","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2231,"last_played":1610104725},"language":"russian","review":"Очень советую поиграть в эту игру, т.к. она является почти что идеалом фантастической игры. Особенно при учете того, что графика там является очень красивой при не очень высоких системных требованиях. Как и в первых двух частях, в игре используется излюбленный прием фантастов - анти-утопия. Однако тут фантастический мир игры выведен на принципиально новый уровень, т.к. он является смесью стим-панка и технологий далекого будущего, таких как квантовая механика и теория мультивселенной. Игра еще из до SJW-шной эпохи, так что главные герои являются своеобразными собирательными образами людей, в которых очень легко влюбится. Так например Лиза является комсомолкой, спортсменкой и просто красавицей. Умела бы еще стрелять, нам бы в этой игре вообще бы нечего было делать. Жаль только тяжесть событий ее сломила и в итоге она почувствовала себя виноватой в том, что произошло, а потому зациклилась на необходимости искупления, хотя по факту произошедшее было лишь одним из бесконечного множества вариантов развития событий и ее вины в этом не было. А потому она фактически повторила судьбу отца. С той только разницей, что она не была эгоистична и пожертвовала собой ради запуска цепочки событий первых частей игры. Но не факт, что этот прекрасный персонаж был слит чисто ради связи сюжета игры с первыми частями. Концовка игры в некотором смысла оставлена открытой. Так то может она еще вернется в будущем.","timestamp_created":1591943043,"timestamp_updated":1591944533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70659875","author":{"steamid":"76561198196998482","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1158,"last_played":1586904449},"language":"english","review":"This is a fun game.

Les phases de combats sont nerveuses et offres de multiples possibilités en termes de tactiques grâces aux toniques (qui remplacent les plasmides) et le crochet qui vous permet d'utiliser les lignes des frets aériens en montagnes russes et de pouvoir attaquer vos ennemis d'une nouvelle manière.\n\nLes armes sont toutes agréables à utiliser et on ne manquera pas de toutes les utiliser pour le fun... même si personnellement, j'ai un attachement pour le fusil.\n\nEt Columbia ne manquera pas d'occasion de vous frayer un chemin à travers des ennemis en nombre, qui manquent parfois d'IA (J'apprécie toujours les ennemis qui attendent gentiment devant vous que vous tiriez dessus ^^) mais les boss qui parsèment l’histoire vous en donnerons pour votre argent et en mode difficile, vous aurez du challenge...\n\nLes graphismes, même avec l’âge, restent magnifiques et colorés et je suis personnellement toujours émerveillé par le souci du détail apporté par Irrational Games lorsque vous prenez le temps de « papillonner » entre deux séquences de fight.\n\nPour information, la voix française de Booker est celle de Guillaume Orsat (le doubleur de Brendan Fraser) et ça en jette… j’adore… mais cela ne veut pas dire que les autres doubleurs et doubleuses sont mauvais bien au contraire… \n\nVous l’aurez compris Bioshock Infinite en a toujours à montrer aussi bien sur le fond que sur la forme et même si je ne suis pas d’accord sur l’explication de fin, je ne peux que saluer le travail effectué…\n\nIl y a 3 dlc, « clash in the Clouds » est anecdotique et n’intéressera que ceux qui veulent débloquer des artworks et autres bonus… « Burial at Sea : episode 1 » nous renvoi à Rapture avec un autre Booker et une Elisabeth vengeresse… pauvre Booker elle lui en veut vraiment… Mais c’est la partie 2 de ce « Burial at Sea » qui est la plus riche en terme de narration et de nouveauté car vous êtes dans la peau d’Elisabeth et il n’est guère bienvenu de partir au front comme le faisait Booker. Non ici mieux vaut tout faire en silence en assommant ou en utilisant votre arbalète et ses fléchettes soporifiques… et prévoyez les mouchoirs au cas où… \n  \n","timestamp_created":1591790191,"timestamp_updated":1591790191,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532265603542327881","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70579758","author":{"steamid":"76561198971141957","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":594,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":594,"last_played":1591789712},"language":"tchinese","review":"第九艺术的巅峰之作，音乐，美术等做工均是顶级中的顶级。但是玩的时候气氛渲染的过于压抑，让人无法呼吸。结局令人致郁，有着一种深深的无力与宿命感。这游戏完全可以说是巧夺天工的艺术品，但你让我再次通一遍关，我是拒绝的。","timestamp_created":1591789970,"timestamp_updated":1591789970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543859660625457764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70579403","author":{"steamid":"76561198320510387","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":670,"last_played":1560176460},"language":"schinese","review":"伊丽莎白，她真可爱，她真迷人……她是男主的女儿_(:3」∠❀)_\n","timestamp_created":1591789294,"timestamp_updated":1591789294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70578291","author":{"steamid":"76561198239941436","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":685,"last_played":1591787101},"language":"russian","review":"Нихера не понял , но очень интересно","timestamp_created":1591787229,"timestamp_updated":1591787229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70576007","author":{"steamid":"76561198102489142","num_games_owned":265,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":619,"last_played":1591781106},"language":"schinese","review":"名副其实第九艺术典范。\n如果一开始我就知道永远都不能去巴黎，那么我永远都不会打断伊丽莎白在战舰港跳舞。","timestamp_created":1591782828,"timestamp_updated":1591782828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70573774","author":{"steamid":"76561198846532846","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":4954,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4954,"last_played":1587436933},"language":"russian","review":"Я больше никогда не вернусь в эту историю.

Здесь нет злодеев и героев, а сама история принимается настолько близко и приводит к такому катарсису, что второй раз я ее переживать не хочу, понадобилось почти 2 месяца, чтобы впечатления немного улеглись. Причем речь в данном случае о всей сюжетной линии с дополнениями. Колористика тоже на высоте, цвета и окружение идеально передают настроение в каждый момент сюжета. Единственный недостаток - несколько неудобная шутерная механика, но и она оставляет хорошее впечатление, благодаря своим особым фишкам.

Playing Bioshock infinite i was still getting the somewhat sickly taste of the game Dishonored out of my system as Dishonored, while being a good indie-type game, still felt more on the mundane side. And i rushed through it just looking to finish. The two games do share strong similarities in art style, and it took about 4 hours of playing Bioshock: Infinite before the game began to stand out as the superior of the two.\n\nInstead of losing steam, the story of Bioshock increases with interest and momentum, and the scenery and landscapes become more diverse and interesting. In the art department this game is a work of art, and with all of the color layout, and level/character design, this game truly stands as an artistic masterpiece. (even the actual paintings on the walls within the game itself are impressive)\n\nThe combat is good, though it is more of a run and gun shooter almost similar in style to unreal tournament in that there will be alot of running, jumping and gunning during combat. But it is certainly not on par tactically as far as Call of Duty or Ubisoft games, and does not try to be.\n\nThe looting system is excellent, this game makes you want to explore every nook and cranny, and make your way to hidden places where there is always a treasure awaiting, and with a great weapon/feats upgrade system, I found these features to enhance this game immensely.\n\nPlaying the burial at sea ad-dons is a must as you go from a sky city back to the underwater city of the first two games, and with the combination of the two, the overall experience goes from great to excellent, with an overall playtime of around 16 hours.\n\nDefinatley a top of the line gaming experience!\n\nPS: Will add that the mature gore system really adds a great finish to this kind of art style, and that this seemingly small thing helps the game stand out a superior game all the more.","timestamp_created":1591511855,"timestamp_updated":1591511855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+fXfxvICfNDTjAI="}
