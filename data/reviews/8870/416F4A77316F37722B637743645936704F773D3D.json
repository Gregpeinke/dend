So for starters lets talk about the look, Bioshock Infinite takes a different turn on the scene, changing from a under water city of mystery to an above the clouds cultist hevenish land of beauty. The game is a stunning pice of artwork, being able to run on most PC's. Now Story, Bioshock Infinite has a crazy turning and twisting moral/consept leaving you a bit puzzled in the end. The story makes you truly think, not just about the story really but of your own life and the choices you make. Really if you want a review that tells you the story you most likely be able to find one on here, but for me its to hard to recall. So overall BioShock Infinite is a stunning beauty and amazing well done story, also with very well done voice acting.

Estudio que no olvidemos tiene a sus espaldas clásicos como System Shock o Bioshock, gente con una capacidad innata para contar buenas historias y hacernos replantear nuestras convicciones políticas y religiosas. Esa clase de personas que son raras de encontrar y que convierten en magia todo lo que tocan.\n\nBioshock Infinite es una obra maestra del videojuego moderno, un claro exponente del potencial y la capacidad de creación de un grupo de artistas motivados y con talento. Tiene sus carencias, esas que se ven en las escenas de acción, en las que nos muestran un shooter genérico y con escasas innovaciones. Y ciertamente ahí terminan sus defectos, pues el resto del conjunto es soberbio, con una fuerza narrativa demoledora, unos personajes desbordantes de carisma, una ambientación perfecta y un apartado técnico impecable. Mención especial al diseño artístico y sonoro, difícilmente superables y que deberían convertirse en un referente, en el modelo a seguir por los demás estudios de desarrollo.\n\nDicho esto, es fácil suponer que lo considero un imprescindible, un must have en toda regla. No importa que no te guste el género shooter, olvídate de las etiquetas y déjate llevar por su atmósfera. La experiencia es muy satisfactoria y la diversión está asegurada... y no quiero terminar sin hablar de su final, uno de esos que te pillan por sorpresa y te dejan con la boca abierta. En resumen, un clásico total y absoluto.\n\nAh, y no te olvides de echarle un vistazo a los DLCs del Panteón Marino 1 y 2, que ayudan a comprender mejor la historia y el universo Bioshock.

The crows then sort of became a shadowy man who tried to kill me. I enjoyed dispatching such a twisted freak only to discover that in killing him, I gained his crow killing-powers.

Again, I was hooked.\n\n\nI liked the way the developers let you get a feel for the place before people started shooting at you.

Hyper religious zealotry driven by megalomania with a side of racism just for good measure.\n\nFascism was there as well but more of the nationalistic breed than Andrew Ryan's corporatocracy.  The good of the state or at least the idealistic society it purported to be were paramount. \n\nIt was engrossing.\n\nI remember strolling through a cobblestone street with a barbershop quartet singing, \"God only Knows\" in 4 part harmony on the Victorian equivalent of a land speeder.  Which I accepted till it occurred to me that this particular song was actually released by the Beach Boys in 1966.  This was supposed to be 1912.\nIn another section of the map I heard CCR's \"Fortunate Son\"\n\nAmusing.  Just an Easter Egg but it seemed to fit the now uneasy backdrop of what was rapidly becoming a dystopian world.\n\n\nJust like the first game I was pulled along.  Learning new abilities and gaining new weaponry to further my cause.  Unlocking puzzles and always keeping a sharp eye out.  In games like these you learn to look in every nook and exploit every cranny. \n\nIt's how I survived...\n\nTwists, turns, heart wrenching morality and outright slaughter, you never knew what was coming at you.  History buffs would chuckle at the distortion of their tomes.  Stone effigies of the likes of John Wilkes Booth and  Jefferson Davis alongside George Washington.\n\nLooming larger than them all was the primary antagonist, Zachary Hale Comstock, the Prophet as he preferred to be addressed.\n\nSo the game continued on with the story revealing itself like the layers of an onion. \n\nBrilliant....\n\nSadly, it all had to end.  The final crescendo, the answer nagging for your attention throughout the entire game was at hand.\n\nExcept...\n\nThe devs screwed it up.  Cheating me out of a hard fought and anxiously anticipated conclusion. \nIrrational Games decided to cheap out on the end and instead of leading you to a natural conclusion placing a final \"God Battle\" in the way of unlocking the secrets I'd invested so much time in learning.\n\nWhat the hell?!\n\nInstead of seeing the end credits I was forced to defend some blue jar on the deck of a floating air barge from hordes of invading foes I was ill-prepared to dispatch.\n\nI was sent scurrying to YouTube to find an answer.  After a dozen attempts and just as many failures I relented.  I've been defeated by a game mechanic.  It was like getting to the last chapter of a book and finding someone had ripped out the pages and locked them in a box then thrown away the key.\nLife's too short...\n\nThe game became a grind and one that took me further away from the story.  It broke the immersion and for that sin I cannot forgive Irrational games.\n\nAgain, just as in the first game and all of Bioshock 2, the idea was to protect something defenseless with less than adequate means. \n\nI don't have any patience for that.  Challenge? yes!  Stupid? No! \n\nAgain I was resigned to YouTube to see what was denied me.  Gracious souls either more skilled or more lucky than I had posted the footage I would never see from my own efforts.\n\nAll of the failings that were mere annoyances became impenetrable barriers to me.  How could I go through the entire game without the need of trainers, cheats or hacks only to be thwarted at the end.  So much for being a straight shooter. \n\nAt least you had console commands in Bioshock 1 and 2.  No such luck in Bioshock Infinite.","timestamp_created":1430448159,"timestamp_updated":1430448159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15629750","author":{"steamid":"76561198037903596","num_games_owned":422,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":2117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2117,"last_played":1429651656},"language":"french","review":"J'ai aimé Bioshock infinite malgrés ses défauts.

It still feels like a BioShock game.\n\nThe graphics are very stylized, which serves the game very well I think, and proves that stylized graphics don't just belong in kids films and games.  They can be very impressive at times with sunshafts and shadows in certain areas, however my computer had a bit of trouble running it when there was smokey or firey areas.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing as well, and they did a great job with it.\n\nThere's a lot of fun to be had in this game, however, the replayability is lacking, but I doubt anyone was expecting this game to be very replayable.

Ou 5/10. Ou 10/20.\n \nCommençons par ce qui m’a plu :\n-          Des graphismes sublimes, des vues impressionnantes\n-          Une excellente localisation VF\n-          On retrouve en partie le gameplay de Bioshock (fouiller tout ce qui traîne)\n-          Une histoire intéressante (du moins, au début)\n-          Quelques phases d’infiltration, malheureusement bien trop rares.\n-          Les plus en combat (petites failles d’Elizabeth)\n\nEt maintenant, les points qui m’ont le plus gêné :\n\n-          Le pire : la transformation d’un FPS-RPG en Serious Sam (comprendre : des zones où on ne peut pas en sortir sans avoir flingué tout le monde (car, impossible de crocheter en combat). Je ne sais plus s’il y en a dans Bioshock 1 et 2, mais je n’y ai jamais eu cette sensation). C’est clairement ce qui m’a le plus agacé de tout le jeu. Obligé de tirer sur tout ce qui bouge, de viser une cible précise, et de mourir pour recharger ses munitions (lié au système d’arme). On s’énerve sur certains passages où on se prend des dégâts venus de nulle part, et on remeurt deux secondes après être revenu, pour finir les 20 mobs qui restent à la clé anglaise, en mode hit&run.\n\n-          Le système d’arme : autant ça partait d’une très bonne idée, autant le peu de munitions que l’on peut trouver ou leur efficacité est à s’arracher les cheveux. Et quand on se retrouve à prendre une arme merdique car notre favorite est à court de balles…  Et sachant qu’il y a une vingtaine d’armes disponibles, avec quatre améliorations pour chaque, que l’on n’a pas assez de thunes pour tout prendre, que l’on ne sait pas laquelle sera dispo dans l’arène suivante.\n\n-          Les pouvoirs : utilité, eh bien, pas grand-chose. Le même système est utilisé avec les armes (un pouvoir ramassé remplace celui actif), et là c’est le drame, on perd celui dont on se servait depuis le début. Impossible de le retrouver comme les armes.\n\n-          L’aérotram : encore une bonne idée, mais finalement bofbof. Les interactions se limitent à se déplacer d’une zone à l’autre, et à sauter sur les mobs par moments. On peut aussi s’en servir en mode hit&run, mais gaffe contre des HandyMan.\n\n-          L’IA des mobs est stupide (attaque de front. Ou pas, d’ailleurs), certaines zones sont « mortes » (comprendre : les mobs peuvent pas y aller, et on les shoot comme on veut)\n\n-          L’histoire et les failles. Idem ici, une bonne idée, mais mal traitée. SPOILER : on se retrouve à osciller entre différentes réalités, sans savoir laquelle est la bonne, ni pourquoi les gens se souviennent d’un passage (comme si la réalité où se trouvait Elizabeth devenait la vraie), ni pourquoi on ne rencontre pas son double. Et en quoi tuer le DeWitt héros résoudrait quoi que ce soit (pourquoi pas un autre, comme celui qui deviendrait Comstock) ? Pourquoi les réalités alternatives (phénomène étudié par Lutece et indépendant de Columbia) disparaitraient suite à ce meurtre ?\n\n-          Les passages que j’ai trouvé difficiles (pour cause de munitions, des mobs qui se soignent quand on meurt (et vu qu’on ne repop pas avec ce qu’on avait au début de l’arène…). SPOILER : Mention spéciale aux moments avec le fantôme (les trois, mais surtout la banque), les Handyman, le combat final sur le dirigeable, où nos armes sont aussi efficaces que des pistolets à bouchon contre les patriotes…\n\n-          Le gameplay spécifique de Bioshock Infinite: les ciblages sont horribles, pour par exemple s’accrocher à l’aérotram, il faut une bonne distance avec le rail, pointer au bon endroit, insister pour qu’apparaisse la flèche verte. Idem pour les désignations de cible à la fin. Les soucis des armes/pouvoirs mentionné plus haut.\n\n-          La liberté de Bioshock 1 et 2 a disparu.

В Биошоке редко испытываешь нехватку патронов, солей или здоровья, ведь повсюду разбросаны аптечки, бананы, оружие, и даже у хрупких, на первый взгляд, женщин можно обнаружить боеприпасы для снайпера или поливалки.

The story line is great, the theme of the game fits in perfect in an alternate world, and it ends with some awesome combat in the end.  The story is the main focus and it gets so twisty that by the end you will be scratching your head going back through to figure out what the hell happened.  I honestly didn't get it the first time, but it's well worth playing.  Great game quality both graphically and by the story.  Music, and the feeling of being there is perfect.

After passing the game, I relly enjoyed the storyline and visuals and the game was fun, then I passed Burial at sea and found myself wanting more. So I decided to give a try on 1999 mode and I don't repent I did. How you usually would play a game, you would just go running killing everything you see and progrssing, in 1999 mode you have to adopt a complete diferent strategy or die. You'll find yourself looking at every corner looing for some money, or ammo, or somthing to replenish you life. You have to stategise on how you use salts, amunition, it just feel like gameplay is totaly diferent... it was a strategy game, and if you are good stategizing the game will be much easier, and fun somehow!\nThere was times I was stuck in a level for hours with low ammo, low health, low salts, and the game really forces you to say, \"what can I do this time to make things diferent.\" For my surprise I got so good at it that as the game progrssed, it felt easier and easier, until the last Handy man wasn't even a challenge anymore, and the falgship defence was a big surpise also. I expected it to be imposible hard but it really was the easyest thing on the game, and that is because I had a strategy. I realized I lost all my amuniotion in the first minutes in game so I started to panic. There were turrets on top shotting at me and there was no way I could kill them, they killed me twice, but I had saved to much money at the end thath relly didn't bother me, at the second revival I killed one last guy and then the mission changed (\"meet elizabet on...\"). It was a surprise to me since I had only been about 5 minutes in that mission, or at least thats wat it felt like, and I already had beaten the game, but again, it was the stategy, I had been thinking on how to beat that level for weeks since it was a real concern.\n\nIn the end I feel like the whole game should had always been like 1999 mode, a game tht makes you think solutions rather than forcing them. This makes you pay more attention to the most little of details on the game, so that in the end you end up praising the overall experience even more. This is the most fun I have had with a game in such a loooooooong time.","timestamp_created":1430066007,"timestamp_updated":1430066007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15563413","author":{"steamid":"76561198011126784","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":145,"last_played":1404504881},"language":"english","review":"horrible game, waste of money.","timestamp_created":1430065891,"timestamp_updated":1430065891,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.45171847939491272","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15563053","author":{"steamid":"76561198181727803","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1430064787},"language":"english","review":"Elizabeth is the best side character ever.
