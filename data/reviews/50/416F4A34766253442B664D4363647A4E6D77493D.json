I like it but I'm not 100% a fan of playing it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love how it gives off a solid story of playing as one of the HECU Soldiers fighting for survival and gives off more HECU varients that would be useful and helpful like the Engineer, Medic, and Machine Soldier fight with you and even gives you character separate between the HECU and Black Ops. The other thing I like about it is that we visit areas seen in Half-Life and extends further into the facility also along with getting to see Gordon Freeman jump into the Portal (Which isn't seen in the original Half-Life since OP wasn't made by then).\n\nMy main problem of why I'm not a fan of this game is most likely the gameplay and arsenal. For the gameplay, I find it the combat with the enemies perfect solid with it challenging sometimes until Black Ops and Race X ruined the fun for me. Black Ops are extremely annoying to deal with since they keep on breaking down my health which causes me to save several times and make me unable to fight in other situations with low health with them teaming up on me in groups. Race X Shock Troopers are hard to avoid since their laser attacks most of the time take down my health similar to Black Ops which ruin my fun for the game.\n\nFor the arsenal part, I don't see too much a problem but jeez, I have so much weapons on my hands. I like them all of them being useful in combat but having so much on my hands distracts me on which weapons I choose. I'm fine with the Barnacle grabber being a weapon but I'm a bit confused on why a Barnacle is used as a weapon. No no no, think about it. A BARNACLE, a creature that grabs and chocks any eatable thing in its path, came up as a idea to be used as a WEAPON!? I like it and all but that's a bit out of logic which doesn't really make sense in the rest of the Half-Life series.\n\nIn conclusion, even though there's flaws on my side on the game and not being a fan of it, I see it as a good expansion game to try.","timestamp_created":1598402577,"timestamp_updated":1630045294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74905708","author":{"steamid":"76561198365466917","num_games_owned":355,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":589,"last_played":1652777281},"language":"english","review":"its just as good as the first half life","timestamp_created":1598384474,"timestamp_updated":1598384474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74902200","author":{"steamid":"76561198268227655","num_games_owned":334,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":701,"last_played":1598379235},"language":"english","review":"Finished the game in 5 hours and stared at the \"void\" for 6 hours because i thought something was gonna happen :(","timestamp_created":1598379480,"timestamp_updated":1598379480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74899179","author":{"steamid":"76561198417708908","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":920,"last_played":1640539525},"language":"english","review":"i like this new weapon","timestamp_created":1598375419,"timestamp_updated":1598375419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74896755","author":{"steamid":"76561198883665016","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":359,"last_played":1623265391},"language":"english","review":"this fucks hard","timestamp_created":1598372390,"timestamp_updated":1598372390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74893987","author":{"steamid":"76561198135846722","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":476,"last_played":1597813199},"language":"english","review":"Adds some new weapons and a little more to the story.","timestamp_created":1598369109,"timestamp_updated":1598369109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74885940","author":{"steamid":"76561198848773755","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1788,"last_played":1653736058},"language":"english","review":"the best game in the world\nvery nostalgic","timestamp_created":1598358280,"timestamp_updated":1598358280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74873603","author":{"steamid":"76561198260195386","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2562,"last_played":1617351670},"language":"english","review":"yea pretty cool","timestamp_created":1598334585,"timestamp_updated":1598334585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74870180","author":{"steamid":"76561198101732759","num_games_owned":664,"num_reviews":456,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1581887840},"language":"english","review":"Easily better than Blue shift and the base game with Morgan Freeman but still has aged poorly.

It's way more inventive for a start, instead of a flashlight you have night-vision, this isn't only a nice little feature but also crucial when you reach a handful of parts in the game where you're plunged into complete darkness and rely on it to find your way around. There's also a neat new weapon which sits alongside your two melee weapons which is a barnacle you can fire at certain green wall-dwelling creatures to grapple your way across the environment just like the Grappling Hook in the Zelda games! Why this wasn't used again in HL2 I'll never know\n\nAs with Blue Shift, Opposing Force takes place alongside the main game Half-Life, only this time instead of playing as our usual silent protagonist Gordon Freeman, you take control of a military dude who is part of the first wave sent in to kill Gordon Freeman. No spoilers but if you have played through the original Half-Life game you'll know that things go very wrong and that even the first wave sent in to \"fix the problem\" was only the beginning of a huge operation.\n\nOpposing Force isn't very long, obviously your first play will be your longest. I took my time, but when you know exactly what you're supposed to be doing (or you're just very good at these older, cooler FPS games) this game can be done within 60 mins or so. That being said there's plenty of moments which will bring a smile to your face, whether you recently finished HL or not, you'll still recognise some areas or even the exact messages being spoken over the radio transmitters. Oh and you'll also see the mysterious G-Man, who also speaks this time (first time he speaks in the franchise? Not sure, maybe)\n\nOverall a great expansion, I would recommend for the reasons that I've given above, although I would strongly recommend a play of the original game first in order to make the most out of it.

The tutorial has you navigating through a boot camp and introduces many of the new mechanics such as rope climbing, how your P.C.V. (Powered Combat Vest) works, and how your night-vision goggles function. This game features many new weapons and tons of new enemies from a completely different planet. Some of the new weapons are the Desert Eagle handgun, a M40A1 Sniper Rifle, and many new \"alien\" weapons. This game also features new AI squad members, some of which can heal you, open sealed doors or just help out with some extra firepower. The beginning of the game takes place around \"Surface Tension\" in Half-Life, even showing Gordon Freeman being captured. Many other references to Half-Life's events are cleverly placed.

Rather than an employee there such a scientist or security guard, you’re in the boots of Alan Shepard, a member of the HECU unit in the USMC tasked with quelling the ongoing incident at Black Mesa. However due to the circumstances at hand when you arrive, you won’t be at odds with the surviving scientists and security guards at Black Mesa, but a whole new group of aliens in addition to the ones encountered in Half Life. In addition to the new enemies, you will be exploring new areas of Black Mesa and will be armed with a new set of weapons, both HECU issue and of out of this world. But in your quest to survive against the alien onslaught in the wake of the resonance cascade, you will also be working with HECU members at times, although despite their wonky ai at times, will prove useful in fighting against enemies while also progressing through the campaign, which isn’t as long as the standard Half Life campaign but is still long enough to leave the player satisfied. \n\nThe puzzles and level difficulty is on par with Half Life but the scenery and enemies will be different. The tutorial mission isn’t in Black Mesa but instead at boot camp/training, which explores new game functions and mechanics while also showcasing much of the new weapons in the game. There is multiplayer as well but it’s not the main selling point of the game and the player base for it is low and gameplay is lacking compared to other standalone Gold Source multiplayer titles like Team Fortress:Classic, Half Life: Death Match, Day of Defeat, and Sven Co-Op. But in the event of downloading Opposing Force, the multiplayer  is still worth checking out. Overall, Half Life Opposing Force is a great expansion to the universe and a great game as well. I’ll leave the story for you to explore. It’s worthy of its praise but keep in mind it’s still over 20 years old.\nI recommend.","timestamp_created":1597899150,"timestamp_updated":1597899150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543108880519866943","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74594873","author":{"steamid":"76561198075135870","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1597894868},"language":"english","review":"more half-life","timestamp_created":1597894896,"timestamp_updated":1597894896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74594826","author":{"steamid":"76561199007516057","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":375,"last_played":1581815008},"language":"english","review":"MY ASS IS HEAVY!!!!!","timestamp_created":1597894792,"timestamp_updated":1597894792,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74594782","author":{"steamid":"76561198393259111","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":416,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":416,"last_played":1597893514},"language":"latam","review":"Excelente expansión, no se olviden de ver los foros de la comunidad para que esté en español.

It's what many expansions are; a mini version of the base game, condensed and less ambitious, but the same formula. Enemy encounters are a bit better for providing the player with a challenge, so that element is better, but as a whole it's not really comparable. It does have a bit of a different style which is refreshing, as you play as a Marine in an overdone comedic gung ho style.\n\nYou revisit parts of Black Mesa seen in Half-Life, but you will see different parts of these locations. The level design doesn't bring anything new to the table, although the final maze-like encounter with black ops enemies is one of the best combat encounters in the series. \n\nThe \"puzzle\" gameplay (solving practical problems to navigate the environment) is less clever than in Half-Life, which wasn't outstanding in this regard either. But Opposing Force is more focused on combat where it does present more challenge than Half-Life especially due to some of its new enemy types, but for the most part more forgettable levels. \n\nAfter all, Half-Life never excelled in gameplay, rather it excelled in presentation, and the presentation and general structure of Opposing Force has less memorable moments. Opposing Force also has a new set of weapons placed in rather lazy but logical places, and like Half-Life a number of these weapons are never ideal to use in any situation, therefore this lacks the intelligent weapon design seen in games like Doom, Quake, and Unreal most of all. \n\n[h3]Strengths[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Amusing over the top gung ho marine style, Opposing Force has character\n\n[*]Decent new enemy types that pose a greater combat challenge\n\n[*]Some cool tie-ins with the original game\n\n[*]A few new types of combat encounters, particularly more maze-like ones that sometimes use pitch darkness against you to encourage night vision use (the game had to make use of the new night vision goggles after all)\n\n[*]Fairly interactive world like in the original game\n\n[*]The Desert Eagle with laser sight is a cool new weapon\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Weaknesses[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Once again many of the weapons are never ideal for any situation, the creativity and intelligence behind weapon design isn't great (a flaw shared by the base game)\n\n[*]Friendly AI that you can command is very dumb\n\n[*]Only 2 channel audio ever since Valve broke it years ago\n\n[*]The \"puzzle\" gameplay (practically getting past environmental obstacles) is rather uninspired and lacks creativity, a downgrade over the base game in this regard which already wasn't the most intelligent here\n\n[*]Hardly any secrets on any level\n\n[*]Encourages cover shooting at times despite not having leaning or iron sights, although it does this less often than the base game\n\n[*]Final boss is one of the lamest and laziest I've ever seen in a game\n\n[*]Features Half-Life's overly slidey movement that lacks precision, not the best feeling FPS game\n[/list]\n\nOverall it's decent, but you're honestly not missing much by not playing this.

Despite being an expansion to Half-Life, it plays almost nothing like it. I mean, sure, it has a pretty decent blend of story and gameplay much like Half-Life, but it's much more combat-focused. You play as a soldier this time around, right down to training at boot camp if you pick the training level, and you get access to a ton of cool new weapons as the game progresses, plus Gearbox added a new batch of aliens called Race X that complement a more traditional first-person shooter kind of gameplay.\n\nThe game's a bit lighter on puzzles than Half-Life, and I recall there being a lot less platforming, but it still has plenty of cool ideas to keep it fresh including a grappling hook mechanic, a displacer cannon that can be used as a one-shot kill or to teleport you to a small Xen location where you might get health and ammunition, new types of companions that give you certain benefits, and even replacing the flashlight with night vision. None of these ideas are implemented [i]perfectly[/i], but they totally change the way that Half-Life plays in the right way.\n\nI have a few complaints about the game as-is, such as how the new rope-swinging mechanic is fiddly and feels out-of-place, and the game's habit of throwing tanky monsters at you ad nauseum, but for me it was a pretty solid four out of five experience through and through, and more than worth the five dollars Valve is asking for it.
