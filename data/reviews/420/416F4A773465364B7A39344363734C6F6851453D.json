Commentary is also fascinating. Loved hearing about how the various elements were lovingly built to create a coherent and innovative experience. So easy to take for granted how much Valve put into this game.  \nLove: \n- the characters\n- the drama and sense of urgency\n- the humour\n- the great core gameplay\n\nMinor niggles:\n- gameplay is beginning to feel tired. By the time I reached the latter part of the game I was thinking \"I've seen this all before\" (that judgment might be partially to do with the fact I played HL2, HL2: EP1 and HL2: EP2 back-to-back) \n- Not a fan of the driving bits, which feel clumsy to me (or revealed my clumsiness, take your pick)\n\nWhat would I like from HL2: EP3?\n\n1. More of the great story, characters, humour\n2. Some new and interesting mechanic to help enliven the gameplay\n3. The original voice acting cast and writers to return\n4. A conclusion fitting of it's predecessors\n\nValve, if you want ideas on where to go with HL2: EP3, I'd love to contribute. \n\nHL2: EP2 is a classic and I love it. And like so many others, I want more. Fingers crossed. \n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1506299446,"timestamp_updated":1506299446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500924229621887207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35187056","author":{"steamid":"76561198337813146","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":211,"last_played":1563932435},"language":"english","review":"i love it, but at the end *SPOILER ALERT AHEAD* i crashed right befour i could get back to base after killing all of the striders\n:steamsad:","timestamp_created":1506275573,"timestamp_updated":1506275573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500924229621887207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35186857","author":{"steamid":"76561198116000791","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1529430887},"language":"polish","review":"BTW, VAVLE WE STILL WAIT !!!","timestamp_created":1506275074,"timestamp_updated":1506275074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480519503355026245","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35175905","author":{"steamid":"76561198044432737","num_games_owned":510,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":572,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":85,"last_played":1543729256},"language":"english","review":"I love this series.

Orange Box adıyla HL2 episode 2, Team Fortress 2 ve Portal oyunlarını barındırıyordu çıktığı Ekim 2007 tarihinde. Diğer oyunlar satış amaçlı, öylesine hediye edilmiş basit yapımlardı diye düşünülmesin, Team Fortress 2 günümüzde, Overwatch, Paladins, Battleborne ve yakın zamanda çıkacak türevlerinin atasıdır. Hâlâ ondaki görevler, dinamikler kullanılıyor ve seviliyor yeni oyunlarda. Portal ise benzerine rastlanmayan fakat çıkışının ardından yine pek çok oyuna fikir babalığı yapan bambaşka bir yapımdır. Böyle dolu dolu gelmişti paket. Oyunun devamına dönersek kaza sonrasında yaşananlarla başlıyor. Yıkıntılar arasından yolumuzu bulmaya çalışırken bir yandan da sinyalimizi gönderme derdindeyiz. İlk bölümlerde tabiata dönüş yaşanıyor da denilebilir. Ardından Alyx’in ağır yara aldığı bir sahne yaşıyoruz ve ana oyunda bizi kurtaran yaratıklar yine yardımımıza koşuyor. Bu sefer onlarla giderek Alyx’in kurtuluşu için öz bulmaya çabalarken bu kez farklı bölümlere giriyor ve yeraltına, böcek yuvalarının arasına iniyoruz. Yeni rakiplerimiz var artık, sarı fosforlu böcekler, gücümüzü azaltıyorlar ve bitirebiliyorlar. Canımız bitmezse yani ölmezsek yeniden dolmaya başlıyor. Yavrularının bulunduğu kozalak benzeri yuvalardan can toplayabilme mekaniği eklenmiş.\n\nAradığımız özü bularak ve sonrasında akın akın gelen kumböceklerine karşı giriştiğimiz zorlu bir savunma savaşının ardından iyileştirebildiğimiz ve sürekli bize yani Gordon’a hayranlığı artan Alyx ile yolumuza devam ediyoruz. Tek başımıza bir araç bularak birkaç fiziksel bulmacayı daha çözmemiz gerekiyor. Aracı bulduktan sonra yoldaki noktalarla uzatılan bölümler eşliğinde üsse ulaşıyor ve bilgileri veriyoruz. Yaşanan baskın ve sonrasındaki hayli zor son savaşın ardından oyunumuz acıklı ve şaşırtıcı sahneyle sonlanıyor. Eksilerinden bahsettiğim ana karaktere verilen ayakçılık görevlerinin benzeri burada yaşanıyor. Füzeyi imal eden kişi Alyx’in babasıyla konuştuğumuz esnada bir şey söyleyeceğim tarzında yanına çağırıyor ve ateşin ortasına atıyor. Oyundaki sırlar da burada biraz daha gösteriyor kendisini. Zira öldüğümüzde sanki düşman bizmişiz gibi adam haklı çıktı gibi yazıları çıkıyor. Ayrıca uzun bacaklıları yeneceğimiz silah da oyuna son anda eklenen bir başka dinamik olarak artı denebilir.  Nihayetinde füze atılıyor, geçit kapanıyor ama beklemediğimiz bir olayla müstakbel kayınpederimizi kaybediyoruz ve oyun burada sona ererken Episode 3’ü beklemeye başlıyoruz…","timestamp_created":1505912261,"timestamp_updated":1505912261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35079202","author":{"steamid":"76561198136614171","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":87,"playtime_forever":1711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1711,"last_played":1606300333},"language":"russian","review":"Таскал всю игру гнома, и забыл положить его в ракету)","timestamp_created":1505892202,"timestamp_updated":1606413552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503676474094390869","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4e6Kz94CcsLohQE="}
