Wir treffen auf unterschiedliche Gegner die mit besonderen Fähigkeiten (Firemen, Patriot, Handymen oder andere) oder unterschiedlichen Waffen. Die tatsächlich Fantastische Spielwelt von Bioshock Infinite ist gespickt von Nutzbaren Dingen, die einem den Kampf erleichtern. Die sogenannte Skyline (eine Art von Gleis bei der man sich an einem Haken durch die Lüfte schwingt oder die Risse die, die früh im Spiel vorkommende Begleiterin Elizabeth (die uns auch fast das ganze Spiel lang begleitet) öffnen kann. Damit werden Selbsschussanlagen, Öllachen(für den Feuerzauber wichtig), fliegende mini Helikopter mit MG usw. herbeigerufen. Außerdem kann unsere Begleiterin uns immer mal wieder mit geld Munition Medipacks usw. versorgen. \nDie Story des Spiels ist sehr verworren und der eigentlich simple Auftrag Elizabeth zu \"Befreien\" wird schnell zu einer actiongeladenen und so komplizierten Geschichte, dass die Figuren oft selber nicht mitkommen. Sofern man aber die im Spiel verteilten Audiologs sich anhört kann man mit etwas Fantasie die Geschichte nachvollziehen. Trotzalledem lebt das Spiel von der Story, da diese gut ist und den Spieler fesselt. Da dies so ist werde ich in diesem Bereich nichts mehr sagen, da kleine Details schon spoilern könnten. Die Spielwelt überzeugt mit wahnsinnig gutem Setting und an sich stimmigen Leveldesign. Man muss zugeben dass die schwebende Stadt Columbia Stoff für sehr schöne Screenshots gibt. Das einzige was mir nicht gefiel war die kurze Spielzeit. Je nach Spielstil habt ihr das Spiel innerhalb von 7-10 sunden durchgespielt.\n\nStory:  9/10 -gute aber teilweise verwirrende Story\n\nGameplay: 10/10 -Das zusammenspiel aus Waffen, Fähigkeiten, der Skyline und den Rissen macht einfach Spaß\n\nSpielwelt: 11/10: wahnsinnig schöne und stimmige Spielwelt, überahl sind Ausblicke die einem die Kinnlade runterklapen lässt\n\nGrafik: 8/10: Selbstverständlich für 2015 nicht so gute Grafik aber die schöne Spielwelt überzeugt auch ohne Grafik a la Witcher 3\n\nIch kann einer Person, die Singleplayershooter mag und gerne in eine schöne Spielwelt und guter Spielwelt abtaucht und Beschäftigung für 8-10 Stunden sucht wärmstens empfehlen\n","timestamp_created":1436393682,"timestamp_updated":1436393682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16949104","author":{"steamid":"76561197985078222","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":818,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":692,"last_played":1436715476},"language":"english","review":"One of the more interesting games I've played.

Примерно такие слова вырываются после первого прохождения Bioshock Infinite, да и после последующих прохождений тоже. Перед нам крайне красивая игра с глубоким сюжетом, который заставляет мозг думать и осмысливать его снова и снова. История не связана с предыдущими частями трилогии. На этот раз нас ждет не мрачный и жестокий Восторг, а летающий город Колумбия, который можно назвать своей рода альтернативой Восторгу. В первые минуты можно подумать, что главный герой оказался в раю. В идеальном городе, где нет места жестокости и насилию, где все вокруг счастливы. Но как и в предыдущей истории, это идеальное общество обречено на разрушение. Не буду вдаваться в детали сюжета, могу лишь сказать что при прохождении игры каждый испытает искренний восторг от происходящего на экране. \nРекомендую всем и каждому к прохождению, уверяю вас - вы не пожалеете. Увлекательный геймплей, красивые локации, надолго запоминающийся сюжет, глубокие и интересные персонажи - это лишь часть того что вы найдете в этой игре.\nШедевр. 10 / 10","timestamp_created":1436373499,"timestamp_updated":1436373499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16944358","author":{"steamid":"76561198086086487","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":474,"last_played":1606784719},"language":"brazilian","review":"A história é bem massa\nEnredo bem massa\nPersonagens bem massas\nJogabilidade bem massa\nGraficos bem massas\nNota : massa/massa\nRecomendo.\n","timestamp_created":1436371411,"timestamp_updated":1436371411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16943636","author":{"steamid":"76561198068830146","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":999,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":999,"last_played":1436367450},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego es mucho más que un simple juego.

I enjoy how this game, as well as Bioshock 1 and 2, doesn't give you the entire story but allows the player to piece together the wider story for themselves. To flesh out the bones presented to you.\n\nIt's characters are amazing. Booker and Elizabeth grow on the player the more you go through the game, to the point where you physically care about them by the end. They both grow as people, as they travel through Columbia's floating streets, and so do you as the player. They make you laugh, cry and, most importantly, think. Comstock remains a mystery, even after the game ends but he still remains a powerful force in the game. But by far the greatest characters in this entire game are the Lutece twins, Robert and Rosalind, they are both omniscient guides and odd comic relief.\n\nThe game play is smooth and easy to master, on both keyboard and mouse and controller. You never feel like you're doing finger contortionism while playing, like other games on the market.\n\n This game is a must play, for everyone who loves amazing storylines and griping character.

Has done. Will do. (You'll get it later.) The balance between the two \"loops\" is handled very well, and I never quit the game because I was bored - a big improvement over the first game in the series.\n\nThe narrative elements are deftly done, with lots of little details that will, at turns, make you smile at the connections and in-jokes, wince at the applicability to what's happening now in the USA, and utterly horrify you later on. Also, the ending payoff is HUGE, delivered in-game, and will PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.\n\nOh, and the Lutece's are some of the best and most engaging \"kinda-secondary\" characters I've ever encountered.\n\nMy only complaint was with the sound - specifically, the sound mix for the dialogue. It's not that the dialogue sounds bad, but rather that (at certain points), bits of character speech would get run over by all the cacaphony of Hollywood sound effects. The gist of things always came through, but a little more space for speech would have been nice (especially because the dialogue is so important). Part of the intensity of the game is in how loud it seems to be, and that's fine - but there's a point where it gets in its own way.\n\nBut that's a minor quibble. \"Infinite\" is very close to perfect.","timestamp_created":1436228571,"timestamp_updated":1436228571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16918343","author":{"steamid":"76561198116897436","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":714,"last_played":1567758118},"language":"english","review":"Very great story and awesome mechanics for fighting.

All in all, barely thought-out and dissapointing.\n\nThe Elizabeth system is trivial and dumb, and they only put it in to make the game not seem like an escort quest. The level design could have been exactly the same and it would've been fine if they just implemented the occasional hook every here-and-there, and would actually encourage the player to fan out further in order to find supplies.\n\nSidequests- eh.\n\nThe skyrails were very well done, but incredibly underused, and just came across as another gimmick to be used in a level every now-and-then.\n\nThe story? Alot of people harp on about how this game has an excellent tale, with a strong supporting lore, but I would heavily disagree, even the background story provided through audio logs in Bioshock 2 (The strongest and most underrated aspect of that game, by the way) is more solid and integral than that of this game. The multi-dimensional aspect of the story is mind-mushingly simple, especially considering what they could've done with it, and I feel that it is an insult to the saga, and a disappointment after Minerva's Den for 2. Another nitpick is that when Elizabeth is supposedly depressed and undergoing complete psychological trauma, she still has it in her to yell a whimsical comment as she throws you some ammo or picks a lock. The alleged and critically acclaimed \"twists\" in it feel incredibly predictible.\n\nCharacter Progression- Tonics get really dull and uninteresting upgrades. There is no system similar to that of the Little Sisters. The weapon upgrades dullness is second only to that of the weapons themselves. You can only hold 2 weapons. The only remnants of the moral choice system showcased in the original display of the early version of this game is at the very beginning, and has no impact at all.\n\nAs much as I've been harping on it, this is still a good game. Just not a good -----Shock game. Although many of these issues are fixed the Burial at Sea expansion pack, they still aren't part of the base game, which is by far what really counts. I thoroughly recommend this game, though you may want to pick it up at a discount...","timestamp_created":1436183357,"timestamp_updated":1436183486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543283581733703613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16908718","author":{"steamid":"76561198108864304","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":470,"last_played":1591629139},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра с отличным сюжетом\n10из10","timestamp_created":1436183227,"timestamp_updated":1436183227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456790119409561157","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16906891","author":{"steamid":"76561198133663228","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":456,"last_played":1436274275},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏是几年前在360上玩的，自制系统破解，现在pc买来支持下，伊丽莎白的本子，动画，cg工口也都看过（不要问我要种子）\n画面嘛：\n当时360上玩真的觉得很屎，梦回五年前的感觉，这次在pc上玩，的的确确是被惊艳到了，感觉可以算当时画面最好的游戏之一。美术风格和各式各样的特效都非常出色，画面非常唯美，即使以现在的眼光来看，也并不觉得过时。\n剧情嘛：\n记得那时候为了搞明白剧情到底tm讲的是啥（通关后)，真的查了不少资料，平行宇宙，一体宇宙，时间悖论，（也是谢谢这款游戏，让我知道了薛定谔的猫）后来听机核网的麦教授答疑解惑，才明白三部曲（包含海葬dlc），就像是一个首尾相接的环，情节紧紧相扣，三代的结尾便是一代开始，两部作品时间跨度长达六年，衔接确是这么完美，这个系列更像是艺术品，一本精彩绝伦的三部曲小说。复杂且不晦涩。生化奇兵的一大神点就是剧情嘛，这也是大家公认的，不得不服肯令文大师深厚的功力啊。（二代虽然并不是出自大师之手，剧情和一代还是有很大联系的，可以算是一代的补完吧。）\n游戏性嘛：\n个人感觉，偏硬派射击的风格，战斗和前两作体验区别并不大，但这一作角色升级要素弱化了不少，剧情和角色倒是占整个游戏的很大比重，可能是为了追求人物塑造吧，虽然并没有续作。拾荒要素被完美的继承下来，而且这一作增加了钩锁机制，非常精妙，主角也能飞上天。可玩性蛮强的，新东西加永远不会腻的老东西。\n音效嘛：\n感觉这一块亮点还是非常足的，电影感很强，而且细节做的非常好，具体就要自己去玩了。\n总的来说：\n一场绝妙的落幕演出，不给满分我是人嘛。","timestamp_created":1436172216,"timestamp_updated":1436176776,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527713477611541748","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16904500","author":{"steamid":"76561198086645101","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":766,"last_played":1467601704},"language":"english","review":"[h1]Bioshock Infinite[/h1]\nIs one of the weirdest ending games and awesome at the same time... \nThe story is incredibly well done with all the easter eggs of the previous bioshock games, with an incredible gameplay especially with all plasmids, if you are planning to buy this game, you should play bioshock and bioshock 2 and if you just want to get into the awesome bioshock story buy the 2 episodes of burial at sea.

Just wow.  I played and enjoyed the first two Bioshock games, but always felt they recieved a bit more credit than they deserved.  Bioshock Infinite makes the previous games feel like prototypes; this is a true marvel in game design and storytelling.\n\nThe combat may not be groundbreaking (you now have a regenerating shield ala Halo), but it's brutal, every weapon and tonic in the game is varied and useful, and for the first time in the series it's just plain fun.  That doesn't mean it's now a mindless shooter; the multi-layered, biting, emotional narrative makes just about every other video game plot look like amateur hour.  The highlight is Elizabeth, one of the best written and useful companions to ever grace a game; she'll toss you ammo and health in the middle of a fight, open tears to another dimension to turn the odds in your favor, pick locks for you, never needs babysitting, and quips, \"Oh my god!\" when you grind your skyhook into some poor sap's face.  She's awesome.\n\nI won't get into plot specifics, partially to avoid spoilers (the less you know going in the better), and partially because I couldn't even begin to do it justice without breaking the game down scene by scene and analizing every visual cue and line of dialogue, and I'd probably need a degree in quantum physics.  It can be enjoyed and absorbed on a multitude of levels, from a simple father/daughter parable to the dark history of The United States to the folly of Patriotism and Absolutism, and a whole lot beyond and between.  I really cannot reccommend this enough; it's so finely crafted and carries so much weight I'd tell anyone who doesn't even like games in general to buckle in and experience something special.  It's just so good.\n\n*Quick note about the DLC: long story short it's not that good.  I played the arena stuff when it first came out and was nothing special.  Burial at Sea is a two part story that ties Columbia and Rapture together, but really it just dilutes and over-complicates what really didn't need explaination.  The first part returns to the well of Rapture and it's pretty standard, but ends right when it gets going.  The second part has you playing as Elizabeth, which going by the main story should be amazing... but it's not.  It's poorly done stealth with no other options, and quite frankly it's boring.  Unless you get it in a bundle for dirt cheap, just don't bother.  Even then it might not even be worth the time and the bad taste it leaves in your mouth after the mindblowing main game.","timestamp_created":1435931532,"timestamp_updated":1435931566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523379385471343994","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrouMqs4CfO+oQA=="}
