Улучшеный графический движок - неплохой подход для DLC.

The only reason why I'm giving this a bad review is because it costs $40 fucking dollars for a simple tech demo!

There is no story, and from what I have heard this is one of the most un-touched games in steam. You can get it if you like, but you also get it for free if you buy half-life 2 episode one (Or one of the half-life games).

Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is $30 for the main 2 hour mission, plus side missions. Half-Life 2: Lost Coast has one mission, and one mission only. Do NOT buy this as a stand-alone game. Buy Half-Life 2 and both episodes (if you havnt already) and you will get this for free. You will also get Half-Life Deathmatch: Source and Half-Life 2 Deathmatch.
