2 меня очень порадовал. По сравнению с первой частью, которая была немного скучновата, сиквел просто шедевр который производит впечатление.\nКому-то она может показаться скучной или сложной, но тут уже личный вкус или нелюбовь к \"головоломкам\". \n\nПлюсы:\n\n+ Хорошая графика и стилистика.\n+ Приятный соундтрек.\n+ Очень много юмора.\n+ Новые возможности вроде гелей, лазеров и т.д.\n+ Много экшена которого так не хватало первой части.\n+ Кооператив и редактор карт.\n\nМинусы:\n- Испытания быстро наскучивают.\n- Идет не на всех машинах.\n- ГДЕ МОЙ ТОРТ???!!!\n\nВ сравнении с первой частью разработчики добавили много нового. Так появились разные виды \"гелей\" для взаимодействия, лазеры, \"световые дорожки\" и т.д. что вносит большее разнообразие в игровой процесс. \nБольше всего порадовало наличие экшена, \"движухи\" которой не было в первом портале. Во второй части постоянно что-то происходит, что-то падает, кто-то взрывается, тебе кричат \"Беги!!\" и на тебя валится труба. Выглядит очень круто и динамично. \nЮмор стал еще более многообразным и веселым. В некоторые моменты я ржал до колик. \nЕще игра в целом выглядит очень красиво, и зрелищно. Графика заметно улучшилась и оптимизировалась в сравнении с первой частью. \nКонечно есть минус в том что испытаний там больно много и иногда наскучивает все это проходить, но обычно это разбавляется диалогами или какой-то движухой. \nЕдинственно что меня разозлило - мне не дали торт! Его вообще нет во второй части! Я так мечтал об этом торте и мне его не дали!! ДАЙТЕ МНЕ ТОРТ!)). Разработчики прокомментировали это тем что \"торт уже устаревший и неинтересный мем\", но они не правы! Это была изюминка игры! \n\nМоя оценка 9,5\\10. Игра отличная.

Reviewing for Science is Fun.[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Genre: First Person Solo & Co-Op Puzzle Game\n[*]Developed & Published by: Valve\n[*]Platform Support: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and PS3\n[*]Business Model: Base Game.\n[*][i]Copy purchased by myself[/i]\n[/list]\n[i][url=http://wp.me/p4fZDz-2lo]Read the full and unabridged review for Portal 2 on A Paladin Without A Crusade[/url][/i]\n\n[b]Preamble[/b]\nPortal 1 had made history. Valve had created a hit on a relatively small budget. The question now was: what’s next? Would there be a sequel? Could Portal handle the AAA deluxe treatment? Well, Valve remained the same Valve as ever. Quiet and secretive about any potential plans for the series. But in the background, work had already begun on a sequel. The team and scope was expanded dramatically. New mechanics and ideas were experimented with. It wouldn’t be until three years later in March 2010 and a patch to Portal 1’s ending that the world would learn of the coming sequel. However, Valve worked on Valve time and despite the original release date being August 2010, it wouldn’t be until April 2011 that Portal 2 would finally hit the shelves. It released to resounding applause and critical acclaim. The question was answered: Portal could be a fully featured AAA experience and still have all the best parts of the original.\n\n[b]Overall Gameplay Thoughts[/b]\nPortal 2 features has three main components that you can play in. The solo campaign of around 10 hours that features the main characters of the Portal universe in a rather epic storyline. There’s the co-op campaign of around 5-6 hours that features a more lighthearted and fun storyline, with two new robot characters and GLaDOS directing their actions. Finally, there’s the Steam Workshop section, where you can test community developed chambers or design your own puzzles for both solo and co-op players. How many hours you’ll get out of this depends upon you but you can experience quite a lot if you want to. These are generally logic puzzles that require a lot of methodical thinking through the solution, with some exhilarating sections to shake things up. You’ll need to take your time and have patience to figure them out. As far as the Valve-crafted puzzles go, they should be solvable on your own. I only used a guide for two particularly difficult puzzles towards the end of the solo campaign and that was mostly because I couldn’t figure out one step in the solution. In the co-op campaign, you probably won’t need any help so long as you and your partner work together.\n\n[b]Story, Characters and Pacing[/b]\nAn unknown number of years have passed since the events of Portal 1. Chell is awakened from a long hibernation sleep to a very different Aperture Laboratories. The place is falling apart without the direction of GLaDOS or the team of scientists killed by the now deceased AI. Chell is awakened by a quirky personality core named Wheatley, who helps her progress through the ruins of Aperture. Wheatley is...a idiot as described by GLaDOS. But a funny idiot. Chell hopes that his assistance will lead to her finally escaping from Aperture Laboratories, a place that seems bound and determined to keep her here. Along the way though, mistakes were made (by Wheatley) and GLaDOS is awakened again. She’s furious at having been blown up by Chell in Portal 1 and is determined to make sure Chell pays for killing her. By making her advance the limits of science via some test chambers, of course. Duh. That’s what we all do to our arch enemies. It’s just so obvious. \n\n[b]PC Settings[/b]\nPortal 2 has a lot of settings at your disposal to create the optimal experience for any rig, even low-end ones. Bit of a side note, but I’m glad that Portal 2 explains every setting in detail when you configure it. Far too many companies forget to add these explanations on what each setting does and it can be confusing to go through this menu without those helpful tooltips. Anyway, in the video settings you have the expected aspect ratios with multiple resolution configurations of up to at least 1080p. There’s fullscreen, borderless window and windowed mode along with a laptop power savings mode. Anti-aliasing supports MSAA and CSAA up to 8x and 16X respectively. Anisotropic filtering goes up to 16X and there’s v-sync up to Triple buffered along with multicore rendering. Shader Detail, Effect Detail and Model/Texture detail have low/medium/high settings. Portal 2 is optimized well enough that even low-end hardware can run the game without too many issues. That being said, there are loading screens between every level which can be tiresome. But, at least we get flashy animations to watch while we wait. Portal 2 really refines the look that Portal 1 started and I really like it. Between the overgrown areas, the bright and distinctive colors with the dystopian feel to it, Portal 2 really stands out.\n\nAudio settings allow for multiple speaker configurations and audio quality. Master volume and music are the only sliders you can mess with. Closed captioning and voice can be enabled or disabled as well. You can also fully rebind your keys, change mouse sensitivity and acceleration as well as reverse the mouse for left handed people. The game also supports controllers with plenty of options from vibration, stick sensitivity, button layouts (custom support) and more. Portal 2 has pretty much everything you’ll need to run it on your machine and I haven’t noticed anything significant missing. \n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\nPortal 2 is one of my favorite games I’ve had the pleasure of playing. It’s a rare sequel where it stands on its own, building upon what came before but feeling fresh and unique the entire time. It cleverly avoids being a rehash of ideas, jokes or character arcs. The heavily expanded sequel comes with plenty of a solo campaign to chew on, new puzzles and refined mechanics, a new co-operative campaign and the backstory of Aperture Laboratories. The campaign is well done in general, though I felt like the ending started to drag a bit. The Co-Op campaign is also very enjoyable and is worth tackling [b]if[/b] you get the right friend to do it with. While both campaigns don't offer any real reason to replay them, that’s where the Steam Workshop and modding community come in. With over 450,000+ puzzles to choose from, you’re spoiled for choice. There’s puzzles that introduce user-created mechanics, new campaigns with their own unique storylines and a plethora of simple test chambers to try and solve. Science is fun, Portal 2 is fun and it gets one of my highest recommendations to give it a go.\n\n[b][url=http://wp.me/p4fZDz-2lo]Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/KingIsaacLinksr/recommended/317400/]A Paladin's Steam Review: Portal Stories: Mel[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/KingIsaacLinksr/recommended/400/]A Paladin’s Steam Review: Portal.
