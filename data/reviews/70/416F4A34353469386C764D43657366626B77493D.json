did this game hold up well in the long run. There's a reason this game is still looked upon fondly. The setting is interesting, the gameplay is fast paced and fun, and the story has that classic Valve tinge to it that makes it extra gripping, while not telling you very much directly. Although, like every game, there are flaws. I experienced many glitches, most of which had to do with getting stuck on random bits of geometry. But, as is well known, the absolute lowest point in this game has to be the final chapter, Xen. Ugly, slow, boring and filled with clunky platforming, and a mediocre final boss to top it all off. But, overall this game has held up tremendously well, even to someone who has only recently played it for the first time.
