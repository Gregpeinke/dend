Player training is an issue in that once you find a new vigor, there is little incentive to explore its use and purpose. \nThe narrative runs into many plot holes in that you are never given a genuine reason for the denizens of Colombia to come after you until Fink identifies you as the 'False Shepard'. This happens again later when the Vox are treating you like the second coming, then Fitroy disclaims you and then EVERYONE is after you. The ending is very memorable, on par with Portal's ending. \n\nIn the end, the game is not as good as it's initial reviews, but doesn't quite deserve the backlash it seems to be getting in online forums.

But the combat is only okay. \n\nI'm the kind of person that will overlook a game's shortcomings if it can entertain me elsewhere, and I think everything in Bioshock Infinite more than makes up for this game's lackluster combat. Your companion Elizabeth is not a dumb AI to babysit; she will provide cover, ammo, escape routes, etc in combat and enemies don't seem to care about her existence. It's a bit weird, but the system is good in a way that you can only really screw yourself over with poor choices. And that'll happen often, due to being frail and combat being too hectic to have the time to make wise decisions.\n\nBut look at this game's screenshots. This is one of the best-looking games on PC right now. The game's setpieces are amazing, the world's history is fleshed out rather well, and Elizabeth's personality does a great job of making you care about your mission and the conflicts that arise as a result. \n\nBioshock Infinite's story will blow your mind.

Запустив игру и погуляв по миру первые часа полтора я направился на просторы интернетов, где решил поставить мозги на место, прочитав \"сюжетку\", чтобы \"въехать\" в суть происходящего, ибо та игра контрастов и красок, что царила на экране, не находила объяснения и породила массу вопросов, ответы на которые найти удалось лишь много позже. Пожалуй, больше всего расстроили дневники (аудио), оставшиеся даже без субтитров. Я знаю английский достаточно, чтобы понять большинство реплик. Но вот незадача, в это время может прилететь не один посторонний звук, может идти перестрелка.. Очень много проходит мимо.. Так же я не оценил подход разработчиков, когда чтобы узнать и понять мир в достаточной степени тебе нужно осмотреть каждый уголок.. Есть игры, где это интересно, где это подано как-то.. Иначе.. Но Infinite - явно не тот случай. \nОднако, информация - это самое ценное, что есть в этой игре. Только узнавая новые сведения о ключевых персонажах и событиях вы сможете оценить всю глубину игры. \nСюжет - основная, если не единственная причина потратить на прохождение не 10-12 часов, а намного больше. BioShock Infinite преподносит нам историю на столько красивую, увлекательную и оригинальную, что по прохождению игры остается ощущение.. шока... Ничего столь восхитительного нам, игрокам, не представляли уже черт-его-знает сколько лет... Он (сюжет), подается очень дозированно, его порой не просто отследить и без сторонних данных (дневники, записки и пр.) собрать паззл порой просто невозможно, но когда ты начинаешь понимать, куда ты попал, зачем и какую роль тебе предначертано сыграть - игра цепляет намертво, на осталяя шанса оторваться от монитора. BioShock - бесконечно глубокая игра, которая раскрывает целый ворох фундаметальных вопросов, позволяя взглянуть на многие события с разных перспектив. \nЧто касается механики - тут всё довольно неплохо. В BioShock 2 я, честно, не вытерпел даже часа игры. Однако могу сравнить Infinite с первой игрой и могу констатировать - механика боя стала несколько живее, при этом оставляя чёткое ощущение приемственности, она узнаваема с первого взгляда. геймплей разнообразили, имеет место \"вертикальный геймплей\", если выражаться терминами Crytek'а. Аэротрассы - фан на любителя. Впрочем, я не фанат серии, потому ругать сильно и хвалить геймплей не буду, откровенных изъянов в нем нет, но лично мне он попросту не по душе. Есть места с пострелушками, были места, где можно поиграть в \"стелс\", есть моменты с исследованием мира. Есть скрытые доп. миссии, для любителей исследовать всё и вся.\nВ целом, я бы поставил игре твердую 8, но сюжет.. это шедевр.. он вытягивает весь проект на 9/10, жаль только, что больше BioShock'ов мы, скорее всего, не увидим. Последняя часть вышла триумфальной, восхитительной, примером для всех шутеров, где есть место настолько восхитительному сюжету, что я удивлюсь, если к 2015му году не выйдет какой-нибудь фильм по мотиву... \nРекомендую всем фанатам вселенной а так же всем любителям прекрасного. Эта игра создана с душой, она живая, яркая и способная покорить самое ледяное сердце...","timestamp_created":1387454743,"timestamp_updated":1387454743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526749014854431152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8114923","author":{"steamid":"76561198116572224","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1036,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54,"last_played":1576730900},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock has proven itself in the past before, but this is something new to the table. With wonderful graphics, simple yet deep combat system, amazing story, and with unforgettable characters to top it off. It's nothing short of amazing. From the amazing scenery of the town, to the satire and imagery in the story line, the game will make sure you follow every step in the game. As it immerses you into the relationship between Booker and Elizabeth, you will feel LIKE the characters. I know many reviewers said it before, but I'll say it now. It's like a Disney story well written. I highly reccommend this title if you're looking for nostalgia, great, shooter, or a great story.
