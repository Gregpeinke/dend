Don't be fooled into thinking just because its old its not up to much. This game is far from easy and on any level I can guarantee you wont complete it in one sitting. I think some of today's game makers need to look at some of the classics because they have lost the art of whats fun and whats boring.  A lot of gamer's want the whole package quality graphics and free open world movement, but with out a reason for running round like headless chicken there's not much point to the game/program and its gets real boring really quickly. With loads to do, ammo to find, puzzles to solve, items to investigate and Aliens and Solider's to kill. This game still has it for me. If you don't mind classic Wolfenstein type graphics I know your love playing this. Have to say although the graphics aren't great, since the release and a few updates its not that bad, the game is very playable.

Choć latami słuchałam o tej produkcji i o jej wpływie na branżę gier, napisy końcowe pierwszej przygody Gordona Freemana zobaczyłam dopiero w 2020 roku. Nie stało się to z niechęci a bardziej braku motywacji do ogrywania starych gier. Co jak co ale gra ma już na karku 23 lata i musiałam mentalnie przygotować się do pewnych ograniczeń ery, z której wyszła. Od czasu do czasu jednak lubię wybrać się wehikułem czasu w przeszłość, żeby zobaczyć jak \"kiedyś to było\" w świecie gier komputerowych i w dzień, w którym w końcu naszło mnie takie nastawienie, butelka obróciła się w stronę oryginalnego Half-Life'a. Nadszedł czas by w końcu zwiedzić placówkę Black Mesa i dowiedzieć się co tak zatrzęsło światem w przed Half-Life 2.\n\nMuszę przyznać, że jak na swój wiek Half-Life trzyma się dobrze pod wieloma względami. Przede wszystkim wrażenie robi dość filmowe podejście do rozgrywki. W czasach przed i w trakcie istnienia przygód Freemana strzelanki FPS raczej nie kojarzyły się z klimatycznymi, powolnymi sekwencjami budującymi atmosferę czy brakiem cutscenek na rzecz przeżywania każdej sceny \"na żywo\" w trakcie rozgrywki. Dziś nie trudno o gry, które korzystają z takich rozwiązań, wtedy jednak prawie każdy FPS, od pierwszego Dooma po Quake'a zaczynał się wybuchem lub mordowaniem hord potworów wielkimi spluwami. Half life był więc rodzynkiem w rodzinie, bo choć w 1998 powstało wiele tytułów nastawionych na filmowe doświadczenia (jak choćby pierwszy MGS), to jednak żaden nie był z gatunku strzelanek pierwszoosobowych. Jest to też tytuł, który stworzył \"modę\" na liniowe, ale pełne fabularnych wydarzeń gry z bardziej realistycznym podejściem do swojego świata, szczególnie w przypadku FPSów, których \"old-schoolowa\" odmiana była chwilowo zniesiona na drugi plan. \n\nTo nietypowe podejście zdobyło Half-Life'owi sławę, jak i zbudowało w nim bardzo charakterystyczną atmosferę, która żyje mocno po dziś dzień. Sam klimat różni się mocno od kontynuacji, która poszła za znacznie poważniejszym i dramatycznym tonem. Gdybym miała jakimś słowem określić stylistykę pierwszego Half-life'a to na myśl przychodzi mi słowo \"strefa 51\" Kosmici, wojskowi, wielkie laboratorium w centrum rozległej pustyni, gra ma bardzo futurystyczny feeling (oczywiście jak na swój czas), szczególnie w etapach dziejących się w podziemiach Black Mesa. Osobiście nie byłam zbytnio zachwycona tym stylem, mój osobisty gust nie trawi jakoś specjalnie szarych metalowych korytarzy z okazjonalnymi kolorkami, i gołą pustynią, ale to bardziej osobista kwestia niż problem gry. W 1998 jednak to oddanie się takiemu kierunkowi wyszło Valve naprawdę dobrze.\n\nDo \"życia\" gry dokłada się również dość zaawansowane jak na swój czas AI i ilość interakcji, dialogów i oskryptowanych scen. Na szczęście nie postawiono jak w innych grach z \"zaawansowanym\" AI na eskortę ludzi czy misje związane z ratowaniem pracowników. Są momenty, gdzie ocalenie personelu Black Mesa da nam nagrodę w postaci dostępu do zamkniętych drzwi lub zapasów, ale gra nie skupia się na tym praktycznie wcale, nigdy nie są też potrzebni, żeby zrobić główny fabularny progres. Wydaje się, że Valve wręcz momentami humorystycznie specjalnie naraża NPC na niebezpieczeństwo. Naukowcy przede wszystkim to zawodowi samobójcy, służą często jako mięso armatnie, które pokazuje nam działanie kolejnych niebezpieczeństw napotykanych na przestrzeni gry jak bomby pułapki czy wieżyczki. \n\nRozgrywka sama w sobie nie ucierpiała mocno na \"filmowości\". Podczas poruszania się i strzelania nadal czuć wpływ strzelanek z tego okresu jak dość szybkie poruszanie się i strzelanie, spora ilość różnorodnych i czasami bardzo oryginalnych broni, choć przez tonę hitscanowych przeciwników w późniejszych częściach gry,  należy być zdecydowanie ostrożniejszym. Oczywiście szybkie zapisy bardzo pomagają, a przydaje się to szczególnie w sytuacji dodatkowych niespodziewanych eventów które często zostawiają nas na resztach zdrowia, lub zabijają od razu. Bywa to odrobinę denerwujące, zwłaszcza że nie da się często przewidzieć, co się stanie. Akcja jest jednak dzięki temu dość wartka, co nie pozwala na nudę ani spokój podczas przechodzenia. \n\n(możliwe spoilery w dalszej części tekstu)\n\nDesign poziomów większość czasu jest dostatecznie interesujący, by w jakimś stopniu zrekompensować ograniczenia stylistyczne i graficzne. Po drodze trafiamy na tonę różnorodnych przeszkód, od bardzo dziwnych, ale świetnie zaprojektowanych kosmitów ze świata Xen po wszelką maszynerię i dziwne substancje przetrzymywane na placówce. Trafiamy do miejsc poświęconych coraz poważniejszym eksperymentom i powoli odkrywamy sekrety Black Mesa, schodząc coraz głębiej do jej wnętrza i odkrywając to, co się dzieje na zewnątrz. I choć ostatni poziom - Xen jest daleki od bycia ideałem, jego design wizulany mimo wszystko robi dobre wrażenie, zostawia nas z wieloma bardzo odmiennymi od reszty gry widokami i ma swój nietypowy, kosmiczny i bardzo organiczny wygląd. Jest niemal idealnym kontrastem od szarych i zimnych korytarzy laboratoryjnych Black Mesa.\n\nZ wiekiem oczywiście widać też coraz więcej pewnych problemów, nawet w oryginale. Wspomniany Xen, jak i niektóre rozdziały jak \"On the Rails\" są średniawe lub po prostu słabe. Przerywają one lepsze części gry a Xen stanowi dość słaby jak na tą grę finał, nieprzyjemnie się ciągnie, ma klasycznie niepotrzebne i niezbyt dobrze zaprojektowane sekcje platformowe i masę, ale to masę wrogów w środowisku gdzie ledwo można się zasłonić przed ich atakami, prawie jak gdyby nie wzięto w ogóle pod uwagę ich umiejętności, gdy projektowano ścieżkę do końca gry.\n\nCo jeszcze osobiście mnie denerwowało to obecność tony hitscanowych przeciwników, którzy są chyba moim najmniej ulubionym typem wroga w strzelankach. Brak możliwości unikania w jakimkolwiek stopniu ognia wroga i ich milisekundowa reakcja na nasze wyjście z zasłony niszczyła bardzo często chęć szybkiego i ostrego mordowania wrogów, na który prędkość poruszania i strzelania w grze by nam pozwoliła. Na to na szczęście cierpią jedynie ludzcy przeciwnicy, do kosmitów ciężko mi się przyczepić.\n\nMiałam też osobiście momentami kłopot z rozpoznaniem gdzie mam iść. Większość czasu nie było z tym problemu, bo dobra eksploracja terenu często otwierała nam kolejne ścieżki, niemal wszystko jest bardzo dobrze poprowadzone, patrząc, że gra nie posiada nawet milimetra wskaźnika drogi czy mapy. Muszę jednak wspomnieć o etapach pustynnych, gdzie szczerze miałam bardzo duży problem z zauważeniem ukrytych w ścianach tuneli. W ciemniejszych korytarzach łatwiej było zauważyć, jak gra nas prowadzi, ale na pustyni pełnej słońca wszystko zlewało się w jednolity kolor, a brak konkretnych cieni nie pomagał. \n\nPatrząc na to, z jakim staruszkiem mam do czynienia i na to, że był to mój pierwszy w życiu kontakt z tym tytułem, jestem w stanie patrzeć na te mniejsze lub większe problemy z przymrużeniem oka. Nie powinno się w końcu oceniać tytułu, patrząc na rok jej zagrania, a bardziej zdecydowanie na rok wydania. Na moje oko Half-Life zestarzał się bardzo dobrze pod wieloma względami, nie ma zbyt dużo sztywności czy dziwnego sterowania a siły dodaje mu na pewno ważna rola w historii powstawania gier wideo, jak i miejsce ojca uniwersum Half-Life, które jest jednym z najbardziej szanowanych przez graczy światów po dziś dzień i nadal zaskakuje pomimo tego, jak tragicznie długo trzeba czekać na kolejne odsłony. Nie potrafię powiedzieć, że gra zrobiła na mnie kosmiczne wrażenie, ale widzę, ile osiągnęła, gdy pierwszy raz wyszła na komputery osobiste. Co jak co ale większość czasu dobrze się bawiłam, zwiedzając Black Mesa, nawet jeśli nie jestem w stanie odtworzyć tego, jak wielkie wrażenie by ta gra zrobiła na mnie w 98 roku, to nadal była to bardzo edukacyjna i historyczna przygoda po początkach fabularyzowanych gier FPS.","timestamp_created":1613219561,"timestamp_updated":1613219561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86537625","author":{"steamid":"76561198104022315","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1613541097},"language":"schinese","review":"就是偶热会闪退，有人说是因为输入法的问题，我切换了会好一点，但是确实还是会闪退，但是不影响这个是个好游戏。","timestamp_created":1613217463,"timestamp_updated":1613217463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86536784","author":{"steamid":"76561198372054922","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1660496039},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life
