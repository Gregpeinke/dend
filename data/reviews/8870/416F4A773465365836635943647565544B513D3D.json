Each time you play through it, you will notice things that you didn't understand the first time through. The game will make more and more sense with each playthrough.

[SPOILER-FREE REVIEW]\n\nINTRO\nBioshock Infinie is a beautiful game that put you in Columbia, a city obove the clouds. It deliveres in every aspect and make for a truly enjoyable game.\n\nSTORY\nBioshock Infinite send you away to a vibrant and glorious world above the clouds; Columbia. Columbia is a city driven by religion, loyalty and... well propellers. As soon as you enter this uncanny realm you are faced with a people that devote their entire spectrum into religion; and of course their one true leader: Combstock. Combstock is the \"villian\" of Bioshock Infinite, and is trying to put a stop to YOU. Who are you? You are Mr. Dewitt. Dewitt is a character that has been forced to kidnap Combstock's daughter; Elizabeth. However she has in a Super Mario-esc way been trapped in a tower where she awaits to be saved by her true hero. The game manages well to capture the clear divine between Elizabeth and Dewitt. You are constantly seeing how Elizabeth has to face all these new revelations she explores whilst playing, and how it affects her. You start developing emotional connections to the characters and so you respond more easily to their actions. Simple things as Elizabeths haircut can show in what state of mind she is currently in. All these feelings become crutial at the end of the game, and without spoiling anything I can only say that it was memorable and made all the emotions feel essential.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nBioshock Infinite is a First Person Shooter and focuses it's gameplay around three core elements:\n- Guns\n- Vigors\n- Gears\n\nGUNS are your main weapon in Infinite, and vary from small one-handed pistols to big RPG's. When I played I found myself experimenting with different weapons all the time, and making all upgrades you did on one specifc gun transfer to any copy of that gun you found, made it easier for me to pick up new unique weapons that I found along the way. Even though I felt a bit frustrated at times when I found three special guns at once, and had to make a sacrifise to one of them and leave them behind, I would always find something to compensate for it. When I played, I also realised how the game tried to hint at me to use a special weapon they left for me to grab like a sniper rifle, and such where they designed for me to use it. This WOULD make it relativly blatant, however you are completely free to choose whatever playstyle you desire. Since I never really liked being stealthy in this game, even when the game purged me to be so, it still felt enjoyable and natural to blast everyone with a flaregun.\n\nVIGORS are special powers that transfered from the Bioshock I & II (Both in which I've played). Throughout the game you pick up different Vigors like Devil's Kiss, Murder of Crows, Possession, Shock Jockey and many more. The different vigors grant you unique abilities like being able to turn an enemy into your ally, or set up a fireball on the ground that explodes when enemies come close to it. All of these skills are run by salts, which is basically your \"mana\". Salts can be found through out the game like you would with guns, and medical kits. Vigors are, however, stuck with you once you learn them. They won't dissapear when you've run out of salts. The salts gave me a feeling of superiorety over my foes, and all where balanced into a way that made them understandable, and enjoyable.\n\nGEARS are different apparell that you pick up. They are built up by four categories; hats, tunics, leggings and boots. Wearing the different gears grants you minor boosts like a minor shiled boost, or a chance to light an enemy on fire when stabbing them. Although gears can be lifesaving at times, I didn't really pay close attention to what I was wearing and hardly changed because of it.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThere isn't really much I have to say about the graphics for this game, other then the obvious, which is that they are beautiful. All the colors are made vibrant and Columbia was prettier that I could ever imagine. The color pallete is, however, a bit varied from the predisessors but that is not a bad thing.\n\nSUMMARY\nBioshock Infinite is the best game I have ever played in my life. That is a big statement for any gamer to say, and I don't even feel bad about saying it. It offeres a fun and dynamic gameplay that most people would enjoy, with beatiful music, graphics and voiceacting. Infinite offers one of the best stories in any video game and immerses you into a beautiful and vibrant world.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1403722507,"timestamp_updated":1403722661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10805271","author":{"steamid":"76561197970514327","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":968,"last_played":1365318000},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games ever.

The pacing and the range of environments and characters keeps drawing you in. There are lots of lovely little details like the barbershop quartet or the miniature dramas being played out in the NPC dialogue you overhear as you pass. Normal difficulty is perhaps a little too easy; I kept waiting for the time when I would really have to learn how to use my full range of plasmids instead of just sticking with a couple, but that moment never came. Still, the fantastic rich world and quite compelling story kept bringing me back to see this game through in short order despite having many other games on the go at the same time.\n\nDLC is a mixed bag; the developers felt obliged to change up the gameplay to keep things fresh, but the result is less fluid and enjoyable, and of course the stories are much less deep. Personally I find Episode 1 to be much more involving despite a somewhat forced attempt to reinject mystery into the protagonist, and Episode 2 starts with a stunning set piece but the eventual game is a bit of a drag, keeping me going only because I want to see the conclusion of the storyline - but perhaps that's just my lack of ability at stealth games.

Bioshock always deliver on all three fronts and the visuals are particularly beautiful in this game. \n\nThe downside, however, is the combat and, more specifically, the AI. It's pretty deadful and felt like a really pretty game of Duck Hunt at times. Some of the powers in the games also aren't that great. In previous entries, the plasmid powers added an extra layer of depth to combat- especially when tackling trickier foes. That effect is lost in this iteration of Bioshock, possibly due to the lack of enemy variety as opposed to lack of powers readily available. You're rarely forced to think outside the box so it becomes a 'one power kills most enemies' kind of tactic.\n\nAll in all, it's a great experience. The story is pretty decent and the ending is pretty good (although not as mind blowing as people had me believe).

Fantastic soundtrack, Fantastic DLC (at least in terms of Burial at sea, not so much with Clash in the Clouds), Awesome voice acting, blah blah blah I could go on and on saying everything that everyone else has said. Though, with all of that mind, the combat in this game IS very...meh. Nothing terrible, but average at least. Now, I didn't have too much problem with it because I was so enthralled by the story, I do however know people who just could not finish the game do to the combat. If you're not a story person and strictly all about mechanics, keep your distance. Everyone else, what are you doing?
