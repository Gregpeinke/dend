Despite being made by Gearbox just like Opposing Force was, I think Blue Shift is the better of the two, because the level design and gameplay is a lot more tolerable in general. In OpFor the combat is awful, because the balance between the player and the enemies is almost nonexistent. In OpFor enemies will hitscan you to death whilst simultaneously being massive bullet sponges. Every firefight seemed like a practice in save-scumming. This game feels a lot more 'natural' in comparison.

You only see the old enemies, barely some of them in fact, and no new ones or bosses. You get a limited slew of weapons unlike the original Half Life.

Тоже средний, но намного лучше, чем в основной игре.\n-Отличный саундтрэк, из-за которого могут пойти мурашки. Композиторы поработали на ура.\n-Уровни. Здесь они не такие затянутые, как в основной игре.\nМинусы:\n-Когда загружаешь сейв, то персонаж начинает всегда сам стрелять.
