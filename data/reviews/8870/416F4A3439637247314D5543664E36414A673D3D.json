The combat was a bit lacking, but still ok. The story was really good. You really need to pay attention to what's going on and it encourages multiple play throughs to better understand the story.  I think I still only understand what happened in terms of the broad strokes and not the finer nuances. Even Burial at Sea, which mostly takes place in Rapture, adds even more interesting layers to the story. It is a story that made me think after it was over and I do appreciate stories that can do that. The game is mostly very linear. There are big areas to explore and each area does have an optional side-quest. It does kind of strike a decent balance between the puzzle box structure of levels from the FPS glory days of yore and the straight line approach to level design of today. There is definitely some searching around to do, but there is still a lot of just moving the character forward.  That said, a lot of the linearity of the level design has to do with incorporating the narrative into an actual video game. While playing through this game, it made me think that the complex story was better suited for a movie or book. The actual game part has to take a break for long and frequent segments for plot development and general exposition. While the story was really good, it isn't necessarily fun to have to continually hold down the walk forward button just to experience the story continuing. It's like I'm watching a movie and I have to constantly hand-crank the projector to keep it powered on. After over a decade of trying to marry gameplay with movies, the results feel like the worst of both worlds. Watered-down gameplay with low-end CGI movies. But, I do recommend BioShock Infinite. The story and world are definitely worth experiencing and while the weapons weren't anything special, the combat was ok.","timestamp_created":1398986058,"timestamp_updated":1402739885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9993011","author":{"steamid":"76561198025207897","num_games_owned":306,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":167,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":167,"last_played":1396220134},"language":"english","review":"This is a game about Mormons in the Nineteenth Century that captured a member of the cast from Sliders and John Marsten has to save her.","timestamp_created":1398985022,"timestamp_updated":1398985022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9992369","author":{"steamid":"76561198047434721","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1050,"last_played":1398974976},"language":"english","review":"So good.

If you like good shooting mechanics, don't buy this game.\n\nI love this game. It has a beautiful design and an amazing story so far (haven't finished it yet, had to upgrade my pc). It's a nice sidestep from the original two bioshock games, and I'm convinced they went in the right direction with choosing a different setting for Infinite. The old city of Rapture was really grim and dark, but after two games, it was time to move on. The world of Bioshock: Infinite is in big contrast with Rapture, quite literally. The graphics are amazing, and combined with the art design, the game looks just amazing!\n\nThe gameplay however has some flaws: The combat system isn't really that good. The weapons are pretty generic: Pistols, shotguns, machine guns, rpg's, the standard stuff. The two weapon system is a love-hate relationship for me. I don't like that you have just 2 weapons, and in a lot of situations, you really need the versatility of multiple weapons, because the 2 you have at the time are useless against certain enemies. It's not always a problem, since a lot of times there are multiple weapons lying around so you can switch up your weapons a lot. Positive side is that you have to plan ahead a bit and consider what situations you'll be going into, and scramble for weapons to adapt.\n\nAs far as Elizabeth goes, I actually like the idea of a character that follows you around and helps you at certain times. A lot of times she saved me with some extra ammo (which also makes the 2 gun problem a little less annoying) or a health pack. It's also good that she's not an escort character and she's actually not killable. \n\nThe skylines are also a nice little addition to the game. They give you a lot of mobility and really gives you the feeling of speed.\n\nI bought it when it was on sale and since then i haven't regretted buying it a single moment.

Either way its worth the buy.\n\nOverall I would give this a 8/10.","timestamp_created":1398775082,"timestamp_updated":1398775082,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9969583","author":{"steamid":"76561198069983187","num_games_owned":672,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":526,"last_played":1510181663},"language":"russian","review":"Замечательный сюжет,но очень затянутые и скучные бои!","timestamp_created":1398768322,"timestamp_updated":1398768322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9969036","author":{"steamid":"76561198095079081","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2081,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1130,"last_played":1469728367},"language":"koreana","review":"근3년안에 산게임중 제일재밌었네요","timestamp_created":1398761600,"timestamp_updated":1398761600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9968461","author":{"steamid":"76561198101196598","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":557,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1561825087},"language":"russian","review":"класная игра","timestamp_created":1398753415,"timestamp_updated":1398753415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.430123090744018555","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9968124","author":{"steamid":"76561197998007257","num_games_owned":394,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":872,"last_played":1398748200},"language":"english","review":"If you like first person shooters with great characters and a twist ending, Bioshock Infinite is for you!","timestamp_created":1398747893,"timestamp_updated":1398747893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9967890","author":{"steamid":"76561198119380666","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":644,"last_played":1402448133},"language":"english","review":"Honesty one of the best games I have ever played.","timestamp_created":1398744456,"timestamp_updated":1398744456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9967348","author":{"steamid":"76561198081481707","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":571,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":522,"last_played":1458707085},"language":"english","review":"great game, well rounded and would recomend to everyone","timestamp_created":1398737695,"timestamp_updated":1398737695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9967133","author":{"steamid":"76561198011680398","num_games_owned":416,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1714,"last_played":1396225941},"language":"english","review":"BioShock Infinite is a very pretty game, in all regards, from the envirnoment, to the characters, to the plot, and everything in between.  BioShock shows what dedicated artist can do given time, money and proper management.  The major weakness then is the gameplay, fights feel repeative and boring, kind of mundane.  Worst of all, with all the work that has gone into the rest of the game the lack of artistic merit in gameplay becomes very noticable.  That said the majority of the game involves exploring the world and the characters that inhabit it so in the balance Bioshock is still a fantastic game.","timestamp_created":1398735402,"timestamp_updated":1398735402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9967099","author":{"steamid":"76561198046678697","num_games_owned":371,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2461,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1117,"last_played":1605462430},"language":"english","review":"Still my favorite game of all time.
