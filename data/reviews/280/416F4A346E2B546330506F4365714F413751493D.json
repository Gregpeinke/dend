life echo en el motor source de half life 2 en primera instancia puede parecer una buena idea y mas a un, un remake de uno de los juegos mas influyentes en los fps, que salio mal?\n\nPuntos a favor:\n-El nuevo motor le permite al juego tomar un segundo aire, y una cierta mejora en la inteligencia artificial (hasta cierto punto)\n-Las luces que se le implementaron al juego embellecen a un mas el juego, esto se puede notar en algunas partes del juego, y donde mas se luce esta mejora es en XEN, se ve simplemente precioso con las luces.\n-corre en cualquier ordenador.\n-La inteligencia de los enemigos mejoro... tal vez demasiado, no recordaba que el modo normal fuese el dark souls de los half life.\n\nPuntos en contra:\n-El primer punto malo que note y el que comenzó una serie de fallos en el juego fue el cambio de manejo de las armas, me explico, la metralleta tiene una nueva mecánica, la cual consiste en que si te mantienes mucho tiempo disparando el arma se desequilibra obligándote a disparar de una manera distinta, la cámara se moverá hacia arriba y esto es algo que no me gusto ya que gracias a eso al llegar a xen me quede sin balas y fue un martirio acabar esa parte.\n-Lo segundo que note es que la inteligencia artificial estaba bugeada de algunas maneras muy estúpidas, algunos ejemplos con los que me encontré fueron, la vez en la que el scrip de el monstruo de tentáculos ciego (no recuerdo su nombre) tenia que matar al guardia pero en vez el guardia de alejo a un lugar seguro, la vez en la que un guardia se me unió y me seguía bastante bien pero este no podía atacar a nadie y no paraba de gritar de dolor incluso si no le estaban disparando, lo cual quiere decir que el sonido de cierto modo tan bien esta bugeado.\n-Los fondos del menú no van acorde a lo que paso en tu ultima partida como si pasaba en half life 2, ya saben indie poco conocido que casualmente se hiso en el mismo motor que este juego.\n\nEstoy muyyyyyyy decepcionado con este juego, cuando lo acabe fue un alivio para mi ya que me avía quitado una espinita que tenia desde que compre la valve pack, tenia las expectativas altas por el nuevo motor que presumía tener, pero cuando lo jugue me di cuenta de que no valia la pena.\n\ny tampoco los problemas que acabo de mencionar son solo míos, investigando me di cuenta de que los problemas si eran del juego ya que avía hasta vídeos de youtube que documentaban los mismos fallos que acabo de mencionar, hasta la propia comunidad a puesto mano en algo completamente innecesario en crear un mod que soluciona todos estos fallos.\nEn lo personal no e jugado el mod pero por lo que se, se puede encontrar muy fácil.\nHalf life es una de mis franquicias favoritas de toda mi vida, y ver cosas como esta solo hacen querer mas la 3era parte ya mismo.\n\nPara finalizar puedo decir con toda seguridad que este juego no vale lo que cuesta normalmente en steam actual mente, yo tube suerte y cerebro para comprarlo en una rebaja en el paquete de valve, recomiendo mucho que esperen a una rebaja o algo, si es que piensan adquirirlo, y en primer lugar este juego debería de venir con el original gratis.\nSi quieren probar un half life bueno recomiendo que compren black mesa (el cual también estoy ansioso por probar) o si no tienen un pc muy bueno recomiendo el mod para el half life 1 original echo por el grupo trusty crowvar, el cual añade nuevas gráficas y sonidos.\n\n10% recomendado \nEs mejor comprar otra cosa con ese dinero.","timestamp_created":1627072308,"timestamp_updated":1627072308,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96246992","author":{"steamid":"76561198307699287","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":432,"last_played":1632078418},"language":"spanish","review":"si","timestamp_created":1627059449,"timestamp_updated":1627059449,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96244443","author":{"steamid":"76561198185535241","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1627056221},"language":"english","review":"Played

of this game.\n\nFew bugs that i have noticed:\nThere have been a few visual glitches, and especially on Chapter 13 is “Forget about Freeman!” i could not see anything for a while in this chapter.\nI've noticed that walking in certain places may not trigger enemies this might be cause it is an old game, you can simply not go somewhere or pass really quickly and you can save on health and ammo basically just by skipping some of the enemies, you might not notice this but after playing the game a while i figured out some of their patterns and when i died i skipped the enemies a few times.\n\nEDIT:\nAnd even in the first few stages i encountered more bugs in the original version than in this one, so i'm pretty sure it's cause the game is old, worth playing. \n\nNOTE:\nMy

It's Half-Life 1.\n2. Not only is it Half-Life 1, but it has incredible lighting and water, alongside Source engine ragdolls being Source engine ragdolls.\n3. It's completely broken. That's the main reason I love it. Floating scientist, weird sound issues, and whatever the hell happened to the water in Residue Processing.\n4. The flashlight is actually usable.\n\nHOWEVER: I have some complaints.\n1. The movement isn't Source engine movement, and it isn't GoldSrc movement. I knoe that the movement had to be modified from Half-Life 2's movement so that certain jumps would be possible, but the game just feels off. It feels too loose, but also too tight at the same time.\n2. The price is still $10 USD. It somewhat makes sense since it's just Half-Life 1 in the Source engine, but all the fun problems should probably have it be priced at $5 USD or less.\n3. Everything is shiny if you use multicore rendering. Multicore rendering also causes Residue Processing if it's on, but that's a positive in my opinion.\n4. The SMG has really weird recoil.\n\nOverall,\nI love how broken it is, but as a game, no. Don't, especially as your first experience with Half-Life as a series or Half-Life 1.
