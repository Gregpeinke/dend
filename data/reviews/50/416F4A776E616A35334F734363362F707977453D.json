That said, I was expecting something else. I've experienced many FPS games in these years, I've seen it all. But the Half-Life expansions have really missed my library, until this recent summer sale when I purchased the Valve Complete Pack.\n\n[h1] The Best Half-Life there is [/h1]\n\nFor some, that may be an overstatement, but hear me out. I've now played ALL the half-life games. HL1, HL2, Blue Shift, Opposing Force, Decay (PS2) and even Uplink (the demo to HL1). But Opposing Force did something better than the others, it gave this series a true personality. \n\nLet me explain:\n\nSo the game is played from the perspective on Cpl. Adrian Shepard, a HECU Marine sent to investigate the Black Mesa incident once a phenomenon know as a \"resonance cascade\" allowed for a sudden alien invasion. The unit that Shepard is sent with is kinda late, as the game begins sometime after the chapter \"Surface Tension\" in Half-Life. The story connects instantly, as one of the Apache helicopter that accompanies Shepard's squad flies off to intercept Gordon Freeman, who is now outside and \"on the loose\" trying to fight his way to the Lambda Complex. Shortly after, your helicopter gets shot down and the fight immediately begins to erupt. Marines vs Aliens, all-out-war.\n\nYou wake up after an unknown amount of time, sometime before the beginning of \"Forget about Freeman\". The story becomes no longer after investigating the attack, but getting out of the facility. The situation is out of control, everyone runs for their lives, including the marines.\n\nFrom here on out, from the order to \"get out\" and all the way until the ending, you must fight through Black Mesa with you military skills and some other help. This \"help\" comes in the form of your fellow marine friends, who will assist you in combat. There are a couple of classes that can help you. The Medic (who heals you), the engineer (who opens doors for you) and the heavy weapons guy (a dude with an LMG who kills everything in his path). There are also some generic soldiers like the gas mask guy and the lieutenant, who are both useless in combat, but I'll touch on that later.\n\nThe way that this expansion is the definitive Half-Life experience is due to the addition of many more things that weren't present on Half-Life. New aliens (a giant tank-like alien, a creature that shoots some sort of electrical weapon, and a smaller creature with claws that can leap to you and kill you in a couple of hits), new weapons (LMG, Sniper, Deagle, some sort of fish that instakills anything, a barnacle that can be used to attach to walls and climb unreachable aliens, and a launcher that can teleport you or other creatures to Xen), and also cool new bosses like a giant worm-like creature and the final one, which is a colossal amalgamation between all other aliens (i think). All of this is topped by the Black Ops soldiers, your sworn enemies, who are even deadlier than in the original game. There are multiple types of Black Ops, from the regular ninjas to the Black Ops soldiers, who are heavily armored, take longer to kill and can easily flank you and kill you if you're not strategic enough.\n\nThe puzzle mechanics of Half-Life have been reduced a bit, there's way less platforming and instead the expansion focuses more on combat rather than just jumping through levels, but the supplement of new enemies and weapons provides for a much more fun experience. All of the action sequences are really well done, you always feel on the edge, running and dodging bullets from the Black Ops, and outsmarting the aliens at every step. You will feel accomplished, overwhelmed, a bit tired, but that's what Black Mesa does to you, I guess.\n\nMany themes are picked up in Opposing Force, and your main objective of investigating the attack (you never got the order to silence the witnesses, so killing scientists is not one of your priorities, neither is Freeman, since the order was to \"forget about freeman\") suddenly become about escaping the facility, later about disarming the nuke that the Black Ops set up in order to end the facilty once and for all, and at the end, you're supposed to finish off the \"nastiest thing yet\", the final boss in order to escape Black Mesa and aid in saving the world (although Mr.Freeman did that already, I guess).\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nSo did Opposing Force live up to my expectations? Yes, it did. I came back to this franchise years later, and I finished the first game's trilogy with a bang. O.F. was that bang, exactly what the series needed, and the amount of content is incredible. \n\nSome cons? Sure, the AI of your companions is a bit crap (they will get stuck in doors and not attack enemies) and also some pacing issues at the beginning but overall the game is solid.\n\n[h1] 9.5/10 [/h1]\n\n","timestamp_created":1562272706,"timestamp_updated":1562272706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53566250","author":{"steamid":"76561198814491706","num_games_owned":457,"num_reviews":261,"playtime_forever":525,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":525,"last_played":1562268684},"language":"russian","review":"[h1]По новой[/h1]\n[i]Было приятно увидеть, уже известную нам историю, \nПод другим углом со стороны спецназовца Шепарда. \nБольше пушек, да и верёвки могут быть применены. \nИз недочётов подчеркну, что не всегда запускается, \nИ процесс игры может существовать без корня \"hl.exe\", \nИ сразу не поймёшь почему ты в игре, но игры нету.\nВ остальном всё весьма не плохо, советую поиграть[/i]","timestamp_created":1562269370,"timestamp_updated":1562274389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.564233183860778809","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53555478","author":{"steamid":"76561198056324069","num_games_owned":723,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":283,"last_played":1562264283},"language":"english","review":"A neat side story showing a different perspective to Half-Life.
