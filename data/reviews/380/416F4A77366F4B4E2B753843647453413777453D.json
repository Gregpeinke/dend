Valve анонсировали одно крупное дополнение — Half-Life 2: Aftermath, по аналогии с Opposing Force или Blue Shift. Но, затем решили выпустить сразу несколько мелких дополнений, названных эпизодами, через (как они тогда думали) менее продолжительные периоды времени. Первый эпизод увидел свет в мае 2006 года и, на первый взгляд, предлагал куда меньше нововведений, чем истории Шэпарда или Барни. Нового оружия не было, единственный новый монстр представлял собой инфицированного хэдкрабом солдата Combine (остроумно названного Аликс «Zombine»), а продолжительность была в районе четырех часов.\n\nПосле оказалось, что дополнение продолжало историю с того же момента, на котором завершилась основная игра, а авторы вложились в дизайн уровней и построение уникальных и запоминающихся ситуаций на них. Например, начало эпизода, где нам надо вернутся обратно в рушащуюся Цитадель, и робо-пес Аликс не придумывает ничего лучше, чем закинуть нас обратно в старом «Рафике». Естественно, строение столкновения с таким снарядом не выдерживает и мы дополнительно пролетаем довольно большую часть секций башни, ломая все на своем пути. Другой пример, ожидание очень медленно едущего лифта в одном из подвалов, на шум от которого сбегаются десятки зомби. В том числе и Zombine, которые даже находясь в безвыходной ситуации, сопротивляются влиянию паразита и присутствию повстанцев, и могут подорвать себя гранатой, пытаясь «убить двух зайцев» сразу.\n\nТакже, мы лишились возможности управлять насекомыми, а дыры на подземной парковке, из которых лезут муравьиные львы придется «затыкать» автомобилями, используя гравипушку. И, вот, из таких мелких, запоминающихся эпизодов состоит, собственно, весь Episode One. Весь сюжет, опять, представляет из себя буквально пару глав: выбраться из Цитадели и спастись из City-17. Правда, теперь Аликс сопровождает нас на всем протяжении игры и способна постоять за себя. Только на то, что она сделает за вас всю работу не рассчитывайте — здоровье у нее, все же, ограниченное. А, так, после непродолжительного прохождения нас вновь ожидает клиффхенгер.","timestamp_created":1580508028,"timestamp_updated":1580508028,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553045153617858887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62757804","author":{"steamid":"76561199001608866","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1580508925},"language":"latam","review":"me gusto el juego es bueno y sigue la historia como el half lie 2","timestamp_created":1580507901,"timestamp_updated":1580507901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62749986","author":{"steamid":"76561198438518515","num_games_owned":235,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":273,"last_played":1580505025},"language":"hungarian","review":"nagyon jó kis játék! nagyon jó kis lövöldözös játék és kicsit kell bene gondolokozni is. nagyon de nagyon jó","timestamp_created":1580495940,"timestamp_updated":1580495940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62744531","author":{"steamid":"76561198161826984","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":528,"last_played":1590474029},"language":"russian","review":"Короткая жаль..","timestamp_created":1580488143,"timestamp_updated":1580488143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62742140","author":{"steamid":"76561198273399053","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":1112,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":104,"last_played":1585467787},"language":"polish","review":"Stupid KI and Bugs.\nTrash Game.","timestamp_created":1580485134,"timestamp_updated":1580485134,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545438289642334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62718472","author":{"steamid":"76561198022130894","num_games_owned":374,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":193,"last_played":1580739609},"language":"english","review":"Great game.

Sin estropear la trama, digamos que Alyx se mantiene fuera de peligro, y los dos se reencuentran rápidamente en la base de una Ciudadela humeante. Después de establecer un vínculo ascendente con los viejos amigos, el Dr. Kleiner y el padre de Alyx, Eli, descubres que la Ciudadela está a punto de quedarse sin aliento, y para que Alyx y muchos otros ciudadanos tengan más tiempo para escapar de la Ciudad 17, tendrás que volver a intentar retrasar el colapso.\n\nUna vez que hayas retrasado el colapso de la Ciudadela (y hayas obtenido información adicional sobre lo que el Combine está haciendo en el proceso), la segunda mitad del Episodio Uno se centra en los esfuerzos de Gordon y Alyx para sacar el culo de la Ciudad 17. Por supuesto, la fuga es todo menos simple, ya que primero te obligan a la clandestinidad donde tienes que lidiar con cangrejos, zombis y luego te diriges a las calles donde te arrodillas en combate con soldados Combine, que no están muy contentos con la información que robaron de la Ciudadela.\n\nProbablemente el mayor cambio introducido en el Episodio Uno es cómo Alyx lucha al lado de Gordon durante la mayor parte del juego. Valve toca las notas correctas con Alyx; ella no molesta a Gordon, puede seguirte de manera competente e incluso proporciona un apoyo útil la mayor parte del tiempo. \n\nHalf-Life 2: Episode One ofrece exactamente lo que esperarías de una expansión de Half-Life : regresa al entorno intrigante de Ciudad 17 y ofrece muchas secuencias de acción y acertijos bien elaborados.","timestamp_created":1580432048,"timestamp_updated":1580432283,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62695492","author":{"steamid":"76561198041578900","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1580423269},"language":"english","review":"Very short.
