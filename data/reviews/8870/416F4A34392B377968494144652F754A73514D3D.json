A story twist most people won't see coming.\n\nThe combat does exhibit a wonderful sense of growth, however. You find various clothing items that grant you additional passive buffs, such as turning enemies you leap on into human torches. You spend the coins you pilfer from corpses and cash registers on vigor and weapon upgrades, though you ultimately must pick and choose the direction you prefer, since you can't afford every possibility. \n\nThe cons of this game are that it uses checkpoints rather than manual save points, which is pretty annoying since you have to pass a certain threshold in order to be able to save. But it is still a great game to play.\n\nThe conclusion I came to for this game is that BioShock Infinite is something special that no one should miss.","timestamp_created":1649846483,"timestamp_updated":1649846483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.436781615018844604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113776762","author":{"steamid":"76561199075964785","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1020,"last_played":1655288577},"language":"schinese","review":"射击手感很好","timestamp_created":1649831968,"timestamp_updated":1649831968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113774606","author":{"steamid":"76561199120761295","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":946,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":801,"last_played":1649961273},"language":"spanish","review":"Una cosa impresionantemente bien hecha.","timestamp_created":1649826471,"timestamp_updated":1649826471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113773068","author":{"steamid":"76561198068910986","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2233,"last_played":1601023402},"language":"koreana","review":"3d멀미 없으면 무조건 하세요","timestamp_created":1649823076,"timestamp_updated":1649823076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113768275","author":{"steamid":"76561198871901502","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":645,"last_played":1649813666},"language":"schinese","review":"YYDS","timestamp_created":1649813819,"timestamp_updated":1649813819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113764852","author":{"steamid":"76561198166434108","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1649806657},"language":"turkish","review":"Gerek hikayesi ile gerek oynanış itibari ile çok iyi bir oyun.

Its themes on the dangers of white nationalism, racism, classism, and the horseshoe theory on diametrically opposed extremism is engrossing, however the plot shifts away from this in the second half of the game to focus more on a more personal plot about the two main characters, the multiverse, and how to deal with the consequences of ones actions. You will see the latter half and ending as one of the greatest stories for a game ever written or a pretentious plot line that eats itself without really resolving anything. The same can be said about its DLC \"Buried at Sea\" which is duology that is set in Rapture before the civil war that destroys the city before the first game. While the first episode is an interesting examination of Rapture society before its fall, the second episode relies on you to the player to be brain dead in order to accept the stupidity of the characters actions. The conclusion to the second episode is a dark, gloomy end that invalidates the themes of the first game to begin with and in fact validates Andrew Ryan's extreme isolationist beliefs.\n\nThe gameplay while simplified over the second title is enjoyable, visceral, and fast paced. The new powers they have added to the game make combining abilities easy and fun. The game comes with a DLC mode called \"Clash in the Clouds\" for those that wish to play an arena like mode to fully take advantage of the gameplay and test their abilities against every increasing difficult waves of enemies. The artistry of the game is amazing with a great attention to detail that only fails when it comes to the character models that populate the world itself. The areas you visit are varied and truly stand out from one another that exemplifies the World Fair in the sky theme that they were going for.\n\nBioshock Infinite is not a perfect game but one people should play due to its artistry, strong voice acting, and examination of American Exceptionalism, racism, and lesser known American history events such as the Boxer Rebellion and Wounded Knee. The story may be amazing or infuriating depending but it is unforgettable nonetheless.","timestamp_created":1649615406,"timestamp_updated":1649615406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113650326","author":{"steamid":"76561198271645507","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":827,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":827,"last_played":1648668201},"language":"english","review":"This game was a great piece of art.

You play as Booker Dewitt, a mercenary who sets out to a secluded cloud city Columbia, to retrieve a girl called Elizabeth and pay off his debt to shady people.\n\nThe world built in previous Bioshock games were already on a high-ticket level, although Infinite breathes a fresh air with its new premise. The introducing chapters on the story certainly shows the strong side of the world building, augmented by the game's engine for stunning graphics, for those looking for a great showcase of lighting, water effects and level design. The amount of NPC models, peripheral dialogues and richness of the observable 1910's American society presented manages to pull me into the world full of life. It's worth mentioning how much effort the devs put into the way my companion Elizabeth behaves to the surrounding level parts, even as vividly during the idle moments.\n\nInfinite has gotten some combat system overhaul; the main thing is that you will be limited to carrying only 2 firearms with you and rely on whatever drops or environment that you'd like to switch to. For that reason, some gamers have a beef with such a degradation from previous titles. Personally, I'm not bothered by this added gun management factor, considering that the game is already has got the ammo and weapon balance right throughout the story mode.\n\nI might recommend Bioshock Infinite for its style, graphics and gameplay, but it still suffers from the overambitious use of lore and complexity of writing that robbed the previous Bioshock games the intriguing value of experience. I still find it hard to care about the plot here as well, although I must give positive points for the thought-provoking twist during the final chapters that tie in with the prequels. In the future, I might see myself come back to this game by watching on Youtube for references in the future.","timestamp_created":1649591694,"timestamp_updated":1649591694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113629669","author":{"steamid":"76561198274248141","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1067,"last_played":1653563028},"language":"schinese","review":"第九艺术,FPS集大成者，这以后的FPS都没有达到这个高度","timestamp_created":1649587902,"timestamp_updated":1649587902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496183216571807861","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113624720","author":{"steamid":"76561198304981048","num_games_owned":933,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":801,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":801,"last_played":1649545517},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game, not quite as good as Bioshock 1, but still an amazing experience.","timestamp_created":1649580522,"timestamp_updated":1649580522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113623953","author":{"steamid":"76561198978384021","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":462,"last_played":1645104077},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite\nBy: Irrational Games\n2013 (2022)\n\nYou are Booker De Witt a late 20th century-style bad ass. You are hired to save Elizabeth, who is being held captive in a tower in the flying city of Columbia. \n\nBioshock Infinite is a run and gun type game that likes to focus way more on the gameplay than the story. The gameplay is very boring and almost made me want to quit playing entirely. You can choose between four different assault rifles, two different rpg's and maybe two or three pistols that you can use. There are spells you can cast, called 'vigors', which are actually pretty fun to use. However, none of the enemies require you to use a vigor to defeat them, so you end up not using them at all.\n\nThe graphics are fine and have a fun cartoonish look to them without making the game feel goofy. The aesthetic of the game is pretty unique and quite appealing. Columbia is a gorgeous, colourful city suspended high above the clouds which makes it feel fantastical and impressive. However, at times the game gets pretty grimm and manages to unnerve you, but then resorts to jump scares instead of actual horror, which is disappointing.\n\nThere's a great variety of shops to be seen on the streets but not once did I come across an apartment. This makes the locations you go to feel more like levels and less like a cohesive world where people actually live.\nThe backtracking in this game is annoying as hell: You defeat all the enemies, get to the end of the level, only to be told you have to go right back to the beginning and then back to the end again to progress to the next area. \n\nThe last 30 minutes of the game were the most enjoyable. The game slows down it's pace and focusses on the story, which turns out to be quite interesting. I wish Bioshock Infinite implemented more of it's story in between the runnin' and gunnin'. This would have made the game much less boring to play and would have made me enjoy it a tad bit more. Unfortunately, it didn't. \n\n\nBioshock Infinite: 4.5","timestamp_created":1649579179,"timestamp_updated":1649579179,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113623577","author":{"steamid":"76561199259890647","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":909,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1656262781},"language":"polish","review":"","timestamp_created":1649578589,"timestamp_updated":1649578589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113622442","author":{"steamid":"76561199168281478","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":659,"last_played":1647888988},"language":"english","review":"D'BEST","timestamp_created":1649576627,"timestamp_updated":1649576627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113616098","author":{"steamid":"76561197960575030","num_games_owned":266,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":750,"last_played":1522375245},"language":"english","review":"The game itself is ok I guess.

Would recommend\n\nEdit: After playing Burial at Sea Episode 2, I still enjoy it. It was weird, though. The DLC is a stealth game. Still fun, and a nice change of pace.

This game is worse than both other Bioshock games, \nThey removed the mechanics that made the original games great. (Minor spoilers for the original games).\n\nNegatives: \n* Hacking is now a \"plasmid\" / \"vigor\" and does not feel rewarding at all. \n* There is only one ending which is almost non-effected by your actions. \n* 2 Weapon slots is incredibly annoying and only causes me to not experiment with strategies.\n* The first two games had side objectives (the little/big sisters), this game has only a bit of exploring.\n* Autosave is bad/unstable, sometimes it saves 2 times per minute, sometimes it saves once 30 minutes. \n\nPositives: \n* The game looks absolutely stunning for its age and can almost be a next gen game with its visuals. \n* The new grappling hook is very fun to use.\n* Although worse than the first two, the combat is still pretty good. \n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1649443679,"timestamp_updated":1649443679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113536835","author":{"steamid":"76561199023126644","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":586,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":586,"last_played":1648872827},"language":"english","review":"Dogshit story, predictable gameplay, elizabeth is a sketchy copout mechanic and grapple combat is stupid. Daisy Fitzroy is the lamest form of Black representation I've ever came across in a video game (the bar is so stupidly low) and it's sickening the leader of a revolutionary uprising was paralleled to basically a Henry Ford that creates magical drugs (because she has a weird obsession with... killing white children?). I don't want to finish this dogshit game and I hope no one ever looks at this as a legitimate example of a video game.
