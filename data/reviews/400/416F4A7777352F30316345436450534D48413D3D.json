Period. \n\nEven now, so many years after it's release, I continue to play this game, and love it every bit of it. It's unique, polished, and damn fun to play. \n\nThe game uses physics that have been tweaked from those of the Source engine's regular capability to support absolutely brilliant potential for puzzles and stunts, and the controls that you use to navigate these are tight as all hell, enabling for a smooth experience. The visuals, while somewhat dated, hold up decently and still provide for some atmospheric tension in the game's second act, with well designed textures and stages, and some nifty HDR lighting patched in for added flare. The most prominent aspect however is the games narrative, one that amuses the role of seemingly omniscient AI, GLaDOS. Her witty but sadistic humour is the driving force behind the story, and one that provides constant tension and wit until the finale.\n\nIt is short, however. And I mean really short. On my first play through, it clocked in to roughly over an hour and a half, start to finish. But it's still better than most linear 1st Person games. The replay value is not the greatest, with only a few challenges to play on your second run, and the environments you experience are not as varied or interesting as you would hope, instead limited to white corridors and rooms, and then later on slightly less futuristic corridors and rooms. However, this is simply not enough to hinder the overall experience.\n\nDespite its short length, Portal still deserves a place in my games list, and hopefully yours too...
