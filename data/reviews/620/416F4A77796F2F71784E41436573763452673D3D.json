I enjoyed the first one immensely, but I think I love the sequel even more.  More puzzles with different dynamics added in and interesting characters really build on what the first game offers.  I love GLaDoS (she's as snarky as ever if even more), Wheatley and Cave Johnson.  It's a really good, solid game overall.  The only downside is that it doesn't really have much for replayability unless you do some of the co-op stuff.  And even then, once you've gotten through the co-op with a friend, there's not much more past that.  But overall, I highly recommend Portal 2, it's one of the best games out there, I think.  \n\n(I know, it shows that I've only played the game for seven minutes on Steam but I've completed the game and more on the XBox 360 version.)","timestamp_created":1445902785,"timestamp_updated":1445902785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544450700283050537","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18702743","author":{"steamid":"76561198003474878","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1346,"last_played":1577613005},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра!

There's more dialogue this time around which actually explains what's going on, along with the usual amusing banter.\n\n+ The puzzles in Portal 2 are leaps and bounds ahead of the first Portal. They are more intricate, less predictable and require the use of multiple strategies in order to progress. They're also greater in number than the meagre 19 offered in Portal. Furthermore, Valve has created some new, interesting gameplay mechanics. The introduction of repulsion gel (which allows you to jump very high), propulsion gel (which gives you the ability to run extremely fast) and conversion gel (which alters any physical surface it touches to become portable), results in a varied, distinct gameplay experience.\n\n+ The graphics are a step up from Portal, which is nice.\n+ Co-op mode for those who enjoy playing with friends.\n\n[h1]Negatives:[/h1]\n\n- Only 10-15 hours worth of content (singleplayer), which is quite short, especially when similar puzzle games like the Talos Principle have a solid 30 hours +\n\n- Some elements of the puzzles in Portal 2 were made to be intentionally deceiving, at least in my view. The main culprits were parts of the environment (grates, pipes) obstructing my view of surfaces where I could fire portals. I could logically deduce a puzzle with ease, had I know such surfaces existed. Instead, I was left scratching my head for an hour, attempting to get through an unsolvable puzzle. Not my idea of fun.\n\n- The story of Portal 2 is fine, but in contrast to other first person puzzle games like the Talos Principle, it becomes clear that it cannot measure up, to any degree. The Talos Principle combined a deep, meaningful and intriguing plot with important decision making, something Portal 2 doesn't do.\n\nOverall Score: 7.5/10\n\nPortal 2 is a pretty decent game and there's nothing intrinstically wrong with the puzzles or storyline, other than its longevity and perhaps its linearity. Only when you analyse it in comparison to other puzzle games like the Talos Principle, can you identify its weaknesses. Portal 2 can never meet the level of quality the Talos Principle delivers in its puzzles and its story (comparatively speaking) is lame.\n\nNevertheless, I do recommend Portal 2 for anyone who hasn't yet played it. A 95/100 Metacritic score is unwarranted, but it's still a cool adventure.\n\nPurchasing on sale is a must.","timestamp_created":1445839658,"timestamp_updated":1486617917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519553065299987793","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18689096","author":{"steamid":"76561197998926239","num_games_owned":414,"num_reviews":145,"playtime_forever":573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":560,"last_played":1646113834},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego, mucho mejor que portal 1, recomendado para jugar en una pantalla 3D","timestamp_created":1445824200,"timestamp_updated":1445824200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18688774","author":{"steamid":"76561198232484904","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1933,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":289,"last_played":1526964753},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 was a beautiful game!

Half-Lifem a Portalem. Obe maji neskutecne osobity cool feeling a i kdyz Source engine neni z nejnovejsich, Portal 2 vypada fantasticky. Miluju tu stylovost, ty scenerie a vize, ktere predvadi. Kilometry pod zemi, presto obri prostory plne sci-fi techniky. Uzasne solo hrani vyuzivajici zvlastniho pocitu samoty a malosti. To vse diky relat. nenarocnosti enginu plynule na max detaily ve fullhd.\nPokud jste hrali jednicku, prvni pulka dvojky vam prijde docela snadna. Nejdriv se po probuzeni z kryogenniho spanku ocitate opet v ubikaci v Aperture, do ktere vas na konci prvniho dilu vratili. Projdete nostalgicky par znamych mistnosti, ovsem tentokrat je vse v rozkladu, rozbite nebo porostle vegetaci. Brzy pribude par novych mechanismu, jako zrcadlova (odrazna) kostka, svetelne mosty a katapulty. To vse se da jeste lehce zvladnout. \nJak se vsak dostanete hloubeji do nitra komplexu a zacnete objevovat od zacatku historii Aperture Labs, pribudou do hernich mechanismu \"balisticke\" gely. Repulsion umoznujici odraz, Propulsion zvetsujici rychlost a Conversion schopny na neaktivnich plochach vytvorit portaly. Obcas se jeste objevi Cleansing gel, ktery je bud prekazkou nebo pomocnikem pri reseni. Obecne jsou gely neskutecne chytry fyzikalni napad, ktery umoznuje hru v obrich podzemnich komplexech, kde budete preskakovat zdanlive neprekonatelne prurvy ci splhat na mista, kde portaly normalne byt nemuzou. Ac se to zda zprvu slozite, reseni se da nalezt vzdy pomerne elegantne, nezacne vas stvat a plynule postupujete pribehem. \nCela hra je docela obsahla. Proti temer experimentalni hricce Portal je druhy dil rekl bych tak 3-4x vetsi. Jak poctem hadanek, tak pribehem a prostory, ktere navstivite. Klasicke testovaci mistnosti se stridaji s lavkami, ochozy a \"vnejsim\" prostredim, kdy vlastne vidite testovaci chambers zvenku. V posledni 1/4 hry pak pribudou svetelne dopravni tunely, ktere vas (nebo gel) dopravi na potrebna mista.\nTemer nemam, co bych vytknul. Snad jen loadingy, ktere jsou velmi caste a trochu kazi tempo. Rozporuplna je taky ukecanost hry. Opet je tu ten sarkasticky humor, uzasny voice-acting hlavne noveho Wheatleyho. To je fajn, ale hra je misty tak upovidana, ze nevite, zda cist titulky nebo se koukat kolem. Tahle hra by byla dokonala s kvalitnim CZ dabingem. Na jednu stranu by sice byla skoda perfektniho angl. akcentu Wheatleyho, ale zas by vam to umoznilo vic si uzit samotnou hru. Druhym resenim je zahrat si to znova samozrejme, bez cteni kazdeho titulku. Jinak preklad je velmi slusny a pri zapnutem CZ Steamu nedela problemy, narozdil od prvniho dilu, kde bylo nutno mit Steam anglicky a cestinu preinstalovat zvlast z Cestiny.cz.\nTentokrat ma hra navic take Steam karty. Achievementu je mnohem vic a rekl bych, ze bude dost tezke je splnit. Hodne z nich je z coop hrani, na ktere je idealni kamarad, abyste se mohli dorozumivat hlasem, jako napr. v CSku. V bonusech pak jsou ruzna videa, hafo komunitnich map...zkratka komu pribeh nestacil (mne tedy jo, mam radsi Portal jako solovku), tak si v coopu uzije dalsi desitky hodin.\n\n95%","timestamp_created":1445780439,"timestamp_updated":1458390752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616074979305267334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18676671","author":{"steamid":"76561198136387871","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2653,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2653,"last_played":1575204911},"language":"german","review":"Bestes Spiel EVER!!","timestamp_created":1445777326,"timestamp_updated":1575202715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18674558","author":{"steamid":"76561198201173765","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":77,"last_played":1548929469},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная Игра10\\10\n","timestamp_created":1445768816,"timestamp_updated":1445768816,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18674312","author":{"steamid":"76561198046237726","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":589,"last_played":1445766655},"language":"english","review":"Has a very good story but the ending was even better.

Not only is the game play fun, but the story and dialouge are both interesting and entertaining. There were many times I laughed out loud and wanted to pull my hair out a little at the same time. There is not not just the story mode to consider though, you also have the co-op missions which are really fun in themselves. You can also build your own tests, share them, and play other players tests. \nMain game aside, there are also free mods to this game that are alternative stories and even more puzzles and entertaining plot. I see a lot of games out there that are $50 dollars and I play them and I just hate the entire experince... But for $20 I have owned this game for about 3 years and have always opened it and never regreted spending a cent. I highly reccomend this game to anyone.
