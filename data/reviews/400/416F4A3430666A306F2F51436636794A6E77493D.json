It has a lot of puzzles that's fun to find a way to beat the puzzles and beside that, it has a good story. If you haven't played the original portal then go buy it and play it before playing portal 2. Pretty much both the portal games are connected to the half life universe and I knew it was canon when they mentioned black mesa but we don't know if the portal series is at the same timeline as half life but in portal 2, it's like a loooong time after half life 2. If your the type of guy that likes puzzles or if your the type of guy that doesn't play puzzles, both portal games are just for you. I'm not a puzzle guy but after playing portal 1 and 2 made me interested of puzzles valve has but in these games. If you played portal 1 and wanting to play portal 2. Just go and buy it or if you never played portal 1 and just want to buy portal 2 then your gonna have to play portal 1 to get the picture while playing portal 2.","timestamp_created":1599186730,"timestamp_updated":1599186730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503816783428192139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75403349","author":{"steamid":"76561198786470170","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":254,"last_played":1634902665},"language":"english","review":"soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun\n","timestamp_created":1599186597,"timestamp_updated":1599186597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75402496","author":{"steamid":"76561199013261378","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":273,"last_played":1599334961},"language":"spanish","review":"si","timestamp_created":1599185120,"timestamp_updated":1599185120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75402237","author":{"steamid":"76561198083410002","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1599184497},"language":"english","review":"Its been so long that I have wanted to play this game.

I had played Bridge Constructor Portal a little bit so the concept wasn't foreign to me but playing the main series game was far more fun. It took a little less than a day to beat the main game and I couldn't put it down the entire time. Man, level 19 is something else though. The escapes are tacked onto it but it felt like it would never end. It took about another day to grab all the achievements except the challenges. The challenges are SERIOUSLY hard even if you watch level walkthroughs from Portal god's on Youtube.\n\nOne complaint I do have is that I struggled with how to orient some of the portals and getting my bearings after teleporting through one.

The fact that the concept of Portals goes from a very basic level of understanding to opening up a world of different possibilities of puzzles and problem-solving shows how cleverly developed and thought out the portalling system is.\n\nThe aesthetic of the game's \"Aperture Science\" is perfect as it feels futuristic and mysterious but also brings across a sense of realism. The mystery of the setting is amplified by the ominous robotic voice that guides you throughout the tests named \"GLaDOS\" that gives very vague advice and says some strange and downright confusing things, well... they're confusing on your first playthrough. There are also many other hidden elements/Easter Eggs in the facility that are just for fun and do hint at some Lore behind the story which has been expanded on exponentially by Valve and fans.\n\nWithout giving too much away, Portal is a unique and classic example of a great game that expands on a simple idea/concept and executes it perfectly. The setting is amazing and will leave you thinking constantly on your first playthrough as well as solving the different puzzles in your path. There is also a sequel non-surprisingly titled \"Portal 2\" that expands so much more on the Story and adds even more elements to the puzzles in major ways and executes this just as well as the first game, maybe even better.\n\nSo...
