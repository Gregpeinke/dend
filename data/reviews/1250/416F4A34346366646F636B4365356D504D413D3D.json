I first thought this is a simple left for dead copy,  but I was wrong. Killing floor is like a mix of PayDay (Level system, playstyle) and  Left for dead ( zombie genre and enemy diversity). It has its own charm. When i played it first time i thought \"Beginner\" difficulty is way to weak and i should go for hard ....woah was I wrong. Beginner may be realy easy but normal is already quite hard to survive and hard is realy hard... I still havent managed to win a Hell on Earth mission and suicidental is damn hard. Its realy important in this game for the higher difficulties where to stay/camp or run; to know from where the enemy comes from and to play as a team + experience of your team overall. Good aiming, Teamwork and personal character level is important in this game. I highly recommend this game for all people who like alien swam, payday, left 4 dead or any other good coop fps games, who haven't played this game and are looking for some challenge/fun (naturaly u can have both if u want - depends on your character).","timestamp_created":1414335275,"timestamp_updated":1414335275,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12642686","author":{"steamid":"76561198157700426","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52,"last_played":1420148963},"language":"brazilian","review":"Não é o melhor jogo de zumbi da Steam, de forma alguma, é bom, no minimo razovel, os gráficos deixam a desejar em alguns momentos, a liberdade também, o modo multiplayer apresenta muitos problemas, e alguns bugs podem ser vistos durante as partidas.\n\n6/10 - É um bom jogo, que te deixa tenso e as vezes com medo, mas como eu já disse, não vale a pena gastar R$24,99 reais fora da promoção para pega-lo.","timestamp_created":1414335100,"timestamp_updated":1414335100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12641924","author":{"steamid":"76561198026377863","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":5364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":273,"last_played":1625502704},"language":"russian","review":"отличный командный шутер с галоннами крови, тоннами мяса и полными штанами радости","timestamp_created":1414331659,"timestamp_updated":1414331659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12640707","author":{"steamid":"76561198119638567","num_games_owned":1554,"num_reviews":99,"playtime_forever":152214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":118123,"last_played":1590344045},"language":"brazilian","review":"[h1]Review powered by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/mamilosclub]Mamilos Club Group.[/url][/h1]\n\n[b]Killing Floor[/b] foi, e ainda é, uma experiência que guardarei por muito tempo.

Um de seus modos de Jogo, é lutar contra ondas de ZEDs e no final enfrentar o chefe Patriarch. Há outro modo de jogo, que é o modo Objetivo; como o nome sugere, você tem que completar os objetivos do mapa.\n\nOs jogadores podem escolher um dentre sete Perks (Classes), que dão bônus ao jogador com determinado tipo de arma, dano, precisão ... Dentre outros. O nível máximo de cada Perk é 6, sendo que a dificuldade para se upar aumenta a cada nível.\n\nO jogo tem 5 tipos de dificuldade.

There are regular seasonal updates as well to keep it interesting. \n\nThis is a co-op survival horror fps. Great for those who don't want to compete with grinders. At least you work together instead of getting pwned nonstop. \n\nLots of sardonic humor here and the game doesn't take itself too seriously. Another big plus is this is regularly on sale on Steam. It's also easy to play and adapt to. This is one of those games you can play for hours on end and get a lot of bang for your buck. When it gets old there is usually a seasonal change so it's always fun to pick it up again. Even if you aren't a hardcore FPS gamer you will probably enjoy this because you can play on easy servers with others and it isn't very competitive unlike almost every other shooter on the market. 5 years after it's release this is still a must have.","timestamp_created":1414296542,"timestamp_updated":1414296542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12635569","author":{"steamid":"76561198157401276","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1221,"last_played":1424830888},"language":"english","review":"if you are into mindless zed killing and i mean just MINDLESS KILLING!! then this game if for you","timestamp_created":1414295145,"timestamp_updated":1414295145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12635485","author":{"steamid":"76561198137491313","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":125,"last_played":1500344566},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom jogo so Enjoativo no meu ponto de vista recomendo comprar na promoção que ele se encotra hoje","timestamp_created":1414294638,"timestamp_updated":1414294638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12634798","author":{"steamid":"76561198098457533","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":6246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3386,"last_played":1606921595},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกดี (เหมียวๆ)","timestamp_created":1414289944,"timestamp_updated":1414289944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12633759","author":{"steamid":"76561198159718325","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":844,"last_played":1499975892},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego.","timestamp_created":1414283498,"timestamp_updated":1414283498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12633595","author":{"steamid":"76561198114229887","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":28,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1413176997},"language":"portuguese","review":".","timestamp_created":1414282457,"timestamp_updated":1414282457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12633441","author":{"steamid":"76561198113250304","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1112,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1477167331},"language":"english","review":"this game is so kool its like left for dead mixed up with call of duty zombies","timestamp_created":1414281317,"timestamp_updated":1414281317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12633099","author":{"steamid":"76561198111959331","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":565,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":455,"last_played":1418157736},"language":"english","review":"This game is really fun to play!

Back then we just thought, hey it's a multiplayer game, and it looks pretty cool. We never thought we would sink as much time into this game as we have.\n\nIt used to hang at the initial load up screen for ages, but even then it worth the 2 minutes of black screen to wait to play this game, the gameplay its self is addictive and enjoyable, the leveling system is a bit too high on the grinding curve if you ask me, once you get to level 4 in the different classes it just drags. I am stoked to see what the next game will bring to the table.\n\nAlso, what is up with the dialogue, specifically with the trader?

Mind you, this is just one of the many maps included in the base game. I would not want to spoil the rest of the game, but if you're at all feeling any doubt about this game, I strongly urge you to buy it. Because it's not just a zombie game. \n\nIt's a crazy mass murdering psychotic bloodfest of demented toys, chainsaw equipped maniacs, and many more that I'm sure I haven't encountered as of yet. Now, this game is strictly a multiplayer experience that is meant to be enjoyed with friends, but if you're so inclined, you can have a solo experience as well.(I often prefer the 'lone wolf' experience myself)\n\nThis is however not by any means an experience like Left 4 Dead. You do not simply mow through enemies with the \"Yeah, I'm a tough guy\" approach. The zombies are challenging, and they WILL catch you off guard. They will give you a merciless beating, should they get too close. But that's what makes it so addicting. It's something that you need to practice. This game offers the biggest arsenal of weaponry that once you attain it, you will feel like you're invincible. But you could not be any more wrong. Every wave gets tougher and tougher, but that's the beauty of it. To see just how far you can make it. Oh yeah, and there's no crosshair. It's skillful gunplay its best.
