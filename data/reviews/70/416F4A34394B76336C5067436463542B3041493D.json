Tutti noi conosciamo i classici: Super Mario 64, Ocarina of Time, Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy VII, Grand Theft Auto 3, Morrowind e, per rimanere sempre in tema FPS, Goldeneye 007 e Halo Combat Evolved. Alcuni invecchiati bene, altri male, ma sempre rivoluzionari.\nTitoli che all'epoca sono stati riconosciuti per aver \"svezzato\" i generi a cui appartenevano, ponendo nuovi standard da rispettare per tutti i giochi negli anni avvenire.\n\nIn quella lista, ovviamente, rientrerebbe anche il piccolo capolavoro Valve.... Però è diverso dai titoli sopracitati per un motivo molto semplice: quando prendi in mano Half-Life NON senti il peso dell'età.\nE' ancora, spiritualmente, un gioco nuovo.\n\nI controlli sono fluidi, il level design è memorabile e intuitivo, la varietà di armi e nemici rendono il gioco progressivamente più divertente, le location cambiano in continuazione, la OST ti gasa e la storia, pur essendo narrata esclusivamente grazie agli ambienti di gioco e i pochi NPC essenziali, è interessantissima ed è tuttora oggetto di osservazione da parte dei fan.\n\nIn poche parole, Half-Life non è solo rivoluzionario ma è anche *moderno*. Perfettamente godibile nel 2021 così come lo era nel 1999. Per citare il colonnello Campbell, passano gli anni ma resta sempre uguale.\n\nE' semplicemente un gioco incredibile, realizzato con cura e meticolosità dall'inizio alla fine... In ogni singolo aspetto.\n\nGioco perfetto? La perfezione non esiste, quindi no.
