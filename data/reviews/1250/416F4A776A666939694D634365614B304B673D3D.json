Когда-то это был обычный мод к Unreal Tournament 2004, ставший полноценной игрой. Эта игра безусловно щедевральна. Я провел в этой бесподобной игре сотни часов и ни капли об этом ни жалею. Динамичные бои и расчленка, взрывы и эпичное замедление под шикарное музыкальное сопровождение, огромное количество занятных достижений. Режим задач и обычное выживание, уровни сложности. Игра вызывает очень хороший прилив адреналина, когда вся твоя команда умирает и ты остаешься наедине против несколько сотен мутантов на Самоубиственном или Адском уровнях сложности, а после - несравненой эпичности пройденого уровня, если выжил конечно. А когда ты собираешься с друзьями на одном сервере игра начинает фантанировать избытком тактик, возможностей для решения задач и фана. В игре множество интересных хардкорных карт. А еще в ней есть интересные моды, разрешающие кататься на транспорте(очень интересный мод, я когда-то один раз играл - понравилось), а так же значительно усложняющих игру(например позволяющих играть более 6 игроков на сервере, что соотвественно увеличивает их количество и живучесть мутантов в разы) Это Бессмертная игра на все времена))).","timestamp_created":1404775091,"timestamp_updated":1404775482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603308618068695068","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11125505","author":{"steamid":"76561198052913828","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8786,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":930,"last_played":1456886551},"language":"english","review":"Just played this game for the first time and it was crazy. 3-man team and it was a blast.
