The game can be played solo, but is much easier with a team of friends.  Each level introduces a wave of monsters, each with special abilities, that are hunting all of the players.  No single player is hunted, except for the closest.  The spawn points surround the players, so moving while shooting is imperative.  To make the game a bit more versatile, players have the option of which character class they want to be.  Solo players will probably prefer Commando (SMG strong) or Support Specialist (shotgun strong), while other classes may benefit teamplay more, like the Medic (heal players from a distance) or the Demolitionist (mob control).  The other classes not mentioned include the Beserker (melee strong, super fast), Sharpshooter (sniper & pistols) and the Firebug (flame based weapons).  The replay value lies within the fact you can level up your classes.  Performing actions and using specific weapons increase your proficiency in each respective class, making your character stronger, which in turn allows you to raise the challenge level.  Head shots are key to the game, especially with limited ammo.  Share cash with your friends, because you don't carry it beyond each game.  Work together, and exploit everyone strengths.

И вот игрушка Killing Floor как раз из этой серии.\nСюжет игры довольно прост - ученый генетик стал проводить эксперименты по клонированию и создал армию зомби. Проведя опыты и над собой он смог стать особенно сильным, устойчивым и опасным и решил вместе со своей армией зомби захватить Великобританию. Ваша задача - уничтожить его и его армию. \nДействия в игре очень просты: Вас и вашу команду (если играете по сети) высаживают на захваченный участок территории и вы отбиваетесь от волн зомби. Каждая волна - это более мощная (более опасные виды зомби) атака, от которой вам необходимо отбиться. Между атаками открывается магазин - в нем вы можете купить любое необходимое вам оружие. А самая последняя волна - это тот самый ученый, которого вам необходимо убить.\nСамая прелесть и интерес игры в том, что есть огромное количество разного оружия и типов игрока - можно играть берсерком (атаковать оружием ближнего боя (катаны, топоры, ножи, мачете)), огнеметчиком, гранатометчиком, снайпером, медиком и техником. При использовании оружия данного типа игрока вы получаете бонусы к мощности, количеству патронов и другим характеристикам оружия и персонажа. Так же можно вместе с командой занять оборону и отбиваться от орд зомби (у игрока имеется сварочный аппарат, чтобы заварить дверь и держать оборону в помещениях). \nДвижок игры не очень тяжелый и многие компьютеры потянут эту игру. Мультиплеер и одиночная игра сделаны одинаково. В общем - играть просто, легко и интересно. Тем кто любит пристрелить кого нибудь на ночь - милости просим. by SmeJIbIu^","timestamp_created":1373192047,"timestamp_updated":1390398496,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1403998","author":{"steamid":"76561197992825207","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":9686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8804,"last_played":1425335885},"language":"german","review":"Holt es euch!","timestamp_created":1373190332,"timestamp_updated":1373190332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7225466","author":{"steamid":"76561198094083713","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":764,"last_played":1471274654},"language":"russian","review":"Всё просто и понятно.
