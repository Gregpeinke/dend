While the normal one life per round game is fun, if you're not particularly good it can get kind of frustrating. However, one of my favorite game modes is gun game, which is great to get better at basically every gun and to fine tune your aiming skills. It's quick paced, fast respawn, weapon-switching action. I play it with my brother all the time, and the competition is fierce, but when you go on a killstreak you just feel like an absolute boss. I highly recommend this game for the gun game mode alone, but once you get good and can play the regular game mode it's heart-pumping and can be an adrenaline rush when you're the last one alive on your team.","timestamp_created":1385662558,"timestamp_updated":1385662558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7809489","author":{"steamid":"76561198090519135","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8004,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2448,"last_played":1449275175},"language":"finnish","review":"Paras peli ikinä ja tosi hyvä mutta sais keksiä jotai uusia hauskoja tai hyviä pelimuotoja ja jotai uutta ois kivaa :)","timestamp_created":1385661617,"timestamp_updated":1385661617,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7808499","author":{"steamid":"76561198068134336","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1105,"last_played":1348556400},"language":"russian","review":"Игра хорошая но проблема с читерами актуальна","timestamp_created":1385658176,"timestamp_updated":1385658176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7808451","author":{"steamid":"76561198014945908","num_games_owned":512,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":793,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":784,"last_played":1404678205},"language":"english","review":"Counter-Strike is a classic series.

The long description would be an arena like firefight simulator between two factions consisting of terrorists and counter terrorists, which each have their own sets of weapons, while some weapons are universal between the two classes, there are some that are exclusive.  The other thing about the factions is that they always have opposing objectives; instead of simple TDM or CTF, this has things like bomb defusal, where the CT's attempt to find and disarm a bomb the T's have control of.  There is also a hostage rescue where the T's must guard their hostages from the rescuing CT's.  Either mode is fun but has heavy TDM overtones.\n\n     Of course the community has created and made mainstay some custom maps and gamemodes which are just as fun if not better than the actual game modes.  \n\n     A word of advice however, this game is not fun for casual play, many members of it's community are seasoned veterens with hundreds if not thousands of hours in game, they know the maps the weapons and the strategies, if you do want to pick up this game, make sure you intend to get your play out if it.  Those first few matches are going to be a bit of a bloodbath on your part until you find a weapon you like and a server where you feel welcome.  But it's very well worth it if you want a shooter you can really dig in to.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1385597151,"timestamp_updated":1385597151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7795926","author":{"steamid":"76561198030135384","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":108,"last_played":1412257029},"language":"english","review":"of source","timestamp_created":1385597003,"timestamp_updated":1385597003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7795260","author":{"steamid":"76561198038503298","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":72097,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37027,"last_played":1550383899},"language":"english","review":"this game is awsome\n","timestamp_created":1385594731,"timestamp_updated":1385594731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7795206","author":{"steamid":"76561198020984838","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":49814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":49041,"last_played":1473868062},"language":"german","review":"Macht immer noch Spaß!

Vu le succès grandissant de la série, c'est en octobre 2004 que Valve se décide à sortir cette édition « Source » qui profite donc du moteur 3D éponyme utilisé à la base pour le jeu Half-Life 2. Alors, simple refonte visuelle ou réels ajouts ?\n\nCounter-Strike : Source\n\nSi vous n'êtes pas resté enfermé dans une grotte durant cette décennie, le nom de Counter-Strike doit vous dire quelque chose. Et si, malheureusement, vous n'avez jamais pu y toucher de près ou de loin alors que vous aimez les FPS, il serait peut-être temps de s'y lancer ! Car oui, Counter-Strike n'est ni plus ni moins la référence du jeu de tir à la première personne sur PC, et cette version « Source »' propose une refonte non négligeable de ce qui fonctionnait très bien dans CS premier du nom. Un petit coup de lifting n'était pas de trop, étant donné que Counter-Strike était sorti fin 2000 chez nous et commençait donc à se faire vieux. Cependant, avec plus de quatre ans de différence entre les deux versions, on est en droit de se demander ce que Valve nous a préparé...\n\n\nSur cette carte, il est possible de faire exploser une bombe ravageuse.\nCommençons donc par le commencement. En quoi consiste le jeu ? Comme mentionné plus haut, c'est un jeu de tir à la première personne (FPS), vous serez toujours affecté à l'une des deux équipes suivantes : terroristes et antiterroristes. Aussi différentes qu'elles puissent paraître, les deux ont pourtant un but commun, exploser l'équipe adverse à coups de fusils d'assaut, de Desert Eagle, et autres fusils Sniper. On note toutefois bien des différences entre les deux camps, et notamment au niveau de l'armement. Les affrontements se déroulent sur des cartes dont la taille varie en fonction du mode de jeu. Les parties sont divisées en manches dont le nombre est défini par l'hôte du serveur. En général, il y a aussi des conditions qu'il faut remplir. Par exemple, les terroristes doivent souvent poser une bombe quelque part sur la carte afin de remporter la manche tandis que les antiterroristes devront la désamorcer. Maintenant que vous savez tout ça, bienvenue dans le monde de Counter-Strike Source.\n\n\nLe menu d'armes est très complet.\nSans surprise, on retrouve ici toutes les armes déjà disponibles dans le jeu de base. Enfin, pas exactement toutes. En effet, les équipes de Valve ont trouvé bon d'enlever le bouclier, tant décrié par les joueurs. Et on aura beau chercher, il n'y a rien qui vienne le remplacer. Toujours du côté de l'armement, les grenades ont été modifiées. Les très célèbres grenades frags sont maintenant plus puissantes, les flashbangs aveuglent bien plus et produisent également un son indésirable pour l'ennemi. On note enfin un meilleur rendu au niveau des fumigènes, nouveau moteur 3D oblige. Côté son maintenant, on apprécie le fait que les nouvelles technologies permettent d'avoir une ambiance plus que correcte dans les maps. Mais le plus gros changement apporté par cette version Source est sans nul doute celui opéré sur le système de visée. Dans Counter-Strike original, lorsqu'un joueur tire, le viseur s'agrandit de manière à être moins précis, représentant le recul d'une arme. Une fois que l'on arrête de tirer, le viseur revient petit à petit à sa taille originale. Mais dans Counter-Strike : Source, le viseur met bien plus de temps à revenir à sa position initiale, rendant donc les armes plus difficiles à maîtriser ! Avec de légères modifications, mais sans ajouts majeurs, Counter-Strike : Source ne bouscule pas outre mesure le jeu de base, et est ainsi plus à considérer comme une simple refonte graphique et sonore du premier Counter-Strike qu'un vrai nouveau jeu à part entière.\n\n\nA la fin de chaque manche, le meilleur joueur voit son nom affiché aux yeux de tous.\nUne chose qui n'a pas changé non plus, c'est le fait que Counter-Strike puise sa force, non pas uniquement dans un gameplay simple et efficace, mais surtout dans une communauté qui fait vivre le jeu grâce à des centaines de nouvelles cartes et de modes de jeu personnalisés ! Des joueurs qui mettent volontiers leurs œuvres à disposition de tous sur un serveur qu'ils créent. Alors, esprits créatifs ou passionnés, n'ayez crainte, vous pourrez montrer vos créations à des milliers de joueurs connectés ! Notez tout de même que tous ces modes de jeu sont faits sur la base de ce qui est proposé initialement. Car en réalité, il n'existe « officiellement » qu'une bonne dizaine de modes. Les plus courants sont, comme à l'accoutumée dans les FPS en ligne, le deathmatch et le chacun pour soi. En fait, ces deux types de parties sont presque identiques, sauf que dans le deathmatch vous réapparaitrez jusqu'à la fin de la partie grâce à un nombre de vies illimité alors que dans le chacun pour soi, il faudra attendre que la partie se termine (souvent rapidement) pour avoir l'occasion de rejouer.\n\nBoom headshot !\nD'autres modes, bien plus originaux, sont aussi présents. Envie de vous détendre un petit peu après une partie bien serrée ? Faites un tour dans les parties Surf et Slide, par exemple. En Surf, vous devrez glisser sur des rampes afin d'atteindre certains objectifs et en Slide, vous avancerez sur un parcours rempli d'obstacles qu'il vous faudra éviter pour venir à bout du circuit ! En parlant de circuit, il existe aussi certaines variantes de courses où vous vous transformerez carrément en Buggy. Un gungame est également présent, celui-ci se présente sous la forme d'un mini-jeu qui vous demandera de tuer des ennemis avec une arme imposée pour pouvoir la faire évoluer. Tous les joueurs commencent donc avec un simple pistolet, et le premier qui arrive à la dernière arme remporte la partie. Dans le genre fun, il existe aussi le cache-cache. Les terroristes peuvent se transformer en objets et se dissimuler dans la carte. Les antiterroristes, quant à eux, doivent repérer les ennemis cachés et les abattre. Outre toutes ces variantes, un des modes les plus populaires pour les joueurs de Counter-Strike est sans conteste le mode Zombie. Ici, tout le monde commence dans la même équipe mais très vite, le serveur désigne aléatoirement parmi les joueurs un zombie qui devra contaminer les autres. Les joueurs encore sains devront fuir grâce à un arsenal avancé comme des fusils-mitrailleurs. Vous le voyez, Counter-Strike : Source est riche en possibilités et si avec tout ça vous arrivez encore à vous ennuyer, chapeau !\n\nAprès maintenant plus de six ans, le jeu est toujours aussi actif qu'à sa sortie. En 2010, une grosse mise à jour de Steam a même permis d'ouvrir encore plus le jeu en ajoutant de nombreuses fonctions, comme par exemple l'arrivée des succès, sorte de petits défis que vous devez relever. Ces derniers allongent encore plus la durée de vie déjà bien conséquente de ce titre qu'il ne faut manquer sous aucun prétexte. Counter-Strike mérite donc bien sa popularité, et cette version Source en est la preuve !\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1385579752,"timestamp_updated":1385579752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499591171741485596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7789781","author":{"steamid":"76561198055081388","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":133,"last_played":1422756157},"language":"english","review":"pretty fun","timestamp_created":1385579460,"timestamp_updated":1385579460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7788973","author":{"steamid":"76561198105198348","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6687,"last_played":1498334937},"language":"german","review":"gg","timestamp_created":1385577706,"timestamp_updated":1385577706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7788273","author":{"steamid":"76561198081998063","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1474,"last_played":1415755112},"language":"english","review":"Must have for Garrys mod if not get it its like CS:GO aka Counter Strike Golbal Offense but less awesome but still great","timestamp_created":1385576284,"timestamp_updated":1385576284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504892110824584961","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7788213","author":{"steamid":"76561198007329764","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":69109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35275,"last_played":1652809933},"language":"russian","review":"отличная игра!","timestamp_created":1385576155,"timestamp_updated":1385576155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7787510","author":{"steamid":"76561198004104655","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":90648,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":48620,"last_played":1660079370},"language":"english","review":"Pretty cool game","timestamp_created":1385574089,"timestamp_updated":1385574089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7787286","author":{"steamid":"76561198108162136","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4230,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1596,"last_played":1437231907},"language":"english","review":"Old and GOLD! \n\nWould recommend it for everyone that loves FPS games!","timestamp_created":1385573349,"timestamp_updated":1385573349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7787240","author":{"steamid":"76561198103005598","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":64431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32321,"last_played":1542440996},"language":"finnish","review":"Ebin 3k flickjumpshoot #nolife","timestamp_created":1385573185,"timestamp_updated":1385573185,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7787215","author":{"steamid":"76561198100218953","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":74896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10818,"last_played":1429463845},"language":"russian","review":"В далёком 2004 году от компании Valve на новом к тому времени движке source вышел замечательный мод на игру half-life - counter-strike:source.

I've really enjoyed my time on this game and I look forward to many more years. This game contains dedicated servers that are vanilla CSS which require you to be strategic and dedicated servers that are meant more for random fun, such as mini games. I have spent most of my time on a mini games server and I must tell you it is a blast. This game ,although old and has a newer counter part,  is still thriving with thousands of servers. And no need to worry about hackers VAC has got you covered. I also own CSGO which is still enjoyable, but it leaned towards tf2 with the item system and the mini transactions, which I think only tf2 can pull off. The only problem I would say CSS has is a tough learning curve, but once you get it feel like a god.

Is it a good game?\n\nWell, that's a question that may earn you a controversial answer. You'll get a lot of differing opinions depending on who you ask. But you need only take a look at how many people play all 3 main games (1.6, CSS, CSGO) to see how popular and huge this franchise is. It's good. But whenever you do ask this question you're bound to find people who are 1.6 outspoken diehards and claim Source to be a catastrophe and the \"worst game ever made\" because it's not made exactly like 1.6 was. You've probably witnessed arguments, either in chatrooms or in forums about which is better, Source or 1.6. The answer? None. They both have their fanbases and they're going to stay that way for a long time, even with CS:GO out there. With that said, there are reasons why 1.6 is as popular as it is despite its age, and why very few hardcore 1.6 have moved to Source.\n\nFor one, it has tight near perfect controls, fully justifying its status as an e-sports to this day, and yes, it is more polished in this aspect than Source is. Two, the gameplay changes that were made from 1.6 to CSS have turned off most of the serious players that have some modicum of skill in 1.6 and aren't willing to just throw it away, especially when it's a game they enjoy and has a huge playerbase. This is different from say, the Starcraft: Brood War to Starcraft 2 move. Brood War was an old game, looked like an old game, but had its mechanics down to a science, which made it possible for it to remain an e-sports title for years. It didn't cease to be a popular title all the way until SC2 released, and that's because the basic mechanics of the game have not changed which allowed veterans to move in with ease and forget the old game entirely. This wasn't the case with 1.6 to Source. Source was made in a different engine, resulting in different gameplay and different fanbase. Whether that was intentional or not by Valve is irrelevant. \n\nNow you may be wondering why I even brought up the whole 1.6 vs CSS discussion, but trust me, it's a given whenever anyone brings up CSS. \n\nTruth is, CS: Source is fine. It's a great game that will feel different to you if you've played 1.6 long enough, but for newcomers they won't mind the changes or even realize they're there. It keeps the game modes and maps 1.6 had, gives them a much needed facelift, and with its huge community gamemodes and servers will be around for a very long time and keep you entertained for ages. I've had my share of fun with 1.6 with friends, and lots of gungame matches in CSS, which were my favorite. I've no huge complaints about the gameplay changes as I wasn't that big or skilled in 1.6 anyway, but am able to see where 1.6 players complaints came from as there are indeed changes, both good and bad, but nevertheless I was able to enjoy Source a lot easier than most people that had played 1.6 first.\n\nIt has its place in the Counter-Strike family, should not be missed, and you will more than likely have fun with it. And whatever complaints people might have about this one, it still manages to be better than most multiplayer FPSes out there. I'd skip to CS:GO by now, but you could still have some fun playing this one.","timestamp_created":1385560334,"timestamp_updated":1393279190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532953858375549316","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7783980","author":{"steamid":"76561198047350429","num_games_owned":311,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":3402,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2496,"last_played":1648774373},"language":"tchinese","review":"CSS對於CS1.6稍微不一樣。\n在這版本內，所有的槍穩定性都增加了，而樂趣仍然不減\n畫質從現在來看的話可說是相當出色\n傳統CS1.6的地圖也可以在這版本內看到\n而且是以全新面貌登場\n加上非官方伺服器很多，所以不怕玩不膩\n價錢也很親民，敗吧！","timestamp_created":1385557644,"timestamp_updated":1385557644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603125929832458496","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7783913","author":{"steamid":"76561198067602397","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13469,"last_played":1416159351},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра !","timestamp_created":1385557188,"timestamp_updated":1385557188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7783869","author":{"steamid":"76561198039609985","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":117541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":115349,"last_played":1422707337},"language":"russian","review":"it's best at the moment <3","timestamp_created":1385556925,"timestamp_updated":1385556925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502461791038513184","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7783110","author":{"steamid":"76561197970399987","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":391546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218020,"last_played":1523892023},"language":"german","review":"Played it now over 3600 hours with friends and on public Servers !

While many people argue over whether 1.6 is better or Global Offensive, it all boils down to a matter of opinion.  All games take place in standard Search and Destroy or Hostage Rescue format, Terrorists vs Counter-Terrorists.  You have your standard weapons, desert eagle (not the nighthawk), M4A1, AK-47, etc.  \n\nThe shooting is different.  If you go in expecting Call of Duty style shooting or Battlefield, you'll be sorely disappointed.  There are no iron sights and the recoil and a lot more noticeable.  Still, after a few hours you'll get used to it.\n\nNote, there are tons of mods to play with this game.  There's zombies, gun game, mini games and more, so give them all a try.\n\nTL:DR - Bang bang bang.  This game is one that nearly everyone should play.
