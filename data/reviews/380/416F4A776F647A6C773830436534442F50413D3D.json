This has got some damn good atmosphere and combat sequnces and while short stands tall as an excellent adventure amongst FPS titles and expansions. That said it really is the middle child of the Half-Life 2 family. From replaying I've come to think it's real weaknesses come from it's exposition heavy,slow start and opening Citadel chapters. Especially when  all combined. It has you teamed up with Alyx for the entire episode and thankfully she is well written, helpful and interesting and a damn impressive showcase of AI unlike a certain Sheva. \n\nAt the same time though you'll often be locked into what I call little \"cutscene\" rooms. YES you can move around freely as control is never taken away from the player in the Half-Life games but while these \"cutscenes\" as well written and interesting as they are are also unskipable and if it's not your first time playing all you can do is leap around like a fussy cat and make people look like an idiot as you attempt to jump on their head or find something to throw. The tunnels, and ESPECIALLY the remains of City 17 are when it's best. The Citadel isn't bad, FAR FROM IT, but it wasn't my favorite part on repeat playthroughs and it keeps me from speedily progressing to my favorite parts faster if I don't skip massive chunks of the gamet via chapter select that is.\n\nEpisode 1 does a lot of things scripting and scenario wise that I've never seen all together in one single FPS game before especially in terms of it's design and layout but then it will repeat some of these good parts a little too much and as a cherry on top will have a character openly say \"oh god no\", \"not again\" and \"here we go again\" winkingly as you do a reocurring scripted sequence involving Combine, explosives and doors. \n\nHaving a character remark at how over used a gimmick in game is and then DOING the gimmick anyway does not then excuse or fix the gimmick. It sticks out like a sore thumb as this sort of thing is uncommon in the game prior. It's like when Duke in Duke Nukem Forever sighed in disgust at a literal pipe puzzle and said \"I hate Valve puzzles.\" and then proceeding to do it anyway. (And no I am not saying anything in this game is as bad as any part of the Duke Nukem Forever.)\n\nIt's short (real short) but sweet and unless you don't wan't to wait forever for a conclusion after you play Episode 2 I highly reccomend you play Episode 1. \n\nMy review for Half-Life 2: Episode 2 can be seen here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/420\nMy review for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch can be seen here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/320\nMy review for Half-Life 2 Lost Coast can be seen here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/340","timestamp_created":1435194067,"timestamp_updated":1486965313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469613343477249146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16685849","author":{"steamid":"76561198185161697","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60,"last_played":1452619800},"language":"russian","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1435184881,"timestamp_updated":1435184881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16684108","author":{"steamid":"76561198127404942","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1493266619},"language":"english","review":"This sequel to a amazing game has been great!

You will have a decent selection of weapons, and a group of characters you will actually grow fond of overtime.  You will encounter a selection of enemies, but they do tend to get a little repetitive towards the end.  You even have plenty of props to play with either using your hands, or the gravity gun.\n\nNow, don't let all the cult praise get the better of you though.  There are still issues with the game.  Mentioned before, the age of the game is starting to show in some parts.  The ladder system is a little buggy at times, and the game is a little tedious in some parts.  But its a small price to pay for a game that does offer a good story to keep the player engaged as you go on.  As someone who hasn't played Half life till 2015, I can safely tell you your money will be well spent.

It's a direct continuation to Half-Life 2 and supposedly a start of episodic releases. If forget that it never got past Episode Two. Episodic releases of games just never work, unless you are Telltale.\n\nIt's quite similiar to Half-Life 2 and uses game design philosophy behind it, as well as gameplay. And assets. So there isn't much to explain. A fancy shooter with gravigun. Only this time you often has a teammate, Alyx, who doesn't die easily.\n\nPlotwise it continues where Half-Life 2 ends, as you are found in rumbles of a citadel of City 17. Now it's your mission to get out from city and cause trouble for yourself in meanwhile.\n\nIt starts out quite weak, as you have to venture through some amount of storyline scenes and then left with super-charged gravigun. Super-charged gravigun was quite a nice surprise at the end of Half-Life 2, but here it overstays it's welcome, as it's the only weapon you can use, with no variety.\n\nIt gets better after first two chapter, as you slowly gain standard weapons, find much more creative uses for gravigun and will get to enjoy Alyx's fighting company much more, while you are exploring dark underground, ruins of a city and hospital. Hospital also featured some AI vs AI fights, something that me and many players love watching. And boss. Same old in new enviroment.\n\nEpisode One adds a big new feature in Valve games for first time: Developers commentary.\nWhen activated, the flying icons will appear in the levels that you can use. Upon usage you will be listening (and reading in subtitles) to one of the developers talking about something related or unrelated to where the icon was placed. It could be Alyx's AI, or changes in lighting, or the way that scene came to be, or just how smart they count themselves.\nIt's quite a great addition and is much better than Developer Commentaries in later Valve games, which was more like Voice Acting Commentary: How Amazing It Is To Have No Script.\n\nOverall, it's a decent FPS. Decent episode. Something that you will beat, have fun and then forget. Still nice.","timestamp_created":1433448203,"timestamp_updated":1433448203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16185730","author":{"steamid":"76561197993336180","num_games_owned":449,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":288,"last_played":1561572660},"language":"russian","review":"Отличное продолжение самой лучшей игры !","timestamp_created":1433424178,"timestamp_updated":1543251994,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16184039","author":{"steamid":"76561198055008124","num_games_owned":427,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":732,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":732,"last_played":1433415468},"language":"english","review":"As usual , Valve has another amazing game on its hands.
