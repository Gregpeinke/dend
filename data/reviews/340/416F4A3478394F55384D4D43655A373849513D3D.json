It was originally intended to be released with Half-Life 2 but was then later cut. It takes roughly twenty minutes to complete but is worth playing for sure.\n   Of coarse, we once again step into the shoes of Gordon Freeman as he hikes up the steep cliffs of the Lost Coast. On his way, he'll encounter several different combine soldiers. As he pushes on, you'll find Gordon inside of a monastery in which he needs to destroy a combine weapon. Short afterwards, he'll step out into the world only to get rained down upon by an combine helicopter. Upon completing his mission, Gordon makes his way back down the mountain to once again talk to the old man.\n   You'll have to play the game yourself to find out who this mysterious man and to see what he has in store for you... \n   All in all, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was an enjoyable experience and I would recommend it to other players.","timestamp_created":1391142600,"timestamp_updated":1391142600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8915873","author":{"steamid":"76561198054907844","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":36,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1384294098},"language":"english","review":"I got this game for free on a mac but now it's only PC compatible and costs 30 dollars.
