The idea of the game is similar to Left 4 Dead, but is a totaly different type of co-op survival horror. In Killing Floor, you are able to play with all of your friends. You can join lobbies with upto 16 people. Once you are in game, you have to survive a certain amount of rounds while trying to fight off some of the craziest types of zombies.","timestamp_created":1434814048,"timestamp_updated":1434814048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16554233","author":{"steamid":"76561198191772525","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":244,"last_played":1469901835},"language":"english","review":"I didnt play the game alot, but its nice. I like the idea of not having a crosshair, it makes it more survival horror-ish. The challenge is great, and workshop support is a nice bonus. This game is obviously based on coop, so its better to play with friends. Nice thing is that the game comes with two guest passes, that allow people to access the full game for a limited time. And if they like  it, they may buy it and play with you. The whole atmosphere is really nice and creepy, and it'll suck you in.
