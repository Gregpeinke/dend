YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\n\n\"Portal\" is an excellently done first-person game, following a character through many scientific tests. This is the first of two, and I would recommend playing this one first if you are interested in the sequel.\n\n[b]STORY LINE:[/b] There isn't much of a story-line, but it starts picking up near the end.\n\n[b]GAME PLAY:[/b] Puzzles that slowly get harder as you get further into the game. Requires brain power. Usage of a portal device--surprise! Shocking for a game named [b]\"PORTAL\"[/b].\n\n...Apologies for my sarcasm, it's just... are you surprised? With a name like \"Portal\"?\n\n[b]GAME CONTROLS:[/b] It is [i]highly recommended[/i] that if you are using a laptop or any computer with a touchpad that you use a mouse. Otherwise, your gaming experience will be very, very difficult. Arrow-keys are used for moving your character around. Spacebar to jump. Mouse used to look around and shoot portals. Other buttons are explained in game.\n\n[b]CHARACTERS:[/b] You play as a mute character. They do not speak. Meanwhile, you are accompanied by an pre-programmed AI through the facility as you complete tests. [spoiler]Except, they aren't pre-programmed. Oh, and also? They want to kill you. Interesting facts, y'know?[/spoiler]\n\n[b]CAUTION:[/b] Please keep in mind that looking at these spoilers may change or ruin your experience, as they are not necessary for enjoyment of the game. They are only if you get disturbed easily by a lack of nothing, loud noises, or sudden events. The minimal usage of music (which is also electric sounding) may be unnerving to some. If you [spoiler]die[/spoiler], you may be kind of freaked out. Also, [spoiler] it may be startling to encounter turrets, which will shoot at you[/spoiler]. Finally, (MAJOR SPOILER) [spoiler]it may be incredibly shocking when you start heading into a fiery pit. Yep, that friendly AI is trying to kill you[/spoiler].\n\n\"Portal\" is a fantastic game, and while it may be less entertaining than the second game, \"Portal 2\", I would highly recommend playing it. It has kept me busy for hours, and figuring out the puzzles can be very pleasing. There is also an Easter Egg, for those who enjoy that sort of thing.","timestamp_created":1586287781,"timestamp_updated":1586287986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66838107","author":{"steamid":"76561198080250887","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":127,"last_played":1586690392},"language":"spanish","review":"juegazo!!","timestamp_created":1586284269,"timestamp_updated":1586284269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66836684","author":{"steamid":"76561198130081758","num_games_owned":746,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":351,"last_played":1586367984},"language":"spanish","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1586282756,"timestamp_updated":1586282756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66833837","author":{"steamid":"76561198127452866","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1437282464},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая ,но короткая головоломка от vALVE во вселенной HALF LIFE\nСвоих денег определенно стоит","timestamp_created":1586278753,"timestamp_updated":1586278753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570126056671142578","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66830379","author":{"steamid":"76561198855803235","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1596018233},"language":"italian","review":"This game is amazing but  I prefer its sequel.","timestamp_created":1586274639,"timestamp_updated":1586274639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66828128","author":{"steamid":"76561198814164033","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":5208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1586954644},"language":"french","review":"Un incontournable, absolument génial.","timestamp_created":1586272467,"timestamp_updated":1586272467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66826200","author":{"steamid":"76561198279319126","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":574,"last_played":1594312273},"language":"english","review":"what a classic","timestamp_created":1586270607,"timestamp_updated":1586270607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66825864","author":{"steamid":"76561198314897628","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":301,"last_played":1588332969},"language":"english","review":"very good","timestamp_created":1586270283,"timestamp_updated":1586270283,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66823909","author":{"steamid":"76561198082174868","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":717,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":559,"last_played":1587357821},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo envelheceu muito bem, ainda vale totalmente a pena jogar.

There's so much to be done in this game despite the short story of the first game. Following it are challenge missions, which are very fun. The second game I bought with the first but have not played it yet, but I heard the story ties well, and that the CO-OP with other players is very fun. This game gets a 15/10, it's that good. I love the sarcasm and irony, it gives life to the gloomy setting of the levels and such (which is not a problem in general). Really well woven game, and I've never played anything like it.
