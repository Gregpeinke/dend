Тогда ещё игра представляла с собой зависимую от Half-Life 2 игровую составляющую, но уже после своего оглушительного успеха, она стала отдельной параллелью во вселенной Half-Life.\n\nДействие игры происходит в лабораториях Aperture Science, где ГГ должен пройти ряд \"экспериментальных опытов\" по исследовании природы порталов, выступая в роли \"подопытной крысы\". Но уже походу игры, героиня начинает понимать, что в комплексе происходит нечто странное: сотрудников или любых других живых людей нет, голос-проводник несёт ахинею про торт, а эксперименты с каждой камерой становятся всё опаснее. Доходит всё до того, что голос пытается уничтожить подопытную, и Челл (ГГ) инициирует побег с комплекса. Сюжет в этой части игры менее выражен, в виду того, что игра выступала в качестве экспериментальной головоломки, но доставляет свой интерес.\n\nГеймплей прост в понимании, но гениален и сложен в решении пазлов. В камерах всегда можно сломать голову. Но если Вам покажется, что они просты в решении, разработчики дают возможность пройти ряд усложнённых камер на время или количество порталов. Да и вообще - портальная пушка оказалась гениальным приспособлением в прохождении игры.\n\nАтмосфера свойственна для этой игры: довольно мирные и симпотичные монотонные камеры испытаний и электронная Ambient мелодия, после ряда испытаний и догадок по ходу сюжетной линии, сменяются угнетающей атмосферой и звуковым содержимым, а ля \"fear & horror\". Своего рода изолированный техногенный постапокалипсис. Разработчики умеют делать качественные проекты.\n\nИгра хоть и выступала как эксперимент, но работа над ним была кропотливой и бережной. [b]Portal[/b] действительно заслуживает высший балл, и эта игра, воистину, является лучшим представителем жанра [i]puzzle[/i].","timestamp_created":1393648121,"timestamp_updated":1393648261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":31,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.683430731296539307","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9297788","author":{"steamid":"76561198038156154","num_games_owned":665,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1400280201},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1393634955,"timestamp_updated":1393634955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9297093","author":{"steamid":"76561198078076345","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1389549487},"language":"brazilian","review":"É um otimo jogo que te faz pensar logicamente(ou não), e o final é totalmente inesperado(ou não tbm :p), e sim \nthe cake is lie.","timestamp_created":1393630196,"timestamp_updated":1393630196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9296694","author":{"steamid":"76561198114451032","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2766,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":802,"last_played":1598219461},"language":"english","review":"This game is great not only for its great gameplay, but a thick and riviting storyline to keep the player guessing till the final lab.","timestamp_created":1393627586,"timestamp_updated":1393627586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9296567","author":{"steamid":"76561198035451530","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":151,"last_played":1329638400},"language":"english","review":"Step into a world where there is no one else....

Portal was released in a pack called The Orange Box which included the amazing Half Life 2, Half Life 2: Episode 1, Half Life 2: Episode 2, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. All of these 5 games are completly amazing, but the game that I am talking about right now is Portal. \n\nPortal is a First-Person Shooter that has you instead of shooting bullets, shooting portals out of a gun called the Portal Gun. The game features a silent protagonist named Chell, and a Robot named GLaDOS. The main mechanic in Portal is that if you shoot a a portal at a wall, then shoot another one at another wall, you can easily walk into that Portal and come out the other Portal. The puzzles are pretty easy at first but quickly get harder as the game goes on, introducing new objects and things to use at your disposal.\n\nYou may think that Portal is all puzzle and no plot, but you are wrong. Portal has a amazing story that is funny, dark, and fantastic all at the same time. Even though the game only took me 2 hours to beat on the first playthrough, it is still short but very sweet. \n\nMy final thoughts on Portal is that this game is like a small slice of delicious cake, ending fast, but leaving a lasting impression on your senses. Personally I completly love this game, and after playing it, im sure you will too.","timestamp_created":1393476188,"timestamp_updated":1436464669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9275224","author":{"steamid":"76561198119573975","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":687,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":685,"last_played":1486780431},"language":"english","review":"I loved playing this game through.

I have yet to play the 6 advanced levels, but as the game is concerned, from beginning to end, it basically boiled down to a charming, short and sweet experience...nothing more.\nIf you're one of those types who MUST have all achievements in a game, then that would be the only replay value it has to offer...aside from additional dowloadable puzzles (which I am uncertain exist, but if they do, that's a definite PLUS!).\nI think $10.00 is the perfect price for the content this game has to offer.  Any more and I don't think it would be worth it.  Any less and you better pick it up while it's cheap!\nI will be waiting for Portal 2 to drop in price before grabbing it under the impression that it, too, will be fairly challenging and short ended.","timestamp_created":1392955182,"timestamp_updated":1393105574,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9199937","author":{"steamid":"76561198043719866","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":101,"last_played":1421453428},"language":"english","review":"Looking back on this game, it's still as fun now as it was a few years ago.","timestamp_created":1392950941,"timestamp_updated":1392950941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9196294","author":{"steamid":"76561198110926840","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":876,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1645989536},"language":"english","review":"portal rocks!","timestamp_created":1392927293,"timestamp_updated":1392927293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9192969","author":{"steamid":"76561198008835314","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":135,"last_played":1453195566},"language":"russian","review":"best","timestamp_created":1392908960,"timestamp_updated":1392908960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9190700","author":{"steamid":"76561198063554459","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":115,"last_played":1392001809},"language":"english","review":"Much perfect, such briliant...........","timestamp_created":1392892368,"timestamp_updated":1403471298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9190256","author":{"steamid":"76561198048395253","num_games_owned":584,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1428090875},"language":"english","review":"It is good and you allrady know it :)","timestamp_created":1392888324,"timestamp_updated":1392888324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9188942","author":{"steamid":"76561198120707785","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":261,"last_played":1611595399},"language":"english","review":"\"This was a triumph...\"! :D","timestamp_created":1392875344,"timestamp_updated":1392875344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9186485","author":{"steamid":"76561198122257151","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":324,"last_played":1552860554},"language":"english","review":"Best.

It took me a while, because I got to test chamber 16 and got scared of the turrets (I was a nine-year-old wimp back then don't judge me) and I stopped playing for about a year. Then I picked it back up, and I got to the boss battle and got scared, then left for about 3 or 4 months. I finally beat it while at a sleepover at my cousin's house, and I felt like THE most accomplished person in the world. Writing this about 3 years later, I have beaten the first game about 15 times (not exaggerating) and the second one about 5 (second game is MUCH longer), and there is literally NOTHING I don't know about portal.","timestamp_created":1392854559,"timestamp_updated":1426803457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9184919","author":{"steamid":"76561197970502194","num_games_owned":352,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1429914804},"language":"english","review":"Oh, Portal...one of the most satisfying puzzlers I've ever played.
