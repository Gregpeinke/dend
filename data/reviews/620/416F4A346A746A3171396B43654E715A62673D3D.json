2 is a 2011 first-person puzzle-platform video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. It is the sequel to Portal (2007) and was released on April 19, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The retail versions of the game are distributed by Electronic Arts while online distribution of the Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux versions is handled by Valve's content delivery service Steam. Portal 2 was announced on March 5, 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game. Before the game's release on Steam, the company released the Potato Sack, a second multi-week alternate reality game, involving 13 independently developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof to release Portal 2 several hours early.\n\nThe game retains Portal's gameplay elements, and adds new features, including tractor beams, laser redirection, bridges made of light, and paint-like 'gels' accelerating the player's speed, allowing the player-character to jump higher or place portals on any surface. These gels were created by the team from the Independent Games Festival-winning DigiPen student project Tag: The Power of Paint. In the single-player campaign, the player controls protagonist Chell, awoken from suspended animation after many years, who must navigate the now-dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by the reactivated GLaDOS, a powerful supercomputer. The storyline introduces new characters, including Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J. K. Simmons). Ellen McLain reprised the role of GLaDOS. Jonathan Coulton and The National each produced a song for the game. Portal 2 also includes a two-player cooperative mode, in which the robotic player-characters Atlas and P-Body (both voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) are each given a portal gun and are required to work together to solve puzzles. Valve provided post-release support for the game, including additional downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share test chambers with others.\n\nAlthough some reviewers initially expressed concerns about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel, Portal 2 received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, pacing, and dark humor. The voice work of McLain, Merchant, and Simmons were also praised, as were the new gameplay elements, the challenging but surmountable learning curve, and the additional cooperative mode. Some journalists ranked Portal 2 among the best games of 2011, and several named it their Game of the Year.

It's a game with a simple message. Being in the Half-Life universe and many, MANY years after the events of the original Portal (apparently the co-op DLC takes place a few million years after this one!), the entire game focuses on the idea that the human race is making all these advancements, but while our creations will live on forever in the underground, we're all going to die up-top until some other race replaces us. This concept screams in your ear the entire time as you traverse (SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT) the stowed-away failed test chambers of Cave Johnson and his assistant Caroline, two characters who bring up some moral questions as well involving the human-AI relationship, yet by the end of the game when everything looked bleak and we were probably the last person on Earth (or at least going to die before encountering other humans), I was still laughing my ass off. Add to that wonderfully creepy (and funny) voice performances from Ellen McLain, that one dude from the British Office, J.K. Simmons (Get me pictures of Spider-Man!!), and Nolan North, plus the awesome game mechanics introduced in what was essentially a two-hour demo for this chapter in the Aperture Science story. 10/10, all across the board.","timestamp_created":1483262574,"timestamp_updated":1483262574,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28896056","author":{"steamid":"76561198097504024","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":642,"last_played":1483259252},"language":"schinese","review":"You want your freedom?

In addition, the game also made me laugh extremely hard, and it made me feel human feelings in all the right ways.

Знаешь, что я вспомнил? Футбол! Пинание круглых мячей ради забавы. Так жестоко. Люди его обожают. Это метафора. Я должен был сразу догадаться...\n\nПервый Portal был оригинальной головоломкой от первого лица, а вторая часть получилась гораздо более масштабной и продуманной. \nОсновной принцип остался тем же: используя портальную пушку, нужно проходить различные испытания. Кто не в курсе: игрок может создавать два связанных между собой портала, чтобы преодолевать всяческие препятствия. Первые уровни очень простые, да еще и с подсказками, но затем прохождение становится все более запутанным: нужно использовать различные предметы, учитывать местные особенности и т.д. Но при этом баланс сложности на мой взгляд очень удачен: не так уж и просто - в некоторых моментах приходится тратить изрядно времени, но и не слишком сложно - ни разу не возникло чувство поискать прохождение, гораздо интереснее было находить выход самому.\n\nСюжет строится как продолжение первой части. Но при этом он стал более сложным и увлекательным, с неожиданными поворотами. И к тому же открывающий интересную информацию об истории мира Portala. Ну и еще огромный плюс игры - это юмор, не позволяющий скучать во время решения головоломок. От постоянных подколок и реплик роботов не раз хотелось по-настоящему расхохотаться.\n\nЕще одним плюсом есть кооператив, от которого получаешь массу удовольствия .\n\nОтличная игра , которая стоит внимания .\n\nМоя оценка 10/10","timestamp_created":1483255295,"timestamp_updated":1483255295,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28893912","author":{"steamid":"76561198018665527","num_games_owned":615,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":4573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4153,"last_played":1565502758},"language":"english","review":"this is much better than the first game and both the story mode and co-op are very fun\n\nthere are a lot of crazy community single player and co-op maps as well which will keep you busy for a while","timestamp_created":1483255266,"timestamp_updated":1483255266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28893825","author":{"steamid":"76561198010794968","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1111,"last_played":1634762356},"language":"russian","review":"Остается только ждать и верить.
