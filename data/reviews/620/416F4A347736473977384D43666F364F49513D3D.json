The single player is signigicantly longer than the first game and the constant plot twists will keep you engagaged.\n\nI would say Portal 2 was my most enjoyable gaming experince, EVER.  I do recomend playing the original Portal first as it gives more depth to the story and experince of Portal 2.\n\nThe co-op mode is also fantastic, but the puzzels can be quite tricky.
