[/b]\n\nReleased in 2007, Portal was an FPS puzzle game developed by Valve. It quickly received critical acclaim for its unique, pioneering gameplay and darkly humoured tone. Set in the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment centre, the player assumes the role of Chell, a test subject confined within the facility by the rogue AI, GLaDOS. \n\nThe game is separated into sequential test chambers which contain various puzzles and hazardous environments which you must navigate through using your hand held portal device. The device allows the player to create inter-spatial portals on level planes, creating visual and physical links between them. Two distinct portals (blue and orange) can be created at any one time in order to fashion an entrance and an exit through which the player and other environmental objects can travel through.\n\nAnother significant game mechanic is the concept of momentum being conserved through portals. Players and objects will exit portals with the same speed (and orientation) with which they entered them, allowing players to launch themselves great distances both vertically and horizontally.\n\nThe test chambers become increasingly more advanced and hazardous as the game progresses. Light combat elements are present, but you have no direct means of defending yourself. Instead, emphasis is placed on using portals in an evasive manner or as a way to deactivate enemies using environmental props.\n\nValve developed Portal alongside their Half-Life 2 series using the Source engine. The stark and often Spartan appearance of the test chambers were a conscious design choice to help players focus on the puzzles without distraction, but it also perfectly reflects the concept of a clinical laboratory setting. Despite this minimalist look, the game still looks graphically decent even by today’s standards.\n\nPortal is very light on any form of plot and the story elements are very subtle, coming only from your interactions with GLaDOS and some hidden information caches. However, GLaDOS herself quickly becomes one of the most memorable aspects of Portal. Her script is full of sarcasm and a blatant disregard for your safety, which creates some genuinely humorous dialogue. GLaDOS’ speeches almost become a reward in themselves for completing the puzzles you encounter.\n\nOne of the few criticisms that can be levelled at Portal is its length, as it can be comfortably completed in just a few hours. However, it is worth noting that you can unlock several advanced test chambers and additional challenge modes to boost gameplay time. These extra levels really display how Portal is a game which is relatively easy to learn but difficult to master. There is also a developer commentary mode which includes some tracks from Ellen McLain (voice of GLaDOS) if you are at all interested in the development process.\n\nOverall, Portal manages to seamlessly combine unique gameplay mechanics with an intuitive level design. It has a highly polished presentation which still looks good today. It is a genuinely innovative gameplay experience, which deserves every accolade it has collected.","timestamp_created":1495391120,"timestamp_updated":1496066018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.763118386268615723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31888305","author":{"steamid":"76561197996281510","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":201,"last_played":1493927632},"language":"english","review":"Just wow.

The only thing I can say is this game revolutionised storyline puzzle games! Portal is a fairly old game now but when I bought this, exdpecting just another 'classic' game - it blew me away. From the very beginning, it was slick, gripping, strcutured and the storyline, though subtle and less influential than most, was simply divine. The fact it was left so open to interpriation allowed users to create their own endings and the gaming industry blew up over the endings. With references in other games such as Minecraft, this masterpiece simply set its place in history. GLaDOS, with her witty sarcasm and questionable personality provided curiosity and doubt throghout the entire game, and the one shot showing the main character just emphasized the mystry further. For a scientific puzzler, using modern and high tech equipment, the construct of this game was immaculate. The achievements are challenging so much so they have a legacy over it, taking me over 50 hours to complete the game fully (with the help of wikis and guides). Challenging but stunning this game is a full blown masterpiece.

довольно своеобразная игра от Valve. Эта игра может заинтересовать каждого, хоть это не шутер. Механика проста: ставишь порталы и выигрываешь. Звучит легко, но на деле эта та еще головоломка. Иногда, правда, не всегда понятно как достигнуть нужной точки, особенно в последних локациях, но проблема решается ноклипом. Правда вот игра ооочень мала - я прошёл её и выполнил все сайды за 3 часа. Но для игры стоимостью 200 рублей без скидки - это неплохо. Рекомендую.","timestamp_created":1495131689,"timestamp_updated":1495131689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55573505163192749","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31816455","author":{"steamid":"76561198338063684","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":260,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":260,"last_played":1494487129},"language":"english","review":"Very interesting, well-made game with great mechanics and good graphics!","timestamp_created":1495084502,"timestamp_updated":1495084502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31815439","author":{"steamid":"76561198053848780","num_games_owned":1856,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":71,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1585251226},"language":"french","review":"Un FPS mixé à un puzzle game architectural ?

Gameplay is simple, Puzzels are complex but not too dificult, visuals are drop dead great for the time and obviously the story and characters lets say its near impossible to find a game which has a better story and characters. Not including Portal 2 which is better then this one. (I played this game offline, which is the reason why I have 1.5 hours. I didn't complete the game that fast.)","timestamp_created":1494732889,"timestamp_updated":1494732889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31738350","author":{"steamid":"76561198157594460","num_games_owned":484,"num_reviews":96,"playtime_forever":259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":173,"last_played":1482966225},"language":"spanish","review":"Aunque resulte ser tan solo un experimento de lo que en el futuro sería Portal 2, es un grandioso juego con una gran trama ligeramente escondida","timestamp_created":1494731733,"timestamp_updated":1494731733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31736267","author":{"steamid":"76561198286200379","num_games_owned":1935,"num_reviews":1491,"playtime_forever":162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":162,"last_played":1494728652},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo simplesmente muito bom\npra mata saudades\nda antigas\nHistoria te legalzin\nVale a pena pra quem ja jogou antigamente\nrecomendo","timestamp_created":1494721902,"timestamp_updated":1494721902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507168471813201904","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31731687","author":{"steamid":"76561198263017803","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":90,"playtime_forever":194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1494703647},"language":"turkish","review":"Bulmacaları sevenler için güzel zaman geçirten, kısa süreli bir oyun.
