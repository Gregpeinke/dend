Also, for its time, it hasn't exactly aged too well, mainly because of KF2, but just by playing it I can feel it. I think it's because it uses the quite dated Unreal Engine 2, for a release in 2009.\n\nI will, of course, start off with the good things about it.\nIt probably has some of the best modern weapons shown in a single game to give that tacticool feel, and the sound design for them (for their time) isn't too shabby, either. The quality of the models are quite good, too. It also has some pretty uniquely designed, fictional weapons, which are pretty darn cool. Too bad the majority are actually DLC. I'll get to that later on. The amount of guns in the game is pretty extensive depending on the perk. Like, Demolitions without any DLC has like 4 weapons and Pipebombs, whereas Sharpshooter has 7, and 4 of them can be dual-wielded.\n\nThe variety of enemies in the game's nice, not too many but not too few so it's good for balance, I suppose. Especially when they resemble zombies so much. Their sound design (can't tell whether they actually used stock sounds for the clots but they sound so annoying I swear it *is* stock) is okay, far from the best, but not the worst you could possibly do, I guess.\n I dislike the sounds/voice acting they did for the zeds, but I can't complain too much I guess. But Left 4 Dead, a game that came out a year before, has zombies with better/less annoying voices than KF1, meaning that perhaps Tripwire did a bad job of their zed sound design, but whatever, it isn't what's going to stop you from filling 'em full of hot lead. Maybe kill them because they're noisy, I dunno. Speaking of which, Sirens' screams are probably the only thing that's intentionally supposed to sound annoying, so I would count them out of the sound design.\n\nThe amount of maps in the game after all these updates is quite excellent. It makes playability longer, than the five \"core\" maps it had at launch. Not that those aren't bad, it's just good in case you're sick of playing in WestLondon or BioticsLab after so long. Though I must say that I feel like a fair amount of maps in these updates aren't nowhere near as well-designed as the five launch maps, just from experience. Keep in mind I said \"a *fair* amount\", not all of them are just okay to play, some are quite enjoyable to play and look at as well, like MountainPass or Wyre.\n\nThe character selection is really small without DLC. Now that TF2 is a free-to-play game, you should probably have access to Pyro by default, but it won't make much of a difference. There's like 6 characters to choose from but they all look similar, with their heads being the difference here, applying to 4 of them, one with gas mask and helmet, one without the helmet but retaining the mask, and the other two have no masks but both have helmets and different faces, all with the same outfit. The other two are both in police uniforms but have different heads, one has a gas mask while the other a riot helmet, revealing his eyes.\n\n There are only two voice sets for these characters, varying between the policemen and the soldiers. This also applies to the DLC characters, most of them anyway. There's 6 unlockable characters that don't look much better than the default ones, in my opinion, you might find them cooler looking. 2 are female, the rest are male, 2 of them are Steampunk reskins of DLC characters. The voice acting isn't terrible despite what people say, at least, personally, I don't think it is that bad, I think it just might be the writing, or perhaps, lack of one. At least, Mark Hayler did an alright job voicing them.\n\nThe DLC characters, most of them, don't look cool enough for me to purchase them, with the more popular ones with the likes of Mr. and Mrs. Foster, as well as DJ Scully and their colorful counterparts, being the only ones that stand out to me. Unfortunately, I find spending money on 4-character packs a waste of money when most of the time you should only have to buy seperately, one euro or two for them. It's ridiculous, in my opinion. Of course, no one's forcing you, but still.\nBasically, the good thing in this part's that some of the DLC characters look and depending on the character, sound cool.\nI'll continue this whole DLC thing later on, when I get to the bad aspects of the game.\n\nThe perks are a really nice way of making the gameplay unique and stand out from most games out there, it might compare to games the likes of TF2 or Overwatch in the case of class-based gameplay, but what's so cool about it is that's co-op only, meaning that each player (out of six max) has a role to play in every match. I don't really have much to add on this part, but it still makes it unique.\n\nI think I covered everything that's good about KF1. Let's get on the ugly, shall we?\n\nFirst and foremost, the DLC shitfest that raked in some pretty good profit merely because of Mr. Foster's popularity and unique looks, not that's a bad thing, especially since I've heard the prices were lower for 4-character DLCs back then, but right now, it's fucking ridiculous how if you want to look less like some commoner and more like a lord, I guess. Sorry for the shite analogy, but seriously. Not just the characters, either, guns too. Oh, you want to use that sweet Bile Thrower for the Medic or SeekerSix for the Demolitions, so cool because it locks on to targets and reloads in one mag? Nope, pay up if you wanna. Fuck that!\n\nWhen you pay for a game, you expect to have all the content made for the game when you buy it, I often don't have an issue with COSMETIC items on this case, but it's just stupid to charge people for sidegrades that might suit your playstyle better! Anyway...Yeah. DLC's if you want your character to look better, most of them overpriced because 4-character packs, few with a single character that happen to be cheap because guess what, single character. Just buy the latest DJ Voltage/Mr. Magma if you want the two coolest and most popular character characters of the DLCs all in one fairly-priced pack.\n\nThere are headshot hitbox issues, making Sharpshooter a HUGE pain to play as. I really wanted to play Sharpshooter more often than I do but I just can't because I swear I'm aiming at their heads and it registers as a bodyshot. Bullcrap! KF2 amends this. This happens often with most of the zeds, mainly Clots, Gorefasts, Sirens and Fleshpounds, as well as the Patriarch himself, sometimes.\n\nSince this is a review, I must tell you, the perks are a heck lot harder to level than in the second one, it's also yet another issue fixed. It's frustrating getting 5.5 million points of damage with each weapon type just to get to max level. Again somewhat amended in the second by introducing XP for kills with perk weapons and beating matches. You can always adopt the strategy I took and try to get an achievement for each map on each difficulty while trying to level the perks, but it's up to you obviously.\n\nI think my last issue with this game that I can think of at the moment, is that it's very easy to get yourself killed in numerous ways just by doing one single mistake, at least if you lack a proper team. It can be quite a frustrating game in later difficulties. I think it's because of how slow the player is even with the melee weapon out, it lacks maneuverability, something KF2 also happens to fix by introducting sprinting, it's much easier to get out of nasty situations, something that probably'll happen to you a ton, too.\n\nMy verdict, is that this game is definitely worth your time if you want some fun, even moreso with friends, and love FPS games. Really, it was designed that way, to be played with 5 other people, shooting down zeds with varied roles. It's fun, and feels quite rewarding to beat a match, especially in harder difficulties. I really can't not recommend this game to FPS lovers, even with KF2 out there, it's worth a try.","timestamp_created":1487693902,"timestamp_updated":1487693902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549001753330230713","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30071756","author":{"steamid":"76561198050341937","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30074,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28557,"last_played":1596315676},"language":"spanish","review":"exelente juego puedes estar muchas horas en el y con la variedad de mapas, armas y enemigos, no te aburres de jugar.","timestamp_created":1487649970,"timestamp_updated":1487649970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30070507","author":{"steamid":"76561198086317855","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":31,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31,"last_played":1487123304},"language":"english","review":"Good God...

Killing floor just isn't nearly as good when you are playing alone and if you can only play it alone then the game will really only be a relic you use to reminisce experience, and then stop playing soon after.","timestamp_created":1487556768,"timestamp_updated":1487556768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30029170","author":{"steamid":"76561198003692786","num_games_owned":415,"num_reviews":115,"playtime_forever":7983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3520,"last_played":1524106694},"language":"spanish","review":"Juego bastante mejorable en muchos sentidos y que se ha quedado algo desfasado, pero es uno de esos multiplayer que nunca pasarán de moda, ni siquiera después de lanzar \"Killing Floor 2\".\n\nLa única pega es la gran cantidad de DLC's que tiene, me parece abusivo.\n\nAún así, ofrece muchísimas horas de entretenimiento.\n\n7/10","timestamp_created":1487494381,"timestamp_updated":1487494381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52702707052230835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30024839","author":{"steamid":"76561198087216761","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":745,"last_played":1427005066},"language":"english","review":"I love it!","timestamp_created":1487476081,"timestamp_updated":1487476081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30023779","author":{"steamid":"76561198028970904","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":121,"playtime_forever":998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":938,"last_played":1463696574},"language":"russian","review":"[h1]Killing Floor:[/h1] \nШутер от первого лица ориентированный на большое кооперативное прохождение.

Самый раздражающий баг - сбивание положения головы противника. Т.е. если сделать достаточно мощный выстрел(предположим из MK23) по телу противника(Отбивальщик), то текстура останется прежней, но голова будет находиться чуть(а бывает и не \"чуть\") левее(или правее) относительно того где вы ее видите. Так же есть баги со сваркой, дверьми, гранатами... Перечислять эти мелочи не особо хочется.\nТак же хочу заметить что после достаточно долгово провождения в этой игре времени, ты перестаёшь нуждаться в помощи товарищей по команде и можешь отыграть 1 за 6 \"Ад на земле\", во второй части такого нет(но это уже совсем другая история).\n\nПерейдем к весомым плюсам.\nИз плюсов я замечу огромное количество карт, как официальных, так и из мастерской и \"огромная куча хороших пушек\" ну и конечно же очаровательного торговца. Оружия в этой игре действительно много и каждое назначено на свою специальность, но это не означает, что будучи медиком ты будешь максимально эффективен, используя ТОЛЬКО стволы медика, какое оружие носить и как его использовать, исключительно на твое личное предусмотрение. Система прокачки тоже весьма неплохая, хоть и требует немало времени, чтобы достичь максимального уровня во всех перках, но совсем не обязательно гнаться получить 6 уровень, можно даже на Аду весьма неплохо справляться и 4, все опять же зависит от вас: как метко вы стреляете, как экономите на покупке оружия и, в конце - концов, ЧТО вы покупаете.\n\nНе буду дальше расписывать ничего, вам нужно просто \"заглянуть\" в эту игру и провести там хотя бы часиков 20, убивая с товарищами бок о бок мерзопакостных мракобесов, эти часы того стоят, вы не пожалеете[/b][/i] ;)","timestamp_created":1487417449,"timestamp_updated":1505246924,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.689246833324432373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30000188","author":{"steamid":"76561198086124656","num_games_owned":264,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1679,"last_played":1542886979},"language":"english","review":"I've always maintained that a game had to either be really creative(on story, game mechanics, art, or the like) or have a really high budget to be successful or fun.

Достаточно только нескольких друзей, ясные головы и руки, растущие из нужного места. Независимые разработчики в последнее время довольно успешно пробиваются в «высшее общество». Ну а те, у кого с реализацией своих идей есть проблемы, идут в модостроение. И тоже добиваются хороших результатов. Например, знаменитый Team Fortress зарождался, как мод для Quake, а уже потом под денежным знаменем Valve стала модом для Half-Life — Team Fortress Classic, ну и в 2007 году вышла полноценная игра. Однако есть и такие проекты, которые из-за кривых рук так и не поразили мир. Пример тому Damnation — будучи модом для Unreal Tournament 2004 игра была довольно оригинальной, но Blue Omega, получив права на полноценную игру, полностью эту самую «игру» угробила, что и вышло ей банкротством.\n\nЗловещие мертвецы\n\nНу а теперь, собственно, о самой Killing Floor. Игра также была модом для Unreal Tournament 2004. Судя по предыстории, Великобританию заполонили орды мутантов, создателем которых был доктор Кламели, клонировавший своих сына и жену, а также модернизировавший себя. Ничем хорошим, разумеется, это не кончилось.\n\nКонечный продукт мало чем отличается от своих «модных» корней. Мы появляемся на карте почти «голыми»: нож, пистолет, сварочный аппарат и шприц для восстановления здоровья. Через пару секунд на нас наваливает первая «волна» мутантов. После каждой такой волны мы должны закупаться в магазинах, а деньги мы получаем за убийства. И так далее, пока не встретим самого доктора, но уже в образе «Патриарха». Убиваем его — конец! Уровни для «гладиаторских боёв» у нас живописные: развалившийся особняк в глуши леса, улицы Лондона, офисы компании и прочее — всё развалившееся, гниющее и тёмное. Прям жуть!\n\nCS с мутантами\n\nИгра буквально является помесью Counter-Strike и Left 4 Dead. Наш герой — выживший солдат. А враги — орды гнилых уродов, желающих порвать нас на куски. Однако не будем же мы стоять и ждать, пока нас рвут. За активное действие против мутантов мы получаем деньги, которые можно смело тратить на амуницию и оружие. А оно, кстати, не халявное. Оружия много: от бензопилы, мачете и парных кольтов до ракетницы и мутантского огнемёта. Однако рано радоваться. Во-первых, оружие стоит, и стоит дорого. А во-вторых — наш герой не Терминатор, а значит у него есть лимит поднятия груза.\n\nМутантов тоже достаточно. На первых волнах на нас бросают простых зомби, да каких-то уродов с клинками вместо рук. Но чем дальше, тем тяжелее. А если вы играете на высоком уровне сложности, то обычные зомби (Клоты) доставят вам не меньше ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥я, чем сам Патриарх. Враги прут со всех 360 градусов и способны не только рвать и кусать, но и «держать» игрока. Достаточно двух Клотов и пары тройки мутантов, чтобы даже на среднем уровне сложности задать вам перца. Однако есть и смешные ситуации: если мутант слишком далеко от вас — он может самопроизвольно умереть. Мистика!\n\nРаз игра появилась из мода для UT2004, то она «наследует» и соответствующие опции. Есть уже известные перки, которые тут выставленный в виде классов: медик, снайпер, техник, берсерк, коммандос, поджигатель и подрывник. Каждый перк «использует» своё оружие, улучшая его. Так, например, снайпер использует неавтоматическое оружие: пистолеты, винтовки, арбалет; берсерк склоняется к холодному оружию; коммандос — к штурмовым винтовкам и тому подобное. Каждый перк можно прокачивать, выполняя соответствующие условия.\n\nТакже игра имеет очень гибкие настройки (так называемая «песочница»). Если вас не устраивают данные вам условия игры, то вперёд: регулируйте количества мутантов за волну, «длину» игры, количество денег ну и так далее. Также можно изменить скин игрока, а их, поверьте, очень много. От обыкновенных полицейских и спецназовцев до Pyro из Team Fortress 2 и солдат и Red Orchestra 2. Уже не стоит говорить и о тех скин-паках, которые одевают игрока, скажем, в Санта-Клауса или футбольного хулигана.","timestamp_created":1487333246,"timestamp_updated":1487333246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29974538","author":{"steamid":"76561198250346888","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1044,"last_played":1624313704},"language":"english","review":"bru get this game and love it as a baby loves a nip","timestamp_created":1487294968,"timestamp_updated":1487294968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29970892","author":{"steamid":"76561198159343860","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5403,"last_played":1543079710},"language":"russian","review":"хорошая игра)) мне очень нравится, с друзьями поиграть самое то))","timestamp_created":1487278856,"timestamp_updated":1487278856,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29956122","author":{"steamid":"76561198059807374","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5351,"last_played":1596867053},"language":"english","review":"Really great game overall.

The variety of maps, weapons, perks, enemies, and difficulties is immense and provides incredible depth. The characters and their dialogue are hilarious and memorable. \n\nI think this game is superior to its sequel in many ways. The gameplay is deeper and more skillful. Fast, accurate aiming and knowledge of combos is essential to becoming skilled at your chosen perk at the higher levels, and attaining these skills is rewarding and fun. You can really feel the improvement as you play more and more. KF2 by contrast lacks the same type of combos and fast, precise aim and replaces it with mad m1 spam at faster-moving hordes of zeds. \n\nThe game does have its flaws in that its hitboxes are unintuitive and often misaligned with the zed models, but once you learn how the models and hitboxes work this becomes less of an obvious issue. The game also has gritty, outdated graphics, but it doesn't really look all that bad and adds to the charm of the game.\n\nUnfortunately there isn't much of a playerbase these days, but there's a lot of content to be enjoyed even for a solo player. Overall, this game is a masterpiece and you can easily spend thousands upon thousands of hours on it. Even though KF2 exists, buy KF1 and put some time into it. You won't regret it.\n","timestamp_created":1487021408,"timestamp_updated":1487021408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617512345314025879","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29908421","author":{"steamid":"76561198301734646","num_games_owned":1791,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1487017282},"language":"english","review":"Pretty

Не соглашусь с данным мнением, так как мы имеем игру, которая хоть и схожа с L4D присутствием зомбаков, пушек и кооператива, но основа всего - защита.\n\nЦель игры проста: \n1) убить всё то, что прёт на тебя; \n2) получить бабки за это;\n3) затарится у местной торговки стволами и холодным оружием;\n4) вернуться к пункту 1, если это не конечная волна;\n5) победить босса, конец\n\nДва режима игры: Защита (тупо отстрел волн мертвецов) и кооперативный режим, где необходимо помимо отстрела милых трупоедов ещё выполнять какое-то задание (что-то открывать, взрывать, переносить что-то куда-то и т.д.).\n\nБольшое количество карт. Стандартные карты, карты связанные с каким-то событием (Рождество, Новый Год, Хэллоуин, Лето(???)), а также карты, созданные игроками. \n\nОгромный арсенал оружия. Пистолеты, ружья, дробовики, штурмовые и снайперские винтовки, холодное оружие. Да даже пила есть. Ну просто праздник для любителей покрошить мертвяков.\n\nИмеется система перков (максимальный уровень - 6), которые дают игроку особые возможности, есть привязка оружия к перкам. Можно прокачивать перки независимо от того, какой перк выбран игроком (например, выбран перк \"Снайпер\", а игрок крошит зомбаков катаной, и идёт прокачка другого перка, связанного с холодным оружием).\n\nСаундтрек. О да, крутые гитарные риффы подходят под весь тот процесс, что будет происходить на вашем экране. \nДо графики придираться не стоит, здесь скорее важен игровой процесс, а он очень динамичен: зазевался, и к тебе в спину постучала толпа зомбаков, а то и хуже - мясник или отбивальщик (Добрый вечер, ага :D).\n\nНесмотря на то, что игре уже 8 лет (год выпуска: 2009), онлайн до сих пор живее всех живых, в отличии от некоторых раскрученных современных шутеров. Настоятельно рекомендую к приобретению, а также советую захватить с собой одного или более друзей, чтобы веселее было.","timestamp_created":1486320317,"timestamp_updated":1486320317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29723754","author":{"steamid":"76561198310001311","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":88,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":42,"last_played":1559498725},"language":"french","review":"DE LA MERDE Y'A PLUS PERSONNE PUTAIN","timestamp_created":1486314340,"timestamp_updated":1486314340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29712320","author":{"steamid":"76561198176737871","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":13318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7462,"last_played":1619313525},"language":"english","review":"Great game","timestamp_created":1486280187,"timestamp_updated":1486280187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509725391864776611","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29709208","author":{"steamid":"76561198038776903","num_games_owned":5785,"num_reviews":2243,"playtime_forever":310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":310,"last_played":1456195431},"language":"schinese","review":"回合制波次刷怪，自由度太低，刷波次的时候还要等很久。没意思。","timestamp_created":1486265899,"timestamp_updated":1486265899,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.171452149748802185","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29705669","author":{"steamid":"76561198096450566","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":35591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27110,"last_played":1540606766},"language":"spanish","review":"buen juego. adictivo como la pasta","timestamp_created":1486250640,"timestamp_updated":1486250640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29701502","author":{"steamid":"76561198142978803","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":7195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5,"playtime_at_review":3836,"last_played":1659958158},"language":"hungarian","review":"Ez a játék egyszerűen fantasztikus.
