Combinando uma excelente narrativa a lá grandes livros clássicos, uma gameplay que ainda impressiona depois de vários anos, entre outras, inúmeras técnicas de produção positivas que formam este magnifico jogo que é Half Life. \n\n[h1]Sinopse da Narrativa[/h1]\nNo jogo, assumimos um protagonista apelidado de Gordon Freeman, um físico teórico que encontra-se atrasado para o seu trabalho. É um personagem vazio, de uma forma correta, já que assim a emersão é mais fácil adquirida. A ação começa bastante lenta, para os parâmetros de hoje em dia. É uma abordagem justificável já que é para demonstrar os gráficos possíveis para a altura e também como forma de ensinar o jogador das mecânicas básicas de movimento, em um ambiente não mortal. Quando chegamos as instalações de Black Mesa, um colapso ocorre e temos a missão de abandonar o local infestado de alienígenas.\n[h1]O que adoro no jogo[/h1]\nPara começo de conversas, Half Life foi um jogo revolucionário para o seu tempo. Este trouxe visuais esplendidos para a sua época e uma apresentação impensável e único ainda mesmo hoje. Trata-se de um universo bastante vivo e imersivo. Itens a rodar depois de um inimigo morto, vida espalhada em locais escondidos e outros tropos dos videojogos não são aplicados neste jogo já que tudo parece realista.\n[h1]Nem tudo é um mar de rosas[/h1]\nO jogo corre no motor gráfico da Valve, bastante conhecido por vários portugueses, o GoldSource que é uma versão mais antiga da Source. Com isso em mente, esperamos um motor gráfico um pouco datado para os parâmetros de hoje em dia e com problemas em computadores modernos. Desde scripts que funcionam de forma incorreta, a uma UI pequena para grandes resoluções.\nTambém é importante mencionar que o desenrolar do jogo torna-se lento para o termino do mesmo. Em Xen, o jogo não trás a mesma emoção e suspense que trazia nos níveis de Black Mesa.\n[h1]Recomendo o jogo?[/h1]\nMas é claro que sim! Sei que não é para todos, pelo menos hoje em dia. Sei que a procura é maior e um jogo não tão polido para os parâmetros de hoje estragaram a experiencia. Só digo que para os que esquecerem os problemas causados pelas texturas, vão adorar o jogo e ficar fãs das franquias. Podem sempre comprar o jogo dos fãs, licenciado pela Valve, Black Mesa que converte o jogo para os dias de hoje.","timestamp_created":1593281154,"timestamp_updated":1593338632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71505222","author":{"steamid":"76561198443911867","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":491,"last_played":1593346199},"language":"english","review":"Nice game i bought it at the steam summer sale wich was a great idea because its great but i like the sequel more. but its a great game","timestamp_created":1593278428,"timestamp_updated":1593278428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71505042","author":{"steamid":"76561198044029326","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":850,"last_played":1593278223},"language":"english","review":"It a classic.

It has a great story, cool characters, awesome weapons (including the signature crowbar,)  fast paced game play, and a pinch of horror. The story is about a man called Gordon Freeman, who works at the Black Mesa Facility. He was testing an experiment when something went terribly wrong, the experiment caused a Resonance Cascade opening up a portal to a strange alien world known as Zen. So Gordon needs to close the portal. I honestly think that this game is a masterpiece, including it's brothers, Blue Shift and Opposing Force.

Не буду врать, для современного игрока эта игра может не подойти из-за графики, моделек и истории, которая очень проста, но по своему привлекательна. \nЕсли объяснять на пальцах, то замес такой:\nОчкарик по имени Гордон Фримен приезжает в блек мезу, чтобы запихнуть кристалл из потустороннего измерения в большую х**вину под названием Антимасс-Спектрометер. Естественно, запихнув кристалл все взрывается, пердит и кряхтит и в итоге происходит каскадный резонанс и существа из другого мира начали атаковать Исследовательскую корпорацию. И начинается п*здец. Сначала все красиво и весело дохнут напоказ, а потом нам выдают оружие, чтобы мы присоединились.  \nГоворя о достоинствах игры, можно выделить подачу самой истории, дизайн локаций (до сих пор помню всю черную мезу во всех деталях), интересный геймплей и атмосферу, которая она смогла подарить большому количеству игроков по всему миру. В то время она смогла взять много наград за графику, повествование, и инновационный мир игры. Кроме того, все издания окрестили её классикой и самой лучшей игрой за всё время.\n10 мертвых очкариков из 10","timestamp_created":1593255758,"timestamp_updated":1593256128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.611111104488372803","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71477705","author":{"steamid":"76561198106190092","num_games_owned":485,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":32,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1650485073},"language":"turkish","review":"wow","timestamp_created":1593253993,"timestamp_updated":1593253993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515723288059234619","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71475214","author":{"steamid":"76561198417495634","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1056,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1056,"last_played":1590145070},"language":"russian","review":".....","timestamp_created":1593251474,"timestamp_updated":1593251474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71473419","author":{"steamid":"76561198313226860","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":3659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2852,"last_played":1598646370},"language":"english","review":"grodon freeman","timestamp_created":1593249675,"timestamp_updated":1593249675,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71471518","author":{"steamid":"76561198859269013","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2955,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1658348230},"language":"russian","review":"замечательная интересная игра особенно битва с нихилантом","timestamp_created":1593247794,"timestamp_updated":1593247794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71471016","author":{"steamid":"76561198398977064","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1213,"last_played":1631981724},"language":"russian","review":":d2naturesprophet:","timestamp_created":1593247274,"timestamp_updated":1656487729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71468399","author":{"steamid":"76561198880589221","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":107,"last_played":1642888087},"language":"german","review":"x","timestamp_created":1593244449,"timestamp_updated":1593244449,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464414983987808228","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71468361","author":{"steamid":"76561198145007919","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1652435630},"language":"russian","review":"It's a Half-Life game.
