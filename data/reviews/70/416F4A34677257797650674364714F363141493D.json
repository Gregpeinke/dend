some may state that the game has shown its age and is no longer visually appealing and enjoyable, I genuinely felt a sense of euphoria while playing the game.  The pacing of combat, environments, and story come together in tandem with a sense of needing to use your brain at times. It's a groundbreaking game that all FPS fans should play at least once. The story may feel a little scarce, but it's the least of your concern. This game's highlight stems from the environments and the unique aspect of what Valve has created - the entire game perpetually propelling you forward as you enter unique environments and combat scenarios non-stop. It's incredible, and I can't get over how much I love that and other things about the game.\n\nHowever, I noticed one issue in some combat instances where you are facing enemies at medium to low health with little to no suit charge. At times, completion of several combat scenarios may be impossible; even on easy mode, it was genuinely challenging at times should you be in low health from a previous altercation. While this may be my issue with being \"shit\" or \"bad,\" I beg to differ. I wouldn't recommend this on hard mode. The worst thing about Half-Life is the chapters set in Xen by far. The level design is a trainwreck, it's visually unappealing, and it contains some sloppy platforming and boring boss fights. The entire game is golden, save for Xen. Usually, when I finished Lambda Core, I'd power through to Interloper and eventually stop playing. However, as I said, the entire game is golden - save for Xen.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game to anyone into First-Person Shooters or even those NOT into First-Person Shooters. It's a must-play and a unique experience that will not leave you disappointed.\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1617154576,"timestamp_updated":1617154576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89403598","author":{"steamid":"76561198190730539","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":26506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25534,"last_played":1645926058},"language":"english","review":"They're waiting for you Gordon, in the test chamber.","timestamp_created":1617153986,"timestamp_updated":1617153986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487784892320632935","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89401083","author":{"steamid":"76561198961232539","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":193,"last_played":1624467169},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego","timestamp_created":1617149663,"timestamp_updated":1617149663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89399623","author":{"steamid":"76561198873811071","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":531,"last_played":1638148991},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen Juego, buena jugabilidad, buena historia y buen final","timestamp_created":1617147144,"timestamp_updated":1617147144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89397269","author":{"steamid":"76561198079309174","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8445,"last_played":1639085842},"language":"english","review":"Absolute classic","timestamp_created":1617143101,"timestamp_updated":1617143101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89395746","author":{"steamid":"76561198053824471","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1004,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1004,"last_played":1592986998},"language":"english","review":"better than sex","timestamp_created":1617140773,"timestamp_updated":1617140773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629629611968994141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89395296","author":{"steamid":"76561198841649476","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":652,"last_played":1624669427},"language":"english","review":"yes\n","timestamp_created":1617140079,"timestamp_updated":1617140079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89390461","author":{"steamid":"76561198349403459","num_games_owned":349,"num_reviews":120,"playtime_forever":1279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":551,"last_played":1617177171},"language":"english","review":"You obviously don't need to hear from me that this game is cult, so I'll stick to this: having played it through for the first time in 2021, I can clearly see why Half-Life has its place in the Hall of Fame of videogames.

I would give this five crowbars out of five.","timestamp_created":1616984059,"timestamp_updated":1616984059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89288216","author":{"steamid":"76561198312197249","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1507,"last_played":1628810071},"language":"english","review":"fantastic just dont play the xen levels","timestamp_created":1616983810,"timestamp_updated":1616983810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89287845","author":{"steamid":"76561198210420636","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1071,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1071,"last_played":1616982986},"language":"english","review":"The game that started it all. 10/10","timestamp_created":1616983134,"timestamp_updated":1616983134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89286867","author":{"steamid":"76561199099866516","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":602,"last_played":1659046183},"language":"english","review":"a must play for all gamers if not theirs something wrong with you","timestamp_created":1616981381,"timestamp_updated":1616981381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89286675","author":{"steamid":"76561198054552974","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1636376493},"language":"turkish","review":".","timestamp_created":1616981071,"timestamp_updated":1616981071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89285247","author":{"steamid":"76561198312194218","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":976,"last_played":1658331387},"language":"english","review":"its a great","timestamp_created":1616978560,"timestamp_updated":1616978560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89284782","author":{"steamid":"76561199121266864","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":19631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":658,"playtime_at_review":8013,"last_played":1660539091},"language":"english","review":"amazing a few flaws here and there but absolutely brilliant, this is\nsimplistic bit long and great all along, the xen levels are not great almost at all but have some good moments. i loved every second of this game from the begining you should play it.
