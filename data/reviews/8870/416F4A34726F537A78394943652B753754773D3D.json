The storyline and the lore is without doubt, imo, the greatest there is. The plot might seem complicated and hard to understand at first but when you continue to play and story is slowly being reveal, you would be stuck wanting to know more. It's like you're waiting for the next episode of a show or a movie just when things about to reach it's peak, you can't stop.\n\nThe game's atmosphere really is enjoyable. The music, background and scene fit well in every scenario. Gameplay is unique from other FPS and I quite enjoy it. Some character in the game have me emotional involved. \nThis game is a MUST have for every gamer as it is one of the best story telling WITH ACTION GAMEPLAY.

Enimies have great variety and the new systems support the game very well. \n\nStory is the main reason we love this game! Its is epic! The world is based in the late 1800s century in a fictional flying city of Columbia. Were you will later get to know its story and reveal it's sectrets. This is the main area of the game (I may be biased because I love the style of the 1700-1960s). The characters are epic! Elizabeth and Booker are very well done characters and their stories are personalities are perfect and they are represented in a prefect matter. The side characters are also very well done (Lutece twins, Fritzroy and so on). There is no boring moment in this story. \n\nAlso the DLC is also very strong in it's own story and you should really play both of the episodes. \n\nGet this game and enjoy. \n\nFinal rating 10/10","timestamp_created":1454111738,"timestamp_updated":1462574045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50205761194229126","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20836513","author":{"steamid":"76561198221662804","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":538,"last_played":1482797138},"language":"english","review":"The best singleplayer game i have ever played in my life!!!
