Вы играете за девушку, которую оставили в камере хранения, как и всех других, после распада компании. Но вас пробуждает один веселый, как вы потом узнаете, дрон. Он попытается вывести вас из этого старого и трухлявого комплекса. Вообще игра состоит из, если я не ошибаюсь, 11 или 12 глав, а то и больше.\nВ каждой главе вы будете проходить, разного рода, испытания.\nНапример в 1 главе вы получите портальную пушку и пробудите главный мозг компании, который вы убили в первой главе(утверждать не могу потому, что в первую часть не играл).\nДалее она заставит проходить вас разные испытания и будет мучить на каждом из них, подшучивая и усложняя вам испытания.\nНо в один прекрасный момент вы сбежите из подопытных камер и смените ее на того мелкого дрона, который вас пробудил.\nИ тут он вас предаст!!!(поробности объяснять не стану будет не интересно играть)\nВообщем на этом и начинается сама долгая и довольно интересная игра.\n1. Вам может показаться, что прохождение камер испытаний это довольно нудно и быстро надоедает, но могу оспорить это, когда вы впервый раз пройдете камеру вам захочется узнать, что будет во второй потом в третьей и т.д. Также вам захочется узнать как закончится сюжет, ведь он довольно запутанный и очень интересный.\n2. Обстановку в игре разбавляет и речь ваших помошьников, а так же противников. Именно из-за речи героев в игре она становится такой забавной. Все герои в этой игре почти на всем протяжении игры несут всякую чущь. Это реально очень смешно.\n3. Эта игра для более взрослых людей, тех кто умеет неординарно мыслить и знает много всего, если вы посадите играть в эту игру ребенка (до стадии подростка), то он не пройдет даже первую главу, да и не поймет всего юмора.\n4. Четвертая особенность этой игры, то что она не жрет слишком много, почти на любом компе или ноуте в нее можно играть на максимальных настройках графики. Кароче, для этой класной игры не нужно много крутых деталий таких как: видеокарта, процессор и т.д.\n5. это естественно незабываемый геймплей. Порталы, а это главная особенность игры, просто перевернут реальность с ног на голову, эта игра просто взорвет ваш мозг и мировозрение воей не реальностью и необычностью.\n6. У этой игры, что не мало важно, есть мастерская стим, откуда вы сможете загружать себе новые уровни и многое другое.\nВообщем эта игра обязательно понравится и подросткам и взрослым, конечно тем, которые умеют мыслить.\nУ этой игры нет множества дополнений, которые вам захотелось бы купить для персонализации, зато к этой игре как я выше сказал прилагается мастерская стим, которая сможет порадовать вас новыми добавлениями в игру.\nЯ рекомендую вам эту игру и обещаю вам, что вас она обязательно удивит и порадует своей, прежде всего, необычностью!!!\nСпасибо всем, кто прочитал мою рекомендацию, и если кто-то не нащел здесь то, что искал пишите в коменты, и я вам все подробно объясню и расскажу, а также буду больше знать, что вас интересует!!!!\nНадеюсь вам понравилось))!\n","timestamp_created":1385581864,"timestamp_updated":1385581864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7790612","author":{"steamid":"76561198093131912","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1518905702},"language":"english","review":"Very fun game\n","timestamp_created":1385581319,"timestamp_updated":1385581319,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7790179","author":{"steamid":"76561198071420883","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":943,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":123,"last_played":1587846306},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegazoo! sin duda uno de los mejores juegos que hay","timestamp_created":1385580298,"timestamp_updated":1385580298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7789528","author":{"steamid":"76561198016878107","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1289,"last_played":1372970633},"language":"english","review":"I immediately loved the concept of Portal 2: Science experiments as a premise to have fun and exercise you brain.

So far, I only missed puzzles that required deep coordination of the co-op partners. It was mostly static decisions, where timing was not an issue.

Something that does not hinder the experience by any means.\nWheatley is fun and GLaDoS's personality shift is frankly amazing.\nThe graphics aren't realistic for today's standards but they are beautiful, especially since Hammer / Source 1 (P2 Build) features raytracing for baked lighting. \nThe result is a game that performs very well on all systems. Unless your CPU doesn't have the instructions necessary to run the game 😛\n\nThere is the possibility to create your own chambers or download others' from the workshop. This paired with the co-op makes for a very replayable experience.\nThe latter of which is lots of fun, grab a friend and enjoy it.\n\nAlmost every interaction in the game results in dynamic changes to the soundtrack. Flying through a portal, adds up to the intensity of the soundtrack. Jumping from a platform... And so on.\nThe OST is always adapting to every moment and every action that you do. This is something that, to this day, only a few game developers do.\n\nThe difficulty curve is very satisfying, once you get the grip of it, you'll figure everything out. Valve made sure to watch people play the game and figure out exactly in which ways they could throw all sorts of hints at you without spoiling the experience entirely.\n\nI guarantee that playing this game is a mindblowing and unforgettable experience, I definitely recommend checking it out if you haven't already.\n\nTo this date, it is unknown whether Valve will ever release a prequel or a sequel, but it would very, very welcoming.\nLet's hope this IP does not get forgotten like Half-Life almost did...","timestamp_created":1385513929,"timestamp_updated":1650392679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7777488","author":{"steamid":"76561198034674042","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":1558,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1002,"last_played":1658420100},"language":"english","review":"Portal is just one of the biggest classics of its generation.
