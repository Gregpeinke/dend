After playing through the collapsed Rapture in Bishock 1, it was refreshing to have a nice looking city to walk through with people. The music is very good, especially in the in-game music that is intergrated throughout the city. The characters are superb, especially Elizabeth. The narrative is interesting and I was enthralled and captivated to the very end. The gameplay has been refined since the original Bioshock, and I thought it was really fun. \n\nClash in the Clouds (DLC) is a fun, arena style mode with various maps and challenges, and all weapons/vigors avaliable to choose from. It comes with a museum to curate with statues, artwork, music etc. \n\nBurial at Sea (DLC) returns to Rapture before the events of the orignal Bioshock. It was interesting and adds some new game dynamics, such as more stealth orientated gameplay. I liked seeing Rapture in its glorious heyday, but with signs of what is to come.","timestamp_created":1474952554,"timestamp_updated":1474952554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25719914","author":{"steamid":"76561198219586395","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1762,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":952,"last_played":1475858012},"language":"spanish","review":"Un  gran juego con una de las mejores historias para algun videjojuego una jugavilidad justa y detalles extraordinarios.... pero  llega a tener bajones mas en las peleas grandes  y algunos bug pero nada que impida disfrutar una experiencia unica","timestamp_created":1474949328,"timestamp_updated":1474949328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25719818","author":{"steamid":"76561198128551180","num_games_owned":461,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1853,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1383,"last_played":1628597327},"language":"thai","review":"โห มันอัดอั้นจริงๆ ต้องมาเขียน รีวิว คือ ชอบตั้งแต่เนื้อเรื่องหลักแล้ว \n\nไม่ว่าระบบการต่อสู้ การดำเนินเนื้อเรื่อง ฉาก แสง สี ฉากคัทซีน การแสดงสีหน้าอารมณ์ของ npc คือรักเลยอ่ะ ไหนตัวเกมส์จะยัด แม่สาวจอมโมเอะ อลิซาเบท มาให้อีก เอาใจไปเลยค่ะ 555555\n\nเนื้อเรื่อง ก็โคตร แฟนตาซี เอาไปคุยกันได้อีกนาน ไม่ว่าจะภาคไหนๆ ก็ยังคงความเข้าใจยาก ชวนคิดให้ได้เสมอ \n\nแล้วผมเพิ่งมีกำลังทรัพย์จัด burial at sea คือ อยากได้มานานแล้ว แต่ตอนนั้นไปติดเกมส์อื่นอยู่ เราขอโทษนะ 55555\n\nอยากจะบอกว่า ทีมงานก็ยังมีทีเด็ดไว้ เซอร์ไพร เราๆ ไว้ใน dlc อีกด้วย นั่นก็คือ อลิซซาเบท น่ารักขึ้นแบบ สึสๆ โตเป็นสาวเต็มตัวเลยทีเดียว ผมนี้ กด f12 เพลินเลย \n\nเอ้ย ไม่ใช่ 55555  หมายถึง ก็ยังคง ความเข้าใจยากและชวนคิดให้เราได้อีก  โดยเป็นการ เล่าในอีก โลกอื่นๆ โดยมีตัวละครที่เราคุ้นเคย ช่วยในการให้เราอยากติดตาม \n\nทั้ง dlc มี salt ใหม่ หรือก็ พลังในมือซ้าย และก็ปืนใหม่ๆ ให้เล่นอีกด้วย ที่ว่าคุ้มค่า dlc คือซื้อมาดู อลิซซาเบทโตขึ้น ผมว่า คุ้มแล้ว55555555\n\nทั้งนี้ เพื่อนผม หาข่าวบอกว่า ตัวผู้พัฒนานั้น ได้ปิดจ็อบเกมส์นีี้ไว้แล้ว  ผมจึงอยากใคร่ขอวอน พี่ พี่มาทำต่อเถอะนะ ผมรักเกมส์พี่มาก555555555\n\nทั้งนี้ ยังมีการที่ว่า ผู้ที่มี bioshock 1-2 อยู่ในคลังแล้ว คุณจะได้ ภาค remastered ไปเลย ฟรีๆ เย้ๆๆ555555 นี้เป็นการบ่งบอกได้เลยว่า เขาอยากที่จะนำเสนอผลงาน ไม่ใช่ นำเสนอราคาเกมส์ มั้งนะ เข้าข้างไปป่าวหว่ะ 555555\n\nสุดท้ายนี้ ถึง ภาค infinite และ burial at sea จะเป็น ฉากสุดท้ายของ bioshock เราก็จะจดจำในความสุดยอดของนายไว้นะ 55555\n\nขอแสดงความชาบู 10.97/10  \n\n0.97 นี้ให้เพราะ อลิซซาเบท เลย5555555555","timestamp_created":1474948557,"timestamp_updated":1497852597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55576711893081665","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25719321","author":{"steamid":"76561198075763443","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1513909437},"language":"english","review":"Pretty A OK\n","timestamp_created":1474944360,"timestamp_updated":1474944360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25719311","author":{"steamid":"76561198074567525","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":6314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1845,"last_played":1538166871},"language":"english","review":"What an amazing game.

Each area was clearly designed solely to be a combat arena, with the mere aesthetic of a city.\n-Boring, generic characters that all fit at least one archetypical mold.\n-The story, though sort of interesting in its own right, was predictable, anticlimactic, and ultimately strayed too far from the original BioShock storyline.\n-The \"vigors\" we too powerful, the AI was unintelligent, and the weapon/\"vigor\" upgrade system was way too easy to access, all of which leads back into the point of unchallenging gameplay.\n-The hacking system has been removed entirely.\n-Alternate Ammo Types have been removed (the Vox Varients could arguably be \"ammo types,\" but that's stretching it).\n-The shield system makes the game very easy (ProTip: Invest in shields, not HP. Shields regenerate).\n-When your health does manage to get too low, you have to rely on Elizibeth for aid, because Health Packs have been removed.\n-Elizibeth's ability to open \"tears\" that give you another advantage in the fight were pure cheese.\n-Most of the weapons were far outshined by other weapons (I used the Carbine and Triple-R the whole game).\n-The \"Equipment System\" is a crappy reissue (downgrade, imo) of the Gene Tonic system.\n-The \"Boss Enemies\" are not a challenge.\n-There was only one real boss fight (two, if you count that the same boss is used twice).\nand lastly, and most firmly,\n-The Skylines. Whilst on them, you are practically invulnerable. When diving from them, your attack is a one hit kill. If a Skyline is in one of the fighting areas, I cheesed it to no end because why shouldn't I?

There are no level maps. With the ability to ride sky lines, Bioshok Infinite is literally a rail shooter.\n[*]In rare cases when you find some \"secret\" stuff, game lists it as a secondary objective: \"you found a closed box, go look for the key\". Thankfully, there's no path marker leading to the key.\n[*]No combination locks. Instead you pick up generic lockpicks and use them to unlock any locked door or safe. There's one door locked with obligatory 0451 code, but it's opened in a cutscene without player's input.\n    [*]You can only carry two weapons. If you run out of ammo for both equipped guns, you're forced to run around the battlefield and search for a new weapon to swap or sit in cover and wait until Elizabeth throws a loaded weapon at you. There is only one ammo type per weapon.\n    [*]Weapons and their upgrades are more boring now: ordinary pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers etc. Upgrades do not change how the weapon looks. No more crazy revolvers with two cylinders, electric shotguns and spear launchers.\n[*]No passive tonics. Partially replaced by gear, but it's limited to four slots total: hat, shirt, pants and boots, with no ability to increase this limit. Also you cannot mix and match any effects as you wish, as every gear piece can only be equipped in its designated slot.\n[*]No first aid kits or EVE hypos. When you're getting low on health in a fight you're have to drop everything and run around searching for a tear with health packs or you're dead. The're a small shield that regenerates when not under attack, but enemies destroy it in couple of hits (on hard difficulty at least).\n[*]No vita chambers. You're probably wondering why is it a bad thing - it's because in previous two games vita chambers could be disabled in settings. In Infinite you have no choice but to accept your \"revival\" and lose money in the process. There are no manual saves anymore too, so there are no reasonable way to bypass that if you liked to play without vita chambers before. \n    [*]Hacking was removed. There's a plasmid (or vigour, how they call them here) that serves a similar purpose, but it only works for a short time and huge drain on salt (EVE). Using it on a vending machine makes it drop a small amount of money instead of decreasing sell prices.\n[/list]\n\nI'm still recommending to play Bioshock Infinite for the story - it's worth it regardless of shooting mechanics and exploration. Just set the difficulty to easy, don't repeat my mistake.","timestamp_created":1474826596,"timestamp_updated":1480097208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553017795085906982","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25697479","author":{"steamid":"76561198114942081","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1576,"last_played":1656803428},"language":"english","review":"Completed the story to find my mind blown.

Взрывай, хедшутари, разрывай, поджаривай - делай что хочешь!\n- огромное количество вариаций убийства врага;\n- сюжет захватывающий, интересный, интригующий;\n- полное погружение в происходящее, сопереживание героям обеспечено;\n- у меня ушло всего 14.5 чистой игры без намеренного зарабатывания достижений.\n\nНе переживайте, если не играли в первые 2 игры франшизы. Bioshock Infinite выходит на сцену со своей оригинальной историей!  \n\nРебят, обязательно поиграйте!!! Это игра стоит своих денег.
