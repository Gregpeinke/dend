Both narratives happen in parallel, and if you played Half-Life before you will better enjoy the events seen from a different perspective, although it's possible to do so without having finished Half-Life before.\n\nThe game is shorter, about a third or half the original. There are some new enemies and weapons that keep things fresh. Jumping puzzles are not as frequent or as frustrating as the original, and rope mechanics, having been so criticized by many, do not interfere with gameplay at all. In fact, the game ends up being even more fluid than the original.\n\nOpposing Force is a good example of what an expansion should look like, increasing the content of the original game, adding things that renew the gameplay and reducing the size of the campaign so that it doesn't get tiring.","timestamp_created":1596399780,"timestamp_updated":1596399780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73669529","author":{"steamid":"76561198451694930","num_games_owned":575,"num_reviews":100,"playtime_forever":301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1596398643},"language":"english","review":"Not a review, just a recommendation.","timestamp_created":1596397135,"timestamp_updated":1596397135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616266787052154541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73668737","author":{"steamid":"76561198286529793","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":429,"last_played":1596390041},"language":"english","review":"Despite the many problems later in the game with the absolute ungodly amounts of annoying enemies (the sewer area, etc.), the game's additions are for the most part nice and and the overall game is fun.

A lot of the weapons are more or less just neat replacements for the original half life weapons, but there's a multiplayer mode that admittedly I haven't tried which has both sets available for use. And the weapons are fun to use so it's fine I guess. If you really like half life, you'll enjoy this.

Опять же, во время прохождения, игра нам даёт понять что всё происходит параллельно с оригиналом и дополнением Blue Shift. В этот же раз нам поведают историю от лица персонажа по имени Адриан Шепард, который является капралом военного спецподразделения HECU. Военные были вынуждены отправится в Чёрную Мезу, для заметения следов после вторжения мира, жителями измерения Зен (Ксен). Сюжет не менее интересный чем в прошлых частях серии. Динамичность в каждой главе. Видов оружия стало больше, в том числе и оружия ближнего боя. Появились новые не менее интересные персонажи, а также босс. В общем рекомендую пройти каждому, особенно фанатам.","timestamp_created":1596235791,"timestamp_updated":1596235976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qafE0/MCcZLYmAI="}
