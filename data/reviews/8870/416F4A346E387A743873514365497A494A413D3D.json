Es hat einfach alles von einer genialen Story bis hin zum Gameplay, das ich überraschend gut fand, da es in anderen Reviews nicht so gelobt wurde.

One minute you could be zipping around in the sky on a type of tramline, the next having a huge shootout with countless enemies!\n\nThe game is beautiful to look at too, the 'city in the sky' setting is really immersive and the developers have gone to a lot of trouble to make 'Columba' as it is known to really look beautiful.  The game style is similar to that of its predecessors as one might expect but this is fun as it was in 'Rapture'(Bioshock 1&2) , no need to fix what is not broken.\n\nI am really enjoying this gaming experience and would highly recommend it to anyone, especially as it is only £4.99!

If you haven't played this game yet but intend to, do yourself a favor and DO NOT spoil the twist ending for youself. Like any game, it has its imperfections: I feel like the new Health/Salts system is nowhere as good as the system in the first BioShock Health/Eve system. Here, instead of having several health kits and even hypos on you that allow you to refresh your health and eve in a battle, you need to actively look for those items in your environment which can often be a hassle because the salts are so scarce. While under different circumstances this system might have worked, in BioShock Infinite it just becomes annoying after a while. Another qualm that I have is the Vigors themselves. While each of the vigors is unique and can be combo'd with another vigor, most of the vigors do essentially the same thing: they disable enemies in an area for a few seconds and deal some damage. There are some exceptions but ultimately out of the entire arsenal of vigors you end up just going around using one of them to do all the work. Unlike BioShock 1 and 2, the storyline is now much more linear and while some sandbox elements were added such as a couple of secret locations, they're barely noticeable. The Haevy Hitters, which are the equivalents of the Big Daddies from previous games have been reduced from enemies that you need to carefully plan your fights with to simple bullet sponges. \nUltimately, despite these flaws the game is still very fun and enjoyable, has a great story and I do recommend, but it doesn't live up to the original BioShock.\n","timestamp_created":1395455439,"timestamp_updated":1395455439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56081080436706543","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9589308","author":{"steamid":"76561198050771648","num_games_owned":365,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":718,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1395526322},"language":"english","review":".....................So much fun beautiful levels and awsome characters not to mention some totaly amazing gameplay","timestamp_created":1395455438,"timestamp_updated":1395455438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9589300","author":{"steamid":"76561198105578417","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1628941644},"language":"russian","review":"Это самая крутая игра","timestamp_created":1395455360,"timestamp_updated":1395455360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9589293","author":{"steamid":"76561198030778396","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":844,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1554602932},"language":"english","review":"love it","timestamp_created":1395455302,"timestamp_updated":1395455302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9589292","author":{"steamid":"76561198107410989","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":66,"last_played":1465890399},"language":"english","review":"march 25th eh?

В 1900 году Америка, находясь на высоком технологическом развитии, построила большой летающий город — Колумбию, который должен был стать гордостью американской нации и большим чудом среди человеческих изобретений. Однако, через некоторое время, в городе произошло восстание, Колумбия вышла из под контроля и исчезла из поля зрения. Протагонистом игры является бывший сотрудник «Детективного агентства Пинкертона» — Букер ДеВитт. В 1912 году к нему обращается некий человек, знающий местоположение Колумбии, и за высокий гонорар просит его освободить оттуда девушку по имени Элизабет, обладающую сверхъестественными способностями. Запер её туда некий человек по имени Захари Комсток, который верил, что за девушкой стоит огромное будущее и именно она займет место правителя Колумбии. Но вытащить Элизабет оказалось не так легко: на страже у девушки была огромная механическая птица — «Соловей». Чудом, Букеру удалось освободить Элизабет из крепости и теперь они должны выбираться из города, вместе противостоя разнообразным врагам. В ходе путешествия ДеВитту открывается правда о происхождении Элизабет — именно та правда, которую он пытался забыть много лет назад.","timestamp_created":1395437259,"timestamp_updated":1395437259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9587088","author":{"steamid":"76561198043240222","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1234,"last_played":1439470260},"language":"czech","review":"Amazing

It's jaw droppingly gorgeous in a way that the original Bioshock never managed and the interaction between Elizabeth and Booker is excellent - just the fact that it's two way raises it above the Freeman\\Alyx pairing straight away. Elizabeth herself is interesting as a character and less of a helpless damsel than may first be thought. \n\nUltimately, Infinit is visually arresting and intriguing, and a game that's worth experiencing.","timestamp_created":1395424136,"timestamp_updated":1395424136,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9584840","author":{"steamid":"76561198079455533","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":714,"last_played":1468956979},"language":"english","review":"Historically Accurate 10/10, The KKK have Crows.\n","timestamp_created":1395423339,"timestamp_updated":1395423339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503311276435852051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n8zt8sQCeIzIJA=="}
