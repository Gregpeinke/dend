Эта игра потрясла мой придел психики, она заставляет смеятся, напрягаться, рыдать... \n\nНо вскоре вы понимаете, что это всё простая ширма. На самом деле в прекрасном городе царит тоталитарность и буржуазизм. Богатые доминируют над бедными, угнетают и без зазрения совести убивают их. В каких то районах царит настоящая война. А в это время, государь Коллумбии - Пророк - говорит о светлом будущем и призывает всех жителей найти и уничтожить вас. Вам ничего не остаётся, кроме как прокладывать себе дорогу многочисленными трупами и кровавыми лужами, попутно удивляясь \"тёмной\" стороне Колумбии. \n\nНо вы не один. С вами бегает странноватая, но невероятно красивая и умная девушка Элизабет. Сначала она словно маленький ребёнок радует всему, что окружает вас и с оптимизмом смотрит на будущее, но судьба города меняет её. Меняет в тёмную сторону. Эта перемена в буквальном смысле поражает вас и вы не можете поверить, что ранее милая девушка может стать таким же, как и вы - убийцей. \n\nА между тем, события принимают иной оборот. В какой то момент вы словно оказываетесь в другом мире, в другой реальности, где всё протекает иначе, но и там есть опасность. А в конце вы засомневаетесь - а в настоящей ли вселенной вы? Что есть правда, а что есть ложь? Кто вы такой на самом деле, и кто такая Элизабет? Последние минуты игры в буквальном смысле рвут все мыслимые и немыслимые шаблоны.Это необычная игра. Под динамичным экшеном скрывается нечто большее, что есть на самом деле. И это нечто должно поразить вас и не оставить равнодушным. Это уникальное явление в жанре боевик.\nЭто необычная игра.

Игра рассказывает на историю американского сыщика Букера Девитта. Главный герой весь в долгах. Однако ему предлагают сделку: Он приводит им девушку по имени Элизабет, а они прощают долг. Вариантов у главного героя немного, и по этому, он соглашается. Сюжет у игры настолько хорош, что описывать дальнейшие события я не буду, оставляя это на радость самостоятельного изучения.\n Графика и художественное оформление. Стиль у Infinite просто шикарный, художники постарались на славу, а картинка радует глаз даже на средних настройках. Музыка тоже на высоте, за это спасибо Гарри Шайману, который написал замечательный саундтрек. Всё это создаёт неповторимую атмосферу, за которую, лично я и полюбил эту игру.\n Геймплей. Игровой процесс, пожалуй, самая слабая часть Infinite: стрелять просто не интересно, а спец. способности призванные разнообразить игровой процесс, со своей задачей справляются слабо…\n Вот так и получается, что в шутере от первого лица, хорошо всё, кроме перестрелок. И, тем не менее, я посоветую вам эту игру. Ради сюжета, ради стиля, ради атмосферы.

It wasnt until I found myself lacking a great single player experience to be had in the past year or so that I decided to repurchase Bioshock Infinite on Steam and see how it held up. It held up great, but even moreso the gameplay, story, and experience still outshines its peers.\n\n[h1]Here is just a few things that make this game so great[/h1]\n\n     It has an absolutely brilliant story! I cant say enough about how cohesive, thought out, and realized this story is. The thing that sticks out the most to me is that this game has some absolutely insane huge twists, yet your too wrapped up in the whats happening now with your character and Elizabeth that you never see it coming.\n\nGameplay that is unrivaled. Its a first person shooter that executes well, it does this because it doesnt try to be something its not, and knows what type of experience they want you to have. You have one arm that is designated for weapons (Brutally easy to swap) and the other hand is for your vigors (powers)  that you pick up along the way. Using both of these together and often is so seamless. \n\nThe game has light RPG elements only in the sense that you have to choose what weapons and vigors (powers) to upgrade with your hard earned coins you pick up. That suits this style of game lovely, as you dont stay away from the story very long flopping through in menu screens.\n\nGraphics are still really polished and do no injustice to this game what so ever. The whole art style is fantastic. It plays out like a city built in the sky to resemble Heaven and Americana Circa 1940s. The music is beautiful, and accompanies it well.\n\nThe game genre I guess would be Science Fiction FPS/Adventure. The thing that makes it so hard to put this game into this category is that there are some genuinely spooky moments, some genuinely Tony Hawk and now Sunset Overdrive style gameplay flying around on Rails, and genuinely just an amazing adventure game.The Rapture DLC is a real treat for all of those who missed being in Rapture, the story is quite awesome as well. Highly Recomend it.\n\nOk I know Im gushing here, but this game ladies and gents, is quite frankly a very rare gem. It should be had by all. I think of it as the Shawshank Redemption, Michael Jordan Game Six, Eminem the Marshall Mathers LP of video games. \n\n** Note this is my second purchase of this game, and fourth to fifth playthrough.","timestamp_created":1457769829,"timestamp_updated":1457770195,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21782870","author":{"steamid":"76561198201043586","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":649,"last_played":1438385768},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1457765963,"timestamp_updated":1457765963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21781464","author":{"steamid":"76561198135743475","num_games_owned":447,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":394,"last_played":1457169497},"language":"turkish","review":"Kesinlikle mükemmel atmosfer,hikaye,karakterler olsun hepsi cok iyi oynanması gereken bir oyun","timestamp_created":1457759229,"timestamp_updated":1457759229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21776824","author":{"steamid":"76561198073417240","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1457669647},"language":"english","review":"10/10 would cry like a little bitch again","timestamp_created":1457738999,"timestamp_updated":1457738999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21775931","author":{"steamid":"76561198124492426","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1112,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":964,"last_played":1510317905},"language":"english","review":"Very fun game, had to play the ending twice becasue it throws you for a huge twist at the end.","timestamp_created":1457735896,"timestamp_updated":1457735896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21775891","author":{"steamid":"76561198141945425","num_games_owned":348,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":918,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":845,"last_played":1512821193},"language":"russian","review":"Игра,нeсомнeнно стоит того врeмeни,котороe трeбуeтся на ee прохождeниe.Hа протяжeнии всeго развития сюжeта мозг просто взрываeтся .
