Mais ce que je peux dire c'est que l'humour du 1 est de retour.\nEn tout cas, au niveau du gameplay, il s'agit la de la même chose que Portal, mais les niveaux sont plus variés avec des nouveautés comme les gels qui permettent de poser des portails à différents endroits, ou encore de sauter plus haut et de sprinter plus rapidement.\nUn des grands ajouts de Portal 2 par rapport au jeu précédent est bien sur le mode multijoueur (ou coop) qui permet de compléter des niveaux spéciaux avec un ami. Ces niveaux nécessitent donc d'utiliser habillement non pas 2 portails mais bien 4 ce qui rend la tâche plus hardue.\n\nBilan :\n\nPoints Positifs:\n-Gameplay (les quelques changements apportent vraiment de bonnes choses au jeu)\n-L'humour (personnellement j'aime bien l'humour des Portals )\n-L'histoire \n-Le Mode Coop\n\nPoints Négatifs:\n-La Durée de Vie (même s'il elle a largement été revue à la hausse par rapport a Portal, le jeu se finit quand même en moins de 15 heures multi compris)\n-Quelques Bugs (des bugs graphiques par ci par la c'est pas bien méchant)\n","timestamp_created":1457198177,"timestamp_updated":1457198177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21646062","author":{"steamid":"76561198152635264","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":163,"playtime_at_review":1315,"last_played":1659913656},"language":"english","review":"After palying this game, I was hooked for days.
