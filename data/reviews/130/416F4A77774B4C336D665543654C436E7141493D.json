The levels look a little better and feel much more open, which solves one of my biggest problems with HL1's level design, being linearity. And if you enjoyed Surface Tension, I think you will like the chapter that takes place in a trainyard. \n\nHowever, no game is without it's flaws, which Blue Shift has a few. This game is pretty short. I tend to take my time when playing Half Life, but even then this entry took me no longer than 6 hours. (Technically I spent 5 hours on it since I had to go somewhere for an hour and forgot to close the game but whatever.)  And, of course, if a game is short, the bad parts tend to stick out a bit more. That bad part, for me atleast, would definitely be the levels in Xen. \n\nFirst off, I absolutely loved the Xen levels in HL1 for two reasons. 1: Lower gravity and 2: The long jump module. Blue Shift doesn't give you the long jump module. It's very strange to not be able to long jump around in these levels, and is just a real shame as I really liked most of the Xen chapter. But... I guess it might make some platforming sections easier, so somewhat I understand. My last gripe with the Xen levels is the first part. The first part has this really dark and somewhat obnoxious maze full of headcrabs, and although it isn't too bad, if you are playing this game for the first time and don't know what you're doing or where to go it will certainly annoy you. \n\nBut, besides that, I really liked this expansion. And although it doesn't add any new weapons or enemies, I can look past that since I really liked the levels. So, check this one out if you haven't already. I think you will enjoy it.","timestamp_created":1604259693,"timestamp_updated":1604259693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78545960","author":{"steamid":"76561199013935048","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1604252798},"language":"english","review":"great game, i must say, if you are receiving cursor mouse issues, go to settings, Open the Mouse Options, Enable \"Mouse Filter\" and \"Raw mouse input\", And then quit the game.","timestamp_created":1604257567,"timestamp_updated":1604257567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78538816","author":{"steamid":"76561198335367163","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1604250345},"language":"brazilian","review":"Os fãs dizem que essa DLC não é tão boa... eu sinceramente adorei!","timestamp_created":1604250375,"timestamp_updated":1604250375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78538267","author":{"steamid":"76561198397888125","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189,"last_played":1612621373},"language":"hungarian","review":"nagyon jó jobb mint a sima half life a black mesara hasonlít a ff miatt és a rombolhatóság miatt","timestamp_created":1604249830,"timestamp_updated":1604249830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78527027","author":{"steamid":"76561198325233743","num_games_owned":335,"num_reviews":118,"playtime_forever":159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1604237746},"language":"french","review":"Bonjour à tous, aujourd’hui on se retrouve pour la review de [u][b]Half Life Blue Shift[/b][/u]\n\n[h1]C’est quoi Half Life Blue Shift ?[/h1]\nHalf Life Blue Shift est un jeu de type FPS science-fiction en solo sorti en 2001, développé par Gearbox et édité par Valve.

Life Blue Shift is an expansion pack for the original Half Life you are Calhoun a security personel that was working in Black Mesa when the experiment with the weird crystal and shit happened and while Gordon tries to do his thing which is save the fucking world you try to get the fuck out of Black Mesa with a few scientists\n\n+the game isnt very long which is great the original Half Life was REALLY long and in the original only the first few chapters were actually fun the rest was really boring in here the game isnt very long and each chapter is kinda fun\n+in the original Half Life the only thing that the scientists did was open some doors,give you some stuff and thats about it but in here there is none of that there is however 1 scientist that helps you through the final parts of the game and its really fun i thought escorting him,keeping him safe and everything would be really boring but i was mistaken he has his own character model,his own name,his own voice and its just fun to have an actual scientist with us someone that we havent seen or heard before\n+you can actually see Gordon Freeman in the beginning of the game and towards the end of the game which i thought was super cool\n+this time Xen is actually fun in the original Half Life Xen was cool at first but quickly got boring,disgusting and confusing you got lost,i encountered a few bugs,i didnt know what was a wall and what was a ceiling in the original Xen just wasnt really fun even though it looked super cool being in Xen wasnt that good but in here Xen still looks cool it still looks interesting and this time finding your way is easier,i didnt encounter any bugs,those awful looking rooms with weird walls and shit those rooms didnt appear this time Xen was generally more fun to be in\n\n-the game has a weird...bug ? idk what to call it when you die if you press M1 to restart your gun will just start firing all of a sudden if you are going to restart you MUST use your keyboard if you use your mouse youll just waste ammo when you respawn yeah i know it makes no fucking sense and apperantly there is no way to fix it\n-you dont have some of the cooler weapons that the original Half Life had you just have some basic stuff i guess it makes sense that we dont get some of the cooler stuff Gordon got in the original but at the same time those things were cool i wanted to use those cool weapons that the original Half Life had and i didnt get to use em which sucks\n-no big,cool,scary creatures this time in the original Half Life you had the green long snake like creature that couldnt see and you had the weird bug like thing that could use his hands as a flamethrower and shit we dont have them here we just get the simple monsters\n\nin general this expansion pack is fun its not too long and its not too short either it has some problems but they are not a deal-breaker in any way and in a discount this expansion pack is really cheap if you have some extra money lying around then you might wanna get this game its fun id recommend

It's [i] fine, [/i]but not much more. It fails where Half-Life doesn't. Half-Life is old, but it feels well designed and presents itself in a clear way. You always know what to do and where to go without being directly told. Blue Shift doesn't manage this, like many of the lesser games of the era, there were moments where I had no idea what to do and was left boringly searching for minutes at a time. In the end I had missed a ladder hidden in a dark corner, or hadn't found the 'new' thing to do that wasn't explained or hinted at. There were four or five times where this happened, and in a game that I beat in under three hours, that's too often.\n\nThe characters are annoying, and the level design feels both more confusing than the original and more boring simultaneously. The game play doesn't add much over the original either, so there really isn't much point in playing except to play them all. Opposing Force is [i] miles [/i] better than this, go play that.
