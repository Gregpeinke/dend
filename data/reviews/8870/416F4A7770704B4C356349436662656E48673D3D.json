And how thin is the line that separates scuh utopia from a dystopia? America, 1912, while Europe sees itself at the brink of a Total war, the United States of America sees its power rising beyond all the expectatives from the Old World. The future is bright, and the choosen people is close to receive from God what is rightfully theirs. Columbia is the apex symbol of this new world. A city floating high among the clouds, near God himself, free of all the sins that wreck havock upon the Sodoma below. \nBut, as well as the USA, upon how many lies, deaths and slaves was Columbia built? Behind the paradise, what kind of hell lies hidden? Much more than a shooter, a \"save the princess\" and an adventure, Bioshock Infinite is a historical reflection upon the pilars that sustains the modern day US of A.\nYou're Booker DeWitt, former US soldier and a Pinkerton agent. Indebted to the wrong people, you receive a simple yet strange bargain: \"Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt\". Who is this girl, the beautifull and lonely princess locked in a tower in the city of Columbia, whose powers can open gaps among worlds? Doesn't really matter, provide she is free by the end of the day. But, at certain point of the game, you will start asking yourself: \"Am I really free?\" \"What is the point of granting physical freedom for her, when our whole lifes are a cage?\" \"I'm rather be free as a bird, or have the safety of a cage?\".\nLike an equation, Bioshock Infinite works with constans and variables, and it's up to you to find what is what and who is who inside the vicious world of Columbia.","timestamp_created":1386423505,"timestamp_updated":1386449221,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7952723","author":{"steamid":"76561197982686325","num_games_owned":452,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1514,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1102,"last_played":1414447272},"language":"english","review":"Dear Infinity Ward, please make a decent FPS like this","timestamp_created":1386422011,"timestamp_updated":1386422011,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7952717","author":{"steamid":"76561198051758663","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1166,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1166,"last_played":1387061137},"language":"russian","review":"Не плохая игра, с хорошой атмосферой...","timestamp_created":1386421987,"timestamp_updated":1386421987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7952458","author":{"steamid":"76561198095953030","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1252,"last_played":1449170854},"language":"english","review":"Just EPIC!

The game has an amazing story, which some can say that it is not as good as the first one, but it is still a blowing-mind story with strong (and sometimes funny) characters and rich details. The game art direction is incredible with beautiful incredible design in each part of the game, the characters, the buildings, the enemies, everything. The gameplay is incredible, and it is hard to be described. The tears, the vigour, the skyline, everything gives the player a really pleasant and different experience on action FPS.

Now that quickly changes and the situation turns sour. The combat takes it's cue from BioShock and BioShock 2 to reintroduce Plasmids and eve as Vigors and salts, now there are allot of variety in Vigors but are just a clear cut copy of Plasmids and you might be only sticking to one or two Vigors because the rest will probably seem under-powered. A two gun limit is one of the worst things in BioShock Infinite because you'll be trying out a weapon for about 5 seconds and then realize that it is very alike to your previous gun, depending on your play style you'll be sticking to two weapons for the whole game, if you can help it (my favorite are the shotgun and the hand cannon). The game is amazing but I completed it in about 8 hours and I was craving for more, I had mixed feelings about the ending for obvious reasons. But the best things for me are Elizabeth and her chemistry with Booker, she would throw Booker money, health or ammo when he needs it and can provide things like hookshots, turrets, and ammo stations. Another great thing is the skyhook, you can fly around the city on rails reminiscent of Ratchet and Clank but multiplied by 10, trust me you'll know when you try it. *Disclaimer a light spoiler ahead, if you don't want the fucking badass of the game revealed to you then read the message in caps to get a basic message of what it's about then skip to the location with the * beside them* BADASS SONGBIRD IS A FUCKING BADASS, YOU DO NOT FUCK WITH SONGBIRD, SONGBIRD FUCKS YOU. Songbird is a gigantic robotic bird that was Elizabeth's caretaker (bringing her food and drink and books to read) but also not allowing her to leave, and trust me you cannot fight the bird in the game which is disappointing for me, I wished we could have fought it when it is first revealed and it purposely kicking your ass so you know not to fuck with it, *MASSIVE SPOILER AHEAD* when it dies you respect it for caring for Elizabeth and knowing that a badass has fallen, but it loses points for it being under the control of Comstock the whole time which put's it's love and protectiveness for Elizabeth into question *SPOILERS END* The multiple twists are explained nicely and the amount of backstory in the form of voxophones is typical for a BioShock game.\n\n\nOverall the game is so close to being a masterpiece but it falls just short, but it is still a truly amazing game that YOU need to buy it, I give it a 9/10.","timestamp_created":1386403159,"timestamp_updated":1386403159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471491217613220215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7949685","author":{"steamid":"76561198062158077","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":317,"last_played":1401981541},"language":"english","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1386402794,"timestamp_updated":1428169533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7949562","author":{"steamid":"76561198035034062","num_games_owned":426,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":613,"last_played":1634322057},"language":"russian","review":"Интересно, немного другой сюжет в отличие от первых частей, но переигрывает их вчистую :)\n\nКонцовка супер!!!","timestamp_created":1386401877,"timestamp_updated":1511460188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7949548","author":{"steamid":"76561198043472317","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":829,"last_played":1386006372},"language":"english","review":"Great revolutionary FPS with an incredible story.

Still, this game is worthwhile to experience if only for the story.","timestamp_created":1386373278,"timestamp_updated":1386373278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487238973379135132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7945373","author":{"steamid":"76561198053470112","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3226,"last_played":1584813417},"language":"german","review":"top","timestamp_created":1386372942,"timestamp_updated":1386372942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7945350","author":{"steamid":"76561197976599918","num_games_owned":418,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1086,"last_played":1386584629},"language":"english","review":"Fanatic graphics and story.

Also i'm still looking forward to trying the DLC that takes us back to Rupture to revisit the original game environment.
