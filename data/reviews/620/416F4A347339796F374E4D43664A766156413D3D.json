Проходить уровни одно удовольствие, начиная от простых и заканчивая сложными. Проходя по сюжетной линии попадаешь из привычных лабораторных помещений в старую часть комплекса, где можно увидеть своими глазами историю становления лаборатории, узнать основателей.\n\nПомимо порталов в игре добавлены различные виды \"гелей\", которые придают разнообразия уровням и делаю прохождение более интересным. Что касается самих уровней, то они стали на порядок сложнее, чем в первой части. Здесь действительно приходится включать голову и искать решение, которое не всегда оказывается \"на повернохности\".\n\nОсобенно порадовал ИИ, который ведёт себя как живой человек. Создается впечатление, что это не просто компьютер управляющий комплексом, а нечто большее. Диалоги в игре сделаны на отлично с хорошим юмором. Музыкальное сопровождение тоже очень порадовало. Музыка подобрана в тему игры и ни сколько не мешает прохожденю.\n\nВ целом игра заслуживает 10 из 10! Сколько бы раз я её не проходил вдоль и поперёк, она попрежнему интересна!","timestamp_created":1460086288,"timestamp_updated":1462299408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608060359954833984","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22294229","author":{"steamid":"76561198219243763","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":952,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":757,"last_played":1598080204},"language":"english","review":"One of the pivotal games of recent development.","timestamp_created":1460082231,"timestamp_updated":1460082231,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22292478","author":{"steamid":"76561198155171757","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":322,"last_played":1499389789},"language":"english","review":"20fps never looked so good :D","timestamp_created":1460071118,"timestamp_updated":1460071118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518507480621338","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22292159","author":{"steamid":"76561198135318390","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":459,"last_played":1455545429},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1460069172,"timestamp_updated":1460069172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22290568","author":{"steamid":"76561198276580608","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1510624203},"language":"english","review":"portal is longer now!\n\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1460061222,"timestamp_updated":1460061222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22289651","author":{"steamid":"76561198132113742","num_games_owned":286,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":5659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3289,"last_played":1642859453},"language":"english","review":"One of the most fun, puzzling games ive ever played.\ni played this for the first time in like 2012 or smth and i still enjoy playing it sometimes but i dont play it much anyomore","timestamp_created":1460057307,"timestamp_updated":1465996891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22289000","author":{"steamid":"76561198197306274","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1641,"last_played":1647180233},"language":"russian","review":"I love Portal","timestamp_created":1460054647,"timestamp_updated":1460054647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22288547","author":{"steamid":"76561198258715401","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":882,"last_played":1472808158},"language":"english","review":"I bought this game for multiplayer, ended up loving its story. \n\nThe storyline starts pretty boring, you really gotta puzzle your way through the first couple chapters.

En effet, ce jeu est beaucoup plus riche et long que le premier Portal, ce qui est dû au fait que le premier a eu un succès non négligeable.\nL'histoire est très bien construite, et immersive, ce qui fait qu'on suit la narration sans jamais décrocher, ce qui est un argument de poids.\nLe gameplay est similaire au premier, si ce n'est que des éléments ont été ajoutés (les gels, etc...), tout en retrouvant tous les éléments du premier.\nLa difficulté n'est pas croissante comme on pourrait le penser, car il y a des retournements de situations imprévus dans le déroulement de l'histoire, qui sont amusants, ainsi que des détails futiles (comme les pièges, et autres choses) qui immergent encore plus le joueur et le surprennent souvent.\nEt bien sûr, l'argument qui convaincra le plus le joueur est l'arrivée du mode co-op, qui était malheureusement absent dans le premier, qui permettra de passer d'excellents moments (délires, casses-têtes et énervements) avec différents partenaires (amis comme inconnus).\n\nEn conclusion, achetez-le les yeux fermés si vous voulez un très bon moment, la durée de vie étant assez conséquente !\n\nPS = J'ai fait des screenshots tout au long de ma progression si jamais vous voulez jeter un coup d'oeil !

The closest thing I have to a friend at this moment is a potato – a potato who hates me. My goal: use a gun to climb through four kilometers of earth. \n Chell’s ascension through the disused facilities in the game’s second act serves as a geological journey through the strata of by-gone Aperture. In geology, when you look through rock you are looking back in time; the closer to the surface, the more recent the history. The history in these rocks is the history of a man and his company. Act Two (Chapter 6) also introduces Cave Johnson, Aperture’s founder and CEO, and the most prominent member of the Portal 2 cast not personally encountered by the player. As the player climbs upward through time, they witness the development of Cave’s character. And, as his character evolves, the facility evolves with him.\nObviously, there is extensive narration from Cave to be listened to, but, at the same time, there is also (perhaps more effective) visual story-telling at work. The top layers adopt a dreary color palette built from lighter and darker shades of gray, meant to reflect the older, exhausted Cave who is slowly being drained by illness of all his previous vigor. A more interesting observation than the color palette, however, is how the facility is restructured over time. \nChell’s detour through Aperture’s past encompasses three decades (60s through 80s). For the first two decades, the space is comprised majorly of retro-styled versions of the “test chambers” the player is quite familiar with from the above-ground complex. But, as Chell climbs into the strata of the 1980s the test chambers seem to vanish. Cave’s messages confirm that Aperture remains dedicated to testing, and so it follows that these chambers must still exist somewhere, but, wherever they may be the player is no longer being led through them.
