Look below as I suck the game off for 4-5 paragraphs.  \n\nPlayed using the mod MMod, a mod that adds visual and sound tweaks to fix minor issues I had.\n\nWith the news of Valve's desire to return to the Half-Life series after the highly successful release of Half-Life: Alyx, I recently took it upon myself to play through Black Mesa and Half-Life 2 and its Episodes. Out of these experiences, Episode 2 stood out to me as the highlight of my time with the Half-Life 2 Trilogy.  Despite being a great game, HL2 is bogged down with certain scenes that overstay their welcome, a questionable latter portion, and some admittedly terrible musical timing. Episode 2 brings with it none of these issues, and shows that it's learned from the mistakes of its predecessor to become an experience that rivals my favorite game, Black Mesa. \n\nGunfights are expertly placed, knowing exactly how long to go on before a change. Your journey to White Forest with Alyx across large open plains is engaging, keeping me so enthralled I sat through the entire game in one sitting.\n\nValve became very good at Half-Life's unbroken way of telling a story at this time, several plot threads are clarified but not resolved in a super awesome way. The new enemy, Hunters, are developed in an awesome way; going from these murderous, insurmountable terrors, to a large threatening obstacle, to mowing through hordes of them with no change other than the player's own knowledge and skill. Unlike Half-Life 2's awesome but poorly placed music, Episode 2 delivers heart pumping tracks placed at times where they actually fit, causing you to being playing with reckless abandon along with the music.\n\nMiscellaneous thoughts that don't fit an overall narrative about the game:\n- I like the opening mines chapters but I get why some people wouldn't. They're so detached from the way the rest of the game feels but I like how they show some more about life on Xen between the Vortigaunts and the Antlions. \n- I think the pistol, shotgun, and SMG sound and feel like garbage, but this is a complaint carried over from the main game. MMod fixes this issue for me.\n- The final battle is very divisive on whether it's good or not among the fanbase, but personally it was probably one of the best parts of the game for me. \n- About the story: For those who know about Epistle 3, it's my opinion that as a followup to this game ending it's a piece of complete dog shit. It's a spit in the face to everything these 3 games built up, and if it really is a draft of what episode 3 could have been I'm completely unsurprised that no one at Valve had any desire to work on  or make it.   \n\nHalf Life 2: Episode Two caught the love I have for Half Life 1 and Black Mesa, a stunning achievement considering my bittersweet thoughts of the main game.","timestamp_created":1595872286,"timestamp_updated":1595872286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73368221","author":{"steamid":"76561198273205897","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":392,"last_played":1595871349},"language":"english","review":"like","timestamp_created":1595871363,"timestamp_updated":1595871363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73367382","author":{"steamid":"76561198086426767","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":408,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":408,"last_played":1563479956},"language":"turkish","review":"HL3 mü? \nO da ne ola ki?","timestamp_created":1595869973,"timestamp_updated":1595869973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73365678","author":{"steamid":"76561198050002598","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1595904282},"language":"english","review":"Excellent game - Hopefully we get Ep3 soon.","timestamp_created":1595867355,"timestamp_updated":1595867355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73355154","author":{"steamid":"76561198928779318","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":185,"last_played":1595942779},"language":"russian","review":"крутая\n игра \n","timestamp_created":1595851157,"timestamp_updated":1595851157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73355022","author":{"steamid":"76561198892472577","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":651,"last_played":1575472309},"language":"english","review":"ysdfcgxcbn","timestamp_created":1595850945,"timestamp_updated":1595850945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73353173","author":{"steamid":"76561198044728158","num_games_owned":412,"num_reviews":143,"playtime_forever":319,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":319,"last_played":1595847708},"language":"russian","review":"Классика, которую я буду перепроходить ещё много раз.

2: Episode Two is the second and last expansion to Half-Life 2, released in 2007 and awaiting a true sequel since then.\n\nTo me, Episode Two does a lot of things better than Episode One. While the moment-to-moment gameplay wasn't bad in Episode One (except for the beginning and climax) and may have even been an improvement over the main game in some ways, it lacked the unique setpieces and story that made the main game stand out so much, essentially retreating old ground for most of the episode.\n\nEpisode Two fares better in that regard, taking you out of City 17 into White Forest, and while that environment still stretches through the entirety of Episode Two, it's a breath of fresh air after being in City 17 and the Citadel for some 8 hours or so. That being said, the episode still has a bunch of interesting setpieces that keep White Forest from becoming monotonous, like the mine, the rocket silo, some of the roadside setpieces, etc..\n\nStory-wise Episode Two also really starts to pick up again after Episode One was relatively stale, even starting to delve into the grander Half-Life storyline like the role of the G-Man, rather than just the short-term goals of the human resistance.\n\nAll in all, I was quite pleased with this entry of the Half-Life series. While I was unsure about Episode One, I can whole-heartedly recommend people play Episode Two after finishing Half-Life 2!\n\n9/10 - Great addition to the series.","timestamp_created":1595599834,"timestamp_updated":1595599834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73201758","author":{"steamid":"76561198410261024","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":362,"last_played":1606902468},"language":"turkish","review":"Her yıl en az 1 kere bitirdiğim, asla eskimeyen, harika bir oyun.","timestamp_created":1595583891,"timestamp_updated":1595583891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73196862","author":{"steamid":"76561198184526530","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":836,"last_played":1595573838},"language":"english","review":"Probably the weakest out of the three HL2 games, but still worth a play for the story conclusion and the couple of enjoyable chapters\n\nFinal mission was poorly designed with it's - what I assume was intended to be - trial and error gameplay ending up feeling more like banging your head against a wall with its sheer randomness and storms of bullets.
