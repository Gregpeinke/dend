The sense of mystery and awe when one sees Columbia for the first time is probably one of gaming’s best moments. But in what may seem like a grand exercise in ludonarrative dissonance, the charm of the first hour is quickly lost amidst the endless busywork of combat and the scrounging in trash cans, “provision” boxes, dead bodies, drawers and closets for ammo, health, salts, audio logs and money. \n\nI would not call the gunplay amazing, but the combat is polished and sometimes novel when you do the disorienting skyline thing and rapidly move about the level to get the drop on enemies.\n\nYou know those satisfying little game sounds that play when you pick up things, land headshots, and kill enemies? Bioshock Infinite has the most annoying of these types of game sounds in my opinion. The vending machines and the noisy blurbs they shout, the sound of picking up money, the sound of health restoring, and various other sounds are very distracting and annoying. To top it all off, very loud music plays during combat which does work in some situations, but it is just all very very loud! I hate it!\n\nThe environments/levels are each technically unique, but I could never shake off that feeling of samey-ness as though all of them were built using the same assets. I soon felt visually tired and saturated with the candy-coloured levels. 60% of the way through the game, I just wanted to get to the ending soon!\n\nThe best thing about Bioshock Infinite is its themes, story and the infinite imagination on display. But my gripe is that most of that is lost in the drudgery of getting through the game itself. I cannot shake off the feeling that it is a game of two parts – one incredible, one dull – two extremes cobbled together by a brilliant but pretentious author.\n\nBut the ending… Somehow, the poignant ending makes it all worth it, I guess. The story of the DLCs adds a little cherry on top. The story would lose all its gravitas if it wasn't for the wonderful music. The scores that play during the story beats are some of the best in a videogame.\n\n[b]Time to Beat:[/b] 18 Hours including the DLC.\n\n[b]Overall Rating:[/b] You will probably like it.

Bioshock Infinite é fantástico. É envolvente. É encantador e genial. É uma verdadeira obra de arte que se tornou um dos jogos que eu mais amo na vida. [/h1]\n\nComecei o jogo sem pretensão nenhuma e fui pego totalmente de surpresa. O enredo é complexo, muito bem trabalhado e o que mais me agrada é que ele não subestima quem tá jogando dando informações demais. As revelações da trama são emocionantes e nos são dadas no momento certo da história. A arte desse jogo é linda e envelheceu muito bem considerando o seu lançamento a oito anos atrás, eu amo cada cenário que eu vi enquanto jogava, é tudo muito bem construído e eu me senti totalmente imerso diversas vezes. \n\nA trilha sonora merece destaque também, pois ela é singela aqui, no bom sentido é claro, as composições não destoam das cenas e sim complementam muito do que a gente tá vendo ali e vale mencionar a surpresa que eu tive com algumas músicas de épocas diferentes tocando nas [spoiler]fendas espaço-temporais[/spoiler], acho que essa foi uma das coisas que me conquistaram ainda mais. Os personagens do game são extremamente carismáticos, é difícil não simpatizar com o protagonista [b]Booker[/b] e é impossível não sair dessa experiência apaixonado pela [b]Elizabeth[/b]. \n\n[b]Elizabeth[/b] é linda, simpática e é totalmente determinada, no início você pode achar que ela será um fardo como em outros jogos em que você precisa “escoltar” certa pessoa, mas isso não acontece aqui, ela é muito independente, não há necessidade de se preocupar com ela e arrisco dizer que muitos vão se sentir dependentes dela durante a campanha. \n\nA jogabilidade pareceu um pouco confusa no início, mas esse foi um problema mais meu do que do jogo em si, após mudar os controles e fazer alguns ajustes me senti muito mais confortável com o que eu estava fazendo. Para concluir, ainda não tive a oportunidade de jogar as dlcs ou os jogos anteriores, mas depois da experiência que eu tive com esse jogo será um prazer enorme saber mais sobre essa história e as demais da franquia. ;)","timestamp_created":1619100585,"timestamp_updated":1637973457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90724670","author":{"steamid":"76561198876550797","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":424,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":424,"last_played":1613589876},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo incrível.","timestamp_created":1619091031,"timestamp_updated":1619091031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90721269","author":{"steamid":"76561198931129919","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":301,"last_played":1620828499},"language":"turkish","review":"İnanılmaz hikaye.","timestamp_created":1619084830,"timestamp_updated":1619084830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90719907","author":{"steamid":"76561199038463133","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":740,"last_played":1619079815},"language":"english","review":"TWIST AT THE END","timestamp_created":1619082234,"timestamp_updated":1619082234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90717383","author":{"steamid":"76561198982199347","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1652503602},"language":"english","review":"Great game","timestamp_created":1619077015,"timestamp_updated":1619077015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90715411","author":{"steamid":"76561198197428462","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1023,"last_played":1620240984},"language":"english","review":"Amazing Game!

I thought the gameplay was just okay but I thought the story was interesting if not a bit pretentious. Fast forward now, about 7 years later and Bioshock Infinite has come under a decent amount of scrutiny, especially with it's plot. I have been in the mood for an atmospheric FPS so I thought what the hell, I'll give it a shot. And well, after playing it I have a lot to say.\n\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\n\nThe best part about this game is it’s visuals and overall atmosphere. The game is absolutely gorgeous and every important set piece is increased so much more by the amazing lighting and background design. It may be a little dated technically but the strong art direction has conquered the test of time and the development team should be proud of the environments they have crafted.\n\n[h1] The Meh [/h1]\n\nThe controls and gameplay were something that was alright. Shooting people is pretty fun and the act of popping off multiple headshots in a row can be very satisfying. The gun variety is nice even if I found myself only using the same two weapons for most of the game. I found that the vigors were a little underwhelming compared to Bioshock's plasmids. I really only used the shock one and it doesn't do any damage without the assistance of a gun.\n \nThe story was something that when going into this game I was prepared to put into the bad section. I'm a man who hates convoluted stories. Kingdom Hearts 2 and 3 might be two of my least favorite games because of this. While the story here is definitely still pretentious and purposefully confusing, I find that it somehow works here. For one the game actually has a conclusion unlike the previously mentioned Nobunga abominations that require 15 different side stories and a handful of youtube videos to make any kind of sense. The drive for most of the game is pretty clear and motivating enough. It isn't until the end when things get a little over the top but I don't think there is anyone out there that could make a story involving time traveling AND dimension hopping without it being a bit of a mess. Overall, it is inoffensive and the ending is satisfying and just confusing enough to keep you thinking even after the credits are over.\n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\n\nI have a few nitpicks with the game that are mostly just a product of its time. Mostly dumb immersion breaking stuff like having a giant arrow burst from your ass to show you the right way to go, and a bunch of moments where you have to \"press e to comfort Elizabeth\". But I have one main complaint that honestly brings the whole game down. And that complaint is with the level design and variety. As mentioned before the environments are beautiful but all you ever do in those environments is sit behind cover and shoot people. There is absolutely ZERO gameplay variety and it gets old real fast. All you ever do is walk somewhere, talk to Elizabeth, and proceed to the next conveniently designed combat arena. Sometimes you go from arena to arena 4 or 5 times without getting any breaks for dialogue. And the gunplay is fine, but this isn't DOOM we are talking here. There are a total of like 5 enemy types that all go down the same way, shooting them in the head (or gears). Once you get to the later half these enemies become total bullet sponges and if you play on a harder difficulty, death is constant and inevitable. I think the team realized how easy it was to die and how awful it would be to have to constantly reload these dull fights so they just made it so there is no punishment for death besides losing a little bit of cash. There is only one real \"boss\" in this game and it is just a gauntlet of mooks coming at you while you try and snipe a ghost. The last area is also a horrible omega gauntlet with a tower defense mechanic that I could only clear on hard mode by cheesing it with the use of the reflection vigor traps. \n\nThis game is an absolute slog to play through because of the anemic variety and it brings down what would be a decent game with an interesting story to one that I don't think I would recommend.","timestamp_created":1619032596,"timestamp_updated":1620342540,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90695063","author":{"steamid":"76561198319464012","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1940,"last_played":1616292564},"language":"schinese","review":"二周目重温剧情，玩到海葬，故事太虐不敢继续下去","timestamp_created":1619032182,"timestamp_updated":1619032182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90695021","author":{"steamid":"76561198796467362","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3033,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2962,"last_played":1631747961},"language":"english","review":"i am attracted to the male main character","timestamp_created":1619032118,"timestamp_updated":1619032118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90687445","author":{"steamid":"76561198260914482","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1027,"last_played":1635400541},"language":"english","review":"Pretty good","timestamp_created":1619021841,"timestamp_updated":1619021841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90686850","author":{"steamid":"76561198007555538","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1283,"last_played":1619020875},"language":"english","review":"superb graphics, unusual setting (Edwardian but within a multiverse).

Los FPS no son mi estilo, y aunque me sentí atraído por la estética y las cosas que escuché sobre la historia no fue hasta la tercera intentona que me lo he terminado de pasar.\n\nComo comentaba, los FPS no son los juegos con los que más disfruto, pero este consigue atraparte con su gran historia. Hay muchos disparos pero también hay mucho tiempo para el desarrollo de la historia, investigar el escenario y poder disfrutar dandole vueltas. Los gráficos son brillantes y el apartado artístico es genial, muy colorista y lleno de fantasía. Es sensacional esa ambientación tecno-vintage americana de principios de siglo y aunque sea un universo muy colorista la realidad es que se trata de una distopía que transcurre en la ciudad flotante de Columbia, sustentada en un regimen teocrático, capitalista y con conceptos cercanos al nazismo, superioridad racial etc.\n\nLa historia como suele ser habitual en muchas otras, comienza de una forma amnésica, por lo que no sabremos ni quienes somo ni que está ocurriendo a medida que avanza la historia y vamos conociendo datos sobre la trama y los audios que vamos encontrando. Todo comienza de una forma un tanto confusa y la historia tendrá varios giros sensacionales así que no conviene destripar mucho. Si es cierto que se trata de una historia compleja... posiblemente en una primera partida será muy habitual quedarse con ciertas lagunas por lo que puede ser recomendable una segunda vuelta. Muy importante destacar que no será necesario haber disfrutado de las anteriores entregas.\n\nEl final... sencillamente espectacular, no recuerdo muchos juegos con finales tan de película. Se trata de una producción muy cinematográfica.\n\nEn cuanto a la jugabilidad sin ser alguien muy experimentado en este genero, la considero bastante buena, todo sucede de forma muy fluida, no es excesivamente compleja y para alguien como yo, sin mucha experiencia en este genero es plenamente asumible. \n\nSe trata de un juego al que no se le pueden poner muchos peros, gran historia, personajes carismáticos, gran apartado gráfico y artístico, muy buena BSO... Como única pega, diría que el juego obliga o te hace sentir obligado  a la revisión exhaustiva del escenario y a veces esto llega a cansar un poco rompiendo sin que sea nada dramático el ritmo... las misiones secundarias son completamente prescindibles y de hecho lo normal será omitirlas.\n\nResumiendo. Merece lo que vale, un juego imprescindible incluso si no eres aficionado al genero. \n\n\n","timestamp_created":1619003367,"timestamp_updated":1619003367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90672772","author":{"steamid":"76561198849783478","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":999,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":928,"last_played":1619963195},"language":"finnish","review":"Erittäin hyvä peli.

갓겜 [/h1]\n[게임역사상 가장 매력적인 ai, 전투와 연출, ost, 스토리텔링의 완벽한 조화를 보여준 갓겜]\n\n2013년은 게임에 있어서 굉장한 한해였습니다. \n최다고티 1위 라오어, 2위 GTA5, 3위 바이오쇼크 인피니트\n갓겜하면 꼭 손꼽히는 3개의 게임이 나온 한해였습니다. \n \n라오어는 게임의 연출, 몰입도를 한차원 끌어올린 게임이었고\nGTA5는 최신 오픈월드 게임들 전부를 오징어로 만들어버리고, 2021년까지도 현역에 1억부이상 판매된 엄청난 게임이죠\n바이오쇼크 인피니트 또한 맛깔난 전투와 엄청난 연출, 몰입도 높은 스토리에 역대급의 보조ai를 보여준 레전드 게임입니다. \n\n이전세대 게임 까지는 2021년 기준으로 플레이해보면 어색한 원근감과 뻣뻣한 모션, 부족한 텍스처로 몰입감이 조금 떨어지는 느낌인데, 위 3개의 게임들은 2021년도 기준으로도 눈이 호강하고, 사운드의 정위감이나 방향등이 아주 잘잡혀있어 이질감이 없이 플레이할 수 있습니다. \n바이오쇼크 1,2까지는 으스스한 분위기의 랩처를 매우 잘 묘사하긴 했지만 뭔가 어색한 공간의 원근감, 어색한 모션, 사운드의 위상이 직관적이지 않아 이질감을 떨칠 수 없었습니다. 텍스처도 부족하지는 않은데 뭔가 설명하기 힘든 이질감이 있었죠. \n\n 하지만 바이오쇼크 인피니트는 그 모든것을 극복해냈습니다. 지금 기준으로도 처음 보면 입이 떡벌어지며 한참 구경하게 되는 콜럼비아의 장관에 한동안 넋을 놓고 구경했네요.\n바이오쇼크1/2를 매우 재미있게 플레이했기에, 인피니트에서 조작감과 일부 사운드가 전작과 \n 비슷하기에 익숙한 느낌을 주어서 더욱 좋았습니다. \n \n*뛰어난 동료 AI\n: 많은 게임들에서 펫이나 npc 동료가 있지만, 엘리자베스만큼 매력적인 케릭터를 본적이 없습니다. 전형적인 서양형 미인의 얼굴은 아니지만, 평범한듯 예쁜 얼굴에, 다양한 표정, 장소나 행동에 따른 다양한 상호작용, 몰입감을 높여주는 성우의 연기, 모션 캡처를 통한 자연스런 모션, 전투에 직접적으로 도움을 주는 다양한 능력덕에 엘리자베스를 중심으로 펼쳐지는 본편과  dlc 2편의 이야기에 몰입되고 가슴이 먹먹해질 수 밖에 없었습니다. 마치 실제 인물에게 감정이입을 하는 듯한 느낌마저 받았습니다. 2013년 작품이지만 엘리자베스만큼 매력적인 케릭터가 게임에서 또 나올 수 있을까 하는 생각마저 드네요.\n\n*명장면 \n: 게임 플레이 중간에 만날수 있는 창고에서 우연히 본 기타가 있는데, 상호작용시 부커가 기타를 치며, 엘리자베스가 노래를 부릅니다. 오프닝때의 그곡... 실제로 있는 Will the circle be unbroken 이며, 해당 장소에선 어쿠스틱 기타와 엘리자베스의 목소리만으로 영화의 한장면을 보는 듯한 감동을 줍니다. 오프닝에선 합창버전으로 들려줍니다. \n 바숔 인피니트처럼 배드엔딩을 만든다면, 라오어2도 그렇게 게이머들의 혹평을 받지는 않았을것 같다는 생각이 듭니다. 배드엔딩이면서도 개발자들이 게이머들이 느끼기에  케릭터를 얼마나 소중히 만들었고, 아끼는지를 느끼게하는 방법을 바숔 개발진들은 아는것 같다고 느꼈습니다. \n\n*아쉬운점\n: 플레이하면서 느낀 아쉬운 점은 스카이 라인이나 후크에 매달리면서 시점이 심각하게 흔들리고, 잠시동안 마우스로 시점이동이 제대로 안되서 빠릿한 컨트롤이 힘듭니다. 바이오쇼크1,2 에서 빅대디가 주변에서 걸어다니면 시점이 흔들리는 효과가 적당했는데, 핸디맨의 걸음에 따른 화면 흔들린은 너무 심해서 핸디맨이 근처에 오면 에이밍도 쉽지 않고, 멀미마저 날 지경이네요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ \n\n\n*엔딩후 추가 \n: 부커 드윗이 처음으로 콜럼비아에 도착하며 보게되는 광경과 OST는 정말 아름다움 그 자체입니다. 멍하니 구석구석을 둘러보게될 정도로 게임역사상 가장 아름다운 인트로라고 생각합니다. 혼자만의 감상이 아니라, 유튜브에도 오프닝 부분영상에 달린 수많은 찬사들이 있습니다. \n초반부에는 콜럼비아의 풍경을 감상하느라 정신없다가, 중반부에는 다양한 무기와 기술로 전투에 푹빠졌습니다. 그러다 후반부에는 지금까지 쌓아온 스토리의 절정부를 보여주며, 엔딩파트는 정말 숨참고 봤습니다. 충격적이면서 슬픈이야기였네요... 솔직히 전투와 스토리 밸런스를 잘 갖춘 게임중에 원탑이라고 생각이 듭니다. \n 개인적으로 바이오쇼크1,2를 너무 재미있게 해서 마지막에 나온 랩처는 너무도 반가웠습니다. 혹, 3편을 연달아  하기 부담스러운 분은 1,2안해도 인피니트 이해하는데 전혀 지장없으니 그냥하셔도 됩니다. 하지만 어벤져스 엔드게임 마냥 1,2에서 쌓아온 스토리들이 연계되며 주는 감동은 말로 형언할 수가 없었습니다.\n\n바이오쇼크 4가 개발중이라는데, 꼭 랩처배경으로 나와서 랩처 특유의 느낌을 잘 살려주면 좋겠습니다.","timestamp_created":1618976625,"timestamp_updated":1645887494,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616151511669158936","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90658998","author":{"steamid":"76561198971185952","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1158,"last_played":1625443047},"language":"spanish","review":"EPICO","timestamp_created":1618972628,"timestamp_updated":1618972628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90656435","author":{"steamid":"76561198091155767","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":107,"playtime_forever":2246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":318,"last_played":1655702405},"language":"spanish","review":"La

It's a very linear shooter by general FPS standards; even more so compared with its predecessors. The exploration is completely gone, and that is a huge blow.\n\nI am going to separate setting and narrative for this review. The setting is okay; it's probably more enjoyable if you're American, in which case its imagery and ideals might mean something to you. Rapture was universal in what it could mean to humanity and to the player. Columbia, by the very nature of what the writers are trying to say, is far more exclusive. Within the game's setting, that's exactly what it's supposed to be, but the result was that I felt far less invested in the city itself. I also think the writers might've felt restricted in the way they could tell the story of this city compared with the writers of Bioshock 1 and 2. It's not bad, but it's not memorable, either.\n\nThat brings me to the narrative. This is where the game shines. It tells the story of its characters expertly. You care about the good guys, you hate the bad guys. The narrative does what it's supposed to do. In contrast to the linear gameplay, the narrative is anything but linear. That isn't to say there are choices - if there are choices, I haven't come across any, yet - but the story about a traumatised, down-on-his-luck former cavalryman-turned Pinkerton sent to retrieve a girl to pay off his debts quickly expands into a very convoluted series of dimension-hops and alternate timelines. Confused? So are the characters, at points.\n\nThe gunplay is pretty solid, though I didn't find the enemies to be half as fun as Splicers, Big Daddies, Big Sisters etc. I didn't find any of the explanations of Vigors - Bioshock: Infinite's Plasmids - to be fleshed out in the slightest. They obviously wanted a \"magic\" system but didn't want to have to give it the slightest amount of exposition. They could and should have done a lot more with this. The game also has its occasional jump-scare and creepy ambience that is, I would say, not quite the equal of its predecessors but not too far behind.\n\nIn short, despite its flaws, this game gets a positive review from me because what it gets right makes it worth playing despite the flaws. Worth buying, but you might feel a bit cheated if you don't wait for a sale.","timestamp_created":1618931548,"timestamp_updated":1618931618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90632589","author":{"steamid":"76561198099118014","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":935,"last_played":1618928477},"language":"schinese","review":"挺好玩的，有种看电影的感觉，通关一遍发现其实很多剧情都被我忽略了，建议打完以后看下网上的剧情解析，再联想一下，会有种恍然大悟的感觉。","timestamp_created":1618930672,"timestamp_updated":1618930672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90629680","author":{"steamid":"76561198121646209","num_games_owned":954,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1322,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1277,"last_played":1618963473},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is, ultimately, a disappointment. It lacks the atmosphere of the orginal, choosing to fully let go of Bioshock's excellent horror elements, as well as a much poorer handling of its themes. It tries, and fails, to criticize violence while making the player kill waves upon waves of enemies, making them an indistinct, poorly designed (compared to previous games) cannon fodder, made fun and easy to kill. It demonizes its black revolutionary characters, making them seem just as bad as the racists they fight, and ulitmately killing its major character to further the development of a white character. Furthermore, Burial at Sea, makes the writing even worse, spitefully ignoring Bioshock 2 and making everything that happens in the first game happen because of Elizabeth's actions, making other characters seem incompetent or taking away their agency; for no reason ti changes estabilished elements of the first game, and does it poorly.","timestamp_created":1618926951,"timestamp_updated":1618926951,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493589729070663452","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90628952","author":{"steamid":"76561198278735163","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":603,"last_played":1626985871},"language":"koreana","review":"DLC사고 다 플레이 한 후에 1편 해보세요 소름돋습니다","timestamp_created":1618925967,"timestamp_updated":1618925967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90627711","author":{"steamid":"76561198849410841","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":1351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1351,"last_played":1613569402},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情让人印象深刻，天空之城美如画，伊丽莎白真好看","timestamp_created":1618924282,"timestamp_updated":1618924282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90625938","author":{"steamid":"76561198054547661","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":173,"playtime_forever":598,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":598,"last_played":1618921283},"language":"turkish","review":"güzel ve uzun soluklu bir oyun bol hikayeli ve tatlı bir kız eşliğinde aksiyondan aksiyona koşturacaksınız..","timestamp_created":1618921838,"timestamp_updated":1618921838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90625881","author":{"steamid":"76561198028604581","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10087,"last_played":1619777383},"language":"english","review":"Love this game.
