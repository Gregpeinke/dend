я покупал эту игру просто потому что люблю франшизу, то есть из чувства долга. Однако поиграв в неё несколько часов, я понял, что игра хороша, даже очень. Несмотря на то, что многие локации о общая стилистика взяты из оригинальной Half-Life, игра не смотрится вторично из-за большого количества нового контента. Здесь много новых врагов, механик и оружия. Также, по моим ощущениям, игра намного сложнее своего предшественника, однако это лишь моя точка зрения. Безусловно, баги в игре тоже есть. Например редко удаётся нормально кинуть гранату, но это, скорее, связанно с движком.

Being part of the universe of the first part of Half-Life, it also contributed to the revolution of the FPS genre that was taking place at the time, and despite having several problems and not reaching the quality achieved in the title original, is a very enjoyable and recommended expansion.\n\n[list]\n\n[*] To begin with, it maintains the narrative of the same type as the original title, giving us a direct gameplay without cinematics where we interact with the environment at all times and at the same time, where we must pay attention to the environment in order to understand both what has happened as what we must do to get out alive, something which I am happy since it is an essential part of Half-Life. Something to highlight in this part is the use of radios, which have a greater use and thanks to them, we can be even more informed of what happened, so from there we can extract as players an extra part of what has happened.\n\n[*]One of the main positive points is the number of new enemies and their mechanics, since in addition to achieving an unforced distinction from the original title, each of these new enemies has unique abilities and characteristics, so each that you face one of these you will have to vary between some tactics, exactly the same in the original title, but with new enemies and, therefore, with new tactics.\n\n[*]Another very positive aspect is the fact that they maintained the use of the original mechanics (obviously in new maps and other puzzles) with the use of the map as a resource continuously to perform puzzles and fight the enemy. And they didn't limit themselves to this, as they also expanded the difficulty and variation of the puzzles and fights using the new weapons and content in general that were included in this expansion.\n\n[*]The setting of the expansion (for more than obvious reasons) is very similar to that of the original title, but maintains the same level of quality and detail in which you get to focus on parts that give more realism to everything despite graphics so old. The only negative is that the lighting in certain parts of the maps is in non-sense areas, in the wrong directions with light sense or simply not at all.\n\n[*] In the story, as was mentioned at the beginning, we are presented with the events that occurred in the original title, but from the point of view of another character, the story itself is somewhat simple, but not bad. The way I've interpreted it, the purpose of this expansion was to make use of new content in general, making use of a background story, and while it may come off as a negative, I felt the story was decent enough to have no issues with it. (except for the ending, it was all too fast at the end and it was even less conclusive than the ending of Half-Life 1)\n\nOne point that is somewhat mixed is the mechanics and the new content in general, since it has both very positive and negative aspects.\n\n[*]The positive side of the mechanics and content in this expansion is that it adds several weapons which differ considerably more from each other than in the original title, so it offers us greater freedom over our possibilities in combat and at the same time, we don't It will make you think twice when we find ourselves in trouble, since some of these are not even limited to only damaging the enemy. In addition to this, there are details to highlight such as the fact that we have a considerable amount of new dialogue, maps and a new tutorial completely set in the expansion.\n\n[*]The negative of all this is the use that was given to these weapons in the expansion, since in the first place, there are considerably more weapons than before, which can cause you to easily forget that you have some of these and do not give them their proper use at the time, and at the same time, you really shouldn't worry too much about them, since the game, after explaining their use, doesn't encourage you in any way to use them, so that you could very well play the campaign with the same old weapons with a few slight exceptions. And to counteract the positive point even more, we have a serious problem with the characters, since in this expansion it was tried to give greater relevance to the cooperation between the player and the NPCs by equipping them with unique abilities which would allow you to advance and have certain advantages in combat, the problem is that they took too much risk with this attempt, since intelligence was not at the level of these demands and in addition to feeling somewhat forced the appearances and disappearances of several of the characters, performing actions such as entering in combat or even others as simple as going through a door, they were literally impossible for them, constantly getting stuck between the corridors, ignoring you or attacking enemies far superior to them with simple pistols, the \"good\" thing about this is that they didn't really have a leading role big and if they died you could keep their weapons.\n\n[*]The other considerably negative aspect is the optimization of the expansion. I think this is already a matter of the port itself, but I will take it into account since it is the version that I have played, and the more you advance, for obvious reasons, the more save points you create, the problem is that when making a action as vital as saving your game in strategic points after a while can become corrupted, although in my case it only happened once, but what really ruined the experience for me in a certain part were 2 problems, first of all, the amount notoriously Major bugs existing in the enemies, allowing you to attack them without any reaction at certain points or similar things, and the other being the constant abrupt closures of the game after being in it after a while, this has caused me more than one annoyance mainly when end of the campaign and I think it's something that can really get you into trouble.\n\n[/list]\n\nIn conclusion, Half-Life Opposing force is an expansion that despite having performance problems to consider and not having the same quality as the original title, it is still a totally fresh Half-Life experience where we will experience this amazing universe from other eyes and with new friendships, enmities and many puzzles and well-structured maps to explore.","timestamp_created":1646614186,"timestamp_updated":1653063965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111710373","author":{"steamid":"76561198250657570","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":52,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41,"last_played":1647790921},"language":"spanish","review":"el juego es un poco horrible y no se puede mover la camara con el raton ademas nose como mirar abajo\n","timestamp_created":1646607923,"timestamp_updated":1646607923,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111700781","author":{"steamid":"76561199100845699","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":369,"last_played":1646415287},"language":"turkish","review":"Half Life hikayesinin eksik iki parçasından biri gibi bu oyun.
