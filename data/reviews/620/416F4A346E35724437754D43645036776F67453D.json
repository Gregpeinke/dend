Plus, the game offers extra puzzles outside of the main story for those looking for a bit more of a challenge.\n\nThe big draw over Portal 1 is the story. It's hardly long or dense, but Valve did a good job of crafting a fine story with some memorable characters in the small space they had to work within the game.\n\nCo-op exists too. It's not my thing but hey, it looks fun.\n\nPortal is a rare, AAA puzzle title. It's well crafted. Well thought out. And thouroughly entertaining at every nook and cranny.

Chief among them were, \"What happens now?\" and \"How did that whole weird situation come to pass?\" Portal 2 sets out to answer these questions, and in doing so travels both forward and backward from the conclusion of Portal. The result is a sequel that doesn't try to replicate the successful formula of its predecessor. Rather, it expands upon that original experience, creating something that feels initially familiar. Yet as you progress through the enthralling single-player journey and tangle with the clever cooperative campaign, any worries that things might be too familiar are swept away by the scope of your adventure and the characters you meet along the way. Once again, you are caught up in the fantastic world of Aperture Science, where hilarious and endearing dialogue is delivered by disembodied voices and artificial intelligences, and where inventive gameplay mechanics and a smooth difficulty curve make the sublime satisfaction of puzzle solving accessible to all.","timestamp_created":1528740680,"timestamp_updated":1528740680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42657465","author":{"steamid":"76561198365850959","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":624,"last_played":1528736513},"language":"russian","review":"В конце роботы ахуенно пели песню . \"  Я королева Англии и пью пиво каждый день \".

Чего-то сюжету не хватало. Не знаю, чего, но все же.\n4) Саундтрек. Помните, что я вам сказал, что геймплей - самая сильная сторона игры? Так вот, я вам наврал.
