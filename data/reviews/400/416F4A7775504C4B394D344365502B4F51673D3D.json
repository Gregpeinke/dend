Ed è un titolo che tutti, a parer mio, anche a così tanti anni di distanza, dovrebbero giocare. \nSi tratta di un puzzle-game in prima persona molto molto bello, ma andiamo per gradi:\n- Il comparto tecnico prende a piene mani da Half-Life, nel cui universo, del resto, il gioco è ambientato. La fisica è, come al solito, eccellente, la grafica è più gradevole su PC e le musiche, nonché i suoni, sono a dir poco perfetti. L'I.A. è difficile da valutare in un gioco come questo, dove praticamente non ci sono altri personaggi se non il nostro protagonista.\n- Il gameplay è il punto di maggiore rilevanza del titolo. Originalissimo, accattivante, si basa sull'utilizzo di una pistola, molto simile alla Gravity Gun di HL2 (e forse, il suo corrispettivo), in grado di aprire due portali nei muri, nel soffitto o nel pavimento (tranne in alcune superfici), un portale d'entrata e uno d'uscita, influenzati fisicamente dal nostro comportamento, che noi dovremo sfruttare per passare uno ad uno i vari puzzle. Saltuariamente potremo usufruire dell'ausilio di un cubo metallico, anch'esso influenzato fisicamente e trasportabile, per superare certe zone e schiacciare alcuni bottoni. Il concept del gameplay è questo, semplice, ma allo stesso originale e accattivante. L'uso dei portali può creare situazioni eccellenti, livelli superati in modi differenti, per non parlare della possibilità di realizzare dei veri e propri loop infiniti (ne serve uno per ottenere l'achievement di Steam \"cadi per 9000 metri\"); il level design è ben fatto e il gioco non ha pause o sottocapitoli, ma si struttura come un unico grande livello interrotto saltuariamente da qualche caricamento.\n- Trama, personaggi, storia: Questo è il punto più criptico del titolo, per risolvere il quale forse si dovrà attendere il secondo capitolo: nel corso del gioco apprendiamo solamente di essere una donna e di star eseguendo un esperimento (che dovrebbe concludersi con la nostra morte) nei laboratori di Aperture Science, principale concorrente di Black Mesa (cfr. il finale di HL2: ep.2); per il resto, sappiamo ben poco, anche perché nel gioco sarà presente solo un altro personaggio, l'I.A. GLaDos, responsabile per gli esperimenti di AS. I dialoghi con questa entità sono comunque molto belli e ben fatti e predispongono un alone di mistero che probabilmente verrà svelato nel secondo capitolo.\n- Longevità: unica vera pecca del titolo. E' brevissimo, io ci ho messo circa cinque ore a finirlo ed era la prima volta che ci giocavo, verosimilmente, ad un secondo giro, livelli bonus esclusi, non si supereranno le due ore.\n\nChe dire, titolo divertente, originale e per certi versi magico, anche se non perfetto. Per questo non può prendere il massimo. La canzone finale è qualcosa di STRAORDINARIO, quasi commovente.\nCAPOLAVORO.\n\n10-/10.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------FOR NON ITALIAN VIEWIERS-------------------------------------------\nNew original concept, funny puzzles, very very brilliant new weapon and idea. Something new in the videogame's actual panorama, absolutely a must play. Nice graphics, nice sound (with an epic final song), funny and deep gameplay, with many solutions for a single puzzle; not very clear in the plot and the story but the game's writing is very good. However, is a very short game: in the second playing, took max only two hours. But no problem. \nThe game is a real masterpiece and a must-playing game. Play it and enjoy it.\n10-/10\n\nPS: sorry for my bad english.","timestamp_created":1439385771,"timestamp_updated":1445209800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17502761","author":{"steamid":"76561198117534136","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":157,"last_played":1631543906},"language":"russian","review":"Скажу честно.........................

I would say I much prefer this to it's sequal...mainly as it's compact nature lends itself to \"Hop in, hop out\" playthroughs...I'll often get a bit bored and spend a quick hour or so pottering quickly through a few chambers to kill time...wonderful game definately a must own.","timestamp_created":1438895841,"timestamp_updated":1438895841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484311044216156006","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17418861","author":{"steamid":"76561198162624901","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":335,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1474726935},"language":"spanish","review":"wea buena cortito pero bakan :3","timestamp_created":1438890356,"timestamp_updated":1438890356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17417574","author":{"steamid":"76561198136167359","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1438891180},"language":"english","review":"It was fun, but a little bit short :/","timestamp_created":1438884046,"timestamp_updated":1438884046,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17413582","author":{"steamid":"76561198120662627","num_games_owned":414,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":125,"last_played":1438791630},"language":"french","review":"[h1] Note Global 16/20[/h1] \n\n❤ Public conseillé : \nLes fans du genre ou de la franchise\nLes casual gamers\nTout public \n\n☼ Graphismes :\nBon\n\n€ Qualité/prix : (9,99€) \nAbordable \n\n⇧ Les plus :\n+  Un concept réussi\n+  Des énigmes qui secouent les méninges\n+  Humour caustique et ambiance malsaine\n+  Les défis pour prolonger l'aventure\n\n⇩ Les moins :\n-  Boss final pas compliquer à battre\n\nDurée de vie : 2 heures (Baser sur mon expérience et celle moyenne des joueurs)","timestamp_created":1438864836,"timestamp_updated":1459006814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17408261","author":{"steamid":"76561198115260945","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":451,"last_played":1445395937},"language":"spanish","review":"Tu experiencia en Portal se resumirá en este sencillo ciclo de repetición\nRepeat\n  Te ríes\n   Piensas\n    Golpeas el Hardware\n     Avanzas\n      La cagas\nUntil btnPower()","timestamp_created":1438826816,"timestamp_updated":1438826816,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17408147","author":{"steamid":"76561198108386056","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":340,"last_played":1628806677},"language":"brazilian","review":"Dentro do game, você acorda confuso em um laboratório que faz testes com um aparato curioso capaz de criar portais sobre praticamente qualquer superfície. \n\nComo parte de um experimento, seus primeiros desafios são um tanto quanto óbvios. \n\nMas em pouco tempo você precisa quebrar a cabeça para chegar a atingir seus objetivos e manter-se vivo durante o processo.\n\nEmbora o game seja construído em cima da mesma engine que o game Half-Life 2, Portal não conta com monstros aterrorizantes e armas destruidoras.

La historia puede ser perfectamente acabada en 2 horas y media pero podremos hacer Misiones avanzadas y Desafíos que nos darán mas horas de juego en caso de que queramos completarlo al 100% (los desafíos se me hicieron aburridos y no pude terminarlos...).\n   Al haber jugado anteriormente a Portal 2 y haber completado su historia y campaña cooperativa creo que el juego se me hizo bastante fácil de completar, pero fue bastante entretenido y me gustó saber sobre el principio de la saga.\n\n  En resumen:\n \nA favor:\n  -Muy entretenido y rejugable podiendo descargar mapas en internet.\n  -Gráficamente nada mal.\n  -Una saga muy original.\n  -Buen humor.\n  -Bajos requisitos de pc.\n  -El precio.\n  -A diferencia que en su secuela muchas veces deberemos ser más habiles que ingeniosos o creativos (esto también es malo porque la dificultad de los niveles suele ser menor a la de la secuela, para la mayoría de jugadores).\n\n En contra:\n  -Se puede acabar perfectamente en un día.\n  -Los \"Desafíos\" y \"Misiones avanzadas\" reciclan los mapas de la historia.\n  -A diferencia que en su secuela muchas veces deberemos ser más habiles que ingeniosos o creativos (esto también es bueno porque da variedad a la saga y al juego).\n\n  Aconsejo la compra de este producto por las risas y dolores de cabeza que te sacará y si te ha gustado aconsejo que juegues a su secuela \"Portal 2\".","timestamp_created":1438583171,"timestamp_updated":1438583171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17360333","author":{"steamid":"76561198242496944","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1438639137},"language":"turkish","review":"Gerçekten oynanmaya değer bir oyun kısa ve öz","timestamp_created":1438568631,"timestamp_updated":1438568631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17359954","author":{"steamid":"76561198141157613","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1629,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1272,"last_played":1563345881},"language":"english","review":"Love it!","timestamp_created":1438566160,"timestamp_updated":1438566160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17354406","author":{"steamid":"76561198061250726","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1438346974},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego.
