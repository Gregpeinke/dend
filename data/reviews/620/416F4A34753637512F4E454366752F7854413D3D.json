As a result the graphics are noticeably better, the game is a much more complete package that easily quadruples the original in terms of content, it introduces new puzzle elements that fit well in the universe, continues the brilliant humour and dark, dry wit of the original, and perhaps most notably introduces two new characters that are almost as good as the original GLaDOS. In fact the Cave Johnson segments of Portal 2 are the best parts of this game.\n\nWith all of that said I think I still rank Portal slightly higher. It's not as pretty, nor is it as well-rounded and complete a game, but it was the first game to deliver line after line of exceptional dialogue and dark humour. The writing in both games is exceptional - easily the best I've ever experienced in all of gaming, and this makes both an absolute joy to discover for the first time - but Portal did it all first and deserves the credit for having done so even if Portal 2 is the better game.","timestamp_created":1451613363,"timestamp_updated":1451613363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20166176","author":{"steamid":"76561198198153279","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1644,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1323,"last_played":1488381026},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game to play with a friend!\n","timestamp_created":1451613075,"timestamp_updated":1451613075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20166151","author":{"steamid":"76561198268958845","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1453529859},"language":"schinese","review":"很棒的游戏，广角的游戏视野给人眼前一亮的感觉","timestamp_created":1451612987,"timestamp_updated":1451612987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20166058","author":{"steamid":"76561198217231255","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":4567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":342,"last_played":1652571149},"language":"english","review":"its amazing","timestamp_created":1451612665,"timestamp_updated":1451612665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20165887","author":{"steamid":"76561198213279195","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1775,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":179,"last_played":1640976255},"language":"english","review":"Best game on Steam","timestamp_created":1451612141,"timestamp_updated":1451612141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20164969","author":{"steamid":"76561198256848754","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":580,"last_played":1451748935},"language":"turkish","review":"Half Life 2 modu olan bir oyun açıkcası Half Life 2 grafikler aynı tek değişiklik oyun birazcık zeka ve dikkat oyunu çok rahat bitirebilir MP ve Tek oyunculuda hikayeyi takip ederseniz oyun çok güzel oluyor.","timestamp_created":1451609224,"timestamp_updated":1451609224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20164959","author":{"steamid":"76561198093039338","num_games_owned":843,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1071,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1519594853},"language":"english","review":"Like every valve game with single player this game isnt exception in very charming and exciting story.
