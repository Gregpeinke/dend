It has many classes and guns to choose from and the leveling system is great, There are guns in the game you can buy for real money, but these are just cosmetics they are always just direct copies of free guns in their stats.(exept for a few weapon packs that aren't that great they just add some more fun) There are I think 2 or 3 guns that are a bit better but one is a promotional off of Tripwire Interactives game Rising Storm for Red Orchistra 2. The thing is like 5$ and 1$ on sale so just pick up the tripwire complete pack on sale you get 4 or 5 great games and every DLC for them and it's probably the best deal on Steam aside from the Valve Complete pack. Back to the game play this game has so many different play styles that its pretty hard to get bored off. The only times that I ever get bored are when I am not doing very well. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes left4dead or any zombie survival shooters. Although keep in mind this game is nothing like DayZ. This game has many different zombies some very large maps and many different zombie types. If I were to compare this game to any game it would be Left 4 Dead(both 1 and 2). The reason being this game has a many different types of zombies(crawlers, Flesh Pounds, Skrakes, ect) and left 4 dead has many different zombie types to there are the regular zombies and the tanks and charges and many more. Also after you progress enough you get to a safe house in L4D and in KF you get to buy moer weapons with money you earned from killing zombies. So in a way it is a little bit like COD zombies(I think it is better than COD zombies) and it is alot like L4D. Overall I would give this game 9 zombies out of 10. The reason it is not a complete 10/10 is because it isnt the easiest game to just pick up and be really good at it. It takes a good ammount of time before you can lead your team in a PUG.","timestamp_created":1385689222,"timestamp_updated":1401660962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478026211261749268","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7816435","author":{"steamid":"76561197987543811","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":652,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":652,"last_played":1379916689},"language":"spanish","review":"Sencillo pero entretenido, y sus actualizaciones son la onda\nBLOODYHELL","timestamp_created":1385688426,"timestamp_updated":1385688426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7816342","author":{"steamid":"76561198010509063","num_games_owned":264,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1571,"last_played":1404869503},"language":"english","review":"Good time killer.","timestamp_created":1385687967,"timestamp_updated":1385687967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7816116","author":{"steamid":"76561198088950222","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1373,"last_played":1586227343},"language":"english","review":"Wow.

All with varying traits, all complimenting each other in one way or another.\nAt lower difficulties, the make-up of your team doesn't matter much, however, at Hard+ difficulties, it becomes paramount to your success.\nPart of this system is also tiers of classes.\nEvery class gets reduced prices on weapons, specifically made for their class. For example, Firebugs get a reduced price at the trader on Flamethrowers.\n\nWhile this is overall, very beneficial, it also gives another reason to level your classes. Thankfully, the developers thought this through, and made class progression easy by allowing cross-progression, which essentially means you can progress one class, while playing another. Getting to the elusive Tier 6 will prove time-consuming, but enjoyable none-the-less.\n\nNaturally, this isn't a reliable way of getting better equipment, though it may save your life down the line (it is also a pretty good idea to seek them out at the start of the game for a headstart).\nSome weapons are obviously for certain classes, but are still open for use by anyone, no matter the class.\n\n-------------\nMaps/Levels\n-------------\nLevel design is also very nice, ranging from abandoned streets, to twisted Santa's workshop.\nThe size of the levels range wildly between narrow corridor to wide open-air shooting.\nEvery level features a trader, which you must get to in-between waves. This is where you stock up on ammo, purchase weaponry and armor, and sell unnecessary equipment. Though do offer the weapons to others before doing so.\nOf course, if you don't have the money to buy weapons or ammo, then these can also be found around the maps in random locations.\n\n-------------\nControls\n-------------\nMovement is nice and fluid, with a slight hint of Counter-Strike with the \"run faster with your knife out, despite still carrying the same equipment\" logic.\nThe weapon controls are extremely varying, with crossbows, assault rifles, katanas, the before mentioned flamethrowers, and many many more.\n\n-------------\nVisuals\n-------------\nIt is very clear that this game originates from a mod based on a game from 2004.\nEnemies have decent animations, though with the occasional pathfinding problems.\nSome maps outright have enemies floating in mid-air, trying to jump down to you only to find themselves hindered by an invisible wall. Thankfully, this is nothing more than visual annoyances that won't put you out of the action, but still make you go \"Huh, that wasn't supposed to happen.\".\nTexture quality is fine, considering the game's origin.\nThe slow motion effect that sometimes happens, is something you'll either enjoy or hate. While one class has an ability that extends this effect everytime the person kills something, this can become either tedious very quickly, or a very awesome bullet-time scene for you.\n\n-------------\nAudio\n-------------\nThe audio quality is very good.\nGuns sound like they'd make the sounds they make, explosions sound... Explosive? And the monsters sound like... Well... Monsters. Especially the Sirens, my god, I hate those things.\n\n-------------\nDLC\n-------------\nThis game has tons of DLC, mostly cosmetics, and some weapons.\nNow, before you go \"Pfft! Those weapons are probably pay 2 win, no thanks!\", listen!\nThe weapons may be stronger, but that comes at a price. The weapon will most of the time be more expensive to obtain, and usually, the standard weapons will be plenty for anyone to use, and succeed with.\n\n\n-------------\nFinal Verdict\n-------------\nIn summary, this game is for anyone who enjoys horde modes, if just a little.\nIf you don't like horde modes, if this won't get you into this type of game, then nothing will!\n\nI whole-heartedly recommend this game to everyone.\n\n-------------\nFeedback\n-------------\nIf anything is incorrect, or if I missed anything, please don't hesitate with posting a comment on my profile telling me.","timestamp_created":1385668068,"timestamp_updated":1385668068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7811614","author":{"steamid":"76561198097521675","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1008,"last_played":1466602822},"language":"portuguese","review":"Very good game! i like a lot!","timestamp_created":1385667651,"timestamp_updated":1385667651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7811523","author":{"steamid":"76561197999322380","num_games_owned":347,"num_reviews":184,"playtime_forever":156,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59,"last_played":1398286878},"language":"russian","review":"Я не знаю зачем я это купил...\nЛучше играть в L4D","timestamp_created":1385667344,"timestamp_updated":1429795474,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464461624622344971","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7811484","author":{"steamid":"76561198035063922","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":111,"last_played":1386010235},"language":"russian","review":"Норм игра =)","timestamp_created":1385667166,"timestamp_updated":1385667166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7811416","author":{"steamid":"76561198002067760","num_games_owned":615,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":6145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5644,"last_played":1561992070},"language":"english","review":"If Team Fortress 2 is light-hearted, brightly coloured, fast paced PvP perfection with beautiful (hilariously ridiculous?) bells (hats?) on then Killing Floor is the flipside of it's FPS coin.\nIn my view these are THE two shooters every PC gamer should have in their collection.\nUp there with Left 4 Dead 2 as THE definitive multi-player zombie shooter, Killing Floor adds persistent character leveling and is the perfect \"survival\" alternative to L4D2's excellent \"journey\" based gameplay approach.\nIf you're looking for a serious, grown-up, spine tingling, and ultimately superb co-op zombie survival shooter then this is most certainly your game.","timestamp_created":1385666946,"timestamp_updated":1385666946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7811402","author":{"steamid":"76561198048143627","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":477,"last_played":1459205128},"language":"russian","review":"ходкор","timestamp_created":1385666896,"timestamp_updated":1385666896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7811400","author":{"steamid":"76561198026462342","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1533,"last_played":1401927200},"language":"russian","review":"Рекомендую ли я эту игру?

Basically, the premise here is that these \"Zeds\" (the zombie-like creatures within the game) are failed military experiments wreaking havoc across the UK. Players are assigned with the task of eliminating these creatures under the role of special agents dropped into these Zed hot spots. \n\nThe typical game progresses in waves of Zeds, each wave ending with a trip to a weapons trader who will move from safehouse to safehouse during the progression of each round in order to keep the Zeds on the run. Players choose from one of seven different classes (or Perks, as they're referred to in the game), each including weapon specialization \"perks\" for picking the class, which include Medic (armor/speed/healing), Sharpshooter (handguns/sniper rifles), Firebug (flamethrower/fire resist), Demolitions Expert (basically anything that explodes), Support (shotguns/welding), Commando (grenades/stealth sight/assault rifles), and Berserker (melee weapon-using close quarters combat specialist). However, your class does not restrict which weapons you can use within the game. It simply gives a boost to your ability with the weapons which fall under that Perk's specialty. Also, each Perk is improved through a leveling EXP system. \n\nThe cool thing about this is that you can level any Perk at any time, depending on your current weapon. EX: Hacking Zeds with a melee weapon will increase your Berserker EXP, shooting off heads in the distance will warrant Sharpshooter EXP, lobbing a grenade into a group will award Commando EXP, and healing a fellow teammate will increase Medic EXP. All in all, this game is great for online and solo play.","timestamp_created":1385666479,"timestamp_updated":1385666479,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7811034","author":{"steamid":"76561198027361960","num_games_owned":410,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2796,"last_played":1590147943},"language":"french","review":"très bon jeu, un pur divertissement en coop aves ses potes","timestamp_created":1385665743,"timestamp_updated":1385665743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7810914","author":{"steamid":"76561198010820323","num_games_owned":1168,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4627,"last_played":1387436902},"language":"english","review":"A great time with friends for a good price.

New players may find they have no time to learn things properly because it sticks you straight in the deep end with only seconds to read about what is even going on before you are being smashed over the head left right and center by some of the scariest looking monsters you have seen (unless you want to play alone of course, which you dont)","timestamp_created":1385663507,"timestamp_updated":1385663507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7810202","author":{"steamid":"76561198018602357","num_games_owned":446,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5815,"last_played":1419403612},"language":"english","review":"Best co-op Zambie game.

However, this game is -fun-.\n\nThe default game mode, the titular \"Killing Floor\", pits up to six players against progressively stronger waves of zombi- sorry, \"Specimens\", some of which possessed of special abilities, like the Siren's disorientating scream (making them more like Banshees) or the Bloat's corrosive bile. Between waves, a Trader appears in one of several locations where you can purchase weapons and ammunition.\n\nOne of the more interesting features of this game is its progression system; when you enter a match you choose a \"Perk\", a sort-of character class, that confers damage bonuses and price discounts with a particular weapon type (among other bonuses), along with corresponding criteria for ranking up (e.g. the Field Medic ranks up by healing other players). However, the beauty of the system is that you do not need to be using a perk to rank it up. All players come equipped with a medical syringe that they can use to heal themselves and their teammates with. All players can purchase any weapon, although there is a limit to how many they can carry. You can rank up any perk you like, simply based on what you choose to bring to bear against the Zo- Specimens.\n\nThere's nothing especially impressive about the game's graphics, although I should stress that there's also nothing -wrong- with them. They convey this dark, grim horror atmosphere, which is accentuated by the Zom- Specimens themselves, often grotesque and genuinely frightening creatures, who have a habit of sneaking up on you. However, this is somewhat contradicted by the voice-acting. The female Trader NPC uses vaguely suggestive and flirtatious dialogue, but appears to have no idea exactly what she's saying. The player characters are almost all Cockney-accented wideboys, with the in-game voice commands conveying a desire for money for weapons as \"anyone spot me a tenner?\", or gratitude as \"nice one, Cyril.\"\n\nThe strength of the game's sound and graphical assets would definitely be its weapons. The guns look and feel great, with a successful headshot popping a Zomb- SPECIMEN'S head like an over-ripe tomato. Each perk has at least one associated weapon type, including pistols, shotguns, rifles, assault rifles, SMGs, RAWKET LAWNCHAIRS and a nice variety of melee weapons. Several are available only as DLC, but for the most part these are just re-skins of standard weapons, and do not impact the game's progression.\n\nI like this game. Despite the somewhat repetitive nature of the Killing Floor mode, it's the sort of game I can play for hours at a time, especially if I'm playing with friends. The game has its own push-to-talk voice chat, as well as text and the aforementioned voice commands. There is an \"Objective Mode\" I have not yet tried, so I cannot comment on how it plays. If I had a minor complaint, it would be the seemingly large leap in difficulty between \"Beginner\" and \"Normal\", and I would highly recommend new players wait until they have achieved Rank 3 in a favoured Perk before attempting anything beyond the first setting. \n\nRegardless, I highly-recommend it, especially for a Steam Sale price.\n\nTL;DR VERSION:\n\nPros:\n- Neat Perk system\n- Nice variety of weapons\n- Weapons look and sound great\n- Fairly easy to pick up and play\n\nCons:\n- Gameplay may become repetitve for some people\n- Poor voice acting clashes with the graphical tone of the game\n- Large difficulty spike between settings.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a really good game for me, and I heartily recommend it to anyone who likes shooting zombies.\n\n\n...Specimens!
