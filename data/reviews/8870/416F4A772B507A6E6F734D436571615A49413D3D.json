Good story too, even though some of the themes and motifs may make you feel uncomfortable. Elizabeth is well done. Vigours are a really fun way to off your enemies. Props for the first mainstream Steampunk game.\n\nHowever, that's kind-of all there is to it. You enter an area, take all the coins and weapons and food, fight some enemies, go to the next area, take the coins and weapons and food, fight some enemies, go to the next area... etc etc. \n\nIf they had sandboxed this game it would have been *amazing*. If they had put in crafting, skill trees, all the stuff a game like this needs in 2014, it would have been game of the year.  As it is, you're just watching a movie, and occasionally a mob of enemies appear and you have to shoot them. Um... \n\nSo 100% for style and presentation, 50% for actual gameplay. So yes, recommended, but with reservations: if you like a linear first-person-shooter where you don't have to think much about puzzles or locations (a big arrow on the floor shows you where to go), then get this, it's beautiful and atmospheric and unique. If you like your games with a bit more.. interaction (Fallout, Deus EX, Dead Island etc) then you may feel a little let down by this.\n\n(To be fair, games like Tomb Raider suffer from the same problem, guess they are written with consoles in mind or something.

There are a couple of things what I expect from a good game: a compelling story, a vivid gameplay and a lot of fun. Nowadays people require also a stunning, state of the art graphic. Frankly, it doesn't matter that much to me. I recently played some quite mind blowing indie games were graphics reminds me on the good old days back in the 90s. Plus, in other FPS like BioShock Infinite I decreased the graphic effects to a minimum to get a better sight on what matters: the enemy. But to make long story short, IMHO the pros and cons about this game:\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- topsy-turvy world that looks simply fantastic\n- the vigors are well chosen and even more the combos are awesome\n- a variety of weapons which are quite well balanced\n- Riding on the Sky-Line and kick ass is so much fun, not speaking of the different ways to frag someone\n- Sky-hook! where can I buy a replica, dude?\n- overall the battles feels really smooth and if action is going on it makes a lot of fun\n\n[b]Neutral:[/b]\n- the story is … well, weird I think. People stated that it’s actually phenomenal in every way. Maybe for a shooter, it might be true but its kinda confusing especially in the end. I won't say the story is bad or something, just it could be more deeply told. \n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Within less than 15 hours I played the game through on the second highest difficulty level, collecting most of the voxophone and kinetoscope, plus reaching more than 50 percent of the achievements. Personally, the play time is to short but there are some DLCs out there \n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\nGot entertained for a while! \nMy rate: 7/10","timestamp_created":1388442544,"timestamp_updated":1388442544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+PznosMCeqaZIA=="}
