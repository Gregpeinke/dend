The most riveting and enjoyable single player campaign I've ever experienced and the game's setting and atmosphere is beautiful, wonderfully crafted.\n\nFrom the eerie introduction in Point Insertion to the anarchy of revolution in Anti Citizen One Half Life 2 is Valve's signature masterpiece that captures the essence of what an adventure is supposed to be.

used to be a Halo fan. Then Halo 4 came out, which upset me so much that I ragequit Xbox Live altogether (well, that and the fact Microsoft lost my profile). I then became a PC gamer. Later, I realized that I never did beat Half-Life 2, and the last time I played it was renting it when I was a kid (and ragequiting on the 'We don't go to Ravenholm' chapter, lol).\n\nI saw it as an opportunity to play a 'new' triple-A IP that wasn't utter COD copy-cat garbage, and I took it. I never felt so pleased with a game in a long time, and it was certainly a breath of fresh air.\n\nI remember the days of the Halo vs. Half-life debate, and now I can say for certain: Half-Life 2 is longer and more exciting than any Halo campaign. And this is comming from a former Halo Fan. What makes it better then Halo is the fact that the game is harder by default, because there is NO REGENERATING HEALTH. Additionally, the game really likes to troll you (and this game came out before the term 'trolling' was even invented!) by throwing situations that can be both difficult, and also bring about an air of satire. \n\nFor example, there was one part where you had to crawl through a vent and had to leave a friend behind to open the way for them. As I went through, there was a branch off. One side had some energy pick-ups, so I naturally crawled in that direction. However, as soon as I got them, the vent broke and I plopped down directly back in front of the person I had left behind, who then smugly said \"Back so soon?\" I rolled my eyes, and then went back in the vent and took the other route. However, the vent broke again, but instead of falling out of it a whole section fell off the ceiling with me inside it. After it settled, I broke out of the vent's grate and tentatively poked my head out the top...\n\nO_O\n\n...\n\nXD\n\nInches away and all around the fallen section of vent that I was inside, the entire room was filled with tripwires and explosive barrels! One wrong move and I'd be one fried Freeman. Like an idiot, my first idea was to chuck a grenade out of the vent section I was in, duck back inside, and hope for the best. Needless to say, it didn't work. Then I somehow jumped and bounced over all the trip-wires safely, and made it to an utility elevator at the other side of the room...only for that to fall down the shaft and into water that was at the bottom, which nearly drowned me.\n\nIt's that sort of thing that pervades much of the game, and you'll be entertained for hours on end. It is quite a long campaign, and for me, despite palying as much as I could and for as long as I could (before and after work), it took me over a week to beat on normal, and I wasn't really stuck on any part.\n\nThere is one warning though: this is not a mindless shooter. Besides shooting the bad guys, you ABSOLUTELY have to scavenge for ammunition and health packs, which may be hidden. Also, there are some logic/physics puzzles as well that might stump the ordinary player and prevent them progressing for upwards of half an hour or more. While I didn't usually have a problem with the puzzles, I'm pretty sure others might.\n\nBut if you aren't afraid of a challenge for both your gun skills and your noodle, and are actively looking for one, this is definately the game for you.","timestamp_created":1399967178,"timestamp_updated":1399967178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10098496","author":{"steamid":"76561198061107421","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1841,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":721,"last_played":1633716609},"language":"czech","review":"Tuhle hru sem celou dohrál a podle máho názoru je to jedna z nejrevolučních her historie.

The story is excellent and you feel this very crude and realistic vibe from it. Graphics aren't spectacular, but we have to consider this game came out quite some time ago. Killing enemies feels excellent, as each kill is an achievement on its own.

Somehow it's graphics are still better than a large amount of modern games, though it is an older game. It was voted Game of the Decade on the VGA's in I believe 2012 but don't quote me on the year. As for my opinon on the game, it's a fun shooter, it can get tricky at times, but it makes good use of the game engine. The characters are interesting and there's sublte humour throughout the game. It also is a game you should get if you're thinking of getting Garry's Mod as it adds models and such that could be nice to have. The game took me probably around 10 hours to complete, but that's a rough guess as I haven't played in quite a while. If you haven't played Half-Life 1 then have no fear, because it explains the basis of what you need to know in a cutscene in the beginning of the game (though if you are interested in watching some gameplay I'd suggest Freeman's Mind on Youtube). The game also comes with a free copy of Half-Life 2: Lost coast which is a short side-game, not relevant to the plot of the main game but fun to play for about 15 minutes. The two DLCs, Episode 1 and Episode 2, also take place in quick succession, Episode 1 taking place about 30 seconds after the end of the main game and Episode 2 taking place right after Episode 1, whihc makes them nice addons to the game. Combat is fun and often fast paced, with a variety of weapons. I'd suggest it to people who like a challenge with their FPS's and who enjoy a good story with good characters.\n\nPROS:\n-Good graphics, especially for an older game\n-Fun characters\n-Subtle humor\n-Combat makes you feel powerful without making the game easy\n-Fun enemies to fight\n\nCONS:\n-WHERE IS HALF-LIFE 3?!?!?!?\n-Seriously though, too many cliffhangers, even after Episode 1 and 2\n\nOverall I'd give it a 8.5/10. It's a great game and worth the money, but there just seems to be something missing. Perhaps it's the lack of a sequel. *ahem* that means you Valve.","timestamp_created":1399767702,"timestamp_updated":1399767702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10077147","author":{"steamid":"76561198105417452","num_games_owned":403,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":1292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1292,"last_played":1590356505},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 2 is a great single player experience, anyone who has a PC and like either a good story and FPS games should play this game.

Although it is from 2004, this is one of the best FPS I have ever played. The game never gets boring, and always keeps you on you on the edge of your seat. The puzzles are challenging, yet solvable. One gripe that I would have to say would be that the game has to load right in the middle of gameplay. For example, you've just taken down a chopper and some awesome music starts playing. You walk foward a few steps and then the game stops and says \"loading\" in the middle of the screen. That really pisses me off, but is something that is always excusable because of how well the game is put together. The game ends fantastically, and after it was over I was was so ready for Half Life 3 someday. The story was fantastic, despite this being a first person shooter game.
