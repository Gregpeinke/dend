You just have to know that if you treat it like Team Fortress 2, you're gonna have a bad time! This game is significantly different than Team Fortress 2. It has a more competitive, fast-paced feeling where people try to work together to complete the objective. If you're used to Team Fortress 2, you have to know some differences before you get in game, get your ass wooped then go to write a negative review about this. \n\nScouts are not designed for combat and are just for completing the objective. Getting a single kill as a scout is hard to do.  I personally like this scout concept over the Team Fortress 2 one. The people that still want a fast combat class in the game, don't worry! There's still a class for that. Recently, Team Fortress 2 got a new rifle called the 'Classic'. If you know how that works, you can grasp the concept of the classic sniper pretty well. Although, the TFC sniper does not suck as much as the classic. Soldier is the same except he has two shotguns. On the topic of shotguns, there are two of them. A double-barreled one that does more damage yet a slower fire rate and a slower reload and a single-barreled one that does more damage yet a faster fire rate and a faster reload. Shotguns in this game have no fall-off.\n\nDemoman is pretty similar. Your pipebomb launcher is your stickybomb launcher as Team Fortress 2 players are used to. Except the pipeboms do not stick. You have a single-barreled shotgun and you can place an instakill detpack that explodes in 5, 20, 50 seconds. The detpack can also be used to open entrances. Medic is the most changed class. Medic is for combat, healing, and capturing objectives. Your medkit can infect enemies and you have two shotguns. You also have a conc grenade that you can use to conc jump which we'll go over later. HWGuy has the same difference as soldier. You still have a minigun, but you have two shotguns.\n\nPyro is weaker than his Team Fortress 2 counterpart. Your main job is to confuse and it is not to wreck. You have an incendiary RPG and you cannot airblast. Spy is the second most different when compared to his Team Fortress 2 counterpart. You have a double-barreled shotgun, a pistol that slows enemies down, and a nailgun. You can disguise still and you can do a crappy feign death that makes you turn into a corpse. No one falls for it and it doesn't even show up in the killfeed. It's good for hiding yet it sucks for tricking. YES BACKSTABS STILL EXIST. Engineer is pretty similar. You cannot upgrade dispensers and teleporters, but you can upgrade sentry guns. Sentry guns can be upgraded in 1 hit as long as you have 130 cells (metal). You also have a weak railgun that's more for finishing off rather than taking on a full health target. Dispensers only give armor and ammo, but no health.\n\nGeneral Differences: \n\nThere are grenades. Grenades. Every Team Fortress Classic class has a frag grenade (except scout), and a special grenade. Scout has two special grenades.\n\nMovement is a lot more intricate. You can jump with grenades and bunnyhop. \n\nThere are more gamemodes and maps.\n\nOn flag capturing maps, you don't take the flag back to your flag and you take it to somewhere else.\n\nThere is armor.","timestamp_created":1419813882,"timestamp_updated":1419813882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":49,"votes_funny":12,"weighted_vote_score":"0.808598160743713379","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13675012","author":{"steamid":"76561198013813448","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2687,"last_played":1658435136},"language":"russian","review":"Nice game.","timestamp_created":1419805420,"timestamp_updated":1641199686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13656878","author":{"steamid":"76561198097733243","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":83,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1419128394},"language":"english","review":"I'm a huge TF2 fan so I figured I'd check out the game that started it all.

But its good when you are in the mood of playing. Servers are dead, but not entirely. Maybe like 2-3 servers still up and running and has people. This game is about objectives such as sending your flag into enemy base or capture the flag. Just remember that everyone has alot of HP (like how it is with half-life basically, but can take more explosives, ALOT).\n\nUpdate: So after playing this a while now there are some things I'm going to say, but nonetheless I still recommend it because there were actually fun moments when playing this even though despite the servers are pretty much dead but not entirely (as said above), because there are some flaws that can and will make the game boring unless you are interested in this kind of stuff (to me, it doesnt as I just want a regular competitive match). So here are the pros and cons I've seen throughout playing this.\n\nPros:\n\nThere are moments in some servers where Team Based are really Team Based, where you work together with your team whether to get the objective in the enemy base, or grab the objective from the enemy base to your base.\n\nMods as usual has some fun stuff, I had a blast playing them and it has its moments when that server has people and sometimes its dead. But when theres people, theres the fun. Preferably the mod maps were alot of fun.\n\n\nNow for cons, and those tend to happen fairly often. I wouldnt say TFC is the worst because otherwise I wouldnt be playing it and would have given a negative review otherwise.\n\nCons:\n\nMost of the classes are useless in some servers. Mainly due to some classes overusing special grenades that gives them a super boost (such as medic and scout), depending on the servers you play, if you are playing defense you will run into them VERY often, wondering why isnt offense taking care of them. Especially when multiple people comes in.\n\nBhopping, lets just say I have a love-hate relationship with Bhopping. Times it was fun, times it gets annoying. In this game, depending on servers once again, its annoying. Mainly on flag captures, as people say it takes \"Skill\". Yeah, thats true. But you know what it can also do? Scare away players, and kill the server. Making it dead (and its not the kind of where the server crashes, its the kind of where you'll end up either playing alone or 2v2, maybe less). Considering the majority of servers are already dead. Unless you love Bhopping, or just want to get into it to make the game balanced. Go for it. To me, its what makes it boring. But nonetheless I still come back and play it.\n\nI cant really say what needs to be fixed considering this is a very old game. But if you love Bhopping, you are welcome here. If you are not, just hope you get good teams or for the very least are good enough to hunt down these bhoppers. Just be aware of overused grenades and use classes that can help tip the balance for the team. There are teams like that, so if its a balanced match, you'll have a fun time.","timestamp_created":1413878760,"timestamp_updated":1476580696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12590536","author":{"steamid":"76561198101251233","num_games_owned":427,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1413093268},"language":"english","review":"I can not in good faith recomend an online multiplayer game that has a severe lack of online players to complete the expierience.
