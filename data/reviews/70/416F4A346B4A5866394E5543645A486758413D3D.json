Bullet spongey enemies and a lack of health recovery that makes the games many traps, ambushes or any mistakes you make costly, encouraging overuse of saves as well as slow and exploity ways to kill enemies. Save Hard for immediate replays where you remember most of what is coming.\n\nI ran into some nasty bugs, like one bug where a scientist did not open up a door they were meant to and completely stopped progress. Verifying the game cache did fix it however. There were also much more harmless bugs, like hornets getting stuck in moving platforms and holding them in place for a few moments, or holding the mouse with the crowbar to hit corpses at lightning speed.\n\nHalf life has a some poor segments, infamously Xen but also a few before it. Mostly I'm talkng about boss battles, platforming or areas with spawning enemies. The platforming challange at the final boss is probably the worse, making me quit the game and look up if I'll have to do it or similarly bad rooms again after beating it (thankfully no so I returned to beat it).","timestamp_created":1469059444,"timestamp_updated":1469060466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24431694","author":{"steamid":"76561198109846808","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":4261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":167,"playtime_at_review":873,"last_played":1660497452},"language":"english","review":"As someone who was born in '96, I didn't really get to experience the games of the 90's until I was much older.

From the moment Gordon Freeman accidentally ushers forth the Green Apocalypse, to the ending where that mysterious timelord threatens you before putting you on ice, the story and action doesn't stop. The first person perspective really puts you into the world of The Black Mesa Research Facility, making this a personal journey for every player. The only possible downside this game might have for some people is that the graphics are old of course. I personally think it adds some charm. Also, if you suck at fps games like I do, then you might find this to be both an exhilarating and frustrating experience. You'll die a lot, and if you don't quicksave often, you might have to replay half a chapter to get back to where you once were. Follower AI can be a bit wonky sometimes. \nOther than that, this game is great and you should buy it during a Steam sale if you haven't played it yet. It really is an experience to be had.

Avoiding all spoilers I started the game and realized how 90s it looked, even with the \"HD textures\" on. It truly felt like an adventure, where the main character finds himself in a rough situation with aliens and military forces trying to take everything down at the same time in a clusterfudge of events that this game throws at you. In general the game is about trying to get to a place called The Lambda Complex, where there is supposed to be a way to stop the alien invasion. You may encounter it hard to travel there since the facilities are kilometers long and most of the time you will be blasting an alien with a shotgun in the face, but once you get there the game will make you feel like the end is near.\n\nDuration is good. Graphics are dated yet the animations for the models are at peak for the time. Audio takes the cake, and level design is quite linear (unless when you count when you realize you are just in the same room as 4 hours before taking a leap of faith from a window to scape).\n\nThe price is right if you have some hours to kill and feel like a movie star surviving through nuclear waste and a giant alien tentacle while swinging a crowbar at a guy who's shooting you with a machine gun. If this game were more gory changing everything but the level design it could have passed for a Doom game.\n\nMost people praise the game but it's not THE game.

I think that the points which I make are quite fair and there is an equal amount of good ones and bad ones. If you downvote a review just because to you a non recommendation for \"Half Life\" has to be false by default then this keeps it from being seen by people who are unbiased about the game. And those are the people this review is for.\n \nThank you :)\n\nI once wrote a review for \"Half Life\" when I was about 4 hours into the game. Having finished it just now, I'd like to do a new and more appropiate one. This one's gonna be long, so bare with me or move on ;)\n\n\"Half Life\" was released in 1998, way back in the past when Valve still used to make games and I was only 6 years old. Half Life was, as you probably already know, at it's time revolutionary for the fps genre and has since influenced arguably every game, not only fps game, which contained elements of the half life formula.\n But here is the thing: \"Half Life\" did this in 1998. I have played this game 18 years after it's release and this review is for gamers who want to play it after the same amount of time or when even more years have passed.\nTo understand my impression, I want to explain that my fps game experience is quite limited: I have never played \"Counter Strike\". I have never played \"Battlefield\" or \"Call of Duty\" or any \"Wolfenstein\" or \"Quake\". A little bit of \"Unreal Turnament\" when I was little but I can hardly remember that.\nThe only fp shooters that I had played before HL were \"Mirror's Edge\", \"Bioshock Infinite\", \"Portal\" (1&2) and the \"Metro\" games of whom I loved all three. They were atmospheric, had great GREAT stories and good gameplay, each in their own way. \nAnd then I bought all the Half Life games during a sale being curious about the hype and wether it's actually justified.\n\nSo here are the things I liked:\nThe pacing (as long as it wasn't hindered by the controls- more about this later): \nAction packed fight scenes were often broken up by environmental puzzles, platforming passages or simply the search for the corridor which would lead me further. This kept things nicely varied.\nThe level of realism:\nI liked the lack of a compass, of an intrusive quest log leading you to the next level like a child, of a healthbar above enemies and auto generation- all mechanics that got introduced in later games and which I probably wouldn't want to play without for ever, but having such a \"natural\" gameplay was kind of nice for once.\nThe level design:\nThe levels varied a lot in terms of scenery and things like verticality- again more variety which I appreciated. Also no backtracking, which should be selfevident but I feel like it has to be said nonetheless.\nWeapon variety:\nNot only was I equipped with all the killing tools a gamer heart can desire (plus some which one wouldn't even expect), but every weapon did also have it's purpose. I only found myself neglecting the shotgun almost completely which might even have been a mistake. I switched freely between around 14 weapons (beat me if I'm wrong), which raised the interest level along with the other plus points.\n\nAnd here are the things I disliked about Half Life:\nThe controls: \nAs I have said before- I have never played counter strike, so Half Life's controls really felt uncomfortable to me. Here I have to admit: Not expecting to find any major changes in comparison to other fps I skipped the tutorial, which made me get stuck at a point, where I needed to crouchjump in order to progress. So I won't criticize HL for a lack of accessability. \nBut because I played it in 2016 I have to compare it with the controls of the fps which I have already played. And in comparison to those, HL'S controls are, at least to me, very uncomfortable. Because of the walking on jelly or whatever it is I never felt like having full control over Mr. Freeman. It was more like navigating another person through an obstacle course, hoping that he will act your command out just in time so that he doesn't bash against a wall. i know that you can walk and crouch and that the jelly then disappears. I also know that the unresponsive movement is supposed to represent how one can't just stop on the spot coming out of a jogging motion. But there is a reason why later games didn't have this mechanic- neither did System Shock 2 btw which I played for a short time- it doesn't work that great. People commented on my old review that this motion system is very common in modern shooters and named CS as an example without giving another one when I asked for it. Because CS is running on the source engine just like HL one can't really let that get pass as an example. \nMy point is that the movement didn't feel good; it provided an additional challenge which I hadn't asked for and don't consider necessary. Having thought back, I remember that \"Portal\" being built with source aswell, has the same movement scheme- but I never noticed it there because in those two games it doesn't become such a pain in the butt.\nThe story:\nI'm not saying that today's fps stories are better (even though \"Infinite\"'s and \"Metro\"'s were in fact more interesting to me), but they are surely better put into play. What people often praise about \"Half Life\" left me quite desinterested: The story sort of runs beside Freeman- there are no dialogues, no facial animations and no plottwists. You see what happens around you and sometimes people talk to you, but there is no depth. The story is just enough to carry the game through. But I don't consider this to be a huge minus because I don't think that Valve aimed at any monumental story arc and targeted gamers who were more interested into the gameplay rather than character development.\nThe style:\nI consider videogames to be a medium of art which, if it wants to tell a story of any kind, needs a style and graphics good enough to let the player immerse himself into the game. I am no graphic fanatic but at a certain level of muddy textures and bland lighting i can't dive into a universe- except if the story makes up for it; which it doesn't in \"Half Life\".\n\nAs you might have noticed, more or less all of my minus points for \"Half Life\" are due to it's age. And I know that. And I don't say that \"Half Life\" wouldn't have caught me in 1998. But games tend to age far worse than books or movies due to the huge improvements which were made in terms of graphics, gameplay and storytelling during the last 20 years. And because of that, at least to me, \"Half Life\" didn't hold up so good. And I don't like people, who played it at it's release, bashing on the ones who play it today and therefore fail to see what gamers of the 90s saw in it. By the way I CAN see what made it great in the past. It just doesn't make it great anymore.\n\nHere is an example: I love the \"Mass Effect\" trilogy more than any other video game and played \"Mass Effect\" (1) back in 2009 or so. And it was already quite clunky back then but I didn't mind. I had a wonderful experience with it and loved the story aswell as it's universe. But when I recommend it to other people I warn them about it's age and tell them if the game's mechanics are too clunky for them and graphics too dated they might want to start off with part 2. Of course I am happy for everyone who can look beyond it's flaws which came partly with it's time. But I wouldn't condemn anyone who is put off by it's age.\n\nI recommend \"Half Life\" for people who are curious about gaming history and who want to play HL for research more than entertainment. And for those who are not bothered by the critique points which I mentioned.\n\nOther than that: I wouldn't bother and rather wait for HL3 just like everyone else. I am going to dive into HL2 shortly out of couriosity, so maybe this will hook me more:)\n\nThanks a lot for reading, sorry for any grammatical or vocabulary mistakes!","timestamp_created":1468933165,"timestamp_updated":1476994047,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.41564565896987915","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24406516","author":{"steamid":"76561198059955122","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1500634219},"language":"english","review":"Bought the Half-Life Complete bundle .\nPlayed it and finished it .\nOne of the greatest PC games of all time . \nHalf-Life is a part of my childhood.

to find a 2nd hand copy of Half-Life for PS2 instead (i have no idea what is different on THAT version though)\n\nAnother good fact is the save function: you can basicly do it at almost any point in the game, wich means you can also play this game if you gotta do something else in 10 minutes.\n\nAfter you are done slayin Xen, you can try a higher difficulty or go onto the extremely random madness
