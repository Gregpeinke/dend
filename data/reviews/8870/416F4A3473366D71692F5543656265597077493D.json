Oh, what a visual style! Oh, how they twisted the plot! Oh, what an impactful story!\n\nThat is all true, but now after all these years and having replayed the game 3 times, I understand something very important for the understanding of [i]Infinite[/i] and [i]Bioshock[/i] in general. It’s an emotional rollercoaster. In both senses. On the one hand, it masterfully takes you from super-highs to super-lows and back, but on the other it pretty much sells you pre-made, pre-packed, pre-cooked emotions and squeezes them out of you with simplistic narrative contrasts, awe explosions and shock injections.  And that’s impressive but… Cheap.\n\nThere’s no subtlety, no nuance. The only nuanced thing in this game is probably the never-mentioned incestuous subtext, and even that might be something that wasn’t actualized simply because it was considered too obscene to shove in the player’s face.\n\nLet me illustrate my point. The very first hour. Walking across the marvelous city. Celebration. Colorful fair. Bliss. Foreboding, but at the moment – glorious. People relax, eat, drink, chat, enjoy themselves. Then – the raffle, the culmination of the celebration, the singing, the merrymaking. And then – after a small ominous interlude – an atomic explosion of violence: right in the middle of the staring whooping crowd you peel off a man’s face with an industrial appliance. In the next two minutes you will kill two dozen arguably innocent people. I think it’s the most terrifyingly beautiful scene of contrastive violence I have ever seen not just in a game, but in any medium. This first hour and this scene carry the rest of the game on their shoulders. They set the tone in bronze, and this contrast will be repeated time after time. Without this massive Alpha impression it would play as a compelling TV-series rather than a compelling interactive experience.\n\n[i]Infinite[/i] will always remain a landmark of my aesthetic scenery, but I also feel like I’ve been had. It’s beautiful, but it’s also a simple blockbuster. It made me feel for the characters in fantastical circumstances that are hard to relate to without cheap emotion-squeezing.\n\nAnd it also intruded upon the old [i]BioShock[/i] in the DLCs. And that fact completely exposes it as an entertainment-first franchise.","timestamp_created":1602575058,"timestamp_updated":1603434146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616824865341186523","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77485895","author":{"steamid":"76561198853528672","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":364,"last_played":1616419745},"language":"russian","review":"Неплохо, хороший товар.","timestamp_created":1602573614,"timestamp_updated":1602573614,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77485700","author":{"steamid":"76561199083976662","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":239,"last_played":1648225682},"language":"turkish","review":"güzel.\n","timestamp_created":1602573155,"timestamp_updated":1602573155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77485406","author":{"steamid":"76561198868223315","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":527,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1606563224},"language":"russian","review":"Good","timestamp_created":1602572401,"timestamp_updated":1602572401,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77485017","author":{"steamid":"76561198102576309","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":4120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1906,"last_played":1655007009},"language":"english","review":"Good game","timestamp_created":1602571419,"timestamp_updated":1602571419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497417747974395752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77484588","author":{"steamid":"76561198373603639","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":105,"last_played":1533748688},"language":"schinese","review":"补票","timestamp_created":1602570322,"timestamp_updated":1602570322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501210391521453857","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77484177","author":{"steamid":"76561198944773585","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1680,"last_played":1570035091},"language":"english","review":"This the game that got me into Bioshock.

I remember buying Bioshock Infinite release month on my PS3 and loving every moment of it. It was easily one of the best games of 2013 and I'm still really happy to say that it holds up today and is definitely worth playing through. At a sale price this game is a must have. The story is unique enough to keep you fascinated, the chemistry between the characters of Booker and Elizabeth are very well written and the gameplay feels fresh and the most fast paced bioshock game today. The game looks amazing even to todays standards and the world feels lived in.\n\nMy only real drawback or peave from the experience of Bioshock Infinite is the lack of Gun variety to use at once. In Bioshock 1 you can cary 7 weapons and in Bioshock 2 you can cary 6 weapons. Infinite however breaks the weapon wheel trend and instead only allows you to carry two weapons at a time. To some players this wont matter to them but to me its a real annoyance. Yes there are a lot more weapons in Infinite but at least let me cary 5 weapons so there can be more variety in each encounter. I tend to stick with the same weapons as they are the most effective in encounters such as the RPG meaning that a lot of the weapons which are not quite as good, I never really touch. I constantly have to decide whether or not to keep a weapon. Also the Vending machines are pointless in Infinite. No longer do you have to worry about health or shields or salt when Elizabeth just so happens to always have what you need at the right moment. To me this just makes the game a little too easy for my liking. In Bioshock 1 and 2 it really feels like every resource is valuable and all purchases are important. This feeling is not in Infinite. That is my only drawback from the game but it does'nt take away from the brilliant experience that is Bioshock Infinite.","timestamp_created":1602548715,"timestamp_updated":1602548715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77474474","author":{"steamid":"76561198966156203","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":338,"last_played":1602556137},"language":"koreana","review":"지리는 스토리 지리는 액션  지리는 그래픽으로 똥 오줌 설사까지 나오게하는 개 오지게 지리는 게임","timestamp_created":1602547832,"timestamp_updated":1602547832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77472844","author":{"steamid":"76561199059559454","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":209,"last_played":1605754275},"language":"spanish","review":"buena","timestamp_created":1602544572,"timestamp_updated":1602544572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77471496","author":{"steamid":"76561197997031728","num_games_owned":241,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":428,"last_played":1605689672},"language":"english","review":"Good weapon feel.
