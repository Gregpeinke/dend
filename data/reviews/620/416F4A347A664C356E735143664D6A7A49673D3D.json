They made an amazing story that you really get into it; the visuals are simple but stunning (the game is very light for what it looks like, Half-Life 2 engine is superb); there is NO VIOLENCE, the olny guns on the game are of the turrets but you can't see any blood or somthing like that, making it playable by any human beeing in the planet.\nThis is not a game that some people like others not, this is the simple case where the people who played are amezed with it and the people who didn't play don't know what they're missing. Never heard of one single person who played and stoped on the middle of the game, you simply have on your mind that one puzzle you must overcome and you won't rest until it, and this feeling is delightful.
