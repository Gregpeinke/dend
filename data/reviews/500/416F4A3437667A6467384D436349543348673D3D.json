Every chapter can be played at any time, and there's no way to save progress (it seems). Still you will enter the following chapter with health, weapons, etc. from the preceding one if you play them one after the other. If you want to complete a campaign, you'll have to play all of its chapters in a go.\n\nFew weapons and explosives, unlimited ammo for the pistols and few enemy types suggest this will get boring soon.

After hundreds of hours, it all got a bit boring... but now a few years later I'm back on it, and finding it still holds its own against other online MP games of today, and better than even its own sequel.\n\nCampaign mode follows the four survivors as hey battle towards escape, via helicopter, boat, whatever.  It's a lot of fun, especially in co-op with some good mates.  The game is made for speedruns, but manages to slow the pace at various \"event\" spots where you must stand off against hungry hordes of zombies.\n\nThe game comes into its own in versus mode.  Two teams of four take it in turns to play as the survivors, earning points for each % of the level they manage to cross before their doom.  Making it to the end of the level is an intense experience, for one reason - the other team play as the zombies!\n\nPlaying as the special infected requires its own skills, separate to the survivors'.  The attacking team must work together to create mayhem and kill off the humans.  A good team will coordinate attacks the AI couldn't dream of, and in turn the survivors must up their game to defend against the onslaught.\n\nIf you haven't played this game yet, it's not too late.  There are still active servers, and plenty of people to play against, although many of them seem to prefer L4D2 which, to be fair, does have all the levels from this game.\n\nGot three friends?

Technically speaking, there is not much wrong with it. In fact, it's fairly well-made overall. However, the gameplay is so incredibly repetitive. Each of the 6 campaigns is set up in the same way and only lasts about 60-90 minutes. Within 5-10 hours, you will have seen everything the game has to offer (most of it 6 times over already) and all that's left to do is play online multiplayer matches. \n\nOnline matches could have been lots of fun, but, in my experience, the online community is so unwelcoming, immature and hostile. It's much more likely you'll end up fighting with your teammates instead of making friends with them and having a good time together.\n\nSo my recommendation would have been that you only get this game if you already have some friends who are willing to play it with you. It would have been, because again, with the release of L4D2 there is almost no point getting L4D1 anymore. Save your money and only buy L4D2 if you're interested in these games.","timestamp_created":1388079728,"timestamp_updated":1388079728,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.564354836940765381","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8307107","author":{"steamid":"76561198098124721","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5352,"last_played":1458519847},"language":"german","review":":D","timestamp_created":1388079036,"timestamp_updated":1388079036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8306876","author":{"steamid":"76561198056913094","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":712,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":711,"last_played":1388913333},"language":"polish","review":"Zajebiste ! :D","timestamp_created":1388078215,"timestamp_updated":1388078215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8305587","author":{"steamid":"76561198013837852","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":85,"last_played":1388776124},"language":"russian","review":" Left 4 Dead:)","timestamp_created":1388075882,"timestamp_updated":1388075882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8300251","author":{"steamid":"76561198119163700","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":410,"last_played":1445705145},"language":"italian","review":"un gioco davero stupendo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :):):):)","timestamp_created":1388064903,"timestamp_updated":1388064903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8293344","author":{"steamid":"76561198030205428","num_games_owned":482,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48,"last_played":1609697228},"language":"english","review":"a good mindless zombie shooter, nothing else, based on valves source engine, nice to play on small stretches of 20-30 minutes as a stress reliever.","timestamp_created":1388049546,"timestamp_updated":1388049546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8292039","author":{"steamid":"76561198014803606","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":636,"last_played":1527497103},"language":"english","review":"Good group FPS fun.","timestamp_created":1388045723,"timestamp_updated":1606349575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8291983","author":{"steamid":"76561198036220513","num_games_owned":441,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":3063,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2519,"last_played":1434429038},"language":"english","review":"Left 4 Dead is amazing and let me say that this is a classic for me.
