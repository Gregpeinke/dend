This game is... something.\n\nGod, I love this game. It's simply fantastic. Who cares about the cliché'd first person shooter aspects of killing enemies? This is a proper change in formula, and Valve did a pretty damn good job at it. The puzzles are rather fun and sometimes fast-paced, the storyline is intriguing, and GLaDOS is quite the character if I do say so myself. The final boss is of course great. There's spoilers for this, but: There's a timer that you gotta beat her in, you can shoot rockets under GLaDOS to cause the morality cores to pop off her, and you gotta put the cores into the incinerator to beat the final boss. And also, the ending song, Still Alive, is just... marvelous.

They are both examples of what I'd consider, perfect video games. Not just an original idea, not just solid mechanics, not just great story and music and characters, but all of it in one package. Yep, they're gonna get a glowing recommendation from me. In my opinion, everyone should play these games, with the notable exception of people who hate puzzles. Even then, these could be the games that change your mind. \n\nBut lets say you know nothing about video games and haven't heard of Portal. Well, it's a puzzle game set as a first person shooter. That is, you see through the character's eyes. The unique idea behind this game is that you have a portal gun. You fire the gun at one wall and then another, and then a portal will form, connecting the two points, which you can then walk through. Using this simple but ingenious mechanic, the game has designed dozens of clever puzzles for you to solve.\n\nThe story behind the game is that you are a test subject in some bizarre maze-like facility run by a homicidal AI named GLaDOS. Now, despite the cool setting and great gameplay, what really elevates this game is the characters. There's only two, GLaDOS and, in the sequel, Wheatley. But despite the fact that the communication you have with these AI is completely one-sided, they absolutely make the game unforgettable. Their dialogue is movie quality, and funny as hell. In fact, GLaDOS has been voted one of the best video game villains of all time.\n\nI can't think of much else to say, other than buy these games, you won't regret it. 5/5 stars.","timestamp_created":1539556128,"timestamp_updated":1539556128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.757996261119842529","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45270941","author":{"steamid":"76561198310440117","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1539542775},"language":"english","review":"Great game.","timestamp_created":1539542837,"timestamp_updated":1539542837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45270866","author":{"steamid":"76561198072076329","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1657516505},"language":"english","review":"Just beat the main part of the \"story\" and fighting advanced maps now.

there^^ This is my first review so I apologise if it's not the best and I would really appreciate any criticism you have.\n\nMy review, if you couldnt tell, is about portal which is a very good game in my opinion: it's a fun and challenging puzzle game that really intrigues you to carry on and succeed. I shall break my review down into 5 categories: soundtrack, characters, story, graphics and gameplay. There will be slight spoilers but I shall give a warning on each category.\n\n\n\n\nSoundtrack:\n\nI found the soundtrack of portal to be okay, it wasnt the best but it wasnt the worst: I found at times to be stuck in silence at one part of the map which I'm not too sure was intentional or not but it helped create the feeling of loneliness that the protagonist, Chell, must have been going through. However, at other times the music would really pick up and be exciting for example the ...\n\n(spoiler)    betrayal part where GLaDos attempted to burn you and during her fight scene\n\n...at those times you felt the tension rise and make you feel either anxious or scared which I think was very effective. My favourite part of the soundtrack was the credit song \"Still Alive\" . I feel that song was a perfect way to end the game and challenges you went through, it was extremely fitting and you could say emotional due to the lyrics and composition (not to mention a few satire jokes in there which furthered my love for the song).\n\n\n\nCharacters:\n\nIn portal there are 2 main characters, Chell and the computer voice that guides you through the game GLaDos. You could say that Chell is an empty slate of a human being which is okay for the role she plays, her character is meant to be like that so that you, the player, can be your own person and make your own decisions: you're not forced to follow a certain path because thats how the character behaves, we all are Chell and we all made our own decisions. On the other hand, GLaDos is a very characterised entity despite her being a robot. She is very narrow minded at the begging and throws in a few jokes here and there with some witty humour which is quite entertaining, but later we learn....\n\n(spoiler) that she is very manipulative and is only using you which makes her character so much deeper, but it also leaves the question, does she actually have real emotions or is it all in the name of science? several times during the fight you hear her screetch, is it because she is feeling real pain or just trying to manipulate you into stopping? The achievement at the end of her fight is labelled as \"broken hearted\" so is that in the metaphorical sense or the literal? it can be taken as we hurt her emotionally or we physically took her heart core and broke it. In my opinion GLaDOs is a very interesting character and my favourite in the whole game.\n\nThe rest of the characters are emotionless items: such as the turrets and companion cube. The turrets do have voiced lines (which are adorable) but they are unable to feel anything or have any emotion: they have one goal and thats to hurt you. While, the companion cube is just a cube with hearts on it: despite this fact so many of us grew so attached to the beloved  pink cube and adored it. I have to give credit to the game for making me feel empathy to a block. \n\nOverall the characters (despite only being a few) were very memorable and interesting and the voice actors did a great job on all of them.\n\n\n\nStory:\n\nThe story of portal follows a test subject by the name Chell and her attempts to get through the Aperture Science testing chambers with the support and guidance of GLaDos. However, during the testing things start glitching and not everything is what it seems. Through out the game you are promised cake as a reward from our \"friend\" GLaDos and that the tests are to help the world...\n\n(spoilers) but that is far from the truth, there was never any cake: the cake was a lie. instead, she had you complete her experiments and once she was done with you she was going to incinerate you this is where Chell breaks from the mindset of being a meaningless test subject and escapes from the fires. We then control her and try to escape Aperture Science with GLaDOs trying to stop us by continuing to manipulate you. You end the game by completely betraying her by killing her and \"escaping\" the building...... to only be greeted with a voice thanking you and slowly pulling you back into the darkness of aperture science. There are also sub stories like Ratman and his caves and the GLaDos' past but I'll save that for another time.\n\n\nAll in all I found the story of portal to be very interesting and captivating: its simple but very effective. It doesnt bombard you with a lot of back story and facts, its very humble about its characters and slowly builds the world up and the develops the characters in good timing. Despite only being in one building through out the whole game, it does a great job of making it seem so big and open while also having the luring feeling of being trapped and never being able to get out.\n\n\n\nGraphics:\n\nFor a game thats 11 years old its holds up very well, I never once had a problem with any of the graphics. It was stable through out my whole experience and never let me down, there are areas where i feel like the textures arent the nicest but those are the parts that are trying to make you feel uncomfortable and in an abandoned place: so it does a good job of making you feel like that. The game ran very smoothly and I was very impressed. Well done portal and valve.\n\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nFinally, the gameplay: the thing this brilliant game was credited most for. The gameplay of portal is very easy and anyone can do it, forwards, backwards, left, right, crouch, jump and pick items up. Oh and also the ability to launch and use portals. This was such a unique idea at the time and was credited alot, you have two portal you can launch: a blue and orange. When you go through one you appear where the other is placed (very self explanatory) however, you can not launch a portal through an already existing one and it can not be on a moving ground such as an elevator. Due to the originality and amusement, all the tests in portal are to do with the portals (hence the name) the levels get progressively harder and you learn new skills with said portals such as the use of momentum and the ability to get rid of turrets alot faster and in a safer approach.  \n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion I found portal to be a very good game, it had fun and challenging levels and very memorable characters and gameplay. For someone who was waiting many years to play it I can safely say I was not disappointed and  I believe that if you ever get the chance to then you should play this game. It is one of my favourite puzzle games of all time: I can not wait to play the next one. I give it a solid 9/10 .","timestamp_created":1539017337,"timestamp_updated":1543166532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45176154","author":{"steamid":"76561198260327935","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6557,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":2382,"last_played":1659380975},"language":"english","review":"seems neat","timestamp_created":1539013273,"timestamp_updated":1539013273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45176011","author":{"steamid":"76561198819037805","num_games_owned":363,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":126,"last_played":1533880985},"language":"koreana","review":"나만 어렵냐....\n재미는 있으니깐 추천","timestamp_created":1539012680,"timestamp_updated":1539012680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45169922","author":{"steamid":"76561198041990871","num_games_owned":736,"num_reviews":215,"playtime_forever":372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":372,"last_played":1468020941},"language":"english","review":"One of the best puzzle games ever.","timestamp_created":1538978144,"timestamp_updated":1538978144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45169853","author":{"steamid":"76561198077297364","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":101,"playtime_forever":163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":144,"last_played":1573087837},"language":"english","review":"A classic first person adventure in a beautiful laboratory!

Pues miren hay una definicion bastante clara en estos casos se debe a que los seres humanos tenemos miedo a lo desconocido y yo podia sentir lo mismo, no sabia con que exactitud en que mundo estaba, pero bueno hay fuentes sobre eso obviamente, no me quiero extender mas, y si portal no es un juego de terror, pero te vas a sentir algo extraño al jugarlo, en si por mas que esten logrados los robots y sus sentimientos, siguen siendo robots, y nosotros estamos solitarios en este mundo alparecer,\n\n\nEl juego los primeros niveles es facil, y ademas que ya los siguientes niveles son muy intuitivos cuando ya te sabes las normas, la jugabilidad esta bien, de echo el concepto que toman de los portales no lo habia visto antes yo, y pues esta bien, al momento de jugar no note errores o bugs, y lo agradesco, en si es muy divertido solucionar los niveles, una de mis partes favoritas eran cuando aparecian esos robots que te disparaban (No recuerdo sus nombres xd) y los destruias al final del nivel o ponerle un portal detras de las camaras, o por ultimo cuando me encontraba en los accesos del mapa la radio con musica, joder la musica era excelente xD,\n\n\nSobre el diseño de niveles, no puedo decir lo mismo, hasta podria decir que no se complicaron mucho para desarrollar niveles aun mas interesantes, no me mal interpreten me referia a las texturas de los niveles y ambientacion, esa seria mi unica queja sobre los niveles que es que no hay novedad en la ambientacion, cosa que en portal 2 solucionaron en mi parecer, haber que esta el nivel final que esta guapo por lo gigantesco que esta, y la complejidad que es pasarlo, es obvio que va a estar dificil por el jefe final, pero no te va a costar pasarlo creeme,\n\npor cierto otra que destacar son los pocos accesos que hay en los niveles, donde hay notas, basura, y easter eggs, nada mas que destacar, joder cada vez que me metia en esos accesos decia: 'no me va a salir un screamer verdad?',  pero oye los niveles son entretenidos,\n\n\nLa banda sonora, puedo decirte que esta bien, no me voy a meter tanto a ese apartado, ya que yo cada vez que juego quito la musica para no distraerme, puedo decirte que la cancion del los creditos me creo algunos sentimientos encontrados, no he leido la letra, pero siento una nostalgia encontrada en esas melodias,\n\n-Conclusion\n\nEl juego esta bien, te va a entretener por una buenas horas, con una historia si no bastante simple, pero oye almenos es buena, y esta bien logrado lo que quieren transmitir, no te vas a arrepentir de comprarlo, enserio, eso si te lo recomiendo que lo compres en conjunto con su secuela que es portal 2, porque al momento de que lo termines vas a querer jugar el siguiente,\n\nMi calificacion final es un 8.5/10, \n\nesperen la reseña de portal 2 proximamente.","timestamp_created":1538722162,"timestamp_updated":1538737828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45110429","author":{"steamid":"76561198291381052","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1538555695},"language":"english","review":"classical","timestamp_created":1538708936,"timestamp_updated":1538708936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45108188","author":{"steamid":"76561198075135870","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1628420556},"language":"english","review":"best game.

The puzzles are really creative, the dialogue never stops to amuse me and the ending song might be the best one in any video game. The game also has some extra modes with added difficulty levels that indeed can get insanely hard - especially the skill level required in time trials is something incomprehensable to me. Otherwise I would be fine with their existence, but it does irk me that there are some achievements tied to them, so there's literally no way you can complete the game 100 % unless you are into speedrunning strategies. The achievements are also pretty glitchy, so even if you do manage to beat everything you might have to do some poking around to even get Steam to acknowledge your victory.
