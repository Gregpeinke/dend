Well, at least, protagonist wasn't nerdy scientist like in Half-Life 1.\nBlue Shift is the the only HL game, that allows you to play as the real character, even if he is still keeping silence all the time and, in fact, represents flying hands, holding a weapons. How's that? Pretty easy - the story is not about \"save planet\" bullshit anymore, it's about personal safety and it shows us fate of a simple people rather than killing machines. Barney Calhoun is just a security guard and all that he want to is to get alive from this nightmare. That brings global conflict with alien invasion and cruel marines on a more personal level. \nHere Gearbox went even further and made a real plot-driving character, years before Valve and its Half-Life 2. Rosenberg became natural evolution of fat and funny security guard Otis, who was a statist, yeah, but at same time he was charismatic and memorable. Dialogues now are longer and more infromative yet they are still \"you need to do this...\"-like. You can finally feel the tension between HECU and Black Mesa personal and dead bodies of your colleagues become something more than just part of the map. It's awesome how from classic HL1 ingridients you can build much more smart and interesting game. \nWhile in Half-Life 1 maps often were just poorly-designed, Blue Shift makes a bet on small, but detailed locations. There are not many areas under the open sky, but their quality is way higher than quality of the most open HL1 maps put together. Good lighting and amount of unnecessary, but cool feauters create immersive Black Mesa experience. And you should see Xen there! The best portrayal of the border world in series. Maps often look like a circle, so in the end you can find a way to the beginning - another nice thing that shows how thought out maps are.\nGameplay... Well, i've completed this game entirely without getting any damage. Can only say, that there are a lot of action packed in a small amount time needed to finish this addon, and this action is pleasant.\nIn conclusion, Blue Shift is the most polished and well-made game of all Half-Life games on Gldsrc engine.

But to be honest, I think it's not that bad. Sure, it doesn't feature anything very new (compared to opposing force), but it's still enjoyable. Though the \"tunnel\" part in Xen reminds me heavily of the vent-labyrinth in the main Half-life, and is just as annoying. I've heard some people complain about the section where you escort Dr.Rosenberg, but I don't think it's that bad. It's pretty short after all.

While I feel like Opposing Force is overrated and easily my least favorite official HL game, Blue Shift is probably my favorite HL1 expansion. It’s short, and doesn’t add any new enemies or weapons like OpFor does. It doesn’t even use the complete roster of weapons and enemies that HL uses. Honestly, I think that’s to it’s benefit. It doesn’t have as many annoying enemies from HL, such as the Black Ops assassins, or the Alien Controllers, aside from one instance, and it doesn’t have some of the more redundant weapons from HL, such as the Hivehand or the Tripmines, though I believe you can obtain Tripmines in the game. \n\nThe storytelling is a bit more like HL2 in a way where you more directly interact with actual named characters, such as Dr. Rosenberg, instead of the mostly samey looking scientists and security guards in HL. It also has segments that are more like interactive cutscenes where other characters move around doing things while talking to you. This can be seen as either good or bad depending on how much you like that in HL2. \n\nAlso, this game, unlike OpFor, just feels more like a Half-Life game. What do I mean by that? Well I mean that it actually fleshes out more aspects of the original game’s story as opposed to being a self contained story set loosely around the events of the original game that also happens to take place in the same setting. It also serves as a story that explains how Barney managed to escape Black Mesa and meet up with you during HL2. Neat, huh?\n\n(Also, it doesn’t lazily recycle certain areas from the original game like OpFor, and instead lets you explore other parts of the Black Mesa Facility that Gordon never got to visit in HL).\n\nSorry to those who like Opposing Force, but I just don’t enjoy it as much as I did Blue Shift. I agree that it’s too short and doesn’t add much in the way of new content, but it’s just better designed and more fun to play. I’d make a review about Opposing Force instead of bringing it up so much here, but I’d be typing all day and would reach the word limit before I could finish.\n\nThat said, I definitely reccomend Blue Shift, especially to HL fans. It has a good story that actually expands on the story and lore of the original HL, as well as having some pretty cool connections to HL2, almost like Valve were trying to call back to this game when including Barney as a character. It also has a bit better focused weapon sandbox than HL1, and level design that is, for the most part, as good, if not better in some areas, like Xen for instance, than even the original game.","timestamp_created":1564109702,"timestamp_updated":1565558589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489310473203659058","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54295568","author":{"steamid":"76561198840016961","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1564099671},"language":"english","review":"If you liked the original [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/] Half-Life[/url], you'll like this.

The base game is too long, too much save-scumming bad platforming segments, cheap enemy spawns, Opposing Forces is a sweet middle spot with a short but sweet campaign that gives you what the OG had to offer but with less BS and less focus on the obnoxious platforming, then there's Blue Shift... this would be the \"too cold\" porridge, the \"too soft\" bed.\n\nThe other reviews really aren't lying when they say that this game is balls short. I feel like the other reviews didn't emphasize how insanely easy this one is though. I played the OG Half-Life on hard, which is what I normally do with other games (unless a game has like, 5 difficulty modes and the hardest one is named something like \"Legendary Nightmare Cancer\", then I'll do the second highest), but in OG Half-Life, with the enemy spawns right behind you constantly and non-stop insta-death platforming, I had my a*s split like that time I spent the night at Bill Cosby's. So, I played through Opposing Forces on Normal and had a nice enough time. I did the same on Blue Shift and was practically falling asleep. I just use my strongest weapon and run out like Leeroy Jenkins in every encounter, then I'm rewarded with more med-packs than I've ever seen in any game ever. No lie, they give you about 20 for every 1/2 you need.\n\nThen there's some obnoxiously slow segments, like when you're escorting one scientist past 8 areas you've already cleared out, and he stops every 2 inches to complain about his asthma or the heat. Dammit, Rosenberg. Then there's a crawling maze section on an alien planet that take's up about 20% of the total playthrough. \n\nMan. If I didn't practically get this game for $.20 in a pack along with the rest of the Half-Life series, I'd feel ripped off. If this game wasn't so short, I wouldn't have finished it. Word to the wise: Play through the OG Half-Life on normal ONLY if you really care about the backstory of Black Mesa and Freeman, play through Opposing Forces only if you want to see what the OG gameplay was like and want a nice enough time, skip to Half-Life 2 if you don't care about any of that, and do NOT waste your time with this one.","timestamp_created":1563867691,"timestamp_updated":1563867711,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493975907564163208","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54231928","author":{"steamid":"76561198148850465","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":522,"last_played":1563820197},"language":"english","review":"Just Buy It !","timestamp_created":1563820281,"timestamp_updated":1563820281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54206978","author":{"steamid":"76561198904806596","num_games_owned":487,"num_reviews":111,"playtime_forever":322,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":322,"last_played":1563689642},"language":"schinese","review":"这一代就只有剧情模式了，比较纯粹，这一部说的是黑山基地的一个保安巴尼的故事，与弗里曼不同的是，主角只需要完成自己作为保安的职责，就是保护科学家并把他们安全送出基地。","timestamp_created":1563692410,"timestamp_updated":1563692410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528773188591003418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54200826","author":{"steamid":"76561198426393881","num_games_owned":332,"num_reviews":167,"playtime_forever":198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1543170071},"language":"english","review":"Most underappreciated Half-Life game ever.

Po základnom nastavení tejto hry som sa pustil do trainingu. Ten je veľmi odfláknutý, pretože je takmer taký istý ako ten v Half-Life. Blue Shift by som ani nenazval hrou samotnou ale skôr takým DLC, pretože má málo nového obsahu. Avšak príbeh, kde hráte za jedného z členu security je docela zaujímavý. Je to jeden z bežných dňoch v Black Mese až pokým sa nestane niečo veľké. Vašim cieľom sa onedlho stane záchrana ako seba samého, tak aj vedcov. Príbeh končí šťastne a pre mňa je to veľké plus, pretože to sa nedá až tak povedať aj pre Half-Life. V hre je oveľa menej zbraní a aj nepriateľov čo je dosť horšie zase v porovnaní z H-L.

In this expansion, you are not in the shoes of Gordon Freeman, but instead you're controlling Barney Calhoun, a security guard at the Black Mesa Research Facility that would later appear as a major NPC in Half-Life 2. He prepares to head off for his usual task when suddenly the resonance cascade from the original game occurs, and the elevator that he was in crashes. He wakes up a little later, now with the goal of trying to escape the facility with as many scientists as he can take with him (spoilers: only three.)\nThe gameplay isn't too different from the game it's based off of, with the most major difference being the view arms and the smaller selection of weapons to use. The combat is pretty good for its era, and there's quite a bit of puzzles to solve, and they're usually not too obtuse to the extent that you need to extensively rely on a walkthrough. I used one a few times, but that's largely due to my own fault more than anything.\nWith that said, the game can be frustrating at times due to the more limited amount of health resupplies compared to the original, not helped by the fact that Barney is unable to use the HEV charge stations to gain armor point-thingies. The AI hasn't aged all that well and that's can be very obvious with some of the friendly characters. \nThe game is also very short compared to the original game and Opposing Force, which is a review for another time, and whether this is good or bad depends on your point of view. I played the game on easy, and even with several deaths, it only took my about two hours to beat.\nFor those who care more for story, this expansion provides the least amount of it compared to Opposing Force, let alone the original game. Again, whether or not this is a good thing is subjective. The only bearing it has on later entries in the Half-Life series is the fact that, as mentioned before, Barney returns as an NPC in Half-Life 2 and the episodes.\nOverall, I give this game a 7/10.

Ao contrário de Opposing Force, Blue Shift não oferece nenhum modo multiplayer, e também é uma expansão independente, não necessitando de Half-Life.\nNele, o jogador assume o controle de um segurança da Black Mesa, Barney Calhoun. Os inimigos são os mesmos de Half-Life, porém a expansão conta com algumas armas diferentes. O jogo também tem uma duração menor que o original.
