I couldn't believe it was quite this good. I chuckled in muddled disbelief, expectations utterly defied. My nervous fingers reloaded the level, knowing that I had to see that breathtaking sequence one more time. It was then that I knew for certain: Valve had surpassed not only themselves, but everyone else too. Half-Life 2 is an astounding accomplishment. It is the definitive statement of the last five years of first-person shooters. Everything else was just a stopgap.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a near perfect sequel. It takes almost everything that worked from Half-Life and either improves on it, or keeps it much the same. But that simple summation undersells how the Valve team have approached this task. Half-Life 2 is a linear shooter with most of the refinements one would expect from years of work, but it is also a game of a higher order of magnitude than any of the previous pretenders to the throne. The polish and the stratospheric height of the production values mean that Half-Life 2 is a magnificent, dramatic experience that has few peers.\n\nIt would be madness for me to spoil this game by talking about the specific turn of events, so spoilers are going to be kept to a minimum. We're going to talk about general processes and the elements of style and design that make Half-Life 2 such an energising experience. Key to this is the way in which Gordon's tale is told. Once again we never leave his perspective. There are no cutscenes, no moment in which you are anything but utterly embedded in Gordon's view of the world. Everything is told through his eyes. And what a story it is. Gordon arrives at the central station at City 17—a disruptive and chilling dystopia. And from there? Well, that would be telling. This is not the contemporary America that Gordon seemed to be living in during the original Half-Life. The events of Black Mesa have affected the whole world. The crossover with Xen has meant that things have altered radically, with hyper-technology existing alongside eastern bloc dereliction.","timestamp_created":1415183708,"timestamp_updated":1415183708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12797238","author":{"steamid":"76561198089066108","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":3730,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1304,"last_played":1610917242},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever made.","timestamp_created":1415158511,"timestamp_updated":1415158511,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12796735","author":{"steamid":"76561198061100612","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":5128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2873,"last_played":1580078230},"language":"english","review":"Worst Call Of Duty knock-off ever. 10/10 crowbars.","timestamp_created":1415155180,"timestamp_updated":1415155180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12796605","author":{"steamid":"76561198119378076","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":763,"last_played":1406320864},"language":"english","review":"Fun to play a good 15 hour game and forever a classic","timestamp_created":1415154262,"timestamp_updated":1437600488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12796077","author":{"steamid":"76561198089784525","num_games_owned":758,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":892,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":892,"last_played":1414818655},"language":"koreana","review":"중력건이라는 게임의 물리엔진을 가지고 놀 수 있는 요소와 하나로 이어진 듯한 구성이 좋았다. 이런 점은 요즘 게임에서도 보기 힘들다. 하지만 나온지 10년이나 된 게임이다보니 다른 부분에선 옛날 게임의 기분이 나는건 사실이다. 피어를 하고 나서 하다보니 콤바인의 인공지능이 좀 부족하게 느껴졌고 전투가 그리 재밌는 편은 아니었다. 또 로딩이 좀...","timestamp_created":1415150628,"timestamp_updated":1415150628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.642513513565063477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12793222","author":{"steamid":"76561198121189551","num_games_owned":1131,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":615,"last_played":1651095975},"language":"russian","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1415136190,"timestamp_updated":1415136190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518644392490386963","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12791322","author":{"steamid":"76561198008469842","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6575,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6575,"last_played":1383664364},"language":"english","review":"HL2. The game that got me gaming :) Once upon a time many dark moons ago I didn't own any games. Instead I played free demos. I did this for about a year. And one demo I played about 60 times was Half Life 2. We don't go to Ravenholm so it is said. But I did. I practically lived in bloody Ravenholm. \n\nAnd lets face it - the rent is cheap there. The zombies drove the prices way down. No more yuppies just one bizarre preacher with amazing shotgun skills. Sure there's a lot of blood and headcrabs and killer traps and weird noises... but nowhere is perfect right? \n\nOut of all the demos this one was the most visceral, interesting, scary, intense and fun one to play. But I needed to know what came before - and what happens after, the amazing Ravenholm section. \n\nSo I bought HL2. Got into gaming. I think this is about 6 years back. And learned that HL2 is indeed an epic story and gameplay experience. The amazing thing is, I still get a rush - a brain rush - when I load it up again. Because I know I'm going to experience an entire gamut of locations, combat, feelings, enemies, friends, and puzzles, (And don't listen to Duke Nukem who said - \"I hate valve puzzles\" - fuck you big guy you don't have the mind-set :)\n\nI love how varied the game is from start to finish, including the two Episodes that come after HL2. It's a treat. It still looks Ok. It runs perfectly. I've never experienced a bug. And getting a chievo for getting through the Ravenholm section using only a crowbar and gravity gun, felt like full circle for me. Goddamn zombies I'm back - and I'm badass. \n\nMy review isn't about plot. It's about something deeper, that I can't put into words because I don't have that ability. If you don't have this game, pick it up. And sink your brain and time into it. Let it build.

Primero y para comenzar, esta aventura en primera persona, sigue la historia 20 años después aproximadamente de la primera entrega. De manera lineal, interesante e ingeniosa.\n\nSu jugablidad cabe destacar que es impresionante. Tanto su faceta mecánica e interactiva presenta una calidad de eficiencia excelente, haciendo cumplir en su totalidad todos los aspectos que promete.\n\nTiene un aspecto gráfico deslumbrante y avanzado para la época, utilizando una tecnología superior para el año en que salió y para años posteriores a su salida. La inteligencia artificial de los jugadores presenta mucho realismo tanto en el aspecto facial como el corporal. Todo esto debido gracias a la genialidad del motor gráfico Source.\n\nEn el apartado sonoro goza de un gran nivel, no así como el doblaje que sigue siendo tan pobre como Valve nos tiene acostumbrados.\n\nLa trama que desarrolla el juego da a conocer un guión totalmente diferente en comparación con su predecesora. En resumen, Half-Life 2 es más que un excelente juego.

Ironic, given the fact that this game has been heralded as the savior of computer games. The ultimate, next-generation, first person shooting game that will finally show off how far we have come in these last few years.\n\nLooking at the reviews, you’d think it had delivered in spades. \n\nUnfortunately every single reviewer has felt the need to give this game as many accolades as possible. At this stage I’m convinced that every single one of those reviewers is severely mentally retarded. I just cant see how anyone could possibly derive any kind of real enjoyment from this game seeing as how it’s identical in every way to every single first person shooter ever produced before it. \n\nI don’t want to drag this out for too long so let me just say that the game has been sold on a foundation of deceit, lies and fancy marketing.\n\nHaving completed the game long ago, I quit the application (as the final credits rolled) and slumped back in my chair absolutely sickened. Questions had arisen and they needed immediate answering.\n\n“Had I gotten some defective, retarded version of the game?”\n\n“Where was the enemy AI that was allegedly so ****-hot it could get inside my brain and psycho-analyze me and know my every move before I did?”\n\n“Where was the physics engine that was to make every single thing in the game destructible, opening up a whole new world of gaming?” \n\n“Where was the virtual world where everything I did had an effect on everything else, and my every action would influence the game in a magical and unique way?”\n\nThe Enemy AI\nEither I am the perfect killer and assassin and an intellectual marvel… or else the AI is pretty damn stupid. The game itself admits this halfway through, when it broadcasts the message telling the guards that if they can’t deal with one puny physicist in an orange suit, then they are officially retarded. If Valve knew that the AI was bad then why didn’t they patch it up a little rather then making lame in-jokes?\n\nBy the end of the first couple of levels I had accounted for approximately 200 enemy soldiers. Granted they didn’t have the luxury of respawning and trying again lots of times like I did (although I rarely had to make use of this luxury), but even so that’s a pretty respectable body count considering my character is an untrained physicist armed with a crowbar.\n\nNope… all the poor guards can do within the pathetic confines of their AI is stand around in two’s and three’s and wait for me to kill them. That is their sole reason for existing as far as I could see. The Gordon Freeman character progresses linearly through the game, killing these mindless drones in order of appearance and conveniently re-spawning Groundhog Day-style whenever he does finally succumb to the guard’s gunfire. It’s pretty pathetic really. \n\nIn the promotional clips that were released some months before the game came out, the developers tried to illustrate the intelligence of the enemies. I witnessed an enemy soldier (who was attempting to locate the player) check a door which was barricaded, then attempt to shoot though the door and the barricade, before giving up and throwing a grenade in through the window. Apparently, the enemy had carried out just one on of many possible responses to the situation, and the game would surprise and delight the player every time it was played.\n\nThe enemy never once employed any semblance of intelligence to take me down at any stage throughout the game. I even went out of my way to recreate the bit from the promotional clip… to no avail.\n\nOh sure, guards shoot from behind walls sometimes and occasionally throw a grenade my way, but they ALWAYS inevitably ended up charging headlong into my waiting machine guns….\n\nWhich is an admirably brave decision to make it has to be said, but one which gets very old after a couple of hours of it from a players point of view.\n\nThey are pretty retarded given that that game loads up in a sequential series of small chunks, so it’s not like they have a huge world to interact with or anything. They basically have enough AI to maneuver them around whatever small room or arena they happen to be placed. It becomes boring and repetitive after just the first five minutes.\n\nThat leads me onto the levels and the level design. Am I the only one who sees a problem with a game that promises plenty of freedom of expression and delivers a severely linear series of small area’s where the goal in each one is simply to move through each one to the other side?? How many times can a person kill a handful of soldiers and open a switch over and over again before it becomes mind numbing??\n\nThe striders are quiet impressive when they first appear in the game. I had envisioned epic running battles with them through the streets of city 17 with fully destructible scenery splintering all around me as they stalked me with their huge laser weapons… and then I confronted them and my hopes were dashed. The ****ing things follow the same path around and around and around in a circle, regardless of what the player does. Sometimes they bend down… I’m not 100% sure why but it didn’t make them any tougher to kill. Nor did the generous helping of rockets and conveniently placed discarded rocket launchers. \n\nIt’s the age-old problem, which was epitomized in the Deus Ex games. Basically if you are confronted with three locked doors in the game then searching nearby crates and bins will yield three lock picks. Possibly some power armour, nano upgrades and ammunition. Realism and believability comes a poor second to lazy programming.\n\nI could almost have played Half Life 2 blindfolded. When you reach a mounted machine gun you know its going to trigger a little wave of attackers for you to shoot down, because that’s what every other game before it has done.\n\nI’ve seen it all before. We all have.\n\nIs this what every games reviewer in the world is ****ting their pants over? Was this why I waited for two hours online for my game to “unlock”? Can’t people see that we’re just playing the same game over and over again? Medal of Honour, Call of Duty, Half Life… the only difference is the cover of the games box. Linear series of small arena’s interrupted by cut sequences.\n\nThe Physics Engine\nSupposedly a major feature of the game, the physics promised completely destructible environments and realistic materials. Oh and buoyancy. I can’t tell you how much my gaming experience was improved at the sight of a floating barrel.\n\nThe only things destructible in the game are small things made of wood. Strangely though, not every kind of wood is destructible. Only crates and specific kinds of chairs and tables break apart when shot or hit, anything bigger then that is only destroyed at very specific, scripted points in the very weak threadbare plot.\n\nWhich means that “Congratulations Valve, the physics are on par with every other game that’s come out in the last six years!” Way to go. Truly a milestone in gaming.\n\nI hate the gravity gun too. \n\nIt’s a pointless weapon, blatantly thrown in to get people to stack boxes and look at the realistic way they fall over when pushed. Look Valve, if I want to stack boxes then I’ll get a ****ing job stacking boxes and at least get a minimum wage for my efforts. I don’t need to sit down in front of a terrible game for hours and pretend to in the hopes that you’ve hidden some enjoyment in there somewhere for me to find.\nIts pathetic to see the lengths the programmers will go to get people to “interact” with the environment. Every time I turn a corner in the game there is a pile of precariously stacked boxes and barrels just waiting to be toppled over and justify the hours spent coding the physics for the game. Is that what “the environment” is?? Stacked boxes??\n [More info  in comments]","timestamp_created":1414714953,"timestamp_updated":1414715997,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":97,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533544778823852539","comment_count":29,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12700734","author":{"steamid":"76561198062860920","num_games_owned":440,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1714,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":564,"last_played":1657745715},"language":"russian","review":"Я купил Вторую Халфу буквально 4 месяца назад, потому что стоны о третьей меня заинтриговали и я захотел понять что там такое.

Very small areas, you are never 10 metres away from a loading zone. The weapons lack any realism, feel completely boring to use and overall are to overpowered in the later segments. Using the gravity gun for a portion of the game was a nice diversion for using the source physics engine, but felt a little too watered down.\n\nGraphics: This is a 14 year old game, but the graphics have aged terribly, the textures look overly pixelated and there is 10 tinges of grey used for everything. At the time the graphics were seen as more advanced however.\n\n*SPOILER ALERT!* \n\nStory: A very cliche, predictable plot, which is essentially every zombie movie ever. Zombies takke over dystopian society with corrupt government, rebels trying to fight and regroup. Very predictable\n\nCharacters: I think valve have caught onto the fact that if you give a character no character, the audience take to the mysteries and he then has more character. Also you can be lazy in this and not program any noise for the main character. All the other characters were too cliche. Alex is a rebelious teen, She has a loving father who she can no longer see. Kleiner is a stereotypical science nerd with many inventions. Most of the other characters stay to their respective stereotypes.\n\nOverall i think this is just a regular fps, which for some reason made some people hail it as THE GREATEST GAME EVER MADE. A title it obviously doesn't deserve. At its release it had good graphics and somewhat innovative gameplay in the fps genre. It hasn't aged like a fine wine, it has aged like bottled tapwater. If you want the greatest fps ever created, play Goldeneye 007 for n64, or get it on a emulator. Valve  has alot of catching up to do if they want to make half life 3 any where near as good as modern games. \n\nScore: 562/1000","timestamp_created":1414665041,"timestamp_updated":1414665041,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.319043129682540894","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xu6msMkCec21MA=="}
