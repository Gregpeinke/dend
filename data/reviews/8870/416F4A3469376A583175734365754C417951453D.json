Weapon choices are limit and ammo is VERY limited. Gears (basically armor) are almost a non-factor in the game. Fights get frustrating because you are going to run out of ammo and have to beg your companion to magically summon ammo and toss you some because that is literally all that she does.\n\nThe story is great with twists and turns. However, there were parts in the game where you had choices to make and it felt as it never really matter what to you picked.\n\nI would recommend this game for the atmosphere, color, and sound that this game has.

The game also encourages you to use different weapons not always just handing you the ammunition you need but ammunition for guns you don't currently have equipped as well (you can only have 2 weapons equipped at a time).\n\nThe arenas where also really good with a lot of verticality and plenty resources scattered around. Enemies will run around a bit and use some parts of their surroundings like the skylines (big rails in (you guessed it) the sky that are used for transport) but other than that nothing special.\n\nThe enemy lineup was solid but nothing amazing, the only one that stood out was the handyman who basically countered every tactic I used which required me to actually use my brain and scared the sh*t out of me by doing so, but it was really fun.     \n\nThe weapons were varied and most of them were fun and made you play the game slightly differently, my favourites were the shotgun and sniper rifle. No weapon was really underpowered either so you choose based on what you like.\n\nThe vigors (superpowers?) were also varied and I found myself using the absolute majority of them in combat because they were very well balanced here as well and the different enviroments and enemy types made you switch between them quite often.\n\nBut the thing that makes the combat so good is the skyhook, using it to zip around the arenas on skylines just makes the combat so much better because it gets so much faster and allows for arenas to be bigger and more vertical. \nSome enemies will also follow you on the joyride which makes small stops to regain your shield or just chill out a bit really frantic.\nThis is the reason the combat kept me hooked (pun intended) throughout and it furthermore separates the game from the slew of military shooters on the market.\n\nSo check it out, you will (probably) enjoy it.\n","timestamp_created":1562001433,"timestamp_updated":1562001433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52930304","author":{"steamid":"76561198427143882","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1262,"last_played":1576181755},"language":"english","review":"This game has an amazing story.
