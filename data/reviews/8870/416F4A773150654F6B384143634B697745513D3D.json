From the visuals to the gameplay to the twists and turns of its narrative, \"BioShock Infinite\" stands out like a beacon in a sea of bland, unvaried first-person shooter games. It is a perfect example of style trumping realism, showing that a vibrant, colorful, artfully crafted world is infinitely more engaging than a desaturated one based on our own reality. The combat is fun, punchy, and becomes an acrobatic delight when Columbia's Sky-Line rail systems are incorporated into the mix. And no recommendation would be complete without mentioning Elizabeth Comstock, one of the best companions to the player video games have ever seen. A superb character in her own right, she also succeeds at never being a hindrance to gameplay, always managing to take care of herself in the heat of battle and helping out the player when she can. All of these elements together make \"BioShock Infinite\" an incredible experience that no fan of shooters (or video games, for that matter) should miss.","timestamp_created":1375724015,"timestamp_updated":1385413199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497287511825561523","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"592277","author":{"steamid":"76561197972572380","num_games_owned":661,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":2311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":927,"last_played":1409597549},"language":"english","review":"The story is revealed at a tantalising pace; the action enthralls you and credits your ability; the art is fantastic in scope and imagination; and the supporting protagonist, Elizabeth, is a grand example of how such characters should be designed for games.\n\nIt has its flaws, but they are minor points that occur to you long after you've feverishly worked the game to completion.","timestamp_created":1375713138,"timestamp_updated":1375713138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5162644","author":{"steamid":"76561198045809469","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1136,"last_played":1377290180},"language":"english","review":"Oh my god this is a good game.","timestamp_created":1375700102,"timestamp_updated":1375700102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"331472","author":{"steamid":"76561197968815699","num_games_owned":334,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":865,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":799,"last_played":1405903848},"language":"english","review":"This game...

For the most part, Bioshock Infinite follows the mold that the previous Bioshock games have made for themselves, with a few of its own additions.\n\nBioshock Infinite takes a different route than the previous games, no longer are we in the underwater civilization of Rapture, but rather we go to the flying utopia known as Columbia. Columbia offeres brand new experiences, characters, and gameplay elements that the previous Bioshocks did not. Lets jump into everything Irrational Games did right in previous titles and continues on into Bioshock Infinite.\n\nWhat would a Bioshock game be without plastids ? In Bioshock Infinite we are given 8 base plastids or \"vigors\" as they are know to toy around with that we can access at any time once they are unlocked. With these base 8 vigors by themselves, but we are now able to combine vigors with one another to causing chaos among the enemys we encounter. Although plastids or \"vigors\" are very iconic weapons amoung Bioshock games, we also have choices among an assortment of weapons to use on our journey aswell.\n\nThe weapon system is completely different from previous Bioshock titles. Before once we came across a new weapon we were allowed to keep the weapon across our entire playthrough of the game; we just had to worry about ammunition. In Bioshock Infinite we are limited to only 2 weapons at a time, instead of a walking armory. Another aspect of the previous Bioshock titles that was removed was the ammunition types such as Armor-Piercing, Antipersonnel, etc. This removal of ammo types as well as the ability to carry numerous weapons at once might actually make the game that much more challenging depending on one's persepective. You may have two weapons you like, but are running out of ammo for one of them, with no Dollar Bill Vending Machines in sight. But you may come across a newer weapon that you might not have used before, this weapon could be either very useful in the upcoming firefight or cause more of a challenge.\n\nAfter taking a look at all the combat aspects involved with Bioshock Infinite, what about Columbia itself ? When we were running through the ruins of the underwater civilization of Rapture, we had a sense of what was once a thriving independent civilization. Whereas in Columbia we see firsthand what this utopia in the sky is. We see the civilization of Columbia come to life before our very eyes through the various interaction that are made between citizens as well as the interactions the player has with their new counterpart, Elizabeth. The experience becoomes that much more \"real\" the more we play through the game and observe how Elizabeth or the civilians of Columbia react to what is going on.\n\nIn the end, when it all comes together as a final product, Bioshock Infinite is one of my favorite games, if not my favorite, that I have ever played. For me, the experience felt like no other. I highly recommend this game to anyone whether or not you have played the previous Bioshock titles or not. The experience that this game can invoke is nothing short of Infinite.","timestamp_created":1375598770,"timestamp_updated":1389947116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7024263","author":{"steamid":"76561198083074967","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":514,"last_played":1451202576},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor jogo que eu já joguei até hoje.

Other games that have an npc companion tends to have the npc 'stuck', or blocking you or even Die suddenly.. so in this game she functions pretty well. I like that she's vulnerable but at the same time i dont have to worry about her dying in battle. awesome story.. even after finishing the game, and  you know how it goes, somehow i could just replay it. The atmosphere is there, I feel I'm really immersed in the game and the character's inner conflict. They play out your emotions really well and it actually counts on people to make decisions based on moral choices. Not that these choices have a big impact on the Story, but after you've finished it, you'll understand WHY you made those choices...\n\nhonestly one of the few games with linear story that i could actually replay.. the other is Dishonored. any other games, it's just 1 time playthrough including skyrim!\n\nHighly recommended if you're into the Story, because at the end of it, I really wish that Elizabeth was actually real. There are probably other better shooters out there in terms of fighting/shooting eg. Dishonored/BF/COD so if you're into that, this is not really for you. I can't stress enough on the awesomeness of the story and it's really sad that the developers have parted ways, so highly unlikely there will be a sequel (though even if there's one, it's not going to be directed by Ken Levine and the team that produced this game).","timestamp_created":1375552005,"timestamp_updated":1398957442,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1535864","author":{"steamid":"76561197994368241","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":532,"last_played":1446478228},"language":"spanish","review":"Una obra maestra","timestamp_created":1375545583,"timestamp_updated":1375545583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7050186","author":{"steamid":"76561198084079897","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":5641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2394,"last_played":1630618749},"language":"russian","review":"Красивая игра с очень интересным сюжетом.","timestamp_created":1375534384,"timestamp_updated":1375534384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"969929","author":{"steamid":"76561197983316107","num_games_owned":247,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1145,"last_played":1375487721},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy malo,\n\nOtro capítulo de una saga sobrevalorada que no aporta absolutamente nada.","timestamp_created":1375524467,"timestamp_updated":1493588561,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4956179","author":{"steamid":"76561198043736138","num_games_owned":298,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":11351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2407,"last_played":1461734640},"language":"french","review":"Un jeu juste magnifique, autant pour ce graphisme phénoménal que pour son gameplay magistral, sa bande-son juste parfaite et son scénario incroyable, bien plus qu'un jeu Bioshock Infinite est une oeuvre d'art, une oeuvre d'art à posséder dans sa bibliothèque steam.\nBest Game Ever <3","timestamp_created":1375511309,"timestamp_updated":1375511309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"429008","author":{"steamid":"76561197970558615","num_games_owned":3006,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":77,"last_played":1624497947},"language":"english","review":"Simply beautiful and amazing, great atmosphere and incredible world.\n\n","timestamp_created":1375504070,"timestamp_updated":1375504070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5820530","author":{"steamid":"76561198055340417","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":508,"last_played":1365404400},"language":"english","review":"If you want a game that has a darn fine story to it, then look no further than Bioshock Infinite.

Из поднебесья он вырывается к таким высоким материям, что уже и конкретное что-то говорить не хочет — одни чувства и абстракции. Кен Левин на время становится игровым Терренсом Маликом и старается сказать нам что-то очень важное, но словами это сделать не может, как не может Терренс Малик или кто угодно еще. Потому что иногда слова — слишком слабая форма выражения. Зато чувство можно транслировать, эмоционально привязав игрока к виртуальной 19-летней девушке, умеющей разламывать пространство и время. Кен Левин делает это для того, чтобы история сработала на игрока должным образом, чтобы мы прочувствовали ее насквозь, чтобы мы стали Букером Девиттом хотя бы на секунду, и испытали те эмоции, которые должен был бы испытать он. И все это Левин делает в том числе с помощью игровых механик. Такого совмещения игрока с персонажем до этого не было, пожалуй, нигде. BioShock Infinite поднимает игры как средство самовыражения на новую ступень: это глубокая, умная игра и настоящее произведение. И только то, что вместо названия студии-разработчика мы говорим «Кен Левин», свидетельствует о многом. Еще не играли в последнего Левина?

Unfortunatley it has traded the things that made Bioshock 1 and 2 so memorable for a more casual and simplified experince. The exploration has been pretty much cut out entirely, no more scavenging around for ammo to help you survive whatever was round the corner and with you only being able to carry 2 guns at a time (not to mention the amount of plasmids now called vigors have been cut, which cannot be upgraded) the diversification of each situation is dramatically cut. Gene tonics are gone. Hacking is cut. Multiple ammo types are gone. Rivaliing enemys gone (e.g big daddys against splicers).  Health and Eve kits are gone. Researching is gone. All resources in the previous games have now been boiled down to money and lockpicks. Infact so much has been cut of of Bioshock Infinite since System Shock 2 that it no longer feels part of the sereis. \n\nThe gameplay has been overly simplified aswell. In the previous games there were so many options depending on your items, your plasmids and your play style. But now in Infinite all it feels like is another modern FPS shooter with some super powers thrown in for good measure. Electryfying a pool of water to shock your enemys? Setting fire to a trail of oil or hacking some security turrets to help you with a horde of splicers? You can kiss that goodbye, in Infinite combat boils down to point and shoot. The weapons in Bioshock Infinite are seriously lack luster aswell, they all just feel like standard run of the mill weapons, you can only hold 2 weapons at a time, so when you upgrade your weapon you may have to chuck it for a crappy one when it runs out of ammo an just hope you can pick your old one back up again soon. The death system is also badly implemented, much like the vita chambers in all the shock games, except in Infinite it will take money from you each death. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if the game would let you have multiple saves or to be able to go back a section if you felt you wanted to redo it, but since you can't if you run out of money your kinda screwed for a large part of the game. Overall Bioshock Infinite falls flat on its face before its predecessors failing to acompish what it has done oh so many times before.\n\nAs for the story, which seems to be the part getting the most attention, I didn't care for it. Without spoiling much, when a plot involves time travel and alternate universes it just has to many holes for me to take it seriously. Its a paradox that some people will just plain out ignore. The ending of the game is undebateably terrible, making you walk around for 20 miniutes listening to narration and not actually doing anything. As for Elizabeth I really enjoyed her company when she first joins up with you, but after a while you realise she's kinda just there to throw you a health kit or some money when your really low on whatever, further simplfying the game. To be honest around 2/3s of the game I stopped caring about her entirely and do not know were so much of the praise around her comes from, she really is just another NPC in a game she won't help you fight enemys or anything like that. But at least you never have to escort her an she doesn't burden you as much as she just follows you around.\n\nThe sky city of Columbia is the setting of the game, as you might imagine its not the nicest place on earth. There is racism, segregation, political propaganda, dictatorism, but heres the problem with these things being in Bioshock, they are not used as means to discuss what is wrong with these things or the consequences of having these things in your society, theres no discussion of were these things come from or the cost it has on humanity. Alot of the time it feels like the game is preaching to you with no real message behind any of the imagery. \"Racism is bad guys\" an it will leave it at that. \n\nNo 10/10 and positive reviews will change the glaring problems of this game. I think I would of enjoyed this game more maybe if I wasn't such a big fan of 1 and 2 but to many things have been cut out for me to enjoy this. I'm not saying that change is a bad thing or that I'm rejecting original ideas in a sequel to a game, what I'm saying is bioshock doesn't do these things at all. It made bad replacements of everything that was good in the first games or plain torn them out. Bioshock 1 and 2 had problems aswell such as bullet spongey enemys but the majority of problems have stayed in Infinite and the mojority of good things have been taken out. Overall I will stick with the predecessors of the shock series and probably be avoiding the next ones.","timestamp_created":1375199340,"timestamp_updated":1388445876,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472972989082336426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3549909","author":{"steamid":"76561198024559792","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2845,"last_played":1404503761},"language":"english","review":"Good gameplay!

Si has jugado a los anteriores BioShock, sabrás que la historia es un punto completamente a favor del juego. La historia de BioShock 1 era levemente enrevesada, pero se podía seguir más o menos bien. La historia de BioShock 2 era algo más sencilla, pero igualmente muy trabajada. Pero en BioShock Infinite... me ha costado demasiado seguir la historia. Hay varias cosas que he ido pillando, por supuesto. Pero, cuando llegué al final del juego, las cosas que creía haber entendido se descolocaron un poco. Obviamente, supongo que jugándolo de nuevo entenderé mejor los acontecimientos (al igual que me pasó con el 1 y el 2). Pero creo que se entienden demasiadas pocas cosas la 1ª vez que se juega.\nDuración: me ha llevado 14 horas de juego en Difícil. Y soy de esos a los que les gusta explorar bien los mapas y encontrar tantas cosas como sea posible.\n¿Recomendación? Si has jugado a los 2 BioShock anteriores y te gustaron, no veo razones para que no te vaya a gustar éste. Aunque tampoco es necesario haberlos jugado, porque, como he dicho, éste no guarda apenas relación con los anteriores.","timestamp_created":1375185075,"timestamp_updated":1375185075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6011858","author":{"steamid":"76561198057188416","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1515,"last_played":1473589047},"language":"english","review":"le best game eveeeeeer\n5 starts :P\n\n","timestamp_created":1375182529,"timestamp_updated":1375182529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2060068","author":{"steamid":"76561198001634749","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":7041,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2552,"last_played":1458628810},"language":"english","review":"Yes, yes, yes.

Citizen Kane, for those who don't know, is a classic film about the death of a rich asshole who whispers the word \"Rosebud\" before he dies. Orson Welles and Sherlock Holmes team up to discover that Rosebud is actually the name of his sled from when he was an uncorrupted youth. It is considered a film masterpiece due to its characterization, cinematography and storytelling. What it's not commonly is the 12 hours Orson Welles spends shooting racists in the fac- oh, I'm sorry. THAT'S BIOSHOCK INFINITE.\n\nLet's get this out of the way so I can address the game itself. Gaming in its current state cannot live up to the aristic heights of a good novel, play, poem or film. The fancy word for it is ludonarrative dissonence - when gameplay and story are in separate \"components\" of the game whole. This is glaring in Bioshock, The Last of Us, or any other recent \"Mona Lisa of Gaming\" (seriously, shut the fuck up with these). These games are exemplary stories in their own right, with solid writing, acting and characterisation; however, they fail when it comes to the story-gameplay interaction. You are removed from the world the game tries to create when all you literally do is collect junk and shoot racists. When did you see Winston Smith shooting Big Brother Bots a billion times? Where was the never-ending multicharacter street war with insults about one's mother in Ulysses? Did anyone else see the Time Traveller collecting useless items and shooting hundreds of Murlocks? Games are childish in their storytelling and when they attempt to inject heightened, mature themes, it's laughable in the face of the ample amount of pointless violence they depict. Bioshock Infinite is one of these games; it's a respectful attempt at something deeper, more meaningful in an attempt to create player bonds with a fictional woman. However, I become this mass murderer of Columbia's citizens, somehthing which Kevin Levine has forced me to do; I cannot respect that.\n\nIn the game you play Booker DeWiit, a generic gruff ruffian from New York who is called to Columbia from his mysterious, unknown employer to save the princess from the castle. She is being held in Columbia, a floating hyper-Murica citystate led by a deranged preacher. The princess is Elizabeth, who is a heavily Disney-inspired girl that throws you random shit in the middle of battle. She will also unlock doors for you since you're drooling buffoon incapable of doing so. You go through the game shooting copious amounts of racists in the face, who are trying to stop you from taking Elizabeth back to Murica. Oh and Elizabeth can open portals for some reason; never explained....k. Anyways, the gameplay is painfully average. A lot of people thought the skyhooks are revolutionary, but they're just an added gimmick to break up the monotony. The diaries are one of the few features I actually like about Bioshock as they break up that dissonence I described before; you interact/find them in order to hear more story, which is what games should be doing. \n\nAfter about 12 hours of waiting for Elizabeth to unlock doors, you'll beat the game and be rewarded with a revolutionary, game-changing revelation from the godly pen of Kevin Levine. Basically it is a pedestrian look at multi-dimensional theory that authors like Baxter have addressed in far more depth and excitement.\n\nNo multiplayer, but I guess that's good so they could spend more time making $5 pre-order DLC.\n\nIn conclusion, read a book instead. I suggest The Time Ships if you like dimensional physics, The City & the City about racism and political structures, A Tale of Two Cities for the viva la revolucion, or any Roger Zelazny (Amber...Lord of Light...etc). Seriously, you can buy all those books for the same price as Bioshock Infinite, let alone the DLC \"season pass\" (its not a fucking TV show 2K) that doesn't even have any DLC yet.\n\n1564 out of 1616; a masterpiece, the fucking Hamlet of Gaming.","timestamp_created":1375078639,"timestamp_updated":1385444998,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480381965637207031","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1168532","author":{"steamid":"76561197988335742","num_games_owned":586,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":640,"last_played":1402607868},"language":"english","review":"A story of love, tragedy, and redemption as I headshot everything that moves because I AM VENGEANCE! \n\nAhem.

Gameplay is super fluid and never ceases to make you feel powerful.  Combat really is comprised of four different facets. Gunplay which is interesting on its own and has many different weapons to try out. Vigors (a return of plasmid like powers from the first game) that give you incredible powers that let you be more creative with your approach on combat and the enviroment. Skyhooks (the most awesome gameplay addition in my opinion) allow you to move through a battle with ease and strike down foes from above. Lastly, are Elizabeths powers to create tears which open up things like turrets, hooks, cover, or many other items or combat options which can help change the tide of a battle.  These main facets to gameplay make the game feel fresh and fun.  Everytime you aproach a group of bad guys gives you a new opportunity to experiment with the myriad of options to take out your foes.\nThe thing of course that makes Infinite interesting is its world and story.  Columbia is a very interesting place to visit with many beautiful views and interesting characters all around.  Booker and Elizabeth have a very interesting connection ,not as deep as Joel and Ellie in The Last of Us per se ,but still great enough to keep the story interesting.\nBioshock Infinite is one of those games that will be remembered for quite a while just like the first Bioshock.

She alone makes the game, which is good because otherwise it falls short on both game play and story in comparison to Bioshock 1, 2.  It falls FAR short in comparison to its legacy of System Shock.\n\nI'm not saying it's a bad game.  The colours are vivid instead of following the washed-out trend, the combat is fairly satisfying, the treasure hunts enjoyable and the rail-riding is actually pretty darn cool.  And then there's Liz.\n\nBut the story is pretencious, the twist is weak,and worst of all -- the game play doesn't match the theme.  If you compare this to Bioshock where the theme is woven beautifully into the game itself, it really falls down.\n\nBut then there's Elizabeth.  The game really shouldn't hinge entirely on her, but it really does.  Without her, the game is uninteresting.  Once you meet her, you miss her presence dearly because without her, Bioshock Infinite is a scary place.  They did a beautiful job making me actually care about a character -- not only does she grow as the events unfold, not only is she your moral compass, but she is also a life-saver in game.  Since you can't carry first aid kits or mana potions (let's face it, it's mana) her ability to toss you life, magic, or ammo (and money out of combat) makes you want to ensure she's with you at all times.  Add to this the personality of Rapunzel from \"Tangled\" and she's prbably the best NPC I've ever seen in a game.\n\nStill, play \"Untdertale\" and you'll really see where they dropped the ball for integrating the theme of the game into the game play itself.","timestamp_created":1375047958,"timestamp_updated":1375047958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1958495","author":{"steamid":"76561198000263863","num_games_owned":384,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":483,"last_played":1409037503},"language":"english","review":"Really Great Game.
