What sets this apart from other games is how the environments are so beautiful and so believable makes you want to just roam around the game taking it all in.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent, the gun play is solid and responsive. Each weapon is different in its own way making it fun to shoot down enemies by shooting them with you 9mm or de-atomizing them with the pulse-rifle. Really simple, really fun.\n\nThe physics in this game are the best I've ever seen (the water effects are superb btw), better than some modern day games (*cough* call of duty). Words cannot describe how fun it is to use the gravity gun.

So all in all, its a bit slow in the beginning and there are two annoyingly tedious chapters but that doesn't change the fact its a great game and I still recommend it!","timestamp_created":1401323890,"timestamp_updated":1401323890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10269994","author":{"steamid":"76561197995749775","num_games_owned":567,"num_reviews":103,"playtime_forever":911,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":911,"last_played":1401306047},"language":"english","review":"Yet another outstanding FPS from Valve.","timestamp_created":1401323801,"timestamp_updated":1401323801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542336821556091309","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10269868","author":{"steamid":"76561198061731234","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1389630707},"language":"english","review":"Always been in one of my favorite games.","timestamp_created":1401322862,"timestamp_updated":1401322862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10269651","author":{"steamid":"76561198059703198","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":546,"last_played":1627622447},"language":"english","review":"> Be me\n> Love Gaben\n> Buys the Complete Valve Collection\n> MFW best decision ever\n> Sleeping one night\n> Feel something touch my ass\nIts Gaben\n> He says \"you've been good, thank you for buying my games\"\n> He gives me a good time then flies away\n> MFW 10/10 Gaben approved\n\nSeriously one of the best purchases of my life, a seriously kick ass game 10/10 :)","timestamp_created":1401321328,"timestamp_updated":1401321328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10269533","author":{"steamid":"76561198048545485","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1122,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1109,"last_played":1457739086},"language":"english","review":"Pros\n\n* Exciting\n* Deep\n* Varied environments\n* Varied weapons\n* Varied missions and settings\n* Atmospheric\n\nCons\n\n* Unimmersive gunplay\n* Acceleration when walking causes unprecise movement\n* Too much grinding\n* Weak story, great concept","timestamp_created":1401320313,"timestamp_updated":1401320313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10269268","author":{"steamid":"76561198062896499","num_games_owned":1144,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1056,"last_played":1561516225},"language":"brazilian","review":":)","timestamp_created":1401318060,"timestamp_updated":1401318060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.465116292238235474","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10267232","author":{"steamid":"76561198076807599","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":71,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71,"last_played":1401304916},"language":"russian","review":"Оверрэйт и оверхайп/10.","timestamp_created":1401305504,"timestamp_updated":1401305504,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.247148141264915466","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10266165","author":{"steamid":"76561198047040623","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":751,"last_played":1505419188},"language":"polish","review":"Co tu dużo mówić ZAJEBISTE ten klimat z 2004 nie to co dzisiaj... grywalność fabuła nie do opisania.

I never felt like the gameplay was getting stale either since the story progressed at a steady pace. And there is a follower who you actually care about and you don't feel forced to lug her around like she's some puppy that you forgot at the puppy mill since you are in to that kind of shit.... Where was I?Aw yes. Alyx Vance was a great supporting character and although Gordon Freeman never really talked, she did all the talking for you and she was hot. Where am I going with this review??? Anyways, this was actually a great game, I could see how this revolutionized story telling, first person shooters, and action/adventure games during its era. A must play for all people on steam.

Игре уже 10 лет, однако при этом она до сих пор держит высокую планку качества.\n\nИгра является продолжением первой части. Спустя несколько лет, G-man вовращает Гордона из стазиса, решив его использовать в своих целях. За время отсутствия Фримена, прошли довольно глобальные изменения в мире. Планета была захвачена могущественной инопланетной организацией, именуемой Советом Альянса. Большиство людей, стали жертвами и рабами захватчиков, однако были и те кто пытался сопротивлятся. Небольшие отряды повстанцев, не теряли надежду спастись и вернуть Землю обратно. Роль главного повстанца сыграет бывшый сотрудник научного комлекса Black Mesa.\n\nПервое, что на тот момент бросалось в глаза, это новый движок Source. Помимо прекрасной графики, крутой анимации, движок имел отличную техническую составляющую. Большая качественная работа была проведена с физикой. Все предметы, оружие, техника, повинуются физике, с учётом их массы, трения и силы тяжести. На этой основе сделано немало различных простеньких головоломок.\n\nТем не менее игра является классическим представителем жанра шутер от первого лица. Так же игра сохранила все классические традиции первой части. К примеру за действиями игры, мы наблюдаем исключительно из глаз главного героя, без каких то видео-вставок или разрыве во времени. Так же Гордон Фримен молчит на протяжении всей игры. Ну и конечно загадка серии номер один, таинственый человек в костюме с кейсом.\n\nПо части геймплея, игра нам предлагает куда больше разноообразия нежели первый HL. И если в первом, место действия в основном проходило на територрии научного комплекса в пустыне, где большую часть времени, игрок проводил в стенах лаборатории, то во второй части, разнообразие локаций на порядок выше. Захваченый, полуразрушенный город восточной европы, побережье, мрачный атмосферный городок Рейвенхольм, тюрьма, огромная Цитадель. Все эти места помимо всего прочего, красиво воссозданы, а в некоторых прекрасно передана атмосфера(Рейвенхольм).\n\nЕсли в первой части основными противника были инопланетные существа, в перемешку с солдатами, посланными на зачистку лаборатории, то во второй таковыми являются солдаты Альянса. Сражениям с зомби и другими существами уделено куда меньше времени. Тем не менее игра постоянно держит в напряжении, а качественно поданый геймплей и продуманный сюжет мотивируют играть не прерываясь, до самого конца.\n\nКроме основной геймплейной составляющей игры, а именно перестрелки с врагами и убийство мутантов, игра так же предлагает нам и другие развлечения. Часто встречаются не сложные, однако вполне продуманые логические задачки, нам дадут возможность покататся на багги по побережью и на воздушной подушке по каналам города.\n\nВ игре не много оружия, однако представленных экземпляров вполне хватает, для того чтобы устроить настоящий беспредел на улицах Сити 17. Хотя модели оружия другие, однако типы и виды остались такими же. Ломик, пистолет, дробовик, атомат, арбалет, базука и гранаты. Однако, ещё было добавлено устройство под названием Грави-пушка, которая полностью заменяет все функции ломика. Теперь один из символов Half-Life, стал самым бесполезным предметом в инвентаре Гордона.\n\nНесмотря на то, что большую часть игры прийдется ходить в одиночестве, и сражаться с врагами собственными силами, во второй части у нас будут союзники. Это некоторые повстанцы, Аликс и её Пёс, и даже Муравьиные львы. Сам же AI был намного лучше проработан. Как враги так и союзники вели себя вполне адекватно. Редко когда замечал баги или какие то проблемы с этим.\n\n[h1] Отличная игра, прекрасное продолжение серии, красивая графика, реалистичная физика, хорошо продуманный сюжет и яркие персонажи.\n\nОценка: 10/10 [/h1]","timestamp_created":1401091061,"timestamp_updated":1418979857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":297,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.903828084468841553","comment_count":20,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10238306","author":{"steamid":"76561198007042683","num_games_owned":769,"num_reviews":135,"playtime_forever":2477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2312,"last_played":1605764058},"language":"english","review":"In 2008, this is the game that got me back into video games.  10/10","timestamp_created":1401084700,"timestamp_updated":1651478766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10237365","author":{"steamid":"76561198095301442","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":724,"last_played":1592174697},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 2 is a hybrid uncommon amongst most FPS games. Combining elements of Horror, Action, Role-Playing, and even Puzzle, this game succeeds as both a thought-provoking game and satisfying shooter. \n\nHalf Life 2 is easily accessbile to all gamers. You don't need to have played the original to comprehend the plot, as they are minimally connected. Past significant events are thoroughly explained, as you easily get up on your feet and immerse yourself in this apocalyptic world dominated by blood-hungry aliens.\n\nThe plot is subtle. Nothing is over-dramatized or exaggerated. The game flows in real-time, so there are no gaps between events. The game proceeds very quickly, and due to that fact some might say this is a short game, but it's not without it's challenges, secrets, and easter eggs. There is enough content to keep you playing for hours, and even come back again after you beat it.\n\nSo don't sit by waiting for Half Life 3, just purchase this one right now! I recommend \"The Orange Box\", because for $20, you  get this game, and it's 3 successors. Not to mention \"Portal\" as well, the 'sister' game to Half Life.","timestamp_created":1401073719,"timestamp_updated":1401073719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10237024","author":{"steamid":"76561198128879180","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":730,"last_played":1658515052},"language":"english","review":"   Half-Life 2 is by far one of the greatest PC games I have ever played.
