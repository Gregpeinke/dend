Игра качественная, и раскрученная. Своих денег стоит.\nНо т.к. игра достаточно старая, а кроме того прямое продолжение half-life, то всеже у нее предостаточно недостатков:\n- игра линейна. Линейна на столько что прохождение построено по схеме бежим вперед убивая врагов (да иногда нужно ставить ящики друг на друга или решать что-то похожее на головоломки, но это минимально).\n- сюжет в игре достаточно слабый. Да, мы бежим и происходят какие-то события, но все очень предсказуемо. Ощущения что мы как-то влияем на события происходящие в игре нет.\n- отдельная проблема - AI. HL в свое время выделялся неплохим AI и появление смышленных солдат после тупых монстров приводило к изменению стиля игры. В HL2 AI был уже очень слаб даже на момент выхода игры. Например показавшись солдатам можно просто сесть в углу и они по очереди прибегут к вам на убой. От брошенной гранаты солдаты не разбегаются, и тупо бегут на расставленые мины итп. Солдаты практически не используют укрытия.\n- слабый AI компесируется скриптовыми появлениями монстров и солдат. Например в здании солдаты могут по очереди появляться из комнат, по ходу движения. Точно также мы встречаем и помошников-повстанцев. Выглядит неправдоподобно.\n- сам движок source (развитие движка 1го quake) в графическом плане весьма слаб, что подтверждает малое число выпущенных на нем игр. В свое время он выделялся только анимацией лиц и красивой водой.\n\nхоть в игре есть и солдаты и монстры, атмосферы первого HL нет. Своей собственной атмосферы тоже нет. А как просто шутер игра достаточно неплохая.\n\nPS В библиотеке есть еще эпизоды 1 и 2, но после ХЛ2 их даже смотреть нет никакого желания..","timestamp_created":1477472895,"timestamp_updated":1478685240,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.374027013778686523","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26220680","author":{"steamid":"76561198199483629","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":881,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":636,"last_played":1636057693},"language":"english","review":"very good game\nwaccomend playing","timestamp_created":1477426863,"timestamp_updated":1477426863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26220188","author":{"steamid":"76561198123470380","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1030,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":943,"last_played":1414673212},"language":"english","review":"We believe.","timestamp_created":1477424851,"timestamp_updated":1477424851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592270731925964355","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26217100","author":{"steamid":"76561198127924676","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22,"last_played":1552928681},"language":"french","review":"Un jeu mythique que je n'oublierai jamais!

I don't know why everyone's recommending it. Way more hype than it deserves. About an hour into it I came to a canal and couldn't progress further until I stacked boxes and barrels to get up to street level. I spent about fifteen minutes with this tedius task only to reach an invisible barrier or something that prevented me from jumping up 1ft to the street... absolutely rediculous. It's like a 2 year-old's game of building blocks with zero skill or brain power required to solve it, but it's incredibly frustrating and painstakingly boring to gather up these items to build a makeshift staircase. Developers, utilize ladders! Overall I defnitely wouldn't recommend this game and am glad I only paid about $1.50 for it on Steam 80% off. If you want similar gameplay with better graphics go with the Metro games instead. I'll be steering clear from anything made by Valve from now on.\"- An actual fucking review.... \n\nAnyone who read that review most likely got cancer...

The Gameplay is Fantastic, there is never a time where I get bored running over ant lions or killing some Combine. The Graphics still after 10+ years looks great. The Audio in this game is amazing.
