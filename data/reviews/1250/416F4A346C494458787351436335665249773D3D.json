Bo przecież survival horror z mutantami ( klonami) nie może być zły. Potem po jakiś 11 godzinach zdecydowałem się na zakup akurat było po 3,74 euro. I powiem szczerze od tego czasu nie żałuję ani godziny spędzonej w tej grze. Ale przejdźmy od sedna. Akcja gry toczy się w Anglii spustoszonej poprzez ataki zedów. Naszą rolą jest oczywiście eksterminacja piekielnego miotu w czasie 11 fal  ( 9 rodzajów oponentów )  zaczynając  od skrzepa ( mięso armatnie ) na potężnym \"Ojcu\". Niewątpliwym plusem gry jest świetny podkład który towarzyszy przy rzezi (drum n bass oraz metal ), możliwość personalizacji postaci poprzez wybór wielu skórek postaci ( niektóre są darmowe - wykonywanie osiągnięć, reszta zaś dostępna w formie płatnych DLC ), ogromny arsenał broni zaczynając na nożu a kończąć na futurystycznych giwerach, klimatyczne mapy oraz przede wszystkim poczucie zaszczucia albo po prostu emocje związane z bycia ostatnim żyjącym. Warto dodać iż posiada ona aż 252 osiągnięcia dla głodnych wyzwań a także sprawny i sympatyczny warsztat ( miejsce w którym dodaje się mapy, skiny ). W grę możemy grać samemu bądź do maks 6 osób. Wymagania sprzętowe nie są zbyt wysokie, grafika możliwe, że nie daje rady dzisiejszym produkcjom lecz uwierzcie. Tu jest ona najmniej ważnym elementem.

On a whim and a steam sale, I bought KF just for kicks.\nBy the looks of it I have the guns, the companions and a dumb AI to deal with, this should be a cake walk for an hour or so, and then I'm back to Far Cry 3/BD...well, Far Cry is crying in its lonely corner with Michael Biehn for a while now.... What KF lacks in graphic polish and writing, it has in game balance, this is  where the classes are complimentary towards each other, every shot counts when things get thick and there are no gun/bomb/airstrike/gunship to save you. If you're not playing to the strengths of your class, your team mates will and do yell viciously at you. The real satisfaction is when you play with a good team and beating up the baddies :3\nEven if you find that it's getting easy to survive then just crank up to Hell on Earth, and you'll find out how old school FPS Killing Floor will drag down your ego. There also is a huge modding community given KF's relative small player pool against the likes of COD and Battlefield.

Including 6 different classes.","timestamp_created":1394056934,"timestamp_updated":1394056934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517857193946838379","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9355998","author":{"steamid":"76561198041769821","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12990,"last_played":1525197784},"language":"dutch","review":"Topper","timestamp_created":1394055430,"timestamp_updated":1394055430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9355045","author":{"steamid":"76561198090880602","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":6351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1319,"last_played":1590345829},"language":"brazilian","review":"razoalvel.","timestamp_created":1394049016,"timestamp_updated":1394049016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9354875","author":{"steamid":"76561198062604487","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1588,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":185,"last_played":1429675200},"language":"english","review":"it a old game but a good one . it still hell of fun to play with friends and i still enjoy it","timestamp_created":1394047878,"timestamp_updated":1394047878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9353671","author":{"steamid":"76561198092113330","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2565,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1789,"last_played":1634332738},"language":"english","review":"My favorite survival horror game for pc try this game and you gonna love it soon...","timestamp_created":1394039068,"timestamp_updated":1394039068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9353595","author":{"steamid":"76561198062875836","num_games_owned":306,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1241,"last_played":1414589436},"language":"french","review":"De la balle","timestamp_created":1394038528,"timestamp_updated":1394038528,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9352045","author":{"steamid":"76561198075284662","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":678,"last_played":1498404359},"language":"english","review":"...","timestamp_created":1394027792,"timestamp_updated":1394027792,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9350121","author":{"steamid":"76561198000423611","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":31204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8587,"last_played":1630311813},"language":"english","review":"I Play This Game With My Best Bud While We BS.

Единственное, от чего страдает игра -- так это от отсутствия единой концепции, как в Left 4 Dead. Ни намёка на зародыш сюжета нет, игроки в разномастных костюмах выглядят несуразно, монстры хороши, но в них нет общей идеи, а во время ивентов упыри в праздничных колпаках смотрятся просто нелепо. Нет, я не говорю, что игра плохая, всё же в целом это классный, смачный кооперативный FPS, один из лучших в своём жанре.","timestamp_created":1394006818,"timestamp_updated":1394006818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653402984142303467","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9348768","author":{"steamid":"76561198068231837","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1925,"last_played":1627293012},"language":"czech","review":"Peins","timestamp_created":1393993056,"timestamp_updated":1393993056,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9347454","author":{"steamid":"76561198087233048","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1393976875},"language":"brazilian","review":"Nota 8","timestamp_created":1393981870,"timestamp_updated":1393981870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9341299","author":{"steamid":"76561198016402077","num_games_owned":309,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3864,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3098,"last_played":1436902769},"language":"italian","review":"Stupendo per cazzeggiare con gli amici","timestamp_created":1393941021,"timestamp_updated":1393941021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lIDXxsQCc5fRIw=="}
