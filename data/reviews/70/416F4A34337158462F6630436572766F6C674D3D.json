The controls are awful and unresponsive, it feels like you are on ice. The level design is awful too, it doesnt feel fun or interesting at all. It is very repetitive. It is a hard game only because of its clunky controls and poorly created and thought out levels. This game is the definition of overrated in every sense of the word.

I was really excited to finally play this game and it did not disappoint for the most part. The one thing I really loved about the game is that it's very much one big seamless experience. Loading between different areas is done in a mostly non-intrusive way (at least as much as technology at that time could allow), and all of the \"cutscenes\" and dialogue are integrated into the gameplay. This, coupled with the eerie music and ambience allows you to really get immersed in the world, like you really are Gordon Freeman going on this journey. The combat feels good and the problem solving to get through the different areas and challenges is really satisfying when you finally get it right. There were some parts of the game where it was a little confusing on what to do, and its easy to occasionally get lost, but for a game made in '98 it holds up surprisingly well.","timestamp_created":1640626139,"timestamp_updated":1640626139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106674326","author":{"steamid":"76561199230001968","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2728,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1647,"last_played":1641604525},"language":"english","review":"annhufnbuhbfubqwbehurfbhurebhbhdsbhdhu
