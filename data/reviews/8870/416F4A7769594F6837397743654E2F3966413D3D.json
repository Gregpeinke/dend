Graphics are stunning, and very well optimized for PC. The story integrates well with the previous Bioshock games as seen in the game, although I am yet to try Burial at Sea, which of course takes you back to the iconic Rapture environment. The floating city of Columbia and the character of Booker makes the game unique, although the variety of different collectables and challenges make 100% completion for a completionist like myself rather difficult and sometimes tedious. Rail riding is an interesting game mechanic, but like Doom's glory kill mechanic becomes less of a fun engaging tactic and more repetitive than I would like.\n\nAll in all a good game.

The story is what will keep you wanting more, the action is nice, combat is well done, and the vigors are creative.  Now Elizabeth is one of the best AI partners I have ever had in any game, she is very helpful as she can give you health, ammo, salts, or even money to spend on things as well and you don't even have to protect her as she protects herself and that I like.  However with all this in mind there are a few problems that Bioshock Infinite has and the first problem is combat, now don't get me wrong combat is good, however you don't really need to use your vigors to kill anyone and they do help with combat, especially with some of the tougher enemies later in the game but for the most part you can just shoot your way to kill them no problem.  Next is the vigors and they are creative but some of them are just not useful or are just useless later in the game, Shock Jockey, Bucking Bronco, Murder of Crows, and Undertow are the ones I find the most useful in the game, the other 4 have their uses, however I just did not find them as useful as the ones I just listed and on top of that Devil's Kiss in my opinion is some what useless in the later parts of the game but with the right combos it's not a bad vigor, just a little under powered.  Now the story is rich, however it is a little confusing and you are going to have many questions on some of the stuff showing in the story and you are either going to get the answers from your friends who have played the game or you look up the stuff to answer these questions and your friends probably did the same as well, unless they were one of those people who were able to piece the story all together in one of more playthroughs of the game.  Bioshock Infinite even with the flaws I just mentioned is a great game and I do recommend it, even the DLC is worth the money as well but these problems do hold the game back in a way and depending on the person the game might not even be worth replaying after sometime but that's just me and even with that you should buy the game as it is well worth it.","timestamp_created":1498415687,"timestamp_updated":1573193430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32782512","author":{"steamid":"76561198135193907","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":977,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":977,"last_played":1496766752},"language":"schinese","review":"第九艺术～剧情炸裂","timestamp_created":1498414162,"timestamp_updated":1511413425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32781404","author":{"steamid":"76561198093612865","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5409,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4344,"last_played":1639507022},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego es la definición de ``obra maestra´´.","timestamp_created":1498412428,"timestamp_updated":1498412428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":20,"weighted_vote_score":"0.695824503898620605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32781284","author":{"steamid":"76561197992308731","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":42,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":42,"last_played":1492631314},"language":"english","review":"Is a realy beutiful game","timestamp_created":1498412224,"timestamp_updated":1498412224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32780843","author":{"steamid":"76561198025789017","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1927,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1870,"last_played":1529589105},"language":"schinese","review":"       这游戏五星推荐啊\n       我以前下载过破解版，之前游戏打折又入了正版，但是一直放在库里吃灰，直到前几天拿出来玩，一发不可收，直接九个小时通关了。\n       首先必须要说的是NPC的智能性，我从未见过像这个游戏一样智能的NPC！Elizabeth全程围着你转，既不是跟着你走也不是带着你走，不会走到一个地方站住不动等你，她会你互动，和你聊天，当你看着一件东西的时候她也会凑过去看，你站着不动的时候她会围着你四处查看小东西。最令我印象深刻的，是她进女厕所不进男厕所！所有的这一切，都让我感到这个人物非常的真实，而不像某些游戏的NPC像一个木偶，只会按照特定的路径完成特定的动作，按照特定的剧情说话。\n       其次是游戏的艺术性，作为一款蒸汽朋克作品，其美工真是非常精致，BGM也恰到好处。从初入哥伦比亚的壮观神圣，到每一个小器件的无比精致，可以看出游戏的美工是下过很大功夫的。现在很多游戏，一味追求画面的真实，把石头草丛什么的做的纹理细致，这个游戏论纹理肯定比不上近两年所谓的显卡杀手，但是却让人感到更加的舒服，让人更加惊叹，我想这是这个游戏美工的独到之处。至于BGM也很有上世纪的复古风，特别是几曲经典交响乐的变奏，给人不一样的感受。\n       至于剧情，作为一个游戏来讲是非常出众的，但是我作为没有打汉化补丁的玩家，玩到最后有些懵逼，直到看了解说才恍然大悟。在当时这样平行世界的构思可以说是非常独到，但是近些年来这类题材的烧脑电影层出不穷，其实有些审美疲劳，但是尽管这样我还是在最后一幕呆坐在电脑前很久，甚至看完了所有字幕（有彩蛋）。我认为剧情的成功离不开NPC的真实塑造。\n       游戏性仿佛不是本作的重点，因为它不是完全开放的沙盒地图（却强过某土豆的沙盒游戏），它AI难度也不高，我普通难度通关没死几次，但是这在一定程度上保证了剧情的完整性和紧凑性。\n       游戏就像一本书，有的游戏是教科书，在于反复琢磨，研究战术思想，有的游戏是小说，打打杀杀一遍通然后吃灰，这个游戏更像是一部著作，不仅制作精良，有深厚的宗教背景，还值得我们反复品味，我想这个游戏值得诸位去接触。","timestamp_created":1498411466,"timestamp_updated":1498411466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32780687","author":{"steamid":"76561198170926543","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1397,"last_played":1513158621},"language":"english","review":"This game will mind-fuck the shit outta you.

Il est entre deux ages, qui montre les progres de nos jours, mais aussi qu'a l'époque les textures sont détaillés et les effets ne sont pas si eloigniées de ceux que l'ont voit maintenant offrant une claque visuelle toujours époustouflante.\n\nElizabeth, l'icone centre de tout.\n\nPeut etre, l'un des personnages feminin le plus réussi. Techniquement elle est rempli d'expressions, de gestuelles qui rendent chaques scénes attachantes. Son estétisme approfondi la sensation d'une époque, d'une beauté, d'une personalité et d'une ambiance. Elle met en avant le level design et son exploration par le crochetage de serrure. Notifie les elements à ramassés, fournis des munitions, des couvertures en combat sans pour autant faire tout le travail. Car sans elle il serait compliqué de loot pendant l'action tout en trouvant une solution pour franchir la zone, meme si on ne peut réellement mourir et reprendre à la derniere sauvegarde par son aspect de vita chambre revu et obligatoire ici qui nous fait respawn. Elle est finalement une coéquipiere discrete et pourtant indispensable.\n\nJ'aurais aimé éviter ses comparaisons car tout le merite revient aux créateurs, qui n'a absolument rien raté et fait l'exploit de proposé une chose nouvelle tout en gardant une base solide des anciens dans son approche tout en réussisant avec brio à rendre la trilogie lié entre eux. Mais emotionnellement, Infinite ma fait l'effet d'un Disney à la princesse touchante, à la Shutter Islande dans son choc et sa reflexion, à la Tim Burton dans certains personnages loufoques dans leurs comportements qui cache un grand savoir. Un jeu qui ne se repose pas que sur son gameplay mythiques, leurs environnements originals, ils ont cette fois montré la chose la plus efficace, proposé au joueur de ressentir des emotions, de le choqué et de le faire relfechir. De lui faire comprendre que tout se qu'il à vécu durant l'aventure, avait un sens, jusqu'a certaines mécaniques du jeu lui meme. Et c'est le bon choix, surtout pour ceux qui recherche la contemplation dans le jeu video. Rien n'est plus justifier lorsque ce que l'ont a fait avait un sens. C'est plaisant de sentir l'adrenaline monté en fleche au meme rythme que le jeu juste par son histoire.\n\nNiveau fps, je ressent mieux la chose, nottament grace au crosshair plus petit. L'armement est plus classique mais plus nerveux et ses upgrades bien que moins mises en avant sont toujours présentes. Avoir que 2armes etaient neccessaire pour l'équilibrage face à l'apport d' Elizabeth. Nouveauté avec l'ajout d'un bouclier. Similitude dans le corps à corps à l'exeption que celle ci offre la possibilité de joué avec le decors que sont les rails pour faire du combat aérien, en plus d'etre tres thematique aux decors, et les fameux toniques qui seront indispensable pour survivre en support de l'AIM. Globalement le jeu a la meme difficulté que ses prédecesseurs. Compliqué si on n'aborde pas le gameplay comme il faut. Et tout de suite bien plus simple quand on utilise sa richesse au mieux. \n\nLes dlc, bien qu'un peu cher, sont indispensables pour ceux qui auraient adoré autant que moi Infinite. Où la direction artistique montre des plans de vue toujours aussi \"mafieux\", mais dans des couleures que j'aurais pas put espérer plus réussie et comme je les voulaient. Et offrent une fois de plus une boucle des plus magnifiquement bouclé. Et l'envie de se replongé immédiatement dans le 1er bioshock, montre l'importance de la réussite d'Infinite dans sa différence en laissant du coup à ses anciens opus leurs identités indémodable.\n\nBioshock Infinite, un ses jeux qu'on regrettera de pas etre plus nombreux, d'etre un AAA avec une mentalité d'indépandent qui nous offre meme l'humour noir. Pour moi il sera toujours présent dans mes mémoires c'est certain. Un choc culturelle apres l'heure. Et flatteur à la culture Francaise, que demandé de plus!","timestamp_created":1498406890,"timestamp_updated":1500993742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":352,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.937999606132507324","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32777098","author":{"steamid":"76561198115862715","num_games_owned":443,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":555,"last_played":1542541945},"language":"schinese","review":"好游戏","timestamp_created":1498405524,"timestamp_updated":1498405524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32775504","author":{"steamid":"76561198046902674","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":582,"last_played":1431681395},"language":"french","review":"une trés bonne expérience de jeu un peut trop linéaire mais sympa","timestamp_created":1498403087,"timestamp_updated":1498403087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32774448","author":{"steamid":"76561198116969792","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":894,"last_played":1498569524},"language":"english","review":"the best game i've ever played","timestamp_created":1498401552,"timestamp_updated":1498401552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32770030","author":{"steamid":"76561198216058625","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":370,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":370,"last_played":1498441639},"language":"english","review":"Immediately right off the bat noticed this was far-left SJW liberal garbage/conditioning.\nf**k off 2k, irrational games and everyone involved in writing and disseminating this unoriginal and drawn out narrative seen again and again in games and movies. bioshock 1 and 2 at least tried...and succeeded better than this one.","timestamp_created":1498393851,"timestamp_updated":1498393851,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.300495892763137817","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32769055","author":{"steamid":"76561198098482820","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":1028,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1636450777},"language":"russian","review":"Сколько раз пытался ее пройти, но рано или поздно бросал ее на пол пути,так то игра неплохая но моего интереса к ней не хватает что бы пройти до конца","timestamp_created":1498392163,"timestamp_updated":1498392163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.436507940292358398","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32768611","author":{"steamid":"76561198116422485","num_games_owned":360,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1046,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1046,"last_played":1442618343},"language":"spanish","review":"Historia, ambientación...
