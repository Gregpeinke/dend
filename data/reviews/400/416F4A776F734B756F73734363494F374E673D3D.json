Nem csak szorakoztató, de gondolkodtató is. Tökéletes példa arra hogy egy FPS hogyan lehet más mint a többi FPS. A kinézete egyszerű letisztult, mégis remek atmoszférája van neki. A poénokat végig kapjuk az arcunkba ahogy haladunk előre. Ezeket a poónékat pedig a drága jó GLaDOS-unk szolgáltatja.  És ahogy az ember megtanul a portálokkal gondolkodni, hatalmas szorakozás lesz a játék. Öszintén mondom, a legjobb FPS-ek között van. \n\nAttól hogy maga a sztori rövid, még nem jelenti azt hogy a játékban nincs több kontent. Úgyanis ott van még a 6 tovább fejlesztett pálya is benne, illetve még a 6 kihívás pálya, amiken egyenként 3-3 kíhivás van. Kitudják a játékidőt rendesen tolni.\n\nEgyértelműen 10/10 a játék.

O fato do personagem não falar como na franquia Half-Life só ajuda na construção da atmosfera deste jogo. A única coisa que segura Portal para trás são os Challenge Maps, que muitos discordarão, mas são muito difíceis para jogadores casuais. Uma dica para quem comprar: jogue este jogo até acabar a história, mesmo porquê você vai ficar tão vidrado que não vai conseguir jogar outra coisa até acabar.\n\nNota: 9 / 10","timestamp_created":1422818606,"timestamp_updated":1422818606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14284482","author":{"steamid":"76561198065021734","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":439,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":372,"last_played":1424549914},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito divertido e desafiador um dos melhores jogos que já joguei.","timestamp_created":1422816796,"timestamp_updated":1422816796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14284456","author":{"steamid":"76561198164246454","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":658,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1425782073},"language":"schinese","review":"强烈推荐的游戏。\n传送门这个概念很好，GLaDOS这个人工智能超逗。\nPortal像是基于Half Life的风格，成就什么的做着也挺有趣的。\n最后GLaDOS唱歌很有爱！\n\n要做成就一定要开始就做！尤其是拿着收音机和弄坏摄像头的！千万不要漏掉！\n\n入steam坑第一款游戏。","timestamp_created":1422816702,"timestamp_updated":1422817089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14282713","author":{"steamid":"76561198157543257","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1513270076},"language":"english","review":"Finished off GLaDoS with a mili second to go 11/10","timestamp_created":1422810326,"timestamp_updated":1422810326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14281947","author":{"steamid":"76561198057425130","num_games_owned":713,"num_reviews":72,"playtime_forever":288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":115,"last_played":1482935465},"language":"english","review":"eezy puzzles in singleplayer! i bet Gabe Newell doesnt know counts till 3 ;-; \nno half life 3, no portal 3 fak...m eagerly waiting for these! :'3 100/10 would recommend","timestamp_created":1422807540,"timestamp_updated":1422807540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14281539","author":{"steamid":"76561198065924273","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":235,"last_played":1431086589},"language":"swedish","review":"Very short but otherwise brilliant game.","timestamp_created":1422806115,"timestamp_updated":1422806115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14280805","author":{"steamid":"76561198079803505","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":758,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1618377550},"language":"english","review":"This game is a triumph.\nI'm making a review here:\nHUGE SUCCESS","timestamp_created":1422803454,"timestamp_updated":1422803454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14280496","author":{"steamid":"76561198001012332","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":154,"last_played":1437561111},"language":"english","review":"I have played Portal 1 and 2 through several times when they came out.
