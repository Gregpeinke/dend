You play as one of a small group of them. There is Zoey, a young woman; Bill, the grizzled veteran; Louis, the middle-class office worker and Francis, the biker. Armed with weapons, these survivors must battle their way through the undead.\nIn each of the game scenarios, you must battle your way to a series of safe houses that lead to a rescue point. You can have up to four players in a game, controlling each of the characters, or the AI can fill in and control the bots.\nEach scenario is presented like a movie. At the beginning there is a movie poster showing the cast. If you survive, the \"credits\" display the statistics for the game, like who killed the most zombies, who inflicted the most headshots, who delivered the most friendly fire, and so on. The final credit shows how many zombies were killed in the making of the film and also the film is dedicated to the memory of those survivors who did not make it to safety.\nThe zombie horde that you battle is based on the \"fast\" zombies. Besides of the zombies there are also special infected. There is the hunter, which can leap across large distances to pin a survivor to the ground. Then there is the smoker, which has a frog-like tongue that can grab a survivor by the throat. The boomer is a corpulent zombie that vomits or explodes to spray survivors. Getting hit by the substance will not only temporarily blind survivors, but it drives the zombie horde into a feeding frenzy. Last but not least there is the tank, he is brick of a zombie that can take an enormous amount of damage and dish out a fair amount. And finally, there is the witch; she is an enormously powerful zombie that can take down a survivor with a single swipe. \nAll maps of Left 4 Dead are available now in the sequel, so it would be cheaper to buy only Left 4 Dead 2.\nStill I would say that Left 4 Dead is an incredible and highly replayable multiplayer experience that is definitely worth checking out.\n\nSounds 9/10\nGraphics 9/10\nGameplay 10/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation\n\nAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA","timestamp_created":1386857644,"timestamp_updated":1489170973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.585793972015380859","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8010949","author":{"steamid":"76561197982494482","num_games_owned":288,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":33,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1385800872},"language":"english","review":"If they remade a 3D Contra where you shot at zombies, it would be Left 4 Dead.

Ich benutzte die Standard Einstellungen und habe alles gut erreicht.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPro/Contra:\n\n+ ein Multiplayer Abend der immer Spass macht\n- im Singleplayer echt langweilig\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFazit:\n\nWenn das Spiel im Angebot ist würde ich immer zuschlagen, am besten L4D1/L4D2 Bundle. Ich habe kauf nicht bereut und da die Community immer noch Kampagnen und Maps liefert kann man Problemlos weiter spielen. Man sollte es allerdings wenn man die Deutsche Version hat um es ungeschnitten zu spielen „Left4Uncut“ Downloaden.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nZusammengefasst: \n\nEinzelspieler: 1/10\nMehrspieler: 8/10\nGrafik: 7/10\nMusik: 7/10\nSteuerung: 10/10\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpiel: 7/10","timestamp_created":1385836063,"timestamp_updated":1392817513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536957323551177979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7846235","author":{"steamid":"76561198006584713","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":344,"last_played":1485716186},"language":"german","review":"Ein tolles spiel auch wenn die Grafik nicht so neu ist ;=)","timestamp_created":1385828927,"timestamp_updated":1385828927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513204634189605713","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7845071","author":{"steamid":"76561197987255443","num_games_owned":333,"num_reviews":191,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1385819850},"language":"russian","review":"+1","timestamp_created":1385824905,"timestamp_updated":1385824905,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466678231954574585","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7842716","author":{"steamid":"76561198071913492","num_games_owned":287,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":860,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":634,"last_played":1418956435},"language":"english","review":"really good game! bunch of zombies and its at a good price!
