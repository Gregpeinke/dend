Для моих детских глаз,красивый воздушный город казался чем-то невероятным. \nВспомнив про эту игру,я решил пройти еще раз. Игра 2013 года не заставила меня скучать.\n\nАтмосфера: Великолепная музыка,стилистика игры (Стимпанк) \n\nГеймлей: Букер(Главный герой) получает силы и способности через «энергетики», «снаряжение» и «экстракты», разбросанные по всей Колумбии. Каждый ''Энергетик'' выглядит уникально и имеет весьма приятные заставки с их использованием. Вы можете направлять стаю воронов в врагов,или захватить противника при помощи щупальца Ктулху (это примеры их использования). Помимо энергетиков,в игре есть ''Снаряжение''. ''Снаряжение'' Вы можете находить помимо прохождении игры,в разных секретных комнатах. Каждая шмотка дает вам уникальные свойства,которая позволяет составить свой билд при желании. В игре есть различные пушки,которые можно улучшать,например: увеличение урона;увеличение обоймы в магазине и т.п. (я прошел игру с одним пистолетом,просто потому что с ним очень клево бегать,пистолет one love).\nСюжет: Могу сказать,что он хорош.

Nenhum adjetivo por si só faz jus à essa obra, como jogo solo, é maravilhoso, e como um encerramento e ponto final para a série Bioshock é impossível de definir numa palavra. Pra quem procura um jogo com mecânicas interessantes, uma história maravilhosa e uma direção de arte impecável, vai achar tudo isso e mais um pouco. \nPra quem já é fã da série, a campanha principal é totalmente diferente dos dois primeiros jogos ambientados na obscura e decadente Rapture após a revolução de Atlas, mas ainda assim consegue nos trazer o sentimento de \"casa\" por toda a campanha. Já as duas partes da DLC \"Enterro no Oceano\" são obrigatórias para amarrar toda a série e nos fazer revisitar com louvor a nossa querida e assustadora Raptura dos anos 50.
