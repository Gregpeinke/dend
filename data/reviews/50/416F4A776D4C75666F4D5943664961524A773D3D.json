STORIA:Questa è la storia del Caporale Adrian Shepard,uno dei tanti soldati che sono stati mandati per coprire l'accaduto e,in seguito,uccidere Freeman.Come storia parallela a quella di Freeman ci dà una visione differente del primo Half-Life davvero soddisfacente e ricca,dato che ci mostra accenni di trama(che non spoilero) mai visti arricchendo così la storia della serie di Half-Life.Come ogni gioco della serie,questo ci sà dare una visione in tempo reale della trama.                                                                                                                                                                                    GRAFICA:La grafica dello stesso Half-Life,seppur datata e con qualche modifica per i modelli dei soldati o di alcune guardie,sà essere molto godibile e di grande accompagnamento durante il gameplay,con script dei modelli davvero fluidi e realistici.Beh del resto parlo del GoldSRC,un'engine che,nonostante possa sembrare un normale engine datato,ai tempi fu una vera novità.\nIA:L'IA (Intelligenza Artificiale) è davvero ottima,infatti gli avversari si nascondono quando capiscono che il pericolo non è alla loro portata e sanno fare gioco di squadra se più di uno,ma avrei qualcosa da ridire su quella degli alleati.Infatti se dei soldati vi seguiranno e si arriva ad un salvataggio,questi si fermeranno e dovranno essere richiamati,ma fin qui niente di fastidioso.Poi se ci sono delle torrette (ma non solo qui) a volte dopo averle distrutte uno dei soldati vi sparerà come se lui vi considerasse un nemico.L'altro bug da segnalare è nel livello del ponte in cui si trova il gargantua,infatti,dopo averlo ucciso i soldati che vi siete portati dietro stranamente non vi seguiranno e a volte il soldato che sta dall'altra parte del ponte non verrà da voi.Del resto saranno solo problemi che ho riscontrato io,ma mi hanno dato un pò fastidio.\nARMI:Il vostro arsenale è stato rinnovato con armi nuove sia militari e di Black Mesa sia aliene cambiando l'approccio con i nemici in modo molto rilevante tanto d'aver questa,una delle migliori novità del gioco assieme alla capacità di arrapicarsi sulle corde o sui cavi.\nGAMEPLAY:Come detto in precedenza,le nuove armi cambieranno l'approccio con i nemici,cambiando notevolmente il gameplay rispetto ad Half-LIfe.Esempio:se un nemico è girato o distratto potremo approfittare di ciò utilizzando il cirripede per attaccarci a lui e ucciderlo non appena la creatura non arriverà verso il suo \"pasto\".\nLe corde ci permetteranno di raggiungere punti irraggiungibili in mancanza di scale e nonstante siano poche le situazioni in cui è possibile farlo,questo elemento dona al gameplay un tocco in più.\nChe dire,Half-Life:Opposing Force è stato e sarà sempre una grande novità per ogni appassionato della serie donando qualcosa  di ancora più nuovo senza perdere però la stessa atmosfera claustrofobica e carica di tensione del primo Half-Life.\nEXTRA:Davvero divertenti i sergenti che ci accompagneranno nell'addestramento dato che sono un chiaro riferimento al Sergente Maggiore Hartman di Full Metal Jacket.\nVoto:9/10","timestamp_created":1409340173,"timestamp_updated":1409340173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11892250","author":{"steamid":"76561198073317987","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":23,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1388940615},"language":"spanish","review":"Magnifico

It includes, as usual, both new single-player campaign that is almost the lenght of the original Half-life, with new enemies, weapons and even features, and Deathmatch multiplayer... even Team Deathmatch. And maybe Capture the Flag, but I am not sure about this one, never got to experience one. Once again, it first came out on retail before it got onto Steam. And yes, this one comes bundled with HD Models too.\n\nThe Single-Player campaign focuses on Adrian Shephard, your everyday soldier with his everyday tough soldier life. In this case he was sent as part of squad to the Black Mesa Facility to neutralise threat and finish that stupid Gordon Freeman who been killing his buddy too... good luck on that soldier. Because Gearbox introduced a new (generic) alien race along with new type of human enemies. On good side, you will more than once have a squad of your soldiers following you (who will die). That's it, until they meet a doorframe. Then it will be your job as commander to babypush them through.\nOh and on unrelated note, while in Valve-made HL games NPCs behaved as if protagonist actually says nothing, Gearbox's NPCs make you aware that silent-for-us protagonist actually speaks something for them, just a curiousity.\nAs for features... You got nightvision, which is light flashlight, but it creates small-radius light from your position. Ropes mechanic were introduced, which feels awkward and wacky, but still do their job. New weapons were introduced, including hand-sized barnacle to pull you around the level and even two melee weapons for no good reason, along with some heavy-damage dealing military and biological weapons. Though I dislike how they pretty much underused Valve's own alien species in preference of their own new ones. They are kinda too generic. Hell, laster-shooting alien soldier? Yep. Hard to avoid shots in open. Cooks your squad members in few seconds too, so once again you will have to go first and babysit your NPCs like in many games from that time.\nActually, whiel campaign seems to be long and not without effort, I feel that it ended up being repetive, it seems to be easier to lose motivation to continue in this addon, and knowing how many people who I know would stop playing at mid of HL1... \n\nMultiplayer... Well, compared to HL1 multiplayer, this one is almost dead... Well, not fully. I still could find servers, 1-2 servers with 1-3 players. Quite a so-so. Yep, it comes with new weapons that you are familiar from single-player. Not much is different though, but I did get to play on map with vertical gameplay, with usage of pet barnacle to pull self around, and that was pretty nice.\n\nP.S.

Just... wow. At first I went into this game prepared for a shameless cash making title by Gearbox. Well, let's put it this way, it's no Blue Shift. In a good way though. Instead of depending on references to the original to add any form of excitement, direct references are minimal, but awesome (You can murder Gordon Freeman and cause a paradox, teleport to the hazard course, and uncover the secrets of Black Mesa). None of those are even the high points (well maybe the paradox). First off new mechanics: your reticule reacts to being over enemies, and a squad command mechanic to unite with fellow soldiers. Obviously the major new mechanic is the squad command, is it any good? Well... Yes, but also no. What do I mean? It is pretty fun, interesting, and cool. However it is fundamentally flawed. There are three types of fellow soldier, heavy machine gunners that obliterate your enemies quickly, medics that heal you and can fight, and defense engineers that in addition to shooting also take doors down. Well that sounds cool, but they are pretty dumb. They always get in your line of fire, you have to beg to get healed and take down doors (mash 'interact' button like some maniac), and run right into bombs and trip mines. \"Davey, hurry up with that door!\" \"Yes Corporal\" *clunk* \"Davey, nooooooo! Not that blue laser!\" \"What?\" *boom* Yep that's definitely the worst part of the AI. Absolutely nothing else. Oh, what that elephant in the room, nah ingnore it it's fine. *Sigh* Okay I have to adress the elephant in the room. When you cross into a new chapter they... well they don't do anything. No, really they just stop and stare as you walk away in an almost creepy fashion. So, yeah not so wonderful, but it can still be cool at times. So anything else new? Oh, boy is there new stuff. Sniper rifle, night vision, heavy rifle, desert eagle with laser, pipe wrench, combat knife, barnacle grapple, shock raches, spore launcher, and the displacer cannon. Tons of new enemies that I couldn't even begin to mention to avoid spoilers, but let's just say prepare to run and gun for your life. It's got new maps, but in my opinion, they aren't quite as ingenious as the original maps. Well I have to admit I love the new variety, especially the new weapons. As always what you're supposed to do is often a process of trial and error, but I as an avid Mega Man player have gotten used to that. I guess if I have to be a downer the music isn't quite as good.

Die Handlung entspricht der aus Half Life,jedoch aus den Augen Shephards,so findet man sich teils in bekannten Umgebungen wieder aber darf natürlich auch neue Gegenden erkunden.Befreundete Soldaten unterstützen Shephard im Kampf,leisten erste Hilfe(Sanitäter) oder öffnen den Zugang zu neuen Bereichen(Pioniere).Einige Waffen wurden ersetzt,beispielsweise bekommt Shephard statt einem Revolver eine Desert Eagle und es wurden auch völlig neue wie ein MG und weiteres Alienarsenal hinzugefügt.\n Opposing Force erzählt zwar nicht die Geschichte von Half Life weiter,es ist aber dennoch lohnenswert den Vorfall in der Black Mesa Forschungsanlage einmal mit anderen Augen zu sehen. Die Neuerungen lassen keine Langeweile aufkommen und es wird ein etwas anderes Licht auf die Soldaten geworfen,die letztendlich auch um ihr Überleben kämpfen müssen.\n\nInteressanterweise wurden in der Deutschen Version diesmal nicht die Soldaten durch Roboter ersetzt wie im Hauptspiel. Blut- und Splattereffekte sind jedoch entfernt worden.\nGlücklicherweise gibt es eine Möglichkeit,diese Änderungen rückgängig zu machen.

The latter often work out nicely (i.e. the Portal Gun that lets you go back to Xen to stock up on health and energy, or the Barnacle Gun that serves as a grappling hook of sorts), while others could have used some polish - the rope climbing mechanic feels very akward, and the AI of the small squad you're occasionally put in charge of is nothing short of suicidal. And since you actually are part of the HECU unit you would normally fight, the standard enemy soldier now is replaced by some mysterious Black Ops that works exactly the same - not exactly a creative solution. Finally, the End Boss doesn't deserve the name (admittedly, Blue Shift had no End Boss at all, but its still a shame seeing how cool the battle against HL1's Nihilanth was).\nDespite of these flaws, Opposing Force still is a fantastic FPS, with a broad arsenal of interesting weapons, challenging enemies (I'm looking at you, Ninja Girls) and a wide range of environments ranging from the laboratories and deeper maintenance shafts of Black Mesa to ruined surface areas and finally the strange world of Xen.","timestamp_created":1404555827,"timestamp_updated":1404555827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11076969","author":{"steamid":"76561198140750181","num_games_owned":665,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":62,"last_played":1495305989},"language":"spanish","review":"una nueva aventura para Half-Life pero desde el punto de vista de los soldados.

Blue Shift rimane simile a ad Half Life, non porta nessun cambiamento, sia come armi che nel gioco (anzi ha molto di meno di HF). Opposing Force invece può essere un vero e proprio Half Life!! Numerose armi di combattmento, armi aliene, durata maggiore.\n\nCerto! Usare i saldati che vogliono uccidere Freeman (e che Freeman ha tanto ucciso) sembra un po’ strano, ma in questo capitolo si nota anche l’altro punto di vista. Non per altro anche i soldati hanno fermato una minaccia aliena (vedi finale). Del resto il Gman ha determinato sia le sorti di Freeman che del soldato.\n\n+ Un gameplay vario e bello.\n+ Novità in armi, tra cui il tanto atteso cecchino (anche se si sblocca molto in là nella campagna :-( ), il mitragliatore pesante e il coltello. Ma voglio anche citare la famosa arma aliena usata come rampino!! :-D  \n+ Nuove modalità, no bhe, solo la corda, ma rendolo il gameplay un po' più vario.\n+ Un arma corpo a corpo diversa dal solito piede di porco di Freeman, con l’aggiunta del coltello.\n+ La modalità di addestramento è simpatica! :-) (è obbligatorio farla per capire le cose “nuove”)\n+ Un po’ di tattica con i soldati.\n+ Il Gman compare molto spesso e si vede come lui cambia ha cambiato destino dei personaggi.\n+ Raggi X per vedere nel buio.\n- Completamente in inglese, non ho capito molto della trama.\n- Freeman si vede una sola volta! -.-! E meno male che dovevamo ucciderlo!! -.-!!\n\n\nUn consiglio, non “risparmiate” ad usarle le armi forti per il finale!

It really opens up a whole new view to the story and brings a more clear understanding to many things that happened during the original Half-Life game. \n\nOpposing Force is much more than a simple expansion with a quick story of the HECU Soldiers, it contains it's own Hazard Course in the form of BOOT CAMP, has a vast variety of new hostiles (Black-Ops additions, Race-X, New Boss Aliens etc.), new weapons and just an outright brilliant experience exploring new and old areas of Black Mesa. \n\nOne of the most memorable games of my childhood was Half-Life and Opposing Force by extension.

La primera expansión lanzada de ''Half Life'' te pone en el pellejo del cabo Shepard, quien tiene una misión de limpieza en los laboratorios Black Mesa, es decir, eliminar a todo lo que se le ponga por delante, ya sean xenianos o humanos. Sin embargo su prioridad es eliminar al doctor Gordon Freeman, el protagonista del ''Half Life'' original. La expansión es bastante interesante, ya que nos pone en la piel de los malos y muestra como se desarrollan los sucesos de Black Mesa desde un punto de vista alternativo al de Gordon. Realmente para mi es una actualización muy bien hecha, no te revela cosas cruciales de la trama, simplemente te hace profundizar en la historia de Black Mesa. En esta expansión hay algunas armas diferentes a las del juego original, las cuales podrás usar a fondo con las hordas de enemigos a las que te tendrás que enfrentar porque este juego esta lleno de acción. La expansión tiene una durabilidad razonable teniendo en cuenta que es eso, una expansión.  Tengo que añadir que el juego no se puede poner en español no sé porque motivo, me he informado y sí existe una traducción en español pero no está disponible.\n\nResumiendo, esta expansión es más de lo mismo, pero sigue siendo igual de frenética que el juego original con alguna que otra novedad interesante.","timestamp_created":1403133085,"timestamp_updated":1403197227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.624530673027038574","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10515289","author":{"steamid":"76561198111512379","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1564574300},"language":"spanish","review":"Para empezar hay que decir que no tiene parche alguno.

You return to Black Mesa Research Facility from the persepective of a U.S. Marine on a mission to cover up the incident and elimanate Gordon Freeman. However, it doesn't take long for your objectives to change when the Xen aliens start overcoming the marines...and you're stranded (for the most part). As you progress, you learn what happened at Black Mesa when Gordon Freeman teleported to Xen and G-Man's role there. \n\nGameplay and graphics are pretty much the same as in the original. But there are enough changes to make the game feel fresh and stand strong on its own. Instead of a flashlight, you have night vision goggles. More alien weapons including a Barnacle sucker. New human weapons consist of a sniper rifle and a Desert Eagle. You have friendly marines to assist you at certain points. And a new alien race called Race X stands in your way, and these bad boys are a tougher animal than the Xen. Oh, and the training portion of the game is stocked with Full Metal Jacket references. \n\nYou may have heard that this game is tougher to get through compared to the original but if that discourages you from purchasing, I remind you that the difficulty is adjustable.

Zaměřím se proto hlavně na rozdíly obou her a na novinky, které tento přídavek přináší. Jmenujete se Adrian Shephard a společně s ostatními vojáky, máte zajistit výzkumný komplex Black Mesa. Došlo v něm totiž k vážné nehodě, s katastrofálními následky. Při leteckém přesunu se ale vaše helikoptéra zřítí, a vy se probouzíte beze zbraně v jedné z laboratoří. Vaše mise může začít...\n\nPrvní výraznou změnou, je menší rozlehlost herních lokací. Už proto nebudete hledat několik spínačů, které jsou rozesety v různých patrech komplexu. Pro překonání většiny překážek, vám stačí jen rozhlédnout se po místnosti. Hra je tak plynulejší a více přímočará.\n\nČekají na vás také noví nepřátelé, kterých není mnoho, ale o to víc jsou nebezpeční. Jejich zdolávání je zábavné, ale mnohem obtížnější, než přestřelky z původní hry. To je další z důvodů, proč tento datadisk působí více akčním dojmem. \n\nTěšit se můžete také na nové zbraně, a to jak na ty klasické, tak i na ty méně obvyklé. Velice jsem si oblíbil jednu speciální, která vám umožní přesun na vzdálená místa, skutečně originálním způsobem.\n\nDatadisk jsem dohrál přibližně za šest hodin a celou dobu mě bavil.

It keeps the solid core gameplay from the original, but adds in new weapons, enemies, and puzzles - and they really are new puzzles, not just the old ones rearranged.  You'll also see your old nemeses - headcrabs, Vortigaunts, and the like.  A select few scenes from the original are revisited, but for the most part new areas of Black Mesa are explored.  Of particular note is that you can use more small alien specimens against your enemies than just the snarks from the original - and sometimes, this is necessary to succeed.\n\nIf you haven't played the original Half-Life, you should probably start there, to get the background story for this one.  However, you could jump right in to Opposing Force without playing the original.  Just play the tutorial first, and you'll be okay.  Along the way, non-playable characters will fill you in on what's been going on.  Like the original, the gameplay mechanics are excellent in Opposing Force.  So if you're debating whether to get the original or try this one first at half the price, you can't really go wrong either way.\n\nI would consider Opposing Force to have lived up to the quality of the original.  It's shorter, but it's also less expensive, so I wouldn't consider that an issue.","timestamp_created":1402251180,"timestamp_updated":1402251180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10386920","author":{"steamid":"76561198100811906","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":575,"last_played":1659283688},"language":"english","review":"I have played this for a long time and I have absolutely loved it.\nAlthough I am very picky, This expansion is one of the best games I have ever encountered.'\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1402179518,"timestamp_updated":1402179518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503759443759918213","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10383210","author":{"steamid":"76561198057958644","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":648,"last_played":1582697697},"language":"english","review":"A fine addition to the Half_life series.

Não se trata de uma sequência, mas sim de acontecimentos  que ocorrem em simultâneo. O personagem principal esta vez não é Freeman, mas sim Adrian Shepard, um dos oficiais de elite (HECU) que foram enviados à instalação durante o capítulo dos escritórios em HL1.\n\nOcorre que antes mesmo de chegar a base, a aeronave em que Shepard e sua equipe estava foi atingida por uma descarga elétrica e caiu, antes mesmo de os soldados receberem as ordens sobre o que eles deveriam fazer em sua missão, ou mesmo qualquer informação sobre o que de fato estava acontecendo.\n\nShepard fica desacordado por um bom tempo, e só retoma a consciência já no final de HL1, quando os militares abortam a missão e estão prestes a deixar a instalação. Porém ocorrem interferências alheias que fazem com que Shepard não chegue a tempo à nave de fuga e a partir daí passa a buscar outra forma de sair do local.\n\nO jogo funciona da mesma forma que o original, mas desta vez foram adicionados novos tipos de alienígenas com personalidades muito mais hostis e muito mais fortes que os do primeiro jogo. Aliás, os aliens antigos praticamente não aparecem após a metade do jogo, talvez em decorrência do desfecho de HL1. Além disso, agora se pode usar algumas armas alienígenas.\n\nUma coisa legal, é que se manteve a preocupação em fazer os cenários de forma que fosse possível reconhecer os lugares por onde passamos no primeiro jogo. Em determinado ponto, inclusive, é possível ver Freeman.\n\nEnfim, Opposing Force é um grande complemento a aventura de HL1, que mantém o mesmo nível de qualidade do jogo original,  além de introduzir uma série de coisas novas.

You also have segments where you lead ai soldiers around so they can open doors for you and heal you. This is all to help you feel like you're part of the army descending on Black Mesa to find and kill Gordon.

You work your way up starting with the head crabs and moving on to special forces and new variants on aliens. You also get access to more guns throughout the game but it feels a little tacked on at times.
