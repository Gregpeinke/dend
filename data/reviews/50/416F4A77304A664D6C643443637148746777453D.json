Great addition to the original story. You're fighting on the opposite side this time, with troops trying to catch freeman. Several radio discussions from the original HL are caught here too, you can figure out how some levels are happening in parallel with the plot from the base game.\n\nNew weapons are really cool. Now you can fight with Xen weapons. Also you discover new parts of the facility where experiments were being made with aliens.\n\nI think I have to admit I enjoyed this one more than the original HL :).

Évidemment, il faut avoir jouer au premier pour comprendre. Il dure environ 4-5h.\n\nJ'ai trouvé l'histoire assez sympa, dans le thème, sachant que ça n'avait pas été développé par Valve à l'époque, mais par GearBox, une entreprise de jeu fidèle à sa réputation de l'époque ( je crois que de nos jours, ce n'est plus la même chose... ). \n\nVous avez le choix entre tuer tout le monde ou pas, ça n'a pas d'influance sur l'histoire, évitez quand même de zigouiller vos potes militaires, car eux sont tous autant très utiles les uns que les autres, vous avez des médecins, des ingénieurs ( capitaux pour ouvrir les portes pour progresser dans l'histoire ) et des mitrailleurs, sans compter des shotgunners et des riflers. C'est une IA très basique, elle est un peu dure d'oreille pour suivre, mais ça va, pas trop de difficulté, le pathfinder est correct.\n\nLa variété d'armes est identique au premier, avec l'addition d'un grappin/variante de l'arme abeille alien, et une variante du revolver. Les ennemis aussi ont quelques variantes, et le pack HD pour armes offre une toute autre alternative pour toutes les armes, ce qui est vachement bien pour un DLC de 1999.\n\nCertains puzzles sont en revanche mal expliqués, il faut bien réfléchir avant d'agir, sinon on fonce droit dans le mur, il y a de la créativité pour vaincre certains ennemis, et le grappin donne un peu de platforming. \n\nAu niveau de la difficulté, ouaip, les ennemis sont deux fois plus forts, il y en a des nouveaux beaucoup plus difficiles, la vie et l'armure descendent très rapidement si vous ne faites pas gaffe, sachant que c'est assez logique ; vous n'êtes pas Gordon, vous n'avez pas sa précieuse armure.\n\nAutrement, un très bon élément dans la collection Half-Life, la soundtrack n'est pas le point fort du jeu, mais il y a quelques instants où le jeu vous indique certains moments clés via les musiques, mais ça s'arrête à ça.\n\nSi un jour, un remake se fait de ce jeu, ça serait que du bonheur, c'est un jeu que je recommande à 100% pour tout les fans de la série.","timestamp_created":1505680734,"timestamp_updated":1505680734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.595290660858154297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35017120","author":{"steamid":"76561197999719850","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":4540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4070,"last_played":1610290538},"language":"english","review":"This game is a very well rounded expansion to the very first Half Life.\nIt shows new enemies, new weapons, and from another point of view.\nI would recommend this game, and he is much more harder than Half Life 1.\nMultiplayer is dead.

The game was a smash hit for fans of the original and brought some new elements to the playing field. The plot takes place during the second half of half-life and Instead of playing as gordon freeman, you play as the ordinary soldier Adrian Shephard. The story also has some new faces, good and bad.\n\nPROS:\n-The story is very well paced and put together very nicely. You play as Adrian Shephard during the cover up operation of the black mesa incident hunting down that dreaded gordon freeman. Not spoiling the rest in case you haven't picked up a copy in the 20 years its existed.\n-The environment is very immersive as it is a long seamless road to the end of the game with, as the definition of seamless implies, zero cutscenes or immersion breaking interruptions.\n-The gunplay involves the same weapons from half-life with plentiful new additions. The arsenal available is pleasently loud, very powerful feeling, and quite fun to use when eliminating the enemy.\n-The ending is good for what it is, it isn't news but spoiler alert [spoiler] no sequal [/spoiler].\n-Has an HD reskin to give a fresh coat of paint.\n\nCONS: (Not even half-life is safe from sin, sorry) Please note that i am extremely aware that this game is an oldy.\n-Controls feel floaty and thats not very great to say when this game is a puzzle platformer.\n-Same issues as the original, guns feel not very effective at some times and very effective at others. No idea whats going on here but it hasn't deterred me from playing. Also a specific enemy is very grenade happy, you'll know it when the time comes.\n\nThis game isn't too much of a must have as the original but usually it comes bundled with it so give it a play(used to come free). I picked the entire series up in a frantic buy in a summer sale and it was worth it. if anything it's textures for gmod if you don't have much interest in it.\n\n9 pipe wrenches out of 10\n\nNext up is Blue Shift.","timestamp_created":1505263999,"timestamp_updated":1505297664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34876575","author":{"steamid":"76561198123902671","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1593211297},"language":"english","review":"I would definitly reccomend it.","timestamp_created":1505104145,"timestamp_updated":1505104145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34873864","author":{"steamid":"76561198160632981","num_games_owned":594,"num_reviews":182,"playtime_forever":364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":364,"last_played":1590104627},"language":"brazilian","review":"Aqui estamos do outro lado da força (a dos Siths).\n\nNa minha opinião foi o jogo mais difícil, tem novos xenianos e varios puzzles.\n\nAgora na pele de Shephard, você tem o objetivo de cumprir a missão de soldado, mas passado em pouco tempo descobre q é melhor salvar sua vida.\n\nSem duvida eu recomendo MUITO!

The attack, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor, led to the United States' entry into World War II. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI, and as Operation Z during its planning.\n\nJapan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions they planned in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Over the next seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong.\n\nThe attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time. The base was attacked by 353[15] Imperial Japanese fighter planes, bombers, and torpedo planes in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers. All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged, with four sunk. All but the USS Arizona were later raised, and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship,[nb 4] and one minelayer. 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed; 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded. Important base installations such as the power station, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 64 servicemen killed. One Japanese sailor, Kazuo Sakamaki, was captured.\n\nThe surprise attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan,[18][19] and several days later, on December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. The U.S. responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been fading since the Fall of France in 1940, disappeared.\n\nThere were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan, but the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, \"a date which will live in infamy\". Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning, the attack on Pearl Harbor was later judged in the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime.","timestamp_created":1504456753,"timestamp_updated":1504456753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481657207012176514","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34706990","author":{"steamid":"76561198255053714","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46,"last_played":1614716257},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошее дополнение к HL1 про солдата который выжил после крушения вертолета.Мне он больше нравится чем оригинальный HL1","timestamp_created":1504431096,"timestamp_updated":1504431096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527773261070251465","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34699980","author":{"steamid":"76561198259187335","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":339,"last_played":1513904643},"language":"english","review":"how to smonk?","timestamp_created":1504403535,"timestamp_updated":1504403535,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471698105335235596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34696385","author":{"steamid":"76561198304581269","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1511495226},"language":"english","review":"This game is a TOTAL rip off of the hit game, HALF LIFE 1! how did they expect to get away with this? they even put half life in the name! you have to be joking! valve is likely gonna sue in the near future, this can't stand at all.","timestamp_created":1504389427,"timestamp_updated":1598133287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":15,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551614642143249512","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34679304","author":{"steamid":"76561198106227264","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1504336587},"language":"schinese","review":"和蓝色行动相同的是只有英文而且没有字幕，大部分剧情都需要靠自己的听力与理解。\n但这部资料片确实远超过了前者。\n\n强大但受限更多的新武器，枪法准确护甲超凡的新怪物，伤他点血就要打死你的队友，移速快但怎么也打不中你的黑衣部队以及本质其实是跟踪狂的Gman...[strike]劳资爬个下水道都能看到你？？\t[/strike]\n\n因为出现了甲厚伤害高的新怪物的缘故，游戏的难度比起最强保安是高了不少。但就解谜部分来说，经常会出现有飘在空中的发光球指引你的道路。队友的跟随系统有点蠢，要经常回头把路慢慢的再走一遍，他们才能看懂跟上你[strike] 我的战友们都是弱智吗！？[/strike]  [spoiler] 最终BOSS也比HL1的大头儿子顺眼了不少，虽然还是丑\t[/spoiler]\n\n[list]\n    [*]不要想不开去找外星人近战\n    [*]没有什么机关是一颗手雷炸不掉的，如果有，那一定是你扔歪了\n    [*]新武器伤害都很高，对你而言\n    [*]引爆任何物体时请先将友军拖远点，除非你要享受一下被左轮爆头的快感\n[/list]\n\n同样推荐随V社大包或打折时入","timestamp_created":1504340337,"timestamp_updated":1504340498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.683614253997802734","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34676645","author":{"steamid":"76561198305623876","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1847,"last_played":1606625664},"language":"english","review":"One of the most pwnage games of all time. opposing force , half life 1 > half lfie 2.
