It was given to me by a friend when I was in Grade 5 and I remember playing until the first part of 'Residue Processing'. By that time, holidays were over and my friend had entered the Xen world and I was full of awe when I saw him playing in a low-gravity world with alien weapons. I decided to return back to Half-life. But alas, I had to move houses and with the passage of time and age, I somehow forgot to continue playing Half-life.\n\nThen surprise surprise I saw the half-life pack on a steam sale. No second questions were asked and I immediately bought the pack. I had to finish this game. With its outdated graphics and linear gameplay, I wouldn't be surprised if people thought Minecraft 'looked' better than Half-life. But let me tell you, there is no other game (aside from Half-life 2) that could even come close to the brilliance of its gameplay. The storyline and the gameplay itself is revolutionary and not many games today can even compare to the shooter known as Half-life.\n\nI shall always remember today (15th August 2016) as the day that I finally finished the original Half-life after 14 years. Thank you Valve for making the game that introduced me to the world of gaming.\n\nI can finally sleep in peace before I move onto another masterpiece known as Half-life 2.\n","timestamp_created":1471261394,"timestamp_updated":1471261394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.738859236240386963","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24927805","author":{"steamid":"76561198000662252","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":78833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":49418,"last_played":1590846345},"language":"english","review":"didnt play it much but recommend it","timestamp_created":1471240913,"timestamp_updated":1481466883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24921770","author":{"steamid":"76561198049490025","num_games_owned":288,"num_reviews":120,"playtime_forever":3396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3369,"last_played":1612239358},"language":"english","review":"I left my computer on for like a day and a half now it says I have 56 hours.

The platforming is actually quite bad. It never works that well in first person unless climbing mechanics are made entirely contextual. In Half Life, of course, nothing is contextual and you are in complete control of Freeman at all times. When the numerous platforming sections come around, though, the game feels extremely sensitive and you are expected to jump and land onto some really ridiculously narrow platforms to progress. It becomes a real exercise in frustration, and trial and error is often the only way of knowing whether or not Freeman will land on the platform or fall right to his doom. I guess the creation of such an impressive physics engine means that the developers will make it their civic duty to show it off as much of it as feasible in the game. It's just that Valve took a little too much liberty in showing it off in Half Life. \n\nAs I've said before, Half Life is a near flawless game, let down only by it's jumping sections. Ignoring those, and you should, this is one of the very best FPSs ever made, possibly THE greatest FPS game ever made. It's ridiculously good. The worldbuilding is astonishingly lifelike, the aliens quirky and instantly iconic thanks to their imaginative designs, the weapon selection is marvellous and transformed the straightforward crowbar into a symbol of gaming culture and the story is one of the strongest in gaming. Seriously, the feeling of being part of a grand conspiracy far greater than your own understanding, together with being the unwitting hero tasked to save the world from an alien invasion and travelling through the chaos happening all around you makes for a rip-roaring roller coaster of a game that never gets boring or repetitive, well, ever really. \n\nGunplay is appropriately meaty and cathartic, yet with an added sense of realism that you didn't find with other FPS classics like Quake and Doom. I rate this game better than Half Life 2, on the grounds that the gameplay is just as good but the story can be treated as one holistic story rather than the mere beginnings of a grander story planned to be told in something like, say, erm a TRILOGY. Yeah it basically boils down to Half Life 1 not ending on a cliffhanger which will likely never be resolved, as it's sequel did. \n\nSo yeah, buy Half Life if you haven't already, experience one of the few games that can truly be called a 'Citizen Kane of Gaming' and don't read THAT much into the greater plot going on. That way, you can feel wholly satisfied with everything this amazing game offers and not go mad waiting for the final chapter to be released sometime in the next 3000 years.\n\n9.5/10","timestamp_created":1471195617,"timestamp_updated":1471789243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24902318","author":{"steamid":"76561198074203076","num_games_owned":314,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":970,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":970,"last_played":1467172309},"language":"spanish","review":"Una de las más grandes joyas de la industria de los videojuegos.

Öncelikle hikâyemiz, Black Mesa adı verilen gizli bir tesiste başlıyor. Gordon Freeman isminde bir MIT profesörünü canlandırdığımız bu başarılı kariyer, yanlış giden bir deney sonucu yerle bir oluyor ve Xen adı verilen öte-evren'den içerisinde bulunduğumuz tesise yoğun bir uzaylı istilası başlıyor. Anlayacağınız üzere, bu tesisten kurtulup olanları tüm dünyaya, tüm şeffaflığıyla anlatmak için elimizden gelen her şeyi yapacağımıza ekip arkadaşlarımıza söz veriyoruz. Bu süreçte karşımıza yaratıklar kadar zombileştirilmiş iş arkadaşlarımız ve hatta devlet tarafından herkesi öldürmek için görevlendirilmiş askerler bile çıkacak diyebilirim. Diğer noktalarına bakarsak, yapım grafiksel olarak çıkış yaptığı yıla göre fazlasıyla başarılı zira 1998 senesinde sunulduğunu düşünürsek yani ortalama yirmi beş yıllık bir oyun olduğunu düşünürsek son derece mükemmel desem abartmış olmam. Oynanış mekanikleri açısından da gerçekten akıcı ve tatmin edici düzeyde bir oynanış sunuyor. Bu anlattıklarım haricinde oyunun en sevdiğim, en bayıldığım yapımlar arasında ilk beş içerisinde olacağını da söyleyebilirim.

It was one of the first pioneers to have realistic and open ended level design and realistic/immersive atmosphere. \nThe game's graphics haven't aged very well, but thankfully the game comes installed with the HD pack, which updates weapon models and come NPCs to make them look crisper and not robot like. \nBut what really makes this game a classic is the gameplay and atmosphere. The gameplay is a mix of Run'n'Gun of older games (Doom, Quake) and the more realistic style of modern shooters. The balance of the enemies you will face on your journey is remarkable. They are tough, but the bullets you have to kill them seem about right. It is fun and with addition weapons you will get later makes it even more fun.\nThe A.I. of the soldier are also remarkable. They actually act as if they are soldiers in a squad, with them flanking and throwing grenades to weed you out. \nThe immersion of the facility you will be playing through is probably the best thing about this game. On my first playthrough, I barely noticed the story or stopped playing because I was so ingrossed. I think the limited graphics actually help the game here.\nMy only problem with this game are it's last couple levels. If you've ever played the game, you know what section I'm talking about.
