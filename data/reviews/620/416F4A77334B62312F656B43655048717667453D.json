Die Story die von Portal 1 weitergeführt wurde ist in diesem Spiel einer der besten, wenn nicht vielleicht sogar die beste die ich bisher erlebt habe. Auch neben der Story gibt es ein beinahe schon revolutionäres Gameplay dass sich bei sonst keinem Spiel auffinden lässt. Beide Sachen sind auf einem Niveau was sich sonst schwer finden lässt. Für alle die eine gute Story bevorzugen, ist das Spiel auf jeden Fall zu empfehlen. Für die die auch gerne zu zweit spielen, gibt es noch den Koop-Modus wobei die Server recht häufig abstürzen, das ist allerdings auch der einzige negative Punkt an dem Spiel.

评分：9/10\t[/h1]\n传送门2是由V社制作发行的一款第一人称射击解谜游戏，在传送门世界里，你手上的枪械并非是为了攻击敌人，而是用来发射蓝橙两色光圈进行传送，抵达一些平时到不了的地方。游戏于2011年发行，在当年TGA年度最佳游戏评选中遗憾地输给了另一个BUG级别的神作上古卷轴5。剧情上游戏承接1代，轻微剧透[spoiler]讲述从格拉多斯手下逃出来的雪儿在冰封多年后被机器人惠特利唤醒，前往寻找格拉多斯残骸的故事[/spoiler]游戏一共9章，通关时间在12小时左右，全成就需要双人合作，同屏或者联网皆可\n\n[h1]+更进一步的谜题\t[/h1]\n作为续作，在谜题设计这块V社自然花了更多的力气。比起一代稍显单调的解谜手法，二代新增了跳板，反射方块，光桥，弹跳/传送凝胶，还有可以缓慢传输的螺旋曲线[spoiler]原谅我捉急的表达==[/spoiler]更多的场景道具意味着更多样的解谜方式，你需要冷静地思考如何把场景内的东西有效的结合起来。综合来看，传送门（不论1，2）绝对是解谜游戏中的翘楚\n\n[h1] +富有深度的剧情\t[/h1]\n一代剧情比较简单，讲的是一个反抗的故事。到了二代，游戏解释了之前格拉多斯为何要杀光所有科研人员，其实这一切都是源于对约翰逊蛮横专制的报复。同时格拉多斯同雪儿在老实验区冒险的过程中，逐渐找回了自己的内心，最终的那一句“卡洛琳，删除”更是格拉多斯拥有独立人格（？）的最佳佐证。同时传送门的剧情表现形式也独具特色，玩家需要通过一些资料，甚至是背景的旁白声来了解这一切。同时游戏拥有多个结局[spoiler]最后开门丢出的那个带有爱心的方块堪称点睛之笔[/spoiler]极佳的剧情也使得传送门从一个优秀的解谜游戏上升到可以封神的大作级别\n\n[h1]+恢宏的场景\t[/h1]\n一代一共19关，除了最后逃跑阶段剩下时间基本都在实验室之间穿梭，布局千篇一律，格局也偏小。二代因为剧情关系加入了更多的外部空间，玩家经常需要把视角抬高来寻找传送点，有些场景制作还是相当大气的。同时值得表扬的是，哪怕场景再大，通往下一个关口的路也只有一条，对于路痴来说这是一个相当友好的设定[strike]永远也不必担心迷路或者走错路 [/strike]\n\n[h1] +联机关卡和创意工坊\t[/h1]\n传送门2有专门的联机关卡，需要2人同屏或者线上共同完成，也有专属成就[strike]本单机玩家通关了就摸了 [/strike]本作支持创意工坊，喜欢挑战的玩家还可以下载自制地图来挑战自我\n\n现在玩家越来越浮躁，快餐游戏逐渐成为主流，这也导致费时费力的硬核解谜游戏的市场越来越小，加上G胖“不会数3”的特性，有生之年我们可能很难看到传送门3了。在我看来其实2代的结局很不错了，有完美结局，也有坏结局。我们不能保证格拉多斯一定善良，但我们可以选择让雪儿始终如一。推荐给喜欢解谜游戏或者喜欢钻研游戏背景设定的玩家","timestamp_created":1554912310,"timestamp_updated":1562674095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50064687","author":{"steamid":"76561198370595191","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":11188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":92,"playtime_at_review":7877,"last_played":1660083143},"language":"english","review":"Its
