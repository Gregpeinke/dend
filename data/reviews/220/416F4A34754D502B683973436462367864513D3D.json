It's one of my favorite games. Here's why.\n\nYou start out generally weak, unfortunately. You see the G-Man who, in my opinion is a lazy plot device from Valve. After the weak start, you see your main enemy, Dr. Breen. One introduction later, you meet Barney Calhoun, a character from the previous games. He seems to be a rogue Metrocop (which is a common enemy in the first chapters) and has access to Combine technology.\n\nNow, let's get into the real meat. The combat system is great once you have the SMG, but that's a bit late. After that you just get more and more guns and at one point it starts to take shape. Though the game has weak spots scattered around, the highlights are really good.\n\nFor that alone, I reccomend this game to everyone with the cash to get it.","timestamp_created":1491264211,"timestamp_updated":1501968637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30932710","author":{"steamid":"76561198255451285","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1848,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60,"last_played":1607287261},"language":"english","review":"is great \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut were is half life tree\n","timestamp_created":1491262712,"timestamp_updated":1491262712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30931491","author":{"steamid":"76561198141264076","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":440,"last_played":1581981652},"language":"english","review":"HL3 was better imo","timestamp_created":1491256131,"timestamp_updated":1491256131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30929212","author":{"steamid":"76561198114858483","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":840,"last_played":1591568916},"language":"portuguese","review":"Foda pra caralho!","timestamp_created":1491247139,"timestamp_updated":1491247139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30928575","author":{"steamid":"76561197993529714","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":916,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":896,"last_played":1565438118},"language":"english","review":"Hell yeah!

I can be very lethal with a controller in hand. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said with a mouse and keyboard. To remedy this disparity, I figured I'd re-enter the world of arguably the most famous PC games of all time... Half-Life 2.\n\nI played this game back when it was packaged in \"The Orange Box\" for the Xbox 360. It was definitely enjoyable back then, and there is very little drop off over the years. Sure, the graphics aren't up to par with modern-day games, but they hold up a lot better than the original Half-Life. \n\nThe gameplay is very fluid. I found the machine gun and shotgun to be my two most used weapons outside of the gravity gun. I used the machine gun regularly throughout the entire game, and it excelled in medium-range combat. However, it had nothing over the shotgun in close-range scenarios. There were many times in which the shotgun kept me safe when I was caught off guard.\n\nSpeaking of getting caught off guard, this game had plenty of moments that startled me or made me jump from my seat. I mean, I've beaten this game over a decade ago. Yet, I seem to have forgetton how great this game is. The little instances in which some headcrab or other enemy popped up from around the corner or from some dark location scared me more than any other \"Horror\" movie or game has, ever! \n\nThe environments are well-thought out. There are plenty of objects to interact with, and there are forty-five health caches scattered throughout the game for those who wish to explore every nook and cranny that this game has to offer. \n\nThe entire story is presented while you control the protagonist, Gordon Freeman. There are no cutscenes. Instead, you can walk around and pay as much (or as little) attention that you'd like to the dialogue. Consequently, I found myself more enthralled by the events that took place. I lived in this world, and I cared about what happened.\n\nI'm sure that most people reading this review have already beaten this game, and that's fine. This game has been around for a while. That being said, this classic game deserves to be played again. It may not have the most memorable story, but it has some memorable set-pieces, and the enemies can be challenging at higher difficulties. Simply put, Half-Life 2 is a complete game that ages like fine wine. I appreciate this game a lot more now than I did over ten years ago. So will you.\n\nBuy this game.","timestamp_created":1490764041,"timestamp_updated":1511489154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":35,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.761190891265869141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30804276","author":{"steamid":"76561198100740854","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":1233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":877,"last_played":1502104548},"language":"english","review":"I have played it but never completed it \none day I will :/","timestamp_created":1490747939,"timestamp_updated":1490747939,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30801102","author":{"steamid":"76561198297560388","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":4170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3285,"last_played":1574950013},"language":"english","review":"It's not perfect, but if you're an FPS fan, then you should definitely play Half-Life 2 at least once.","timestamp_created":1490732974,"timestamp_updated":1520775149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30798629","author":{"steamid":"76561198070530170","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1592770913},"language":"english","review":"i love this game it is so fun","timestamp_created":1490725054,"timestamp_updated":1490725054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30798471","author":{"steamid":"76561198032750615","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":345,"last_played":1561747332},"language":"russian","review":"Ну это просто классика.\nНе жалею, что купил.
