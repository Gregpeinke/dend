Selbst 10 Jahre nach Veröffentlichung liegt es, in meinen Augen, noch ganz weit vorne im Genre. Kaum ein Shooter bietet eine so durchgehend interessante Story. Auch die Spielwelt reißt einen mit. Rapture ist schon relativ einmalig. Ganz groß hervorheben muss man aber das Leveldesign. Dieses ist wirklich sehr gut gelungen. Hinzu kommt ein bemerkenswerter Umfang. Kritikpunkte? Ok für die Erbsenzähler: Zu Beginn hat mal längere Zeit das Gefühl, dass die Waffen doch recht langweilig sind. Das ändert sich allerdings, sobald man beginnt sie aufzuwerten. Da wird so manche Steinzeitschleuder zur High- End Waffe. Hin und wieder vermisst man hier und da auch ein wenig Gegnervielfalt. \n\nTeil 2 der Serie ist in meinen Augen nur wenig schwächer als der erste Teil, bietet aber auch nur wenige Neuerungen. Auch hier findet man wieder ein hervorragendes Leveldesign und eine interessante Story. Es gibt mehr von dem (Guten) was man schon aus Teil eins kennt. \n\nBioshock Infinite hingegen wirkt recht frisch. Hier steckt zwar noch merklich viel vom Bioshock Original drin, bietet aber zahllose neue Elemente. Wie Teil zwei gibt es hier und da ein paar kleinere ( aber gut spielbare) Längen, der Plot der Story ist jedoch unvergessen und einmalig. Auf mich wirkte Infinite etwas linearer als die beiden Vorgänger, allerdings von der Kulisse her sogar noch etwas abwechslungsreicher als Teil eins. Kritik: Es gibt nur wenige Gesichtsmodelle für die NPCs, so dass man sich gelegentlich wie in einer Clonwelt vorkommt.\n\nAlle Teile haben auch etwas philosophisches, tiefgründiges, was einen als Spieler auch mal gedanklich mitnimmt. Ungewöhnlich für ein Videospiel. Letztendlich drei tolle Spiele, wobei Teil 1 und Infinite meiner Meinung nach mittlerweile Klassiker sind, weger der ungewöhnlichen und tiefen Story, dem sehr durchdachtem Leveldesign und natürlich der hervorragenden Spielbarkeit.","timestamp_created":1509834820,"timestamp_updated":1552422062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.663087785243988037","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36282410","author":{"steamid":"76561198003062976","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":786,"last_played":1511203243},"language":"english","review":"I still prefer the original Bioshock, but this one is a great game, with an insteresting story and great graphics.","timestamp_created":1509834733,"timestamp_updated":1509834733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36282390","author":{"steamid":"76561198119438933","num_games_owned":249,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":909,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":909,"last_played":1509903423},"language":"german","review":"Das ERSTE und EINZIGE Spiel, was ich je nochmal gespielt habe. \nEs ist und bleibt mein lieblingsspiel. \nGute Story, Gute Grafik, Guter Sound und ein \"sidekick\" der dir auch WAS BRINGT.\nIch liebe es.\nKauft es.\nBItte.","timestamp_created":1509834589,"timestamp_updated":1509834589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36281831","author":{"steamid":"76561198047089438","num_games_owned":234,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":736,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":736,"last_played":1509826514},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games i have ever played!

It reaches that same level of word building and immersion. The gunplay has been tightened considerably since the very clunky original Bioshock, although some aspects of the combat system have been cut (like the different ammo types of Bioshock  1). However, the average person won't miss these subtractions and will probably like the combat more for it (some strategies are more obvious). Elizabeth is a passable AI companion. Although not very helpful, at least she doesn't hinder you like some AI characters do (I'm looking at you HL2, with your terrible friendly AI pathfinding). On the whole, the enemy AI is just there to do it's job. Don't expect these guys to split the atom. The sky rail system along with the floating city setting makes for some really interesting level design, I loved using the sky rail to zip over and take out enemies on a nearby floating block. Overall, Bioshock Infinite is an amazing game. A game that I have no problems awarding a 10/10 score to, especially when the excellent DLC is considered.","timestamp_created":1509798300,"timestamp_updated":1509798300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467994600534439087","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36265837","author":{"steamid":"76561198201091498","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":981,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":570,"last_played":1538605102},"language":"english","review":"you dont beat the game, the game beats you﻿","timestamp_created":1509791766,"timestamp_updated":1509791766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36265637","author":{"steamid":"76561198107608419","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":815,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":815,"last_played":1510214845},"language":"schinese","review":"流程有点短","timestamp_created":1509791178,"timestamp_updated":1509791178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36265157","author":{"steamid":"76561198370825909","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1312,"last_played":1565167953},"language":"spanish","review":"Este es un juego, que de principio a fin tiene altas y bajas, una gran historia, grandes personajes, un final muy confuso, pero sobre todo un juego completamente disfrutable.
