Graficamente e con gli effetti di luce è veramente spettacolare e molto godibile da vedere anche adesso, di gameplay ci sono state notevoli e piacevoli aggiunte oltre che ad un miglioramento generale e ad un ampiamento dei sistemi di superamento dei test, grazie proprio a delle nuove funzioni. La trama in Portal era bellissima già nel 1, ma qui è veramente spettacolare, molto più fuori dagli schemi, ben costruita e meglio articolata in tutto e per tutto, comprese le pochissime cutscene che si possono trovare. La co-op è fantastica, giocare con un amico e risolvere insieme le camere dei test è un'esperienza assai diversa dagli altri titoli giocabili in co-op, ha una trama anche qui, è particolare, divertente e relativamente duratura, anche se la difficoltà non è troppo esagerata secondo me. Con la funzione della comunità è possibile creare e condividere le proprie mappe con l'utenza, il che lo rende rigiocabile al massimo. Questo gioiello di gioco è un must have.","timestamp_created":1537870541,"timestamp_updated":1537870541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44926638","author":{"steamid":"76561198798738876","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1515381473},"language":"russian","review":"Кто с IGM про TOP игру ?)","timestamp_created":1537868052,"timestamp_updated":1537868052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44926087","author":{"steamid":"76561198196168109","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":593,"last_played":1625252430},"language":"turkish","review":"Muazzam.","timestamp_created":1537864712,"timestamp_updated":1537864712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44925828","author":{"steamid":"76561198428101862","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":9114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":854,"last_played":1658055669},"language":"tchinese","review":"好玩 兩天就過完單人的了","timestamp_created":1537863072,"timestamp_updated":1537863072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44925699","author":{"steamid":"76561198367753641","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":2404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1293,"last_played":1657811069},"language":"russian","review":"В общем, игра не для дебилов","timestamp_created":1537862316,"timestamp_updated":1537862316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541284441947937012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44925599","author":{"steamid":"76561198108868556","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":289,"last_played":1451658305},"language":"russian","review":"ну такое","timestamp_created":1537861639,"timestamp_updated":1537861639,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.387306451797485352","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44925513","author":{"steamid":"76561198101199176","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":288,"last_played":1537861004},"language":"koreana","review":"한번 해볼만한 게임\n\n단점 1. 막힐때 힌트가 전혀없다. 근데 이 마저도 걍 막힐때 끄고 다음에 시작하면 금방 풀리더라구요\n\n9 / 10","timestamp_created":1537861103,"timestamp_updated":1537861103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44925387","author":{"steamid":"76561198354410749","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":556,"last_played":1541065760},"language":"russian","review":"Это самая лучшая головоломка в которую я играл.\nПо сравнению с первой частью, игра улучшилась буквально во всем, начиная с графики заканчивая новыми плюшками в геймплее. \n\nИгра 10 из 10 \n\n","timestamp_created":1537860357,"timestamp_updated":1537860357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44925371","author":{"steamid":"76561198121367828","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":662,"last_played":1618812964},"language":"russian","review":"Покупал с другом.

I would easily pay $25 for it.","timestamp_created":1537749225,"timestamp_updated":1537749225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44903322","author":{"steamid":"76561198292272271","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1663,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":725,"last_played":1568844536},"language":"spanish","review":"Me ha Encantado. ;)","timestamp_created":1537747640,"timestamp_updated":1537747640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44902251","author":{"steamid":"76561198324961368","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1335,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":822,"last_played":1602121616},"language":"english","review":"11/10 perfect game","timestamp_created":1537741576,"timestamp_updated":1537741576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61336594820022583","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44902081","author":{"steamid":"76561198046697505","num_games_owned":1862,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":749,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":697,"last_played":1539910096},"language":"english","review":"Portal games are awsome, they are one of the best games i ever played.

And in a way it succeeded, but to a lesser degree. It does follow the same relative direction I just told you about, but it seems to to switch on and off at times. It becomes tiring (to an extent) when you re-meet  (INSERT SPOILER HERE), who would be your friend turned enemy in this game, and have go through a lot of chambers for a THIRD time just so you could get a stab at the boss. Luckily, this game saves frequently, so redoing large sections of the game is not a problem for most of the time. \n         One thing to compliment this game on? The story, the story, and the story. By god, if they didn't already formulate a complex and interesting yet somehow simple to comprehend story in Portal 1, then they expanded upon it greatly and hardly complicated it further in the process. I won't spoil it, because it has to experienced to be appreciated. \n         That's how I feel at the moment. I haven't downloaded any DLC yet, but I'm just talking about the game at hand, so that's fine and dandy. So this is where I stand: If you want an all round memorable game that is fun yet offers little storywise, Portal 1 is the right place to play. A more story inclined person with a longer attention span should get Portal 2, on the other hand. But both these games combined create the most fun and challengingly great games on Steam as a whole. I'm serious. This'll be the greatest twenty dollars (at most) you will ever spend. \n\nAlso, GLaDOS is like, the greatest character in a game, like ever, so yea. \n","timestamp_created":1537633500,"timestamp_updated":1537633500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44874542","author":{"steamid":"76561198213850391","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":18724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11172,"last_played":1551486728},"language":"english","review":"It's the best","timestamp_created":1537630573,"timestamp_updated":1537630573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44873184","author":{"steamid":"76561198287650746","num_games_owned":285,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":580,"last_played":1537588980},"language":"schinese","review":"Goodbye my only friend\nOh, did you think I meant you?","timestamp_created":1537626110,"timestamp_updated":1537626110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44871527","author":{"steamid":"76561198202672485","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":79,"playtime_forever":3119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":64,"playtime_at_review":1053,"last_played":1660001135},"language":"polish","review":"Świetna, gra przechodze ją chyba po raz 10 (przedtem grałem na PS3).
