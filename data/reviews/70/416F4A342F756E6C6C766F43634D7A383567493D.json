Sadece birinci şahıs nişancı türünü yeniden tanımlamakla kalmadı, aynı zamanda oyunları bir sanat formu olarak görme biçimimizi de değiştirdi. Half-Life, dünya çapında (ben dahil) birçok kişiye video oyunlarının gerçek etkileşimli deneyimler olabileceğini gösterdi. Half-Life, daha ilk andan itibaren dünyası ve karakterleriyle sizi içine çekiyor, tramvay sekansı 1998'de o kadar dudak uçuklatıcıydı ki. Oyun, hikaye, aksiyon, bulmaca çözme, senaryolu sekanslar ve platform oluşturmanın bir kombinasyonuydu; Half-Life, hayatta kalma korku hisleri de veriyor. Dürüst olmak gerekirse Half-Life interaktif bir roman gibi geldi, her an beni şaşırtacak bir sonraki şey için sayfayı çevirdiğimi hissettim, oyun durmuyor. Diğer birçok birinci şahıs nişancı oyununda süper insan gibisin ama Half-Life'da işine geç kalmış bir bilim insanısın, meslektaşlarının ihanetine uğramış, ordunun ihanetine uğramış ve bir çıkmaza saplanmış bir adamsın. komplolar, ihanetler ve korkunç sekanslar dizisi. Korku Half-Life'ın ana hedefi değildi, ancak Valve bu konuda başarılı oldu. Oyun sizi yalnız ve mahsur hissettiriyor, hayatta kalma içgüdülerinizi test ediyor ve birçok durumda size meydan okuyor. Bu oyundaki cephaneliğiniz olağanüstü, aralarından seçim yapabileceğiniz çok sayıda silah ve kampanyayı oynamanın birçok yolu var. Oyun onu düşman çeşitliliği ile öldürür, düşmanların her birini daha ilginç kılan büyüleyici irfanları ve tasarımları vardır. Half-Life'daki seviye tasarımı, zamanı için çok devrim niteliğindeydi ve şimdi oynaması son derece akıcı ve eğlenceli. Oyunun sanat stili, xen seviyeleri dışında kampanya boyunca tutarlıdır (bunu daha sonra alacağım). Her bir sayaç akılda kalıcı ve zorlu, hikaye çok fazla bükülme ve dönüş getiriyor ve anlatımın kendisi sizi asla sıkmıyor ve sizi her zaman diken üstünde tutuyor. Half-Life herkesin sahip olması ve oynaması gereken bir klasik, mükemmel mekanik ve oynanışla dolu bir oyun; Half-Life, 1998'de video oyunlarının birçok yasasını çiğnedi ve yeni standartlar belirledi; Bioshock, Halo, DOOM 3 gibi oyunların tümü bu oyundan etkilenen ürünlerdir. Orijinal oyunu oynamanızı şiddetle tavsiye ederim, steam versiyonu yine de harika. Xen seviyeleri hala zorlu ve oynaması eğlenceli, Interpoler ve Gonarch'ın sığınağı benim favorilerimden bazıları ve son boss çok tuhaf ve benzersiz; bu sadece başka bir sıkıcı dövüş değil, tüm becerilerinizi gerektiren bir dövüş. Oyunun son kısmı çok unutulmaz ve ikonikti. Final, herkesi Half-Life 2 hakkında çok heyecanlandırdı ve yorum için çok fazla alan bıraktı. Half-Life, esintilerle geçebileceğiniz bir oyun değil, tüm dikkatinizi gerektiren bir oyundur. Oyun, durumları deneyimlemenizi ve yavaşlamanızı istiyor. Half-Life bir aksiyon oyunu değil, içine yerleştirilmiş yoğun aksiyon bölümleriyle çok hikaye odaklı bir oyun. Half-Life franchsie'yi ya da en azından ilkini oynamadıysanız, bu incelemeyi okuduktan sonra oynamalısınız. \n","timestamp_created":1624362894,"timestamp_updated":1624362894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.655472397804260254","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94161009","author":{"steamid":"76561198882309129","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":352,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":259,"last_played":1648995973},"language":"turkish","review":"Eski zamanlarda çıkan bir oyun olmasına karşın hem tek hem de çok oyunculu alanda oynanırken insana zevk veren ve vaktini boş değil dolu geçirmesini sağlayan çok güzel bir oyun tavsiye ederim","timestamp_created":1624362160,"timestamp_updated":1624362160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94161006","author":{"steamid":"76561199021560671","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1712,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":415,"last_played":1649859046},"language":"turkish","review":"ayhana s2ş \n","timestamp_created":1624362147,"timestamp_updated":1624362147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94160185","author":{"steamid":"76561198454332331","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":635,"last_played":1652149496},"language":"english","review":"A classic.","timestamp_created":1624360805,"timestamp_updated":1624360805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94157332","author":{"steamid":"76561198443383288","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2100,"last_played":1624354817},"language":"english","review":"we do a little bit of USER DEATH IMMINENT","timestamp_created":1624355825,"timestamp_updated":1624355825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94149819","author":{"steamid":"76561198253512265","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":973,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1628978810},"language":"english","review":"cool","timestamp_created":1624340988,"timestamp_updated":1624340988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94149620","author":{"steamid":"76561198177277923","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1087,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1039,"last_played":1624343927},"language":"english","review":"It's pretty good.","timestamp_created":1624340584,"timestamp_updated":1624340584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94148559","author":{"steamid":"76561199095391433","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":1242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":703,"last_played":1654197199},"language":"polish","review":"chyba nic odkrywczego nie napiszę w tej recenzji o half life.

The sound design is the same loop and when other sounds are playing, it becomes a horrible cacophony of noise. If you like tinnitus - this is perfect for you. \n\nThe graphics are old, yet very good even today. They really do set the mood of the whole game. The enemy design is also brilliant, every enemy is very different from the other and so you always have to learn how to counter every new enemy. \n\nIn combat, things fall apart. You are always the weaker enemy, which is partly the point, and bullets are scarce so really count if you don't want to take loads of damage. Combat is, however, the dominant feature, and you have to fight endless enemies that you have already met. It becomes almost a chore towards the end of the game, and it spoiled the experience for me. \n\nHalf Life is a long game. It took me about 15 hours to beat the game on my first playthrough (on normal difficulty). At times there were long parts (one up to 2 hours) that felt like fillers and that didn't need to be there. There were puzzles that gave you no help to solve so you're stuck trying to solve the puzzle until you randomly get to the answer. \n\nIt's not the best game ever, it's old and I got really motion sick at times. The thing that made this game enjoyable for me is the moments that aren't bad. If you stick with the game, there's so much it does right and these moments really make the game enjoyable and massively outweigh the negatives in Half Life.\n\nOverall, I'd probably give this game a 5/10 - not the best, but not by far the worst I've ever played either.","timestamp_created":1624285391,"timestamp_updated":1624783722,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94115427","author":{"steamid":"76561199149182112","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2307,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2241,"last_played":1638495978},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1624284491,"timestamp_updated":1624284491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94115314","author":{"steamid":"76561198451498028","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":912,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1650628057},"language":"english","review":"It brings me back :)","timestamp_created":1624284314,"timestamp_updated":1624284314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94112936","author":{"steamid":"76561198047661414","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":282,"last_played":1624449771},"language":"russian","review":"Старая классика, что сказать.","timestamp_created":1624281020,"timestamp_updated":1624281020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94108758","author":{"steamid":"76561198952558652","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2024,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":926,"last_played":1624535529},"language":"spanish","review":"Sin dudar este es el padre de de todos los shooters actuales eso si se le notan los años pero es igual de divertido.\n","timestamp_created":1624274350,"timestamp_updated":1624274350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94108323","author":{"steamid":"76561198799573735","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":990,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":739,"last_played":1659370053},"language":"english","review":"This classic shooter is probably the best 1900s game ever.
