With strikingly superior graphics for this games time and innovative story telling, this game honestly deserves a remaster.\nI remember sitting, waiting for this game to be released at a young age after beating the first Half-Life.\nThe story is fantastic, showing a different perspective. Instead of being the protagonist Gordon Freeman, you now take place as an antagonist known as Adrian Shepard. Moving on the the multi player, it is insanely fun. The excessive amount of explosions going on around you is an exciting add-on to this game. With servers still running 20 years later, this game is fantastic. Don't think that Opposing Force lacks a cooperative mode, because one Coop server is currently running with a maximum slot of 32 players per match.\n\nOverall, this game is a splendid masterpiece and I would recommend anyone buying. It's worth spending on a game such as this one.","timestamp_created":1627762330,"timestamp_updated":1627762330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.642857134342193604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96703432","author":{"steamid":"76561198805441351","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":786,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":348,"last_played":1656577645},"language":"czech","review":"je to dobrá hra","timestamp_created":1627752621,"timestamp_updated":1627752621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96701494","author":{"steamid":"76561198089847935","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":351,"last_played":1627750075},"language":"english","review":"Creatures and black-suit guys.","timestamp_created":1627750133,"timestamp_updated":1627750133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96700433","author":{"steamid":"76561199178036977","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":51,"last_played":1629722925},"language":"english","review":"cover-ups were not in my job description.","timestamp_created":1627748833,"timestamp_updated":1627748833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96698589","author":{"steamid":"76561198347800172","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":617,"last_played":1627586265},"language":"english","review":"its hl, can't be better","timestamp_created":1627746629,"timestamp_updated":1627746629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96690754","author":{"steamid":"76561198290308867","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1815,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1805,"last_played":1627737904},"language":"english","review":"Great game with Blue Shift and Half Life 1.

Например пулемёт: его можно задействовать против самых бронированных врагов, так как он стреляет крупнокалиберными пулемётными патронами (логично же); споромёт — как хорошая альтернатива гранатомёту (хотя он остался и здесь): имеет два режма стрельбы; гаечный ключ обладает большим разовым уроном (что особенно заметно на высокой сложности), однозначно вне конкуренции с ножом.\n\n• Музыка к модификации достаточно хороша и к тому же вписывается в него: я ещё не нашёл ни одного трека, который мне бы не понравился\n\n• Добавлено много врагов и союзников, причём очень разных; привнесли целую новую фракцию (Раса X); боссы тоже ничего, довольно простые даже на высокой сложности.\n\n• Дизайн карт модификации соответствует дизайну карт оригинальной игры.\n\n     Минусы:\n\n• Самый большой минус: баги. Игра и оружия весьма забагованные, причём это так и не исправили. В лифтах часто застреваешь, когда спускаешься вниз; deagle после стрельбы в воде больше не стреляет; гаечный ключ делает удар с задержкой. Одна дверь даже сломалась и перестала открываться, пришлось использовать консоль.\n\n• Враги по какой-то неведомой причине сильнее, чем в оригинале. Чёрные оперативники на низкой сложности умирают не с одного выстрела крупнокалиберного пистолета В ГОЛОВУ (как будто у них полный набор нано брони из Industrial Craft 2).\n\n• Половина нового вооружения создана явно для количества. Добавили нож и гаечный (точнее даже торцовый), хотя можно было добавить только одно из этого списка; ручным барнаклом совсем не повоюешь, разве что с хедкрабами; шоковый таракан восстанавливает внутренний боезапас даже медленнее, чем ручной улей из оригинала, да и не может самостоятельно наводить снаряд в полёте; перемещающее устройство самое то лишь против одного врага, хотя если патроны есть, то и для других задействовать можно; Deagle... Ну зачем... Зачем? Был же револьвер! Что он сделал разработчикам мода?\n\n     Модификация достаточно неплохая, да только \"сырая\". Как будто в WON версию играешь, но с недоработками. Valve могли исправить эти странные баги, но зачем, когда это не принесёт никакого дохода.","timestamp_created":1627232378,"timestamp_updated":1627463836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96346558","author":{"steamid":"76561199069660947","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":385,"last_played":1627216215},"language":"english","review":"i shat myself multiple times","timestamp_created":1627216723,"timestamp_updated":1627216723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96337356","author":{"steamid":"76561198040633137","num_games_owned":354,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":3494,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3454,"last_played":1649203602},"language":"english","review":"War Suferer :(\nThat's me :/","timestamp_created":1627203155,"timestamp_updated":1627203155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96335106","author":{"steamid":"76561198941497825","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1627199103},"language":"russian","review":"такой должна быть халва","timestamp_created":1627199395,"timestamp_updated":1627199395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96330168","author":{"steamid":"76561198334316042","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1627188621},"language":"english","review":"been spending the last half hour trying to keep my four man squad alive just to leave them behind by the rail train","timestamp_created":1627190595,"timestamp_updated":1627190595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96325815","author":{"steamid":"76561198285270510","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":360,"last_played":1646362148},"language":"english","review":"this is the best half life game. \n\n\n\nthank you for coming to my presentation","timestamp_created":1627183119,"timestamp_updated":1627183119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96323133","author":{"steamid":"76561198984689658","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":212,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1627178430},"language":"russian","review":"То чувство когда дополнение вышло лучше оригинала","timestamp_created":1627178451,"timestamp_updated":1628675770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96312497","author":{"steamid":"76561199085556202","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":134,"last_played":1626495962},"language":"english","review":"hecu eoic","timestamp_created":1627160081,"timestamp_updated":1627160081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522471904754638672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96306987","author":{"steamid":"76561198396491731","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":102,"playtime_forever":432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":432,"last_played":1590170427},"language":"english","review":"I wonder where Adrian Shepard went.","timestamp_created":1627152493,"timestamp_updated":1627152493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96296142","author":{"steamid":"76561198903968012","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":631,"last_played":1600628328},"language":"ukrainian","review":"Half-Life: Opposing Force - якщо коротко то це шутер від першої особи та в тому числі одне з доповнень для основної гри Half-Life. Half-Life: Opposing Force був розроблений компанією Gearbox Software у колаборації з Valve яке було випущене Sierra Entertaiment 31 жовтня 1991 року. Доповнення недодає нічого у ігровий світ (тобто сетінг та події гри залишилися не змінними) різниця лише у тому що ви граєте вже не за Гордона Фрімена, а за капрала Адріана Шепарда, солдата спецпідрозділу  HECU. \n\n▻ Що нового то?\nПеред тим як сказати зав'язку сюжету потрібно розповізти про те, що додали взагалі нового у цьому доповненні. \n\nЦе нова зброя. Єдина зброя яка лишилася із оригінальної частини це: Glock-17, пістолет-кулемет HK MP5 з підствольним гранатометом 203, дробовик Franchi SPAS-12, РПГ ATGM-400, гранати Mk II, радіокеровані фугаси,міні-пастки та снарки. Замість усім нам знайомого лому тепер гравець отримує трубний ключ та ніж, замість револьверу тепер Desert Eagle з лазером, а замість арбалету тепер снайперська гвинтівка M40A1. Щодо нової зброї вона є. Це ручний кулемет M249 SAW і розроблена у ``Black Mesa`` гармата зміщення XV11382, що представляє собою ручний телепорт і, як і тау-гармата або глюона гармата, яка використовує у ролі боєприпасів контейнери з ураном -235. Інопланетну зброю крім Снарке, представлено ручну  Барнакль(служить як аналогом гака з мотузкою, але також дозволяє вбити дрібних ворогів), спорометателем(являється личинкою шокового соладата Раси X, плюється зеленими спорами) і шоковим тарганом, що стріляє електричними розрядами і мають нескінченний  боєзапас, подібно ручному вулика з Half-Life\n\nВ мережевій грі присутня уся зброя з обох ігор, а в доповненні  Capture Flag з'явився ще один вид зброї - пінгвінчики з гранатою, що діють аналогічно Снарке.\n\nНаші нові вороги. Крім основних ворогів із оригінальної Half-Life, в Opposing Force присутні також нові вороги. Так, серед основних ворогів нам доведеться зустрітися не тільки з мyдакaми з всесвіту Зен, але і з прибульцями з нової Раси X, яка має свої  цілі і з'являється виключно у частині Opposing Force. Якщо в оригінальній частині Half-life людським противником для гравця був спецпідрозділ HECU, то у іншого є свої вороги в цьому доповненні - Чорні оперативники. Ці спеціальні війська були послані, щоб повністю знищити Black Mesa і ліквідувати не тільки прибульців і персонал дослідницького центру, а й військових з підрозділу HECU. В оригінальній частині Half-Life ми вже билися з представниками оперативників - це були жінки у чорному костюмі, в Opposing Force крім них присутні і чоловіки, а також різна військова техніка. Серед ворогів-прибульців з Зена в Opposing Force теж з'явилися невеликі поповнення у вигляді нових зомбі - гоном, що є результатом тривалої мутації зараженого хедкрабу людини і більш небезпечним різновидом зомбі, а також зомбованих солдата HECU і охоронця Black Mesa, чия броня надає їм більшу стійкість, ніж у звичайних зомбі. Також різні прибульці по типу печерного хробака.\n\n▻Сюжет\n\nВсе теж саме, що було у першій частині, але від обличчя іншого персонажа. Тут ви будете грати за (як ви зрозуміли) Адріана шепарда який прибув у Black Mesa за особливим завданням. Я не буду повністю пересказувати та розповідати весь сюжет Half-Life: Opposing Force, але я так скажу взагалі, що він цікавий і ви отримуєте кайф від проходження.\n\n▻Підсумок\n\nСама гра представляє якраз таки шутер. Якщо брати та зрівняти наступну Half-Life: Blue Shift то це доповнення комусь сподобається більше ніж наступне (хоча мені сподобалися обидва доповнення). Короче якщо вам сподобалася оригінальна частина то можете впевнено купляти це доповнення та проходити його будьте впевнені вам сподобається.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1627138039,"timestamp_updated":1627138039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96290408","author":{"steamid":"76561198831991100","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":552,"last_played":1608978586},"language":"russian","review":"Мне понравилось!.. =)","timestamp_created":1627130288,"timestamp_updated":1627130288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96273867","author":{"steamid":"76561198822968496","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":572,"last_played":1654648230},"language":"spanish","review":"It´s a masterpiece of game, valve i´m still waiting for opposing force 2 :D","timestamp_created":1627102244,"timestamp_updated":1627102244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96263989","author":{"steamid":"76561198294021418","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":343,"last_played":1627017005},"language":"spanish","review":"La mejor expansión que tuvo el primer Half-life, con muchísimo contenido nuevo como armas y enemigos, un gran punto que su compañero Half-life Blue shift no agrego, también este es mucho mas largo que la otra expansión y muchísimo mas difícil (incluso mas difícil que el mismo Half-life).","timestamp_created":1627084634,"timestamp_updated":1627084634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96263629","author":{"steamid":"76561198298480408","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1627083604},"language":"spanish","review":"juegaso pero se cae a pedazos comparado al half life 1","timestamp_created":1627084015,"timestamp_updated":1627084015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96258353","author":{"steamid":"76561199066558360","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":375,"last_played":1626891635},"language":"russian","review":"Игра крутая, но есть моменты в конце игры которые хер как проходить.
