I’m not much for shooters, but I do love this game.  If you’ve ever played a wave-based zombie-type gun thing and thought, “this is awful fun but about as deep as a puddle,” this may very well be the game for you.\n\nKilling Floor is quite simple on its face, and it's arcadey in a really positive way.  The zeds (this is the in-lore word for what are essentially zombies) are really just walking health bars that you need to reduce to zero with your chosen damage machine before you get smacked around.  That said, there are nine discrete types of zed that you’ll encounter wave-to-wave, and any given quantity and combination of those nine warrants a unique response.  There are also lots of effective ways to deal with each individual zed.  Though you are dealing with the same 10 waves of baddies every game, it’ll never feel exactly the same game to game.\n\nThe danger is also very present in this game.  You can close off the entrances to some areas with your welder, but that’s almost always a strategic move rather than a “Ha ha!  Now you are in a space where I can shoot you but you cannot attack me!” move.  If you are able to shoot the zeds, that usually means they are able to charge full-speed at you, and if you truly close off every entrance the game will keep spawning baddies until they blow open all the doors and swarm you en masse.  So hiding isn't really an option.  This is a positive thing.  It either leads to a very intense, dangerous camping strategy with a constant stream of enemies, or a very intense, active kiting strategy with a mob at your back.  Both, you may have noticed, are intense.  The game is intense.\n\nThe game is also unyieldingly difficult.  There are five difficulties, and my buddies and I still can't guarantee a win on the top two difficulties after nearly a thousand combined hours of play (god help us).  Keeping with the arcadey shooter theme, the main differences between the difficulties are numbers.  Enemies are faster, stronger, and more resilient on higher difficulties because all of their numbers tick up.  Upgrading your equipment costs more, and you are less effective.  Most of these changes just mean you have to play better or get bonked.  I’m not going to say that there’s anything revolutionary here, but I appreciate how tough the game is.  When you go from getting your shit rocked on a difficulty, to being able to beat it most of the time, to moving up to the next difficulty and repeating the process, that feels like real progress.  And that first win on the hardest difficulty is pretty nuts.  We've managed it only four times.\n\nThere are also a number of classes (called Perks) to choose from-- everything from “Carefully Planned Headshot Friend” to “Lots of Bullets Assault Rifle Friend” to “I Have a Sword Friend” and more.  These perks level up over time and you get some pretty significant bonuses to damage and overall effectiveness once you hit the higher levels.\n\nThe systems in place for leveling these perks are also some of the most ridiculous that I have ever seen.  Let’s look at the leveling curve for the Commando, which is the assault rifle class.  To become level one in this class, you have to deal 25,000 damage with assault rifles.  That takes a couple of games.  To get to level six, which is the highest level, you have to deal 5.5 MILLION damage with assault rifles.  It takes quite a long time to do that.  I have a buddy who only plays Commando because he's stubborn.  20-odd hours into playing the game, he was only level four.  He's since reached level six, but he's at like 130 hours now.  I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing and I’ve really enjoyed slowly leveling up over my couple-hundred hours, but I want to publicly acknowledge that anyone who thinks this is stupid is correct.\n\nThe game hasn’t aged perfectly-- the player character animations are really bad, the footstep sounds are the same four or five clips played over and over, aaaaaand actually those are pretty much my only complaints.  The automatic player call-outs are a nice touch and really fun-- they all sound like they were recorded by someone who is not a voice actor but they have a really endearing energy to them and they happen all over the place.  Welding a door?  “I am WELDING this DOOR!”  Throwing money for other players?  “Cash here, grab it all.”  Reloading?  “RELOADING!!  CAN’T YOU SEE I’M RELOADING?!!  NEW MAG, GIMME A SEC!!”  They’re great.\n\nSo basically, it’s a super fun, surprisingly deep game that I can’t seem to get enough of.

KF is one of those games that for all respects and purposes should be labelled as bad, but only a shallow fool would label this game with that title. \nA newcomer to the game will note that Killing Floor runs off of the horrendously outdated engine, Unreal 2. This is evidenced by redundant control bindings, low poly models and low-res texture sheets, and the voice acting for the survivor characters is that of two cockney accented Brits and is laughably bad, with foreground sound assets that sound mildly cheap to the ears of the inexperienced.\nNow, an ignorant person may think \"omg this gaem is so bad 0/10 uninstelld\". And a veteran of KF would respond by breaking into their house at night and smothering them with their own sweat-stained pillow.\nKilling Floor is a game that does not rely on immersion, high-end graphics or extreme emphasis on realism, Killing Floor is a game that requires one to shut off their thinking processors and just have fun with it. \nAs stated previously, KF is a game with a heavy emphasis on cooperative challenge, in this people are encouraged to bring together a group of buddies, grab a firearm and fire away at the sea of mutant flesh inching their way towards you. \nThe gameplay is fast-paced and challenging, rewarding players for cooperation and working together like a well-oiled machine. Waves grow increasingly difficult by not only adding more and more freaks but also mixing up the enemy composition randomly, forcing players to think on their feet without using pre-scripted wave composition. For each enemy the player kills, they earn \"Dosh\" (which is what the characters call British Pounds) to purchase more powerful weapons, armor and to restock on ammo. The trader who supplies this surplus changes location on the map after each wave and is only open during the 60 second downtime between slaughters, so in order to make efficient time the players cannot simply sit and camp during the wave but instead they have to stay on the move and find her. Players are also capable of supporting eachother in numerous ways to prevent anyone player from falling behind, by sharing money, weapons and healing a well-tuned team can overcome any adversity that inches it's way towards them. However, the Trader's location is always random, meaning that sometimes she can appear at the same location that she was in during the previous pitstop, which is boring, and her constant and repeated sexual innuendo becomes tiring increasingly fast, resulting in the Trader being a disliked character by the community.\nThe game also utilizes seven player classes, or \"perks\" that offer bonuses for their respective field of expertise and grant discounts on perk-specific weapons per level. Perks can be levelled up by playing that class the way it was meant to be played, Sharpshooters level up with headshot kills, Field Medics level by healing allies and Demolitions by explosive damage. A sour note with these perks is that they are a massive grind headache to level up, particularily those that require dealing points in damage, since they need thousands of points to the next level, the player needs to play on higher difficulties to maximize this effectiveness, but the drawback to this is that even making it to level 2-3 requires a lot of damage done so they would be ineffective on those difficulties. While this encourages players to invest playtime and increasing the challenge to themselves to reach that ever-so-satisfying reward of a maxed out perk, it is still quite a headache. Especially for levelling up the Commando and Support Specialist perks. \nAt the end of all the waves is a \"boss\" wave in which the players must pool their resources and grab the biggest, most painful weapons on the market in preparation to fight the \"Patriarch\", who is the mutated fugly kingpin behind the outbreaks. The Patriarch is massively overpowered, dealing incredilous sums of damage through all his sources, including a chaingun/rocket launcher arm and a tentacle-thingy in his chest. He has a huge healthpool, which when nearing depletion he has the ability to turn 99% invisible and run away, calling in a mini-wave of smaller enemies to distract the players while he charges off to heal. Thankfully, he can only do this a total of three times, but this adds to the hardcore challenge that unprepared players will have no chance to survive. Due to his overpoweredness, I personally dislike the Patriarch battles and I rarely take part in them. \nSince teamwork is such a heavy asset to the game, it comes as a terrible shock to learn that Killing Floor has a simply terrible fucking microphone system. Players speaking through the in-game voice chat have their voices plagued with static and low quality filters, making communication near impossible in-game, so a third-party voice chat system like Skype, Mumble or even tried-but-true Steam Chat is HEAVILY recommended. \nTo summarize Killing Floor, I can say with utmost confidence that it is a high-challenge game with no handholding packaged in, and if players want to survive they have to damn-well earn it. \nSo despite it's tremendous flaws, Killing Floor is a game I'd highly recommend to players looking for a good time with friends or even if they want to join a game in progress and meet new people. \n\nOh and I almost forgot, Killing Floor has a crummy server-browser.

And you'll always have something to do, or a new challenge to complete!","timestamp_created":1386489472,"timestamp_updated":1386489472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7965544","author":{"steamid":"76561198056621755","num_games_owned":400,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1429014480},"language":"english","review":"2 much boooooty","timestamp_created":1386489128,"timestamp_updated":1386489128,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4978523850440979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7965520","author":{"steamid":"76561197997702438","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":43685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":42959,"last_played":1611943593},"language":"german","review":"Das beste Game der Welt.\n\neen zeer goede shoter.","timestamp_created":1386488953,"timestamp_updated":1406925746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7965516","author":{"steamid":"76561198061410784","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":464,"last_played":1402290981},"language":"russian","review":"ПРОСТЬО ВЕСЕЛО","timestamp_created":1386488934,"timestamp_updated":1386488934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7965455","author":{"steamid":"76561198092156369","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1069,"last_played":1392998371},"language":"thai","review":"Co-op มันจริงไรจริงนะครับ","timestamp_created":1386488444,"timestamp_updated":1386488444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7965388","author":{"steamid":"76561197971359224","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":17716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17424,"last_played":1415746476},"language":"english","review":"horribly addicting game!!

Расчлененка фактически отсутствует.\nТак же что очень портит статус данной игры так это куча не нужных DLC которые вносят лишь измененные модели оружия. Ну почти все, есть там пара DLC с новыми видами вооружения. Ну это скорее минус чем плюс. Я лично покупал целый пак со скидкой и ожидал чегото интересного, но увы нет.\nСюжета в игре нет, и не читайте все что написанно между строк в оглавлении игры. Это тупо выживалка в замкнутой карте.\nНо соглашусь что она не плохо позволяет скоротать часик и раслабится, да и чувствуется что в игре должен быть драйв.\nЗа все хорошее ставлю ей плюс, но надеюсь что во второй части они исправят свои ошибки ;)","timestamp_created":1386480790,"timestamp_updated":1427124316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7964460","author":{"steamid":"76561197997357009","num_games_owned":616,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":16232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6704,"last_played":1578198748},"language":"english","review":"you shoot the zambies and then you buy more DLC","timestamp_created":1386480695,"timestamp_updated":1392662222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7964423","author":{"steamid":"76561197994827727","num_games_owned":692,"num_reviews":79,"playtime_forever":1963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1768,"last_played":1413530940},"language":"english","review":"British Accent Simulator","timestamp_created":1386480471,"timestamp_updated":1386480471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7964393","author":{"steamid":"76561198032198977","num_games_owned":241,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":250,"last_played":1587329011},"language":"english","review":"the most funny","timestamp_created":1386480311,"timestamp_updated":1386480311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7964304","author":{"steamid":"76561198115544181","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3861,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2900,"last_played":1413820312},"language":"russian","review":"скины  у ботов неплохие только на сложке сложно розобрать куда стрелять за кемпа из далика","timestamp_created":1386479712,"timestamp_updated":1386479712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8K6o6MICcOmwHg=="}
