Bu oyun çıktığı dönem inanılmazdı, eşi benzeri görülmemiş derecede kaliteliydi. İnsanlara o dönem \"Böyle bir oyun olabilir mi ya?\" dedirtmişti. Bunları ben de biliyorum. Ama izin verin, günümüz gözüyle değerlendirelim:\n  Half-Life, her ne kadar bir efsane olsa da günümüzde oynanabilecek bir oyun değil. Kamera açısı ve grafikler alıştığım oyunlara göre çok farklı olduğundan mı bilmem, 1 saat oynadıktan sonra midem bulanıyor. Kalkmak zorunda kalıyorum. Ek olarak, oyun bize ne yapacağımızı söylemediğinden mal mal etrafta dolanıp aradığımı bulamayınca internetten bakıyorum, \"Haa bunu mu yapacakmışız?\" diyorum. Half-Life'ı ilk oynadığım dönem çok beğenmiştim ama hikayesini tamamlamadığım için başına oturayım tekrar bitireyim dedim. Yok abi, oynanmıyor oyun.\n\nHalf-Life, eskilerde çıkmış bir efsane olarak kalmaya devam etsin. Şimdikiler oynamasın. Belki Valve reis güzel bir remastered getirirse tekrar oturabilirim başına. Onun da geleceğini pek zannetmiyorum :D\nEk olarak, oyunda hala korktuğum yerler var. İlk başladığımda heralde korkmam demiştim ama gerçekten minik düşmanların suratımıza atladığı yerlerde (özellikle havalandırmalarda) korktuğum yerler oldu. Oyun bu bakımdan hala başarılı.\n\nHalf-Life, sen oyun sektörünün efsanelerinden birisisin, öyle kalmaya devam et.","timestamp_created":1608457011,"timestamp_updated":1608457011,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490160137414932251","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82746964","author":{"steamid":"76561198973311539","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3525,"playtime_last_two_weeks":325,"playtime_at_review":1894,"last_played":1660494327},"language":"schinese","review":"神作","timestamp_created":1608453938,"timestamp_updated":1608453938,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82742336","author":{"steamid":"76561197993072267","num_games_owned":459,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":495,"last_played":1507991766},"language":"english","review":"This game truly stands the test of time.

Even now, 22 years later, it still manages to impress, with obvious thought put into each and every environment, puzzle, and combat scenario. The relative lack of hand-holding makes you feel that much more accomplished when you figure out how to defeat a boss, or outwit a group of particularly tough enemies when you're low on health. It's a wild ride that almost never lets up.\n\nOf course, seeing as how they were making things up as they went, there were bound to be a few missteps.  Jumping and climbing is terribly imprecise, which makes the final few stages on Xen kind of infuriating. You'll occasionally get stuck on objects for no reason and have to do some finicking to get free. And the last boss, for lack of a nicer way to say it, sucks. Unbelievably difficult and unintuitive, I definitely got hung up on him longer than any other section in the game. Oh, and the plot is mostly background noise, but at least it had one.\n\nGood for a nostalgia trip, or, if you're a first-timer like me, a reminder of how big a leap this was for first-person shooters, and how much we've built upon it since then.","timestamp_created":1608431608,"timestamp_updated":1608431608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82727560","author":{"steamid":"76561198097146171","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1932,"last_played":1608516025},"language":"english","review":"ha lf","timestamp_created":1608427955,"timestamp_updated":1608427955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82727150","author":{"steamid":"76561198978429192","num_games_owned":366,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":427,"last_played":1617606708},"language":"english","review":"it  good","timestamp_created":1608427419,"timestamp_updated":1608427419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82723154","author":{"steamid":"76561198132118157","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":251,"last_played":1618447566},"language":"latam","review":"el juego es muy bueno, la historia es muy buena","timestamp_created":1608422507,"timestamp_updated":1608422507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82722938","author":{"steamid":"76561198008910007","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1241,"last_played":1608422207},"language":"english","review":"Classic!

The level design is wonderful; the chapter Surface Tension in particular is fantastic, and a classic FPS level.  This level design was quite immersive in 1998, and it still holds up today.  The story isn't anything too original, but the way in which it's presented without the use of cut-scenes or loads of exposition is simply outstanding.  The enemy A.I. is quite intelligent, and respond to the player in a realistic and believable way.  The human soldiers in particular are very smart, being able to flank the player, and lob grenades organically.  This game is also extremely well paced; intense firefights compliment smart environmental puzzles like a fine wine.  The weapons you acquire are also fun to use.  The MP-5 and .357 Magnum are great and useful weapons, and the Crowbar is iconic.  The scientific/experimental weapons are fun to use, the Gluon Gun being one of my personal favorites.  And, besides the frustrating Xen levels, the campaign in Half-Life overall is awesome and unique!  Half-Life is considered to be one of the best and most influential FPS games of all time, and it's acclaim is well deserved!  Half-Life is one of my favorite games of all time, and a must play FPS game.  Whether is be 1998, or 2020, Half-Life is a timeless classic.","timestamp_created":1608344118,"timestamp_updated":1608344118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82658923","author":{"steamid":"76561198191365994","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":681,"last_played":1637802657},"language":"english","review":"ges","timestamp_created":1608340107,"timestamp_updated":1608340107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82656723","author":{"steamid":"76561198019820717","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":976,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":559,"last_played":1614533602},"language":"english","review":"Gewd","timestamp_created":1608336644,"timestamp_updated":1608336644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82654370","author":{"steamid":"76561198280870532","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":48,"playtime_at_review":81,"last_played":1660492111},"language":"english","review":"big

What once was a masterpiece in the late 90's is now a decent and often meme-able piece of history in video gaming. Half Life is not at all a bad game, it's brillant for sure. The platforming is not very good and often is the worst part about this game, the difficulty spikes up a bit when you go against these very tanky, bullet spongy enemies, the levels can get super confusing and navigating them can also get annoying and frustrating. These are all issues that have not stood well against the test of time. \nBut the story, the fun gameplay, the sound design, the music, it's very coordinated and enjoyable. You can still get a kick out of it till this day, there is always something there for each type of player. It's a classic, it really did pave the way for more story-based shooters. If you don't have this game in your library, you can't be called a Valve fan.","timestamp_created":1608320032,"timestamp_updated":1610869559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82643670","author":{"steamid":"76561198217787379","num_games_owned":608,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":506,"last_played":1595499091},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1608319934,"timestamp_updated":1608319934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533678770065307617","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82638465","author":{"steamid":"76561199071183058","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":344,"last_played":1610043128},"language":"latam","review":".","timestamp_created":1608314116,"timestamp_updated":1608314116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82635733","author":{"steamid":"76561198076268214","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":139,"last_played":1579882629},"language":"koreana","review":"벌써 23년 지난 게임","timestamp_created":1608311034,"timestamp_updated":1608311034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82635239","author":{"steamid":"76561198926669293","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1099,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":175,"last_played":1627849778},"language":"spanish","review":"Solo voy a decir una cosa.
