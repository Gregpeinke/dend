Half-Life single-handedly reinvented the first-person shooter, and while Half-Life 2 doesn't quite do this, it is the better game.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a technically amazing, sharply honed first-person shooter that pulls all the tricks that made Half-Life such a beloved experience, all the while incorporating new game play innovations and concepts that help to build a much broader, more cinematic experience. In Half-Life 2, you again take the role of the seemingly mute Gordon Freeman, the game transpiring an unspecified number of years after the Black Mesa incident. If there's one thing that Valve does extremely well, it's capture the sense of dystopian atmosphere. But you won't be soaking up the scene for long before you're thrust into the struggle to defeat the Combine. The intense fire fights against often scary enemy AI's, and the physics puzzles you find yourself in are made all the more authentic thanks to the Source engine, and although this version of the engine is now dated, this is somewhat of a perk, as the game runs at a flawless FPS, and the physics are essentially at their most refined. The game for the most part controls very well, a nearly seamless experience with sharp view control and movement that ensure that game play is natural and excitingly paced. New game play additions such as vehicles allow the game to take on a new pace, with sections of on foot exploration and fire fights perfectly supplemented by the blistering chases and escapes aboard Jeeps and Hover Boats. Weapons are familiar, with your standard Pistol, Revolver, SMG and Crowbar making an appearance, but the addition of the gravity gun, a medium that allows for more tactical combat and approach to physics puzzles, adds a whole new layer of depth. There are no cut scenes or perspective changes to break the immersion, and discreetly sectioned areas mean that loading times are nearly unnoticeable. Put it all together and the game's single-player campaign will probably take you between 15 and 20 hours to complete, but this can be nearly halved if played well.\n\nSadly, despite it's length Half-Life 2's story is one of the more disappointing aspects of the game, with the first half seeming unfocused, and the second half quickly escalating to the point of feeling a tad rushed. Half-Life 2 feels like the middle chapter in a much larger story, and that's because it really is. Furthermore, the game's AI, even at harder difficulty levels, don't seem capable of intelligent behaviour, save for the main side characters such as Alyx and Barney, which is somewhat ironic. They'll attempt to perform what would appear to be taking cover, but in the end they'll just end up charging around, asking to be shot in the face. There are seemingly few fearsome bosses of any description in the game unlike Half-Life 1, with even the final \"boss\" lacking any character or even much real challenge. \n\nIn addition, Half-Life 2 is now unquestionably dated, with other franchise and developers having taken so many pages from the Half-Life handbook that the original source material has begun to feel somewhat generic, which is slightly unfair. After all, it's not exactly plausible to deem Super Mario World a bad game for wielding graphics of a 16-bit nature. \n\nIn conclusion, Half-Life 2 is an undoubtedly brilliant piece of Valve gaming genius that rightly deserves the place among the greatest games of all time, and quite possibly the place as the best PC game of all time, however, due to it's somewhat incomplete story, I would greatly recommend you pick this up only if you purchase it along with it's subsequent episodes 1 and 2, if only to ensure you experience the full masterpiece that is the Half-Life 2 trilogy.\n\n+ Amazing atmosphere\n+ Seamless perspective\n+ Flawlessly blended ground and vehicle game play.\n- Unfocussed and incomplete standalone narrative\n ᴴᵃᶫᶠ ᶫᶦᶠᵉ ³ ᶜᵒᶰᶠᶦʳᵐᵉᵈ\n\n8.5/10 ~ Amazing\n\nEpicSouls (Sam)","timestamp_created":1382995887,"timestamp_updated":1386529131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7505587","author":{"steamid":"76561198075298608","num_games_owned":1229,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":491,"last_played":1645831971},"language":"english","review":"an epic game ermahgerd","timestamp_created":1382986469,"timestamp_updated":1382986469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7499903","author":{"steamid":"76561198083949173","num_games_owned":297,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":1793,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1031,"last_played":1441097779},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games ever made and it won game of the decade.

The list just goes on. Whatever combination of things to fight - combine, headcrab zombies, antlions - it will at some point or another feature such a scene. It never disappoints. You're taken to a vast spectrum of places, with puzzles and combat and inertia to sustain your interest. Finally, without trying to be so, it feels more personal an experience; and yet the only thing Valve did to allow this to happen was to not feature the image of Gordon Freeman or give him a voice throughout the epic (which it pulls off perfectly where games as, say, Skyrim or Saint's Row, always give that impression that it isn't you playing, but someone you designed: that is nothing on how HL2 ensures there's no middle medium between you and the game (the gem of Valve)). Consequently, it gave the sense of reading a novel, with plenty of replayability, not to mention value for money.

In questo nuovo capitolo della serie ci ritroviamo a City 17 dopo un numero imprecisato di anni dal disastro di Black Mesa. Gordon Freeman si trova di fronte ad una città semi-distrutta e in catene di una nuova razza aliena, i combine, che ha raggruppato i sopravvissuti in città-prigioni sparse in tutto il mondo, obbligate a servire l'oppressore mentre questo depreda la Terra di tutte le sue risorse. Gordon si vedrà dunque impegnato nella dura lotta per liberare il pianeta al fianco di vecchie conoscenze che comandano la ribellione. La più grande innovazione di Half-Life 2 sta nella struttura di gioco. Mentre in precedenza dovevamo vagare continuamente per i corridoi di Black Mesa, adesso il tutto si divide in sequenze ben delineate dove s'intrecciano fasi in cui saremo chiamati a sfuggire dai combine e risolvere puzzle logici ad altre in cui dovremo correre a bordo del nostro idroscivolante e fare strage di nemici ad altre ancora in cui dovremo comandare una squadra d'assalto o affrontare orde di zombie con munizioni scarse, assumendo più le tinte del survival horror. Sotto il punto di vista degli elementi da shooter in prima persona Half Life 2 è eccelso: le armi sono perfette e ognuna delle quali ha un preciso ruolo all'interno delle sequenze di gioco dando al titolo una profondità ed uno spessore senza pari. La fisica raggiunge apici di eccellenza e la maniera in cui gli oggetti o i nemici reagiscono alle sollecitazioni esterne è di un un realismo sconcertante. Sul piano tecnico Half Life 2 è mosso dal motore grafico Source Engine che punta tutto sulla spettacolarità e rappresenta ancora, ad oggi, il metro di paragone per molti titoli. Ultima menzione va fatta per il comparto audio che, seppur molto buono, toppa completamente nel doppiaggio che fa scemare in diverse occasioni il ritmo di gioco.
