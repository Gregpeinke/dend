Fast action interspersed with moments to allow the players to collect themselves before the coming onslaught that is not unlike the round based mechanics of those earlier games.\n\nThey also have great simplicity in common; nothing is wasted and there is little to no attempt to create characters (though surprisingly character is something that oozes from the game). Instead the developers rely on sparse dialogue and good character design to convey each of the four characters unique flavours.\n\nUnusually this game, though designed for up to four players, is just as much fun to play alone. The AI of the computer controlled characters seems fluid and they help out when needed with a logic that can easily be taken for another human player. In truth of course it is best to play with several friends, especially when chat is enabled, but single player functionality is wonderfully realised.\n\nIf you want a game that plays well as a single player, but is an unbeatable experience in multiplayer this game is a hard one to beat. Regardless of whether you are a seasoned gamer or casual player the controls are intuitive (allowing for both keyboard and controller support) and the learning curve is only dictated by the level of insanity you require.\nLeft 4 Dead is highly recommended.\n","timestamp_created":1435245959,"timestamp_updated":1435245959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16699336","author":{"steamid":"76561198026367166","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":106,"last_played":1576401397},"language":"english","review":"great game","timestamp_created":1435243584,"timestamp_updated":1435243584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16693724","author":{"steamid":"76561197968273060","num_games_owned":518,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":11805,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11634,"last_played":1584896117},"language":"spanish","review":"Uno de los buques insignia de Valve, probablemente uno de los mejores multijugador que hay hoy en día.","timestamp_created":1435221564,"timestamp_updated":1435221564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511627912521362305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16690883","author":{"steamid":"76561198120991525","num_games_owned":389,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":583,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":411,"last_played":1534649437},"language":"brazilian","review":"Left 4 Dead... o que falar desse jogo??? bom para começar este é um jogo incrível, frenético, cooperativo... o gráfico não é seu forte, mas sua jogabilidade que é simples e responde muito bem, tem um arsenal de armas bem limitado infelizmente, porem tem diversos modos de jogo que deixa-o mais interessante... jogar sozinho é um pouco chato... melhor enjoa rápido, porém jogar com os amigos é muito bom... o uso de microfone faz com que melhore ainda mais a jogabilidade... para aquele que gostam de jogar com amigos é mais que obrigatório ter este jogo na lista... diversão garantida...\nSe o preço não estiver bom, espere uma promoção... garato vale a pena...","timestamp_created":1435206453,"timestamp_updated":1435206453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16688511","author":{"steamid":"76561198056186683","num_games_owned":365,"num_reviews":244,"playtime_forever":551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":523,"last_played":1654068122},"language":"english","review":"My review for L4D2 can be seen here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/550\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 is practically a game of the year or what would be considered a remastered edition of Left 4 Dead these days with improvements to the core gameplay, graphics, all the DLC and even more extra content.

Have a few friends who own a copy of Left 4 Dead 1. Look towards owning L4D2.\n[b]Major Theme:[/b] Valve’s take on Zombies, proving a very good mix.\n[b]Bought at Price:[/b] Valve Complete Pack\n\nWhen Valve puts their hands into some area, they mean business. You can see that with the Zombie genre game Left 4 Dead 1 (L4D).\n\nIf you are looking for an original experience, look no further than No More Room in Hell, a source mod turned game available on Steam. If however you want a solid, tried and tested coop experience, look no further.\n\nOnce you start playing Left 4 Dead 2, you will see how simple this game is, and how much more it could have been. There was quite uproar when the features in L4D2 were to be in this title, but the splitting of feature sets does make sense in some regards. L4D has 2 tiers of weapons, limiting options for weapons, and combine that with fairly simple mechanics. Keep in mind that the AI director which controls placement of items, and which map variation to use, does change gameplay up. I wouldn’t go to say you won’t see the same play through again, but it does mix things up from time to time.\n\nThe gameplay is designed to mimic a zombie movie in many regards, but the coop side of it is one of the best I’ve ever played. It’s not to be taken lightly when I say that, as I really do mean it. Singleplayer is no more than you, and 3 AI followers going through somewhat randomized campaigns. Multiplayer is basically the same thing, but each person is able to do their own thing. \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=392589277\n\nIssues include:\n[list]\n    [*]Feels as if simple mechanics are too simple\n    [*]Improvements made in L4D2 should have been put in this title?\n[*]Low amount of variance of mechanics and items\n [/list]\n\nPositives include:\n[list]\n    [*]Can be played in Big Picture mode with a controller\n    [*]Simple and easy game to master\n    [*]Seamless integration between Singleplayer and Multiplayer\n    [*]AI work well\n[*]A good LAN party title\n[*]Works well on older, but fairly recent systems\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1435175242,"timestamp_updated":1435220586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16678340","author":{"steamid":"76561198202430893","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1452704226},"language":"german","review":"Super geiles Spiel","timestamp_created":1435162424,"timestamp_updated":1435162424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16676521","author":{"steamid":"76561198140145045","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1442768591},"language":"danish","review":"i want my monney back please","timestamp_created":1435157057,"timestamp_updated":1435157057,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.434782594442367554","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16673807","author":{"steamid":"76561198094071427","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":254,"last_played":1512165501},"language":"romanian","review":"Very good !","timestamp_created":1435148384,"timestamp_updated":1435148384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16672089","author":{"steamid":"76561198156634863","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1444535705},"language":"russian","review":"Ностальгия......играл я очень давно и вернулся","timestamp_created":1435142160,"timestamp_updated":1435142160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16669273","author":{"steamid":"76561198082071688","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":75,"last_played":1487637872},"language":"english","review":"Some great zombie ass-busting shooter, I just finished the Singleplayer campaign, but I had almost expected more at the end.
