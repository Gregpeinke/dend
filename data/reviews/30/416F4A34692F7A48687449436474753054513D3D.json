This game is like the grandfather of WW2 games , Before COD and all other WW2 games there was Day of Defeat. I have a major love for this game. I also made alot of good friends amongst my battles along the way :) {\"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers\"}\n\nThe game play is a bit older and slower then its predecessor of the day Counter-Strike.The Capture the Flag gameplay and Objective Play enforce strong team work and communication game play. The game has aged a bit of course but the key gameplay is still relevant today.\n\nIt may not have had as a big following as did CS did but the community it has , has kept this game alive and well even today. I would highly recommed this game to anyone that loves WW2 games and Loves the old school game play and who also would like to see what we played back in the day,before the flood of WW2 games saw the light of day.\n\nI will say there are not as many servers today as there were back in the day, but there are a few good ones still alive and kicking today.Some with bots and others packed we people {At certain times}.
