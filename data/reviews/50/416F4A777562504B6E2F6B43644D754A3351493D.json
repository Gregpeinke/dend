I obviously would not compare it to the base game, but there is some very unique gameplay, very cool enemies (Race X), and some very important lore that should be considered before overlooking this game. The final boss battle with the Gene Worm and the ending were not great, which is likely why this game has received a mixed response from fans over the years. But I would still seriously recommend this game if you are a Half-Life fan, or if you're at all curious about the lore. There are some very unique gameplay features (like the alien grappling hook) and in-game events (like Freeman jumping into the xen portal in the lambda core) that I found to be very cool and unique, so no doubt it is worth checking out.","timestamp_created":1621114745,"timestamp_updated":1621114745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92057498","author":{"steamid":"76561198216173737","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":420,"last_played":1621106649},"language":"english","review":"this is even better then the original half life. you get a desert eagle and a green goop shooter which are very good weapons. there are 2 worms in opposing force and 0 worms in the original half life, and i think that speaks for itself","timestamp_created":1621105246,"timestamp_updated":1621105246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92056619","author":{"steamid":"76561198143629999","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":525,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":485,"last_played":1627742402},"language":"brazilian","review":"This expansion is just amazing, it has a lot of new stuff like new weapons and mechanics, the H.E.C.U. guys are just great, their lines really enhance the situations and the gameplay is flawless.

Shift must've been Gearbox just getting their toes dipped into the water: a fairly interesting modification with a short but generally fun run through a different perspective of the Black Mesa incident. Opposing Force is when they hit their stride. There are at least five new enemies, seven new weapons (well, six, one is actually a tool), and 2 new gameplay mechanics: rope climbing and night vision goggles. I was blown away by just how many new things were in this in comparison to Blue Shift. The level puzzles and general map layouts are much better as I never felt nearly as lost. The need for team mates is used a lot more, as you will use your squad mates to access new areas, and there's a lot more world building going on with all the dialogue between your commanders and squad. The only downside to the game is that the last quarter or so of the game, you will be absolutely starved for health and armor pickups/stations. I was so exhausted by the end of the game just from constantly needing to play more and more careful or I would be reloading my save. I also feel like the final boss was overly gimmicky and is rather boring, and maybe a little annoying.

You also realise that there are basically 3 factions, Black Mesa, the Army and Black Ops, all have different missions. As you're playing for the army in this regard, you're quest at first is to find Freeman, which is abandoned and it becomes all about survival against the black ops and alien horde.\n\nAlthough this story was never expanded, it's none the less an awesome and worth playing expansion to Half-Life.
