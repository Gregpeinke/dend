A mecânica dele me empolgou bastante, os gráficos são muito bons mesmo com o jogo já tendo lá seus 3 anos. Mas a minha maior surpresa acabou sendo negativa. Quando eu menos esperava, após apenas umas 3 horas de jogatina, o jogo acaba! Quando começava a ficar melhor.

Fiquei com uma sensação de alívio de ter baixado gratuitamente o jogo, pois não sei se valeria a pena pagar por um jogo tão curto.
