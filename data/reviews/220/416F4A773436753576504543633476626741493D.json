Esta continuación de Half-Life 1 fue lanzada el 16 de Noviembre de 2004, y consigo trajo como gran innovación el motor gráfico Source y el motor de físicas Havok.\nTras derrotar a Nihilanth en el final de Half-Life 1, y minutos después haber sido puesto en estado de hibernación, nuestro personaje, Gordon Freeman, es despertado y puesto en acción para una nueva aventura, obligado a cumplir el papel que le impone el misterioso G-Man. El juego arranca con Gordon despertando en un tren con dirección a \"Ciudad 17\", luego del estado de hibernación y algunas palabras del hombre de traje. Una vez haber bajado del tren, sin saber dónde estamos, nos encontramos con un ambiente bastante frío y triste, en donde no se paran de escuchar las voces de un líder en las pantallas gigantes, y donde acecha en todo momento la represión por parte de las \"fuerzas de seguridad\" allí presentes hacia los habitantes. \"¿Y por qué sucede esto?\" nos vamos a estar preguntando. A medida que vayamos avanzando en la historia, nos enteramos que un régimen fascista tiene a toda la población mundial bajo control, y que este fue conformado gracias a la Alianza (O \"Combine\"), pero principalmente gracias a la ayuda del Doctor Wallace Breen (Ex administrador de Black Mesa), que se encuentra a la cabeza como administrador de La Tierra. Los Combine son una fuerza interdimensional conformada por múltiples razas de mundos que van conquistando, su objetivo es ir tomando el poder sobre planetas en donde abunden razas inteligentes o fuertes, y una vez conquistado el planeta, dejan un ejército y un administrador que lidere la conquista y elimine a todo aquel ser que se interponga en su camino. Estos se encuentran en La Tierra ya que, al momento en que murió Nihilanth (quien tenía bajo control a los Xenianos con su inmenso poder), se produjo una tormenta de portales que se extendió por todo el mundo, transportando a gran parte de las criaturas de Xen a la Tierra, y los Combine al darse cuenta de esto, decidieron conquistar nuestro planeta por el poder e inteligencia que tienen la raza Xen y la humana. Gordon, como líder de \"La resistencia\", y con la ayuda de viejos conocidos, debe hacer frente a este régimen de conquistadores y liberar al planeta Tierra cuanto antes.\nSe le pueden hacer un par de críticas negativas, como que las pantallas de carga entre niveles tardan demasiado, o que el logro de las lambda está un poco bugueado a veces, pero este juego me impresionó y me maravilló por la cantidad de historia que tiene detrás. Además, cómo recurre constantemente al uso de las físicas para superar obstáculos y lo bien que aprovecha el motor Source en los niveles. También el apartado gráfico y el diseño de los niveles es algo fabuloso. Por otra parte, la historia no lineal, con el buen desarrollo de personajes presente en el juego. Y por último la banda sonora es muy buena.\n\nEste juego lo finalicé en Febrero del 2018, pero en aquel momento no me sentí listo para desarrollar un análisis de esta joya de juego. Aprovechando la salida de Half-Life: Alyx, y que 2 años más tarde tengo un poco más de experiencia con las reseñas en Steam, decidí rejugarme Half-Life 2 y analizarlo de una vez por todas. Estuvo genial en términos de acción, disparos, e historia, mucho más desarrollado que en su primera entrega. Considero que es uno de los mejores juegos de la historia por todo lo dicho anteriormente, me encantó todo de este juego, por eso es uno de mis juegos favoritos. Ojalá veamos dentro de poco como continúa la historia, si Dios y Valve quieren.\n\n10/10 puntos!","timestamp_created":1586906971,"timestamp_updated":1586906971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.668722212314605713","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67327741","author":{"steamid":"76561198320819767","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1638637152},"language":"danish","review":"Bunardo","timestamp_created":1586906465,"timestamp_updated":1586906465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67327232","author":{"steamid":"76561198861720990","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":363,"last_played":1646624006},"language":"english","review":"great, fucking, game...","timestamp_created":1586905722,"timestamp_updated":1586905722,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67326701","author":{"steamid":"76561198361652702","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":572,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":572,"last_played":1586904259},"language":"brazilian","review":"lindo d+","timestamp_created":1586904292,"timestamp_updated":1586904292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67326623","author":{"steamid":"76561198153679443","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1372,"last_played":1586910493},"language":"english","review":"This game is quite epic.

Rise and shine.\"[/h3]\n\t\n\tHalf-life 2 mantém sua maior qualidade trazida do primeiro jogo, que é a história contada de forma scriptada e interativa, sem cutscenes ou pausas. Isso dá uma imersão enorme para tudo, faz parecer que você realmente está lutando em uma revolução e torna tudo mais impressionante. É incrível pois ao invés de trazer cutscenes dirigidas, o jogador é o diretor, tendo uma participação maior na história.\n\t\n\tA novidade do Half-life 2 foi seu incrível sistema de física que trouxe interações muito interessantes entre os objetos. Dá para ver porque a Valve decidiu fazer um Half-life VR. Esse sistema é muito utilizado no começo do jogo com diversos puzzles, uma pena que mais para o final o jogo se torna mais ações, porém pelo fato de ser o climax da história, isso acaba sendo compensado, além de que fizeram depois um Half-life focado em puzzles.\n\t\n\tO combate é aquilo que todo mundo já conhece da Valve e da Source engine, o que estranhamente funciona. Tirando alguns inimigos bem difíceis (ou impossíveis?) de desviar, como helicópteros e o Strider que podem ser um pouco frustrantes. O jogo porém compensa muito nos visuais, que eram impressionantes para a época, assim como as expressões faciais que nesse caso são impressionantes até hoje. Tudo isso entra em conjunto e torna Half-life 2 uma experiência muito imersiva e divertida.\n\t\n\t[h3]\"Rather than offer you the illusion of free choice, I will take the liberty of choosing for you...if and when your time comes around again.\"[/h3]\n\t\nA história justifica muito suas ações do jogo, trazendo também personagens muito interessantes e que torna a história mais verossímil, parecendo realmente que eles existem. Por fim, a história obviamente não termina aqui e sempre tem o mistério de quem é o G-MAN que, quem sabe um dia, poderemos descobrir. Para mim, é um daqueles jogos que todo mundo deveria jogar, não por ser um clássico aclamado, como diversos outros jogos que recomendam como \"obrigatórios\", mas realmente por ser muito bom.","timestamp_created":1586882963,"timestamp_updated":1586883039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.655873537063598633","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67307730","author":{"steamid":"76561198075596922","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":993,"last_played":1617814564},"language":"english","review":"is good","timestamp_created":1586882819,"timestamp_updated":1586882819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950463771820068","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67307170","author":{"steamid":"76561197963144769","num_games_owned":7062,"num_reviews":191,"playtime_forever":1026,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1026,"last_played":1437547259},"language":"english","review":"Recommend.","timestamp_created":1586882249,"timestamp_updated":1586882249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950463771820068","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67306306","author":{"steamid":"76561198885118903","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":855,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":816,"last_played":1658020881},"language":"ukrainian","review":"nice game","timestamp_created":1586881386,"timestamp_updated":1586881386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67306103","author":{"steamid":"76561198870654469","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":246,"last_played":1605931321},"language":"english","review":"its half life.","timestamp_created":1586881188,"timestamp_updated":1586881188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483204126358032227","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67305072","author":{"steamid":"76561198429062799","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":752,"last_played":1578096974},"language":"english","review":"Stop reading the reviews.
