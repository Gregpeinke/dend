I played through the game almost without issue expect for one part where I had to go into God mode because the game would for some reason instantly crash every few seconds. But it was just for one area. So besides that I didn't have any issues playing it.  if you want to play a HL expansion I would recommend this game over Half-Life Blue Shift. 8/10 would play again.","timestamp_created":1589667510,"timestamp_updated":1589667510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503816783428192139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69248634","author":{"steamid":"76561198053576807","num_games_owned":465,"num_reviews":104,"playtime_forever":348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":348,"last_played":1589640799},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life:Opposing Force-неплохое дополнение к оригинальной игре(То чувство,когда долго не знал о дополнениях к HL вообще :D),которое можно лаконично охарактеризовать как \"Почти удачный эксперимент\".\nБолее конкретно:\n-Сюжет,вторично переплетающийся с сюжетом оригинала вкупе с посещением тех же участков,где бодрячком с монтировкой шествовал Mr.Freeman;\n-Пришельцы старые и...Пришельцы новые - существа из мира X - это уже отсебятина разработчиков,но в Opposing Force вписались очень удачно.Чёрные оперативники со штурмовыми винтовками - ни рыба,ни мясо,практически 100 % идентичность с обычным спецназом,разве что текстурки другие,но в кампании с оригинальными пистолетчиками заставляют слегка вспотеть;\n-Арсенал,который больше в 1,5 раза нежели в оригинале,чего-то здесь нет,что-то заменено аналогом,что-то вообще новое.Отмечу что Пустынный Орёл - отличная замена Магнуму,пушка XV11382(Вместо Тау-Лазера и Глюонной Пушки) полезна только в качестве телепорта в Зен за снаряжением и пополнением здоровья,винтовка M40A1(Вместо Арбалета) имеет весьма сомнительный простор для применения,пулемёт M249 SAW разблокирует режим тра-та-та - пока есть боеприпасы :D.Холодное оружие - другое и вне каких-либо комментариев,инопланетные образцы весьма колоритные,но бестолковые;\n-Касательно технической части говорить особо и нечего - всё тот же оригинальный HL,слегка улучшенный движок,а вот технические проблемы есть.Лично я встретил \"Синдром Пустынного Пацифиста\" - Desert Eagle напрочь отказывался стрелять, пропадающий звук,а один раз Opposing Force просто решила вылететь.В остальном всё отлично.\nHalf-Life:Opposing Force при всех своих плюсах,имеет огромный минус - самобытная атмосфера оригинала не перекочевала в дополнение,т.к игру делали не Valve.Нет чувства полного погружения.Поэтому,Opposing Force при всех своих \"За\",лично для меня,навсегда останется \"Проходняком\", однако это \"Качественный аддон,за который и денег отдать не жалко\".\nПодлежит к ознакомлению при условии,что был пройден оригинал.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/70/ - рецензия на Half-Life\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/130/ - рецензия на Half-Life: Blue Shift\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/280/ - рецензия на Half-Life: Source\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/220/ - рецензия на Half-Life 2\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/340/ - рецензия на Half-Life 2: Lost Coast\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/380/ - рецензия на Half-Life 2: Episode 1\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/420/ - рецензия на Half-Life 2: Episode 2\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/290930/ - рецензия на Half-Life 2: Update\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/362890/ - рецензия на Black Mesa","timestamp_created":1589648270,"timestamp_updated":1608663665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589460968971252441","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69244861","author":{"steamid":"76561198001306275","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":100,"playtime_forever":2207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2207,"last_played":1417884184},"language":"english","review":"the best of the two expansions and probably one of the only times gearbox has done anything right","timestamp_created":1589644621,"timestamp_updated":1589644621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503816783428192139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69238135","author":{"steamid":"76561198820759062","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":280,"last_played":1615923979},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun gayet zevkli hatta en sevdiğim half life oyunu...
