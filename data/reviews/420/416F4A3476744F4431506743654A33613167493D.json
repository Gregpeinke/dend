It almost doesn’t seem that long since we left Gordon Freeman in the ashes of a dead world, frozen in time with increasingly little chance of the enigmatic G-Man showing up to conclude business. The promise of Half-Life: Episode Three never really died, kept alive by jokes and hopes and increasingly desperate attempts to see a ‘3’ even hinted in anything Valve did.\n\nGoing back to Episode Two though, it’s not too surprising. The industry’s brief fascination with episodic content was a bad idea for basically everyone not called Telltale, which approached it by carefully working out pipelines for content and limited and games where one team could be working on one episode while another team did the prep-work for the next, allowing games within a couple of months. Valve, like Ritual with SiN: Episodes, was effectively looking at a new game every time, each time having to be bigger and better for a likely diminishing playerbase.\n\nEven by 2007, and upgraded over the years with effects like HDR lighting and improved models, the Source engine was starting to creak. Tech aside, the Half-Life 2 world that had looked so real back in 2004 now felt distinctly blocky retrograde in the wake of games like BioShock and Crysis and Call of Duty 4, which, yes, was a very different style, but took shooter set-pieces to crazy levels of polish and inspiration. For Half-Life to continue as a blockbuster, it had to take that generational leap again, and at this point Valve was already turning its attention elsewhere. Soon it was too late. It could risk leaving a gaming generation blueballed over a sequel (and of course the lady equivalent!). It couldn’t so easily risk a Half-Life that didn’t set the world on fire, and it wasn’t long before it was hard to imagine what Episode Three versus a full sequel could realistically do.\n\nThat’s not to dismiss Episode 2, though. Like the best DLC/add-ons, Valve treated the Episodes not just as more Half-Life 2, but a way of exploring the potential of the game and expand what that actually meant. Episode 1 for instance reversed the order that you got the weapons, cranked up the feel of City 17 being under siege and playing your part in a warzone, and focused on the team-up of Gordon and Alyx Vance, after the largely solitary travels of Half-Life 2 proper.\n\nThe keyword of Episode Two was ‘freedom’. Kinda. To a point. It certainly wasn’t a game like, say, STALKER, where you could head off in whatever direction you wanted and fight the evil Combine. The path through the game was linear. However, it was also considerably wider, giving you a car and moving out of caves and streets and other very controlled areas to the relatively open roads of the White Forest and its abandoned houses and waypoints. One of its best set-pieces involves defending an empty inn from attack by both regular troops and the game’s new Hunter enemies, and running around from window to window to take on the attackers as they break down the doors and try to swarm you. It’s an open combat environment that feels like a carefully laid trap by the enemies rather than simply holding out against waves, as with a remarkably tedious antlion fight earlier, where you’re running upstairs to shoot out of windows and then back down as guys burst in, and otherwise trying to watch your flanks like an actual guerrilla warfare situation.\n\nThe thing is that replaying the game, despite having fond memories of wandering around the countryside and so on, the road trip is only about an hour of its running time. The first part is all underground, through a maze of antlion tunnels, and just as you’re starting to enjoy the driving around, it’s over, give or take some conversations with NPCs that definitely didn’t drag on this much in 2004-2007 and can’t be sped up no matter how much junk you throw in their faces with the gravity gun (still, incidentally, one of the greatest weapons ever invented).\n\nOnly then do you get another taste of freedom with the final boss—another non-linear base defence bit, this time involving a car, attacking Striders, and the expansions’ one new weapon—a bomb created by new character (but old Black Mesa scientist) Magnusson. It’s a fun, tense standoff that certainly beats the heck out of fighting Nihilanth in the first game, but it’s also over pretty quickly. Like so much of the episode, the openness feels transitionary—the acceptance that Half-Life needed to grow into something new and the realisation that the tricks that were so cool in 2004 were wearing thin. Even then it gets some fun use out of physics, like smashing open a door with a carefully positioned cart, but still.\n\nIt remains a fun enough shooter, but the reality versus the memory is definitely unsatisfying. It doesn’t help that it’s the middle part of a trilogy, and in Empire Strikes Back fashion, one that exists primarily to set up the finale. Emotionally, it ends on a low, with a big win for our heroes, but the brutal murder of a major character right in front of both Gordon and Alyx. The job isn’t just unfinished, it’s unfinished leaving at least one big maggot-shaped alien needing a kicking.\n\nLuckily, we now have at least some idea of how things would have gone, courtesy of writer Marc Laidlaw’s \"Epistle 3\". This not-exactly-coded ‘fanfic’ took the form of a letter from one 'Gertie Fremont' to find a ship called the 'Hyperborea' in the Antarctic and defeat the evil 'Disparate', and tells of a last-ditch suicide mission to the heart of the alien menace, before loyal partner 'Alex Vaunt' gets whisked away by a mysterious suited presence and 'Gertie' is likewise pulled from the action by the not-Vortigaunts. In short, a more explosive cliffhanger, not a big series finale.\n\nIt’s important to note that even outside the tongue-in-cheek premise, Laidlaw wasn’t the only writer of the Episodes, no longer works for Valve, there were no doubt many revisions of the story (Laidlaw himself has said that ‘Like most things in the HL series, answers are developed strictly as needed’ —there is no official big secret to be revealed about, say, the identity of the G-Man) and it’s anyone’s guess how Episode Three would actually have played out. Still, it’s both more than we usually get when series fizzle out, and better than leaving Gordon staring at a corpse for all eternity.\n\nNow, if some of this sounds harsh towards Episode Two, it’s largely in retrospect. At the time, even with its issues, it was an exciting step forward for the series and a fresh take on things. Half-Life 2 in all its forms is still stunningly playable for its age compared to most of its peers, helped by its commitment to staying within Gordon’s POV and its set-pieces typically flowing naturally and designed around the game rather than being a flashy background to climb over or simply witness. Episode Two was a great couple of hours of action, even if it was somewhat upstaged by the other parts of The Orange Box—Portal’s sheer novelty, and the beyond-wonderful early TF2.\n\nThere’s a reason that everyone wanted Episode Three so much, and it wasn’t just to see what happened next. While Episode Two wasn’t Valve’s best moment, it was Valve at its most exciting time creatively. The company that would do something like The Orange Box. The company that had overcome everyone’s early dislike of Steam to create a platform people actually wanted to use. The company that could do absolutely anything, make whatever game it wanted, and be guaranteed to deliver. The promise of Episode Three, much like Half-Life 2 before it, was that it could be anything but was sure to be great. And maybe the result could have lived up to that. \n\nMaybe. Or maybe not. We’ll never know for sure.\n\nBut at least we can savour what we actually got. \n\nWe’ll always have City 17.\"\n\nBy Richard Cobbett of PC

I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you","timestamp_created":1617994701,"timestamp_updated":1617994701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469498097896575928","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90012036","author":{"steamid":"76561198957891185","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1643,"last_played":1617739278},"language":"russian","review":"заебись один чел отпиъдел всех врагов нахуй с боллее слабыми челами и тут врывается гандон с портфелем емае был ж как на донбасе","timestamp_created":1617984278,"timestamp_updated":1617984278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90011531","author":{"steamid":"76561198131706592","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":402,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":402,"last_played":1617983682},"language":"english","review":"carefull spoiler:                                      PORTAL CROSSOVER!!!!","timestamp_created":1617983743,"timestamp_updated":1617983743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90009016","author":{"steamid":"76561198975494040","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":460,"last_played":1610187775},"language":"russian","review":"симулятор давки личинок\n12 личинок из 10","timestamp_created":1617980860,"timestamp_updated":1617980860,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90003330","author":{"steamid":"76561198834814766","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1658498274},"language":"swedish","review":"Overall, Pretty Good Game.

I would say that this game stands toe to toe with the original Half-Life 2 Episode 0. What really makes this stand out is that, unlike HL2E1, it remembered that Half-Life's strengths lie in its narrative, world, and game play. \n\nLets start with the world, this is undeniably the most creative Half-Life game yet! Half-Life 2 Episode 0 had so many creative and really visually striking locations, its truly unlike any other game out there. The slow and contemplative city 17 streets, before quickly falling into the dark underbellies, before transitioning to a beautifully barren waterscape, then the jovial Black Mesa East, before hitting you with the dread of Ravenholm, the quiet atmosphere of Highway 17, and ending with the cold emptiness of the Sandtraps and Nova Prospekt. Then lets compare it to E1.... hmmm... that's... that's a lot of ruined cities. bleh. But E2? HOOOO BOY! The cold open, the quiet serenity of the forest with the looming fear of the portal, then BAM the cramped horror of the Antlion nest, then BOOM the cold silence of the empty mine, then the exhilarating ride with Alyx, and where do I even START with The White Forrest Inn? Before concluding with a great final section in White Forrest! Never a dull moment in this game, I swear! And having the entire game be threaded by the absolutely stunning Outlands is ingenious! I [i]personally[/i] like the rural and natural areas of Half-Life compared to the industrial ones, Ravenholm, Highway 17, The Victory Mines, and even Lost Coast, so this game feels like it was made for me\n\nNow lets move onto the game play, just like HL2E0, the variety the game has is absolutely flooring! The dark horrific corridors of the Antilion den were a blast, and the turret section at the end? [i]mwah![/i] And the car section was also a blast! It really does lull you into a fun cartrip with Alyx before gut-punching you with The White Forrest Inn. What an amazing level! I don't even wanna talk about it so much, not only is the design of the small alpine town beautifully silent and serene, but seeing that beautiful scenery being turned into a fantastic battlefield with one of the most tense experiences I've ever had in gaming? [i]mmmmMMMMWAH![/i] The Strider Battles, the Antlion chase, just... pure Valve game design perfection. \n\nNow the story... what can I even say that hasn't been said a million times? The unique Valve way of storytelling is still as strong as ever, as much as I love a good long cut scene (hell I'm a Metal Gear fan) but this way of storytelling is so refreshing! So much is said in what seems to be so little, its great. And I'm not gonna touch on the plot itself much, but instead what it sets up. I can see why HL3 or E3 is such an infamous game, that ending is such a tease! It sets up what might be the biggest mission yet, and right when you're about to go *BAM SPLURCH NOOOO* and immediately cut to credits. While compelling, you need to... yknow... finish it up? But hey, after HLA and the creation of the Source 2 engine, 3 is inevitable.
