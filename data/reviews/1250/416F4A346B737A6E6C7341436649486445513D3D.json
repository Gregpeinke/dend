Команда из 4 человек выносит волны мутантов получая за них деньги, в перерыве между волнами у нас есть возможность пополнить боезапас, купить оружие, бронижелет и вперёд выносить новую волну, а в конце нас ждёт монстр доктор который всю эту кашу и заварил, Патриарх звать его. На этом можно и закончить но есть одно но, конечно же куда без неё без прокачки то, здесь нам дают 7 классов: Медик, Техник, Снайпер, Коммандос, Берсеркер, Поджигатель, Подрывник все те кого мы можем вкачать, к каждому по 6 перков. Вкачиваемся мы логическим образом, снайпер значит стреляем со снайпы, техник с шотгана + двери варит, берсеркер с оружием ближнего боя и т.д В целом игра подразумевает задроство так как с каждым новым уровнем выносить надо всё больше и больше, ещё и подогревает просто громадное кол-во достижений. Рекомендую игру и конечно же играть с реальными людьми в команде, одному тут просто адово скучно.","timestamp_created":1376598002,"timestamp_updated":1404987039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497057676315307617","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5999809","author":{"steamid":"76561198056947600","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1641,"last_played":1493302422},"language":"german","review":"Viele Zombies, viele Waffen, viele Maps - und wenig Sinn.

If you have a gun out, you walk pretty slowly, but if you have your melee weapon out your fast as shit. I don't believe that works in this styling of game. It ends up being mundanely slow, with even the weakeast of enemies being able to just catch up to you. s'pretty annoying.\n\nThe other thing I find wrong is how absolutely over-powered the dlc weapons are. It makes the game a small pay to win based game, and that's bullshit.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, this is meant for groups of players/friends killing shit. That's ok in my books, but there's far better games to do that with in my opinion, such as Serious Sam, Painkiller, or even some mods for Doom. Even though I don't RECOMMEND the game, I still do think it's a fairly mediocre survival experience. It's not un-playable by any means, and again it's fun with friends, but it gets incredibly boring rather quickly.","timestamp_created":1376538274,"timestamp_updated":1582227139,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478020280599594116","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4768900","author":{"steamid":"76561198041639565","num_games_owned":265,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":4476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2571,"last_played":1451205310},"language":"english","review":"Think of this game as Counter Strike, Doom, and Left 4 Dead mixed together.\n\nA variety of weapons, maps set in different places, and interesting monsters.\n\nThis game places a huge emphasis on coop, you got to work together to survive the hoard of monsters.","timestamp_created":1376525713,"timestamp_updated":1376525713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7253925","author":{"steamid":"76561198097505129","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":533,"last_played":1446325494},"language":"english","review":"JOGO MASSA 10/10","timestamp_created":1376491872,"timestamp_updated":1388098606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6874085","author":{"steamid":"76561198078021823","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":98,"playtime_forever":718,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":517,"last_played":1395961066},"language":"english","review":"meat","timestamp_created":1376484830,"timestamp_updated":1376484830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47486037015914917","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5021880","author":{"steamid":"76561198044271435","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1283,"last_played":1429418514},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom Jogo ;D","timestamp_created":1376472709,"timestamp_updated":1376472709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4923001","author":{"steamid":"76561198043358462","num_games_owned":470,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":4147,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2537,"last_played":1451159260},"language":"english","review":"Imagine Cod: Zombies.

And is 6 payer co-op, hard to find that nowadays other then COD. Another thing that is great about this game is the steam workshop, there are tons of mods, guns, and maps on there to keep the game fresh. The last great thing about this game is anyone can run it on their PC because of how little it demands from your computer. However that is the double edged part of this blade, hundreds of hours in this game for me and my friends, they either need to make a sequel or make a serious overhaul patch to it that improve both graphics and physics.\n\nThis game is dated but still loads of fun.
