I can remember thinking, \"Hmm this game doesnt feel as good as Bioshock one.\" Now after  beating it i can say i was wrong. The story can start off slow but speeds up very quickly. The story is awesome and the ending left me in shock. I wanted more. It's a shame this is the last bioshock game, although I read online they are working on one now but it wont be out for years to come. This game is truly iconic for many reasons. You have Elizabeth which if you have been on the internet and know what Bioshock is you've seen her. You have all new vigors adding an extra flare to the way the game feels. All an all i must admit I do wish the story wasnt only 7 hours long (I completed it in 1 sitting) but then again I was so hooked I cant complain because those 7 hours were the most enjoyable hours I've had gaming in a singleplayer game in a long while (Since Fallout New Vegas). So I still have to say all around this game is awesome, a good buy for a solo gamer i need of that buzz from the addiction that is solo gaming.\n\nAfter a little while I have beaten the DLC aswell and must say that Burial at Sea is amazing.. If you play Bioshock 1 and 2 you will instantly start seeing a connection and be able to map the games together no spoilers but If you want a spoiler free run play Bioshock 1 and 2 before playing this. even if you dont care about spoilers play Bioshock 1 at least.

Na úvod řeknu, že mě Bioshock Infinite tolik nebavil jako jeho dva předchůdci,  příběh byl dost zmatený, \n v podstatě od momentu kdy najdete Elizabeth a pochopil sem ho až na úplném konci.  K tomu nutno dodat že DLC Burial at Sea epizoda 1 a 2 jsou nedílnou součástí celé hry a pokud to chcete pochopit tak jako já,  co se to tam k sakru dějě, tak si musíte rozhodně zahrát i DLC neboť zároveň zakončují celý příběh Bioshock trilogie.  \n\nZa sebe můžu tvrdit, že DLC jsou snad lepší než celá hra Infinite, neboť spojují události v předchozích dvou dílech a vlastně vysvětlují všechno, co se tam děje.\n\nco se týče plasmidů (vigorů) tak sám sem použil možná dva druhy za celou dobu hraní Infinitu (dohráno na nejtěžší obtížnost),  umělá inteligence dost je dost zvláštní a zbraně nejsou moc zajímavé, (co bych taky chtěl v roce 1912).  \nKaždopádně způsob, jakým vás hra provází se dá přirovnat spíš ke sledování filmu, což byla věc, která mě bavila. \n\nNo a proč tedy Bioshock Infinite doporučit ?   Pokud jste hráli předchozí dva díly, je infinite rozhodně důstojné zakončení celé serie, byť to tak zezačátku nevypada  (hlavně až v DLC).   A i když Columbia postrádá tu skvělou atmosféru rozpadajícího se utopeného města,  pořád má něco do sebe.   Pokud ste ale předchozí dva díly nehráli, tak se tomuto dílu raději vyhněte a zahrajte si nejprve první dva.","timestamp_created":1577037086,"timestamp_updated":1577037086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598246872425079346","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60331446","author":{"steamid":"76561198345703373","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":404,"last_played":1576861568},"language":"brazilian","review":"Gameplay boa com uma historia dificil de entender, com um plot muito foda que se conecta nos outros 2 jogos, recomendo","timestamp_created":1577035480,"timestamp_updated":1577035480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60331160","author":{"steamid":"76561198132399067","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1201,"last_played":1596468120},"language":"schinese","review":"还能说啥呢 玩就对了","timestamp_created":1577035187,"timestamp_updated":1577035187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60329184","author":{"steamid":"76561198283558988","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":583,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1577184233},"language":"schinese","review":"30 不到的本体 我只能说买爆","timestamp_created":1577033335,"timestamp_updated":1577033335,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60325587","author":{"steamid":"76561198965600068","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":424,"last_played":1618358020},"language":"spanish","review":"esta bueno el jueguito y chupame el pito","timestamp_created":1577029891,"timestamp_updated":1577029891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60324081","author":{"steamid":"76561199000176779","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":303,"last_played":1629374262},"language":"schinese","review":"除了卡退bug一切都好","timestamp_created":1577028576,"timestamp_updated":1577028576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60322954","author":{"steamid":"76561198151845999","num_games_owned":1227,"num_reviews":341,"playtime_forever":599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":562,"last_played":1580064974},"language":"russian","review":"Нечего сказать, отлично","timestamp_created":1577027523,"timestamp_updated":1577027523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60321835","author":{"steamid":"76561198397089855","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":273,"last_played":1625418922},"language":"russian","review":"Балдеж","timestamp_created":1577026539,"timestamp_updated":1577026539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60321137","author":{"steamid":"76561198271377836","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1577216874},"language":"english","review":"must play title","timestamp_created":1577025911,"timestamp_updated":1577025911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60319504","author":{"steamid":"76561198840721644","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1558,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1558,"last_played":1532173356},"language":"italian","review":"Capolavoro indiscusso.

Soit parce que finalement on aura pas trop l'occasion d'utiliser l'arme qu'on a fait évoluer, soit parce qu'une arme bien meilleur arrivera plus tard dans le jeu rendant la nôtre obsolète.\nIl est d'ailleurs compliqué de savoir quelle arme est \"meilleure\". Il n'y a pas de caractéristiques précises genre \"dégâts, cadence de tir\" qui auraient pu être utiles ici. \nConcernant la prise en main, il y a un texte d'aide qui s'affiche quand on débloque une nouvelle capacité, c'est plutôt simple et efficace, ça évite un long tuto. Par contre, je n'ai rien vu qui m'indique le menu personnage. Au bout d'un moment, j'ai considéré que c'était pas possible qu'il n'y en ai pas donc j'ai cherché où il était et j'ai fini par le trouver. Pratique et bien fait, mais trouvé un peu tard...(après peut-être que j'ai raté la phrase qui me disait comment y accéder, hein)\n\nBref, je recommande ce jeu.
