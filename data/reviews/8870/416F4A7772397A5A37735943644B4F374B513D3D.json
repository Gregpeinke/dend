The shooting mechanic is fun but generic, as is the spellcasting/Vigors powers which is a little dissappointing. This is all secondary towards the story telling which is excellently voiced and written, though pacing in the beginning needs work. There are plot holes (the ending, the mother story thread, etc) and jarring game mechanics (Elizabeth's powers) but nothing preventing you from wanting  to see how this all unveils. For all my quibbles, it's smoothed out with the charming characters and world that Infinite presents.\n\nThe Long:\nAfter 2 hours in to Infinite, I stopped playing this game. \nI felt bored, and as pretty as the world was presented in this wonderous alternate steam-punk reality of a cotton candied 1910-esque US, it just wasn't enought to keep me interested because I've seen this theme many times in lower detail and quality, and after 10 minutes wondering around, it all felt familiar. The clever plot points were slipped in from early on, but a bit too obvious and/or heavy handedly but at least a good attempt was made.  The gun play is typical, movement was typical, vigors/spells were unique enough but nothing unheard of. And that's when I stopped. The story was being too subtle, especially for a player like me, who wants to see all places presented, thus making the story even slower. \n \nAfter some nudging from friends, I booted it back on and trudged forward. Once you meet Elizabeth, everything this world and story was building upon started to click. Factions, trials, wonders, backstory, expositories, trageties, horrors, betrayals and tender moments all come at you like a torrential storm surge, each trying to overwhelm the other in waves. Weirdly, through this maelstrom of motivations and hatched plots, the characters and why the world is the way it is, was and/or to be all make some semblance of sense, albeit broken sense if you're not caught up in the spectical/revelation and think about it a bit. The voice acting and dialog is wonderful and believable, there is chemistry between Booker and Elisabeth in their voicing and 3D depictions. You get the sense of balance between tragedy and resilience from Elisabeth, while Booker is definately a man with a past and skin he's not comfortable in anymore.\n\nThe ending... I'll let you be the judge due to the nature of it. It's definitely you take what you will with it since there really isn't a proper answer besides speculation to be honest. The one the game presents is possible but flawed in my mind, but given the game's title, who am I to really judge? Play it and see if you choose to believe it as it is one of the infinite possibilities.","timestamp_created":1403937645,"timestamp_updated":1403985861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614140510559082031","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10896729","author":{"steamid":"76561198079481054","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1458,"last_played":1404193834},"language":"english","review":"if you have money buy this game","timestamp_created":1403937310,"timestamp_updated":1403937310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10895430","author":{"steamid":"76561198094422594","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1491597002},"language":"english","review":"Cool game, great gameplay, and awesome story.

Könnte ist hierbei der absolut richtige Ausdruck, denn es war eins der langweiligsten Spiele die ich gespielt habe. \n\nDie Grafik ist gut, das ist aber auch das einzig gute. Die Story war total schlecht und langweilig, so dass ich mich öfter aufmuntern musste das Spiel weiter zuspielen. Das Gameplay ist zudem auch nicht das gelbe vom Ei. Im großen gibt es 4-5 Gegnertypen die man aber nach und nach auswendig kennt. Dazu kommt dann noch, das es wirklich sehr sehr einfach war auf mittlerer Schwierigkeit. Einzig an einer Stelle musste ich öfter mich versuchen. \n\nIm Gesamten bleibt jedoch, dass ich dieses Spiel nicht hätte kaufen sollen.
