Our objective as the allied forces: capture all flags and take over Caen. One thing stood in our way- the Axis forces.\nI chose the loadout of a sniper, and on my way to my favourite spot of a derelict building I captured our two closest flags. As I turned the corner, I pulled out my Colt 1911 in case any Nazi scum were lurking, waiting for me. Luckily, my path was unblocked and I safely made it to the window overlooking the courtyard.\nI scoped in to see my good friend John get shot in the balls, then stabbed repeatedly as he lay on the floor helpless. I avenged his death- all it took was a simple pull of the trigger. I saw man after man come out of the Axis base only to meet the cold, fast bullet propelled by my Springfield sniper rifle. \nIt was about ten kills later when I met my match. One of the men I had killed had magically respawned with a rocket launcher! And of course, he knew exactly where I was sniping from. He crawled out of an alleyway, round a statue, aimed and fired. \nI only saw him just in time, but not fast enough to stop him. The rocket flying through the air, towards me seemed to be going in slow motion -everything was. I accepted my death, and it didnt hurt one bit as it flew through the window and obliterated me.\n\n\nAll kidding and stories aside, this is what a 15 year old gamer historian would call a beautiful game. Sure it's got old graphics, but they're really not bad and it has a source version anyway (I prefer the original by the way). The loudouts are varied very well, players tend to be friendly enough and the maps can be amazing.\nBut the best thing about this game is the one hit kills. Most guns kill players very quickly, which makes DOD realistic and exciting. Highly recomended\n\n\nI made this review because I was bored and a good review is always useful when you're deciding whether or not to buy a game.","timestamp_created":1441384754,"timestamp_updated":1446236287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17853161","author":{"steamid":"76561197995935948","num_games_owned":652,"num_reviews":109,"playtime_forever":194135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":102,"playtime_at_review":30272,"last_played":1660105608},"language":"english","review":"Please ignore all the reviews saying 'this game is dead'. That is simply not true. DOD 1.3 has a thriving, though comparatively small, community as of 2015. You will always find populated servers and the clans/communities running those servers have been around for years. They know how to run them well. I have noticed that each server tends to have a busy time of day and everybody plays on everybody else's servers. Play this game for a few weeks and you will notice the same people popping up everywhere you play. That is a wonderful thing to say about a community, and this one is as friendly and welcoming to new players as you are likely to find. According to steam stats the game has ~200 players (30 day average). Source has around three to four times that number at time of writing. Whilst that doesn't sound like a lot it is definitely enough to sustain this game with many different servers utilising different setups and mods giving some nice variation in gameplay. There is even still competitive play and a league still in existence. The only thing you will not find is realism, the last unit having died a few years ago. In conclusion, this is a GREAT game which deserves to go on being played. Try it. It's cheap and can run on a calculator. You may play it for two minutes and think 'the nades are ridiculously overpowered'. That would be my one major criticism of this game. You may, however, love it.","timestamp_created":1441228784,"timestamp_updated":1441228784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554264664649963379","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17767278","author":{"steamid":"76561198110034926","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":618,"last_played":1458880540},"language":"english","review":"good game, but its dead.","timestamp_created":1440832504,"timestamp_updated":1440832504,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17744381","author":{"steamid":"76561197991904140","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":2716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2608,"last_played":1584921915},"language":"french","review":"Un jeu au top pour passer de bonnes soirées entre amis ou seul en multi","timestamp_created":1440710212,"timestamp_updated":1440710212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17741145","author":{"steamid":"76561198104043213","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":155,"last_played":1440701742},"language":"spanish","review":"Para pasar el rato esta bien, te sientes como si estuveras en la segunda guerra mundial \n\n\n\nPD: No se como fue la segunda guerra mundial :D","timestamp_created":1440696819,"timestamp_updated":1440696819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":38,"weighted_vote_score":"0.666225314140319824","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17740053","author":{"steamid":"76561198155601515","num_games_owned":377,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":179,"last_played":1475372400},"language":"brazilian","review":"Não pude aproveitar muito do game por conta do ping, ;-;

The first WW2 shooter on Steam and the first WW2 shooter I've played so we all know this game is old and I have nostalgia for this game.\n\n-Launching The Game: When you first launch Day of Defeat you are met with Two Soldiers charging at the enemy with a very dark and green background that is complemented with a very dark World War Two sounding theme which fits well the the title... Day of Defeat....\n\n-The Factions: The game has 3 factions you can play as. The Americans, The Germans, and The British. this sounds like it could be a very fun 3 way battle game like Planetside 2 but not at all since only Allied forces and Fight the Germans. Each faction has their own victory themes, uniforms, flags, voice acting, weaponry, and even their own classes which makes playing the individual factions feel unique.\n\n-The Classes: Day of Defeat's way of making guns that posess their own playstyle was to make them their own classes. This idea is as good as it is bad because a new player will be forced to test out most of these classes (around 15-21 if your Americans or Germans) to adjust to the playstyle they like the most which can be enjoyable. The huge issue with this is that most servers have class limits and restrictions enforced so people have to know the corks behind every weapon in the game to be effective.\n\n-The Shooting: Day of Defeat's shooting mechanic vs it's bigger brother, Counter Strike, is very baisic and easy to pickup on. you point and hold M1 but however there is a recoil system. If you dont control your bursts or mouse the enemy will think your trying to shoot birds instead of them. So with the classes you have at your disposal you will need to learn their recoil paterns. When it comes to the hitboxes they work very well and I hardly have issues with them (unlike it' source counterpart). There is one huge balance issue however. Grenade spamming. Grenade spamming is huge in DoD. Players are given around 2-10 grenades per life (depending on the server)  and people would rather clear choke points, objectives, and spawn zones with their grenades. For the server who have grenades limited to 1 or none. Thumbs up.\n\n-The Maps: When it comes to defaualt DoD maps they are sometimes rare to come across since a lot of the servers play custom maps and for TF2 players, hear this. There are a TON of orange servers that operate just like CP_Orange in TF2. For the defualt maps I can find, they very well fit the World War 2 era and most of them are balanced and others might sacrifice balance to make the game seem less like your staring at a mirrored image on your minimap.\n\n-Sound Design: The weapons all sound unique and the sounds they make can be used to identify what faction they are from. The soundtrack however is very limited to only playing music at the end of a round or when you launch the game for the first time. The music you do hear is very recognizable and fits well with their factions.\n\n-The Community: DoD is a very old game so very old people tend to stick with it when they got it when they were 14 so coming across squeakers is very rare. Since the way servers work is that you would normaly join the same server that you had the best connection to and that was enjoyable at the same time. People have become regulars at that same server for years so you might say a name and there is a chance that someone on the server will recognize it.

First got into it when a PCGamer Magazine featured beta 1.3 in one of their CDRoms that came with the magazine, back in 2001 I think. Stopped playing for a while in the middle of the decade, picked it up again a few years ago, and have been playing pretty regularly.\n\nFor new players, a little advice, please change your name before entering your first game. Communication is key, don't get sniped and neglect to tell your team where the sniper is.\n\nDo not sit in one spot for too long. Some of these guys have been playing since before you were born and can hit any spot on the map. Crouch and shoot unless you're caught unawares, then make yourself a moving target and aim for the head. Stay in cover, but if you kill someone move your position, good teams communicate. Don't take the mg to the top of the bank on Caen or to either sniper loft, you will die very fast. \n\nLearn to snipe on your feet, laying down and sniping is the worst. Try to vary your routine, if you choose the same route too often, experienced players will learn to anticipate you. When sniping an exit from the side, place your crosshair a few feet in front of the exit to give yourself enough space to shoot a streaking opposing player exiting. \n\nThrow your nades on the ground and pick them up, hold them for a sec and then throw them [holding time will vary]. \n\nIf you use an automatic weapon, aim at center mass and quickly streak up to the head. When walking let your crosshairs naturally rest in a slightly elevated position, that way if you suddenly come upon an enemy, you will likely already be aiming at his head [beware, pros will crouch to avoid this very thing [ofc they'll also jump to avoid your shot, idk do your best]]. Fire in short bursts. Change your crosshairs to dynamic instead of static. \n\nHave fun. This game is great, there is a core community left that is mostly polite and old. But there is still some young blood, like me and others. Try out the Merrill's Marauder's 24/7 Caen and Avalanche servers. They are consistently full and well administrated. I'm usually on in the afternoon/night.

set out in the morning, warily checking windows, corners, anywhere the Germans could spring a trap or an ambush. \n\nJohannson was in the lead, Garand at the ready and bayonet fixed improperly. Rook was shadowing him, double checking each spot that Johannson had checked before. I was in the middle with Peters and his trusty sniper rifle, carrying the M2 Browning. And Stewart was in the rear, covering our backs with his Thompson at the ready.\n\nThe others had been glancing uncertainly at the MG I held in my hands, but I quickly dismissed the growing fear as they were undoubtly only nervous about a rookie with such a powerful weapon.\n\nIt was quiet. Too quiet.\n\nThe bridge we had set out to capture was undefended, and we quickly set up a defensive position in case a German patrol stumbled upon us.\n\nThe sound started as a low rumble. We looked around, at each other, confused as to why the ground was shaking. It got louder, and we could soon hear the sound of people yelling. We readied our weapons, getting ready for the enemy to throw a grenade or fire a Panzerschreck.\n\nBut nothing could prepare us for what happened next.\n\nA giant tide of German soldiers, all carrying trench shovels and primed Steilhandgranates in their hands, came around the corner, rushing at us screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\nWe opened fire, but there were too many and we were quickly overrun.\n\nStewart was the first to go, having gotten overzealous with his Thompson. He had managed to push the wave of Germans back, when they surrounded him and began pummeling him to death with their shovels. \n\nOne of them, holding a grenade, charged Rook and Johannson from behind. They never saw it coming.\n\nBy now, it was only me and Peters, him firing his sniper rifle with reckless abandon.  Running out of ammo, Peters quickly pulled out his M1911 and managed to squeeze off a few shots, but it wasn't long before he too was buried under the mass of grey and black.\n\nI was cornered, MG propped up against an overturned cart while I mowed down soldier after soldier, spent casings flying everywhere.  From out of nowhere, a fist collided with my face and I blacked out.\n\nWaking up, I found I was tied down to a chair in a pitch black room.  The only thing visible was a glowing box directly in front of me with words written on it.  Squinting my eyes, I barely made out the small, black letters.\n\nThe box read:\n\n[b]Kicked from server.
