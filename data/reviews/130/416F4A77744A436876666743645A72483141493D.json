They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly.

Вы - охранник [b]Барни Калхун[/b], друг [b]доктора Фримена[/b](протогониста первой части), просто приезжаете на работу, как и Гордон, но в Черной Мезе творится странное, проблемы с безопасностью, ученый орет на охранника что не может отправить отчет и его работа под угрозой и т.д; потом происходит каскадный резонанс, как вы помните, начинают вылезать твари из зена, приезжают военные и начинают массовый геноцид ученых, вы в это время просто убиваете сотни врагов и идете в непонятном направлении. Потом в один момент встречаете умирающего ученого, который скажет что они с [b]доктором Розенбергом[/b] хотели свалить отсюда пока не поздно через старые экспериментальные закрытые лаборатории, но Розенберга схватили военные, а этого ученого сильно ранили. Вы находите Розенберга, спасаете его и тут есть 2 момента: мне понравилось что Розенберг вас подсадил(не буду говорить, зачем, потом узнаете), это очень прикольно и интересно для 20-летней игры, а второе - это ключевой нужный вам персонаж, а не просто мясо как в первой части, вместе с ним вы пробиваетесь к тому месту где умер первый ученый, проламываете стену, находите лифт и спускаетесь в старые заброшенные лаборатории, где проводили эксперименты с порталами, по лору [b]Black Mesa[/b] была  конкурентом [b]Aperture[/b], компании из серии игр Portal, создавшей порталган, но у Мезы портальная пушка работала по-другому, ребята из Мезы нашли мир между мирами Зен, откуда и начали лезть все твари и меза забросила изучение порталов ради изучения Зена, природы и существ оттуда. Вы спускаетесь на часик реального времени на лифте, включаете питание портала, возвращаетесь, восстанавливаете связь с устройством в Зене, которое помогает телепортироваться по выбранным координатам в наш мир через Зен и после этого возвращаетесь и все вместе сваливаете и уезжаете из лабораторий на машине с учеными.\n[b]Что еще мне понравилось[/b] - то что по прохождению вы 3-4 раза будете видеть Гордона, либо слышать как о нем говорят военные, это создает лучшее погружение и связывает эти две истории как единое целое, но с двух ракурсов. \n\n[h1]Вывод[/h1]\nНу, повторюсь: рекомендую всем поиграть, отличная игра и интересный шутер, который реально интересно проходить, не смотря на его возраст. Если вы не знаете английский и не будете понимать речь персонажей, то будет не так классно играть, [u]но даже без сюжета это классный шутер.[/u] Возможно, структура отчета зайдет не всем, но это просто обыкновенная [b]Half-Life[/b] с другим, более интересным, сюжетом и большую часть обзора я дискутирую о нем, в целом эта игра крайне схожа с оригиналом и выделять геймплей в отдельный отдел под отдельным заголовком я не стал. \nПриятной игры, если кто-то как я проходит 20-летние игры)","timestamp_created":1618043015,"timestamp_updated":1627416465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90051154","author":{"steamid":"76561198278986879","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1618027303},"language":"english","review":"barney","timestamp_created":1618040968,"timestamp_updated":1618040968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90042036","author":{"steamid":"76561198872297642","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":274,"last_played":1565873746},"language":"english","review":"A good DLC, but I completed the game twice and I've only played it for 4 hours so if you're not into short games... well.","timestamp_created":1618025332,"timestamp_updated":1618025332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90032818","author":{"steamid":"76561198409638907","num_games_owned":673,"num_reviews":189,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1618010042},"language":"french","review":"Injouable","timestamp_created":1618010061,"timestamp_updated":1618010061,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471014469861984253","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90030118","author":{"steamid":"76561198252522608","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":162,"last_played":1617996837},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1618005948,"timestamp_updated":1618005948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90026904","author":{"steamid":"76561198202999986","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":138,"last_played":1586515745},"language":"turkish","review":"İlk oyunu oynayıp doymadıysanız çıtır çerez bir yan oyun bence.","timestamp_created":1618001729,"timestamp_updated":1618001729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90013900","author":{"steamid":"76561198935864880","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":213,"last_played":1617985492},"language":"english","review":"Aaaaaaand done, now Barney where's that beer you owe me?
