Не могу сказать, что меня игра особо зацепила, если бы я поиграл в нее на старте релиза или хотя бы в начале 2000-х, то наверняка Half Life стала бы моей одной из самых любимых игр.

Так что повторюсь, игра безусловно хороша, но время ее прошло и теперь это лишь просто огромная и довольно значимая часть истории видео ировой индустрии.","timestamp_created":1499617078,"timestamp_updated":1499617078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33407856","author":{"steamid":"76561198011862274","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":2478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":919,"last_played":1585342786},"language":"english","review":"much fun, much classic, wow","timestamp_created":1499616091,"timestamp_updated":1499616091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33405329","author":{"steamid":"76561198173748162","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1524695437},"language":"spanish","review":"Malardo 0/10","timestamp_created":1499610046,"timestamp_updated":1587083552,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.438505560159683228","comment_count":24,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33400932","author":{"steamid":"76561198120219473","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1488,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1268,"last_played":1654268613},"language":"english","review":"\"Masterpiece\"","timestamp_created":1499598160,"timestamp_updated":1531042024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33400563","author":{"steamid":"76561198256854622","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":465,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":317,"last_played":1516887329},"language":"turkish","review":"Efsanenin indirime girdiğini görünce eskisi kadar oynamayacağımı bildiğim halde sadece kütüphanemde durması için aldım.

I won't say that I wasted two dollars, but this game was an enormous disappointment. I don't care that the graphics suck; of course they would on an old game. That's not an issue. The issue is that the plot makes no sense and the gameplay isn't very good. \n\nThe whole premise is just a run-of-the-mill \"we scienced too hard, and now bad things are attacking, and you're the only one who can stop them!\" But then suddenly the military is involved and they know your name for no apparent reason, and then this weird dude with a breifcase, like, removes you from the world or something. It doesn't make sense, and then when you look up someone explaining it on the internet, it's still wholly unfulfilling as a storyline.\n\nThen there's the gameplay. First and foremost, the movement mechanics are ABYSMAL. Holy shit, I haven't been that frustrated with just trying to walk around since I played Ocarina of Time (which is a good game, but early 3-D was hell). It's especially annoying given how many jumping puzzles there are. Nothing stands out as special, and I found myself spending hours hiding behind doors taking potshots at yet another of the same enemy until it finally died. And for fuck's sake, how many times did they think I would still find it interesting to turn a blind corner and \"Ha HA! A headcrab was hiding there! Bet you never saw that coming! Have a few points of basically unavoidable damage again!

Wow, Im deeply divided on this.\n\nOn the one hand the level design was pretty nice, the story interesting, environments good, graphics are alright, sound is ok, but soundtrack isnt anything special though. \n\nOn the other, controls felt awkward and caused a lot of deaths, in most situations the game tries to take you by surprise and it often feels it gets cheap kills (if yore low on HP, you may die from falls that are scripted, if you dont have grenades in some ares youre screwed, etc), some of the weapon functionality isnt explained, for example, only at the end I realised that if the laser sight is on the rockets will mimick your movements when launched (Lord, that was a pain in the ass), how some other weapons worked I didnt understand at all. The game creates an environment where you will get killed a lot unless you know the layout of the missions and know well how to use controls and weapons. Being careful, attentive and having good reflexes will often be not enough if youre playing this for the first time, there is often little room to maneuver on the spot. Its basically challenging you to play it again. Thing is, there is not much incentive in this day and age to play it again once you beat the story.\n\nEven though this game made me frustrated quite often, I will give it a positive review, considering its a 20 years old game and, what was the deciding factor for me, I really liked the end credits music after you finish the game. )))\n\nAll in all, it is a good game.\n\nBut be warned, you should only get this in the bundle with the rest of the franchise and on sale.

honest review:\nI wasn't around for when this game first came out so I don't have any nostalgia for it or any emotional attachments as many people do. So this review is unbiased. I have to say though it's a pretty awesome game. The graphics aren't that great but other than that everything else is pretty solid. Story is good and the gunplay is straight up awesome.
