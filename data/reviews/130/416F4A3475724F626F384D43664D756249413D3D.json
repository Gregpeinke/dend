This time you assume the role of security guard Barney Calhoun, during the events of the original game. Just like the original game and Opposing Force, your main objective is to survive by assisting fellow Black Mesa Employees, using any weapon or tool to your advantage and by using your wits. Blue shift does just that.\n\nGameplay wise, It's still the engaging Half Life everyone knows and loves. Real Time cutscenes? Check. Aggresive and sophisticated enemies? Check. Reliable friendly NPC's? Check. Clever puzzles and well designed levels? Check. And the epic and intense gunplay that the original had? Yep, it's all here. Graphically, it's just like the previous games. The levels look as varied as ever, and the audio still breaths a great atmosphere into the game. So far, everything that is included in this expansion is good.\n\nBut it's the worst installment in the series.\n\nAnd why, do you ask? Because, unlike it's predecessors, it's really short. Really, really short. And unlike Opposing Force, it didn't really add anything new. OK, maybe the HEV battery pickups have now been replaced by Body armour since you are a security guard instead of a heavily armoured scientist/soldier. But... other than that... that's it. No new guns, no new NPC types, friendly or enemy, no new level obstacles and gimmicks, no nothing. Hell, it even lacks some things from the original Half Life, such as certain weapons and an end boss. With an impressive expansion like Opposing force being released before this, I was honestly expecting to see a lot more, but instead, it feels like a watered down Half Life. It's still nice, but it could've been so much more.\n\nOverall, Half Life: Blue Shift is a fairly decent expansion, although a tad bit underwhelming considering the content it's two predecessors delivered before it. If you enjoyed Half Life or Opposing Force, I'd say you check Blue Shift out. If you never played either of those two, this is not the best place to start. It's way too short and light on content and the other Half Life games deliver so much more.

It does have an interesting side story, and is taken from the perspective of a Black Mesa security guard, one who is featured prominently in the Half-Life 2 games. It fills in some backstory and explains a bit more of the Black Mesa Incident. Blue Shift is really just more of Half-Life 1, which isn't a bad thing, it just doesn't feels as different from the main game as Opposing Force did.","timestamp_created":1390277323,"timestamp_updated":1390277323,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.46875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8791389","author":{"steamid":"76561198095225350","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":1223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":758,"last_played":1560908880},"language":"english","review":"w","timestamp_created":1390269595,"timestamp_updated":1489552407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8785837","author":{"steamid":"76561198076942710","num_games_owned":547,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1428573567},"language":"russian","review":"Good game!","timestamp_created":1390238037,"timestamp_updated":1390238037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563750565052032471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8752229","author":{"steamid":"76561198073019164","num_games_owned":415,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":152,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":152,"last_played":1384218229},"language":"english","review":"Blue Shift is somewhat weak and short compared to Opposing Force, but is necessary to walk through as it is part of the original story.","timestamp_created":1390046401,"timestamp_updated":1390046401,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509433984756469727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8717556","author":{"steamid":"76561198072806865","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":118,"last_played":1636569895},"language":"english","review":"Another nice expansion pack for Half-Life.

The game is disappointingly short, lacks any serious challenge, interesting weapons, or new enemies. The story is also pretty lack luster. You play as Barney, the security guard you see pounding on the door in the intro to Half-Life, who is later used as a side character in Half-Life 2. The G-Man plays no serious role in the game, unlike his direct involvement in the endings of Half-Life, or Opposing Force. The ending (spoiler alert) falls completely flat. Get teleported to a parking lot, then drive away. No enemies, no hurry, no stress, no reward. Huzzah, right? I want to like this game, but I don't. Gearbox and Valve got really lazy. Your money is better spent on Opposing Force, about 10 new guns, about 5 new enemeis, new bosses, a pretty decent story, and an interesting new perspective. Blue Shift offers none of this, and isn't worth your time.","timestamp_created":1388456025,"timestamp_updated":1388456025,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468085110187530518","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4urObo8MCfMubIA=="}
