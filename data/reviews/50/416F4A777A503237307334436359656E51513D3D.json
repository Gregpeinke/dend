Even though I was playing it on medium difficulty as Half Life before, I felt like I was easier passing through the game with almost no moments of frustration.\n\nWhat I didn't like about the expansion was night vision, being stuck in elevator glitch and the final boss fight. The night vision is way too green, which makes the walking in the darkness very unpleasant. Remember to save before you enter elevators or small tunnels. And finally the last boss frustration. I really liked the game, but the final boss took me 2 hours to kill. First I tried to shoot it and there I wasted most of my ammunition so after I figured out what needs to be done, I decided to use Shock Roach to defeat it. They said I just need to repeat all the action several times and it will eventually die. It didn't. This alien weapon is completely uneffective against it.

The first thing to know is that neither one is a continuation of Gordon Freeman's story. Instead, each is a look at the Black Mesa Incident from a different perspective. In Opposing Force, you play as Cpl. Adrian Shephard, one of the marines sent in to contain the catastrophe. You'll be moving through some of the same areas as Freeman, but the game is laudable in that while every area feels familiar, you'll rarely feel as if you're running over the same old ground.\n\nSo, how's the story? Well, like Half-Life, the story is that you're attempting to escape Black Mesa. Cpl. Shephard is one of the first wave of marines sent in, and your transport is shot down immediately. The unit is thrown into complete chaos, and no one has any idea what they're doing. After all, while you might remember the marines from Half-Life as murderous enemies hellbent on killing everything in Black Mesa, Shephard's unit is lost before they can receive that order. Shephard is simply trying to escape, but like Freeman, he'll have an alien threat of his own to deal with. He also has more help than Freeman. While in Half-Life, you had security guards and scientists to aid you in different ways, he also has help from the scattered remnants of the military, namely medics, who heal you like scientists but more so, and engineers, who can cut locked doors open.  \n\nThe weapon roster has been expanded as well. While Shephard doesn't have access to the Gluon Gun or the Tau Cannon, he has a number of new weapons to make up for it. The revolver is replaced with the (better) Desert Eagle and the Crossbow is replaced with the (better) sniper rifle. The Displacer Cannon is an interesting but only situationally useful weapon that opens portals to Xen, the alien dimension. The primary fire basically works as a powerful, slow rocket, destroying any enemy it comes into contact with, and the secondary fire teleports you to different areas of Xen depending on where you are in the game, which is useful to escape combat and grab a few items. There are a couple of alien weapons as well, the Shock Rifle (an energy assault rifle) and the Spore Launcher, a sort of alien grenade launcher. The crowbar is split into the absolutely useless wrench and the awesome knife, and a new melee weapon is added in the form of the Barnacle, which isn't all that useful in combat, but serves as a hookshot and is played with liberally later in the game. A number of new enemies are also added, and all are challenging and fun to fight. I'll not spoil those for you.\n\nOpposing Force is a textbook expansion pack. It adds a ton of new content, is reasonably lengthy as 6-7 hours, and well, it's more Half-Life. Perhaps the only two complaints I can think of are that the end-boss isn't all that interesting and that the whole military angle changes the feel, sort of like Aliens to Half-Life's Alien. At the end of the day, if you're a Half-Life fan, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up.","timestamp_created":1439179502,"timestamp_updated":1439179502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500907480716705322","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17458506","author":{"steamid":"76561197994626924","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":441,"last_played":1439053954},"language":"french","review":"very good game again","timestamp_created":1439131745,"timestamp_updated":1439131745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17445061","author":{"steamid":"76561198210503587","num_games_owned":752,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164,"last_played":1468353472},"language":"russian","review":"Вот оно, наше любимое, детство!)","timestamp_created":1439049575,"timestamp_updated":1439049575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533881723880767822","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17444132","author":{"steamid":"76561197997277236","num_games_owned":1335,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":539,"last_played":1439044981},"language":"english","review":"I hope you like save scumming","timestamp_created":1439045129,"timestamp_updated":1439045129,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469795882701873779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17435458","author":{"steamid":"76561198205544076","num_games_owned":365,"num_reviews":115,"playtime_forever":280,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":115,"last_played":1522782468},"language":"english","review":"Everyone likes a hero, but everyone loves a good villian.","timestamp_created":1438987379,"timestamp_updated":1449069711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17434280","author":{"steamid":"76561198036839493","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":853,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":473,"last_played":1518979146},"language":"english","review":"\"Government cover ups were not in my job description\"","timestamp_created":1438981092,"timestamp_updated":1438981092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17428512","author":{"steamid":"76561198072920687","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":74,"playtime_forever":36,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1436475141},"language":"english","review":"Multiplayer was pretty fun I didnt finish the story mode butt it still was a good Half Life game!","timestamp_created":1438952547,"timestamp_updated":1438952547,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17416761","author":{"steamid":"76561198119087489","num_games_owned":354,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":516,"last_played":1445625456},"language":"english","review":"If you like half life, you must play this expansion.

I haven't tried multi.]\n\nSo I finally played Opposing Force, 13 years after originally buying it in the Half-Life Generation pack... and it was so much better than I expected! Actually, it was maybe even better than Half-Life itself. I thought it would be just like playing an additional map of Half-Life, and boy was I wrong. The gameplay is quite different, much more nervous and fast, in the fashion of Doom and Quake. There are new aliens, new awesome weapons, and even some cool puzzles. And it makes you feel like discovering more of the Half-Life universe; it gives you a better understanding about what is the Black Mesa facility and what happens in there. There are also some nice G-Man sightings. And the difficulty is up several notches compared to HL, which is not a bad thing. Your weapons often feel like they severely lack firepower, which is really frustrating at first, but becomes stimulating because of the challenge it generates. The only flaw about Opposing Force is the terrible AI of your squadmates, and the ridiculous dialogue lines they yell at random times. But even this becomes funny after a while. \"CHECK YOUR ZONE\"!\n\nBottom line: hours of great fun, and quite indispensable if you enjoyed Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1438812260,"timestamp_updated":1456022964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17388454","author":{"steamid":"76561198043609914","num_games_owned":3234,"num_reviews":654,"playtime_forever":291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":291,"last_played":1438269460},"language":"english","review":"Half Life: Opposing Force is the final expansion pack for the original Half Life but is it worth your time ?\n\nHalf Life: Opposing Force puts you in the shoes of Corporal Adrian Shepard who is sent into Black Mesa to kill Gordon Freeman and you get to experience the invasion through his eyes.\n\nGameplay is the same as Half Life and Half Life Blue Shift but it adds new stuff to it. You can use the barnacle monster to swing around the environment. Overall apart from that new mechanic and new weapons like the teleportation gun that sends you to a location with ammo, armor and health pick ups.\n\nThe soundtrack is awesome as always. There are intense music during some of the later firefights and it's awesome. The audio for the bad guys isn't that good but that's too the age of the game. But the music overall is really good.\n\nThis expansion is really hard even on the normal difficulty. You will have to take things slowly, if you move too fast you will die cause some of levels are insanely hard. \n\nLevel Design for the most part is alright, there's less of thinking where to go, but it still has many places to explore to find secret stashes of ammo and health pick ups. But some of the levels have very claustrophobic environments that could confuse some players.\n\nHalf Life Opposing Force took me 5 hours to finish. It's quite short and it's doesn't have much replay value apart from the first playthrough where you will see everything there is to see.\n\nThe game has a few minor bugs like the enemy AI glitching through walls but overall it doesn't happen too often and there aren't any game breaking bugs that I could find.\n\nOverall this is a very good expansion pack compared to Blue Shift. It's longer, adds more stuff and has a better story. Overall If you want the complete Half Life experience than by all means check out Blue Shift and Opposing Force. But if you have to choose one then by all means buy  Opposing Force. I give Half Life: Opposing Force an 8/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","timestamp_created":1438718074,"timestamp_updated":1454102990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605908870697021484","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17359345","author":{"steamid":"76561198050544533","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":321,"last_played":1444705892},"language":"english","review":"you can pet a alien from a middle dimension 10/10","timestamp_created":1438562215,"timestamp_updated":1438562215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17291830","author":{"steamid":"76561198152213920","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":359,"last_played":1475337440},"language":"english","review":"if it was longer it would be just as good as the original.\n\nOpposing Force 2 and Half-Life 3 for 2015 hopefully\n","timestamp_created":1438224933,"timestamp_updated":1438224933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17274148","author":{"steamid":"76561198115240521","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":74,"playtime_forever":236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":235,"last_played":1440181169},"language":"brazilian","review":"para quem quiser relembrar esse vale a pena! loool","timestamp_created":1438127265,"timestamp_updated":1438127265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17263905","author":{"steamid":"76561198060180554","num_games_owned":492,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1594938893},"language":"english","review":"Very good single player addition to Half-Life, plus there is still some multiplayer activity on Steam.\n\nWorth picking up if it is going cheap.","timestamp_created":1438081709,"timestamp_updated":1438081709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17243143","author":{"steamid":"76561198062808998","num_games_owned":983,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":587,"last_played":1437952785},"language":"english","review":"Good expantion to the original Half-Life! ...

Znělo to velmi lákavě, možnost projít si Black Mesu z pozice vojenské jednotky čističů kteří měli zlikvidovat i hrdinu jednička Gordona. Navíc mít k dispozici kolegy, kteří v boji poskytnou palebnou podporu nebo vyřadí zamčené dveře. Vyšlo i demo které mě navnadilo, a mělo tu správnou atmosféru. No a na první dohrání došlo skoro taky po 16 letech. \n\nJe docela paradox, že ke hře mě dostala velká prohlášení od Randy Pitchforda jak chce vzkřísit Duka a sérii Brothers in Arms. Podíval jsem se schválně co vše už má za sebou Gearbox. A mé překvapení je Opposing Force, cože oni? Vážně? Hned se mi vybavila zmíněná vzpomínka. A bylo na čase instalovat na Steamu hru. \n\nPrvní věc po nainstalování a spuštění, mě zaujala grafika přesně jak jsem si jí pamatoval, a vůbec mi nepřišlo, že by nějak více zošklivěla po letech. Pomalejší rozjezd, prozkoumávání oblasti, sebrání první zbraně a už to jelo. Hratelnost má tento datadisk stále výbornou, a já se do hry neustále nořil více a více. Kolegové vojáci mi občas pomohli, ale byly pro mě spíš obavou aby danou přestřelku přežili, i když na tom hra netrvala, tak pro svůj pocit jsem je většinou udržel na živu. \n\nKromě starých známých lokací se tu objevují i nové zbraně a nepřátelé. Nejvíc sem si oblíbil mimozemské kousky, jejich design a účelnost ve hře byly vidět. Hra ovšem nedá nic zadarmo, a její obtížnost není malá, zvláště pasáže s jednotkami Black Ops nebo s hejnem silnějších alienů byla výzva. Datadisk který nabídl přes 6 hodin dlouhou kampaň, solidní porci nového obsahu a příběh vojáka Sheparda z Black Mesy nezklamal ani po letech. \n\nHodnocení 80%","timestamp_created":1437757815,"timestamp_updated":1437757815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.78990781307220459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17206796","author":{"steamid":"76561198153955826","num_games_owned":314,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":370,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":350,"last_played":1480326240},"language":"russian","review":"  Просто","timestamp_created":1437756121,"timestamp_updated":1437756121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17204263","author":{"steamid":"76561198170448902","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":176,"last_played":1488746624},"language":"english","review":"Story is terrible but multiplayer (if you can get a match) is SO FUN","timestamp_created":1437745299,"timestamp_updated":1440172400,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.318649739027023315","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17201395","author":{"steamid":"76561198036063422","num_games_owned":781,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":453,"last_played":1437729701},"language":"english","review":"Short, and not as good as HL.

Playing as a military grunt in charge of chasing down Gordon Freeman you get such an incredible insight into the workings of each historic event from the original game with the same great arsenal (missing the crowbar). Though the level design is somewhat cumbersome at times I'll forgive it because it does a great job of adding flavour to the series. A must play for fans of Half-Life. \nAgain, an older game I will not use my original review system and give it an 8/10.

It has a great story and concept and brings cool new weapons and abilities to the franchise. However, half-way through, it gets off ballence. Enemies are over-powered and numerous, often coming at you in ambushes. They also don't explain the new species of alien, or why Gordon Freeman and Barney Calhoun never saw any of them. There were many instances in which playing this game felt like a chore but by then you're too far gone to just give up now. There is a bug that prevents the final sequence from playing after you beat the final boss (which was a complete waste of time) so I had to go on Youtube to see the result of my seven hours' hard work. \n\n5/10 I love Half-Life but I just can't with this game.
