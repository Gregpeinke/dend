Unfortunately, this game doesn't offer much more than the 1998 classic already does. Sure, there's a few graphical improvements, some cool physics, and I can see through the surface of the water this time, but this Source \"remaster\" also comes with its fair share of bugs. \nA few of these bugs include: scientists and guards screaming repeatedly if they get injured, levitating guns/health kits, and the skybox in certain maps will distort if you look at the sky.\nAsides from the minor improvements and bugs, this game contains the same epic journey that changed the FPS genre forever, including a level select (with every level already unlocked so you can skip right to Xen if you want) and more loading screens than before.\n\n[b]Rating: A One-to-One Source Port That Could Have Done More[/b]\nI'd have to rank Half-Life: Source at a 5/10. I can't recommend this game to anyone whose already played the 1998 classic. Only get it for the Garry's Mod assets. If you want a real remaster, check out the 2020 fan remake of Half-Life (called Black Mesa) made by Crowbar Collective. It may not be an official Valve game, but it certainly adds a whole lot more to Half-Life than this game did.","timestamp_created":1638937548,"timestamp_updated":1638937548,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105421568","author":{"steamid":"76561199003912019","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":267,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":251,"last_played":1639420246},"language":"russian","review":"топ","timestamp_created":1638901278,"timestamp_updated":1638901278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105419317","author":{"steamid":"76561199084615388","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1167,"last_played":1644179244},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegazo,buenos escenarios,enemigos,armas y lore,el unico problema esque hay 2 partes que tienen algunos bugs graficos,pero son en partes especificas y solo 1 de ellos es realmenete molesto, y lo otro \"malo\" esque el personaje avanza muy rapido,quitando eso, si te gustan los juegos debes jugarlo si o si,ademas de que es un juego con unos requisitos bastante bajos,por lo que a menos que tu PC sea una patata,lo mas seguro esque puedas jugar comodamente el juego y con los graficos HD activados","timestamp_created":1638898474,"timestamp_updated":1638898474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105411026","author":{"steamid":"76561198415401159","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6,"playtime_at_review":77,"last_played":1660139728},"language":"polish","review":"This \"remaster\" of the glorious classic Half Life is like an Resonance Cascade.

sincera opinião\n\nO jogo em si é bom, sabe, mas essa versão é tipo o \"GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition\" só que bem menos cagado que o GTA, deu uma leve defecada no que funcionava no jogo clássico, erro no áudio do pé de cabra e bug na skybox por exemplo, coisas que na minha opinião são bobas e que não atrapalharam minha gameplay mas que poderia ser arrumado tranquilamente (na verdade até onde eu sei a comunidade consertou com mods) enfim recomendo pegar em promoção caso alguém tenha curiosidade de como é essa versão ou pra quem só quer jogar essa obra de arte, recomendo pegar o clássico

If you're deciding which to buy, it honestly doesn't matter. The water is nicer in this game and there are ragdolls and better physics. Other than that, it's essentially the same game. Don't worry about not getting the \"pure\" experience of HL1 because this is essentially it.

But I played only deathmatch and not single-player mode back then. It was much later and after I already completed Half-Life 2 in the middle of 2000s, when I finally have beaten Half-Life 1. The series are very important to me and while I like Half-Life 2 the most, the very first game also holds an important place in my heart. The story of Half-Life 1 is not the most original. However, the way how it's written and portrayed it's what makes it so good and revolutionary. There was no cut-scenes in the game and we were watching everything from the eyes of our protagonist Gordon Freeman. It was only much later that such way of storytelling became common in videogame industry. The fact that Gordon was a theoretical physicist and not military or someone like Duke Nukem was interesting and original plot element (but obviously, it can be questioned how he knows how to operate all the weapons then). It's also worth to mention that Valve took inspirations in famous novel \"The Mist\" of legendary Stephen King while writing the story. So, today, if you are considering to experience this classics, you can choose either this version, the original or Black Mesa. But the last one is remake with many things changed/added. So, if you want to go closer to original, you shall choose either the original itself or this source version. And it would be clever decision to pick this one. Despite all the claims about bugs and so on, it has also its own advantages and is playable. As for me, as a series fan I like all the versions and I must also note that Black Mesa is a very good remake indeed and is absolutely worth playing.","timestamp_created":1638016116,"timestamp_updated":1641817610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104278234","author":{"steamid":"76561198076907703","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":686,"last_played":1582147660},"language":"latam","review":"En el año 2025 Gabe Newell vende los derechos de la franquicia Half-Life al conglomerado formado por la fusión entre EA y Ubisoft.

Na początku gra była w porządku (zakładając, że to moje pierwsze podejście do jakiegokolwiek half-life'a). Liczyłem się od początku z tym, że grafika nie powali bla bla itd.. Dotarłem gdzieś do połowy gry. Nie licząc tego, że kilka razy trzeba było wczytywać zapis gry sprzed 30 min (soft-locki), bawiłem się... ok? Kiedy jednak dotarłem do tej \"przetwarzalni śmieci\" (?) gra zablokowała się po raz kolejny. Trzeba było rozwalić na odległość 2 miny laserowe. Jako, że bronie głównego bohatera są kradzione jakieś 30 min przed tym momentem to miałem tylko łom i rewolwer, który gdzieś podniosłem. W chwili gdy miałem zniszczyć miny miałem 1 pocisk. No i dupa! Ostatni zapis jakieś 45 min temu. Ja mam nerwy poszarpane, a chciałbym dodać, że próbowałem się wrócić w poszukiwaniu innej broni/amunicji. Okazuje się, że gdzieś wcześniej był jeszcze pistolet ale ten był zupełnie pomijalny. Kiedy dowiedziałem się, że nie wyjdę z pomieszczenia w którym utknąłem, poddałem się. Ta gra mnie złamała. Powiem tyle:\n- fabuła ciekawa\n- bronie ok\n- na jakość innych rzeczy nie narzekam (sam wybrałem taką wersję gry choć są lepsze)\nA co nie jest fajne? No chociażby to, że można się tak zsoft-lockować. Jako, że chce poznać lore tego świata to pewnie obejrzę resztę gameplayu na YouTube. Gra nie powinna postawić mnie w takiej sytuacji. Liczę, że dodatki to hl1 i hl2 poprawią mi ten niesmak w ustach. \nJak komuś się to podoba, szanuję i rozumiem. Ja sam dobrze się bawiłem ale to szczęście uciekało z każdą chwilą. Jest mi przykro, że taki klasyk otrzymuje ode mnie ocenę negatywną.\n\n\nAKTUALIZACJA:\nHo ho ho, udało się! Użyłem konsoli deweloperskiej i dodałem sobie amunicję, Można by powiedzieć, że skoro mi się udało to będę zadowolony, nie? No i byłem... do czasu, ale o tym później. Kilka razy podczas rozgrywki miewałem denerwujące momenty, a to utknąłem bo miałem 1 HP a przeciwników była chmara i musiałem zapisywać po zabiciu każdego, a to jakiś bug a to glitch itd.. Mimo wszystko było znośnie. Do bossa. Ten mnie irytował niemiłosiernie. Nie było wyraźnie powiedziane co mam zrobić więc większość przerw między umieraniem spędziłem na lataniu wte i wewte. No ale cóż, bywa. \n\nSkoro dałem wcześniej ocenę negatywną wypadałoby ją zmienić na pozytywną skoro mi się udało. No i tak zrobiłem. Gdybym mógł, dałbym ocenę \"mieszaną', ale nie mogę. Podsumowując, gra to klasyk, muzyka ok, fabuła zacna i AI ok. No a reszta taka sobie, ale sam sobie to zgotowałem nie kupując Black Mesa. Denerwowały mnie błędy i boss. Błędów było sporo, więc niby równoważą zalety gry, ale tak jak mówiłem, średniej oceny dać nie mogę. Polecam i dzięki jęśli ktoś to czyta.","timestamp_created":1637961761,"timestamp_updated":1638012128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577329516410827637","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104192583","author":{"steamid":"76561199188700026","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":62,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1638813255},"language":"russian","review":"топ\n:0","timestamp_created":1637961705,"timestamp_updated":1637961705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104135011","author":{"steamid":"76561199038922061","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":566,"last_played":1637697493},"language":"english","review":"Old but gold.","timestamp_created":1637946822,"timestamp_updated":1637946822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104077267","author":{"steamid":"76561199067274201","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1637955499},"language":"russian","review":"с пивком зайдёт","timestamp_created":1637930113,"timestamp_updated":1637930113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104026362","author":{"steamid":"76561199037849751","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":107,"last_played":1637022607},"language":"english","review":"Your guns shine a lot","timestamp_created":1637909591,"timestamp_updated":1637909591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vZ7Brf0Ceo/qjAM="}
