Initially I started playing as I've found out that I had gotten this and Two Wolds II from a sale and (obviously) I have to go through the first one before starting the II. What I've found is:\n\nNice:\n- Cool system of combining same kinds of gear to upgrade them (no skill required). 4 katanas in you inventory? combine them  to a single thicc nippon steel  bad boi. Better gear and less space neede in inventory\n- Nice dialogue and Story execution. The interaction and dialogoues with NPCs during quests is nicely thought out and quite extensive (if you're into that)\n- Massive selection of different gear sets\n- Good combat balance. Never felt too OP unless venturing into high-level territory.\n- Factions with different pros and cons\n\nMeh:\n- Soft locks for some quests that get cancelled after doing other, seemingly unrelated quests\n- MASSIVE juddering and stuttering. No matter what you specs are. but you get used to it\n- Too hard to find a fitting set. I'm at level 57 now and still collecting gear to complete a set that makes sense and is stronger than the stuff I've been combining for 57 levels\n- Some items don't combine although they seem like they should\n- Selling is tedious. No easier way than drag n drop or double click every item\n- Voice acting. Dialogue (as said) would be nice but sometimes the voice acting gets in the way.\n- Story is somewhat basic\n- You can up your reputation in contrasting factions with almost no consequences. doesn't really make sense\n\nOverall really nice game. Deffo worth it.","timestamp_created":1605399760,"timestamp_updated":1605399760,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79101753","author":{"steamid":"76561198063687801","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5911,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1081,"last_played":1639834690},"language":"german","review":"Weites offenes Land mit vielen Keilereien.

I movimenti solo legnosi, i cavalli si bloccano con poco dislivello del terreno, i combattimenti sono brutti da vedere e scattosi (nonostante le buone animazioni delle armi).\nL'ambientazioni è a tratti bella e a tratti spoglia, vuota. Le città sono molto diverse tra loro, ma le campagne sono vuote o monotone, con alcuni gruppi di nemici che spawnano ogni tot metri. Le missioni sembrano molto diversificate, ma alla fine risultano sempre nel trovare un nemico a caso nella mappa e farlo fuori.\nIl gioco è in generale passa da una fase iniziale di divertimento, nello scoprire le varie caratteristiche, ad una noia e tediosità mortale, dimostrando che il gioco sembra quasi \"incompleto\" nell'affinamento delle meccaniche, con tanti buchi o problemi che sembrano dovuti a una noncuranza dei programmatori (o ad una fretta di rilascio).\nGiusto la colonna sonora è particolarmente bella, soprattutto il tema del menù principale (creata tra l'altro dagli Ambermoon, band italiana di gran valore ma da anni sciolta).\nIn generale non consiglio il gioco se cercate un buon gioco di ruolo che vi prenda dall'inizio alla fine, ma se vi incuriosisce vi consiglio di comprarlo con forti sconti a pochi euro.","timestamp_created":1602002516,"timestamp_updated":1602002516,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77059169","author":{"steamid":"76561198166709532","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":7584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7584,"last_played":1566596356},"language":"russian","review":"Ээээх...

RPG von 2009.\n\nIn Europa im Mai 2007 von Zuxxez Entertainment veröffentlicht, in den USA vier Monate später von TopWare Interactive. Die hier vorliegende Version ist wohl eine übersetzte US Version. Ich habe alle 3 gespielt, von daher ist das nachfolgende also zutreffend für alle Versionen.\n\nDu schlüpft`s in die Rolle eines namenlosen jungen Kopfgeldjägers, dessen Schwester Kira von einem Bösewicht namens Reist entführt wurde. Nach monatelanger vergeblicher Suche wirst du von Reist Tungard kontaktiert. Im Spiel sind etliche Videosequenzen die dir das Wissen vermitteln worum es eigentlich geht und was denn dein eigentliches Ziel ist. \nIn diesem Fall die Befreiung des Kriegsgottes Aziraal.  Du gerätst dadurch in den Machtkampf zwischen längst vergessenen Göttern.\nDie Welt Antaloor ist riesig, 60 km² groß dies teilt sich auf in 35 km² Oberwelt und 25 km² Unterwelt. Es gibt fünf große Städte und über 50 Dörfer sowie zahlreiche Höhlen und andere versteckte Orte. Der RPG Gedanke zeigt sich deutlich in dem du wirklich viele verschiedene Aufgaben lösen mußt und deinen Charakter weiterentwickeln kannst. \n\nFür all jene ein Tipp die gerne der Haupthandlung hinterher rennen. Wenn ihr das tut werdet ihr nur ein Bruchteil dessen erspielen was dieses ausgesprochen gute Spiel bietet. Und keine Sorge du wirst deine Schwester schon finden und auch befreien, sie ist ja gefangen und läuft dir nicht weg.  Mit der Befreiung endet das Spiel.\n\nHinweis: Es gibt ein Bug im Spiel der auch nie behoben wurde. Du sollst den Alphawolf eines Rudels finden und unschädlich machen.\nDer Ort ist oberhalb eines Felsens, dieser Felsen ist das Problem da sich der Wolf gerne mal in diesen Felsen zurückzieht, wo ihr ihn nicht erreichen könnt. Also vorher Speichern und gegebenenfalls öfters probieren. Ihr müsst ihn vom Felsen weg treiben, sonnst bleibt er im Felsen und kommt auch nicht mehr raus.   \n\nSeinerzeit eine Sensation in Sachen Landschaftsgrafik und noch immer besser als viele die deutlich neuer sind, aber sie ist halt schon alt. \nTW konzentriert sich auf upgrad von Waffen, Schilden und Rüstungen. Die schiere Menge an Möglichkeiten ist ein Novum in der Spielgeschichte. Von daher solltet ihr euch genau überlegen was, wann und welche Teile ihr aufwertet. Die Schwierigkeit dabei ist das auch schwächere Teile eine bessere Wahl sein können da sie weiter als die Starken aufgerüstet werden können. Die richtige Ausrüstung zu haben ist das entscheidende in diesem Spiel. \n\nEin richtig gutes RPG mit viel Handlung, lupenreine Empfehlung.\n\nMeine Gruppe und mein Archiv mit über 1.200 Reviews hier:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/hoi4deu\n\n👑 Powered by HoI 4 Deu  Kuratorengruppe auf deutsch/englisch 👑\n⠀⠀⠀🎉 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30388691/]\n Folgen [/url] \nund mehr Reviews von mir entdecken 🎊\n\n\n\nTwo Worlds Epic Edition\n1st of 3rd RPG of 2009.\n\nPublished in Europe in May 2007 by Zuxxez Entertainment, in the US four months later by TopWare Interactive. The version available here is probably a translated US version. I've played all 3, so the following applies to all versions.\n\nYou slip into the role of a nameless young bounty hunter whose sister Kira was kidnapped by a villain named Reist. After months of searching in vain, you will be contacted by Reist Tungard. In the game there are several video sequences that give you the knowledge what it is actually about and what your actual goal is.\nIn this case, the liberation of Aziraal, god of war. This puts you in a power struggle between long-forgotten gods.\nThe world of Antaloor is huge, 60 km² in size, which is divided into 35 km² of the upper world and 25 km² of the underworld. There are five large cities and over 50 villages as well as numerous caves and other hidden places. The RPG idea shows itself clearly in that you really have to solve many different tasks and can develop your character further.\n\nA tip for all those who like to chase after the main story. If you do that, I will only earn a fraction of what this very good game offers. And don't worry, you'll find your sister and free her too, she's trapped and won't run away from you. The game ends with the liberation.\n\nNote: There is a bug in the game that has never been fixed. You should find the alpha wolf of a pack and make it harmless.\nThe place is above a rock, this rock is the problem because the wolf likes to retreat into this rock where you cannot reach it. So save beforehand and try more often if necessary. You have to drive it away from the rock, otherwise it stays in the rock and does not come out.\n\nAt the time a sensation in terms of landscape graphics and still better than many who are much newer, but it's just old.\nTW focuses on upgrading weapons, shields and armor. The sheer amount of possibilities is a first in game history. Therefore, you should think carefully about what, when and which parts you upgrade. The difficulty here is that even weaker parts can be a better choice because they can be upgraded further than the strong ones. Having the right equipment is crucial in this game.\n\nA really good RPG with a lot of action, a flawless recommendation.\n\nMy group and my archive with over 1,200 reviews here:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/hoi4deu\n\n👑 Powered by HoI 4 Deu Curators group in German / English 👑\n⠀⠀⠀🎉 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30388691/] \nFollow [/url] \nand discover more reviews from me 🎊","timestamp_created":1601280449,"timestamp_updated":1601284004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.736872613430023193","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76694143","author":{"steamid":"76561198121932287","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2045,"last_played":1634345833},"language":"english","review":"I enjoy this game. Combat is simple and straight forward. I fight with a bow and magic. Firewall is a good early spell that distracts packs of wolves, giving you time to overdraw your bow. Horses are fun ways to travel the map. \n\nAll enemies stay dead so you can clear the map. However with no life, it looks barren, so I leave all small mammals and snakes alone. You can go anywhere in any order with the large open map. Certainly some areas are off limits because the foes are too strong early game. \n\nDuals with other bowmen are fun. You just have to draw and release quicker then they do, cause the shock of getting hit will throw off their shot. Its a fun game to juts hang out in and explore. I actually like the old English dialogue with 'Mayhap you could aid us'  type wording. Unlike  like many RPG's  the bulk of dialogue is spoken. Graphics are average for 2009 with the weakest spot being the face textures. It has a sort of quirkiness to it that I enjoy.","timestamp_created":1601266125,"timestamp_updated":1601266125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76685996","author":{"steamid":"76561198161379009","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6,"playtime_at_review":1292,"last_played":1660526311},"language":"english","review":"This game is a very fun RPG which I am way too addicted to.","timestamp_created":1601250355,"timestamp_updated":1601250355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76670856","author":{"steamid":"76561198327816121","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1234,"last_played":1608220098},"language":"german","review":"Das spiel macht sehr viel Spaß.

This may have been due to my play style - which is to do every side task as it comes along and build the character / gear up - so in the end at nearly level 100 with maxed gear, nothing was a challenge.\n\n(2) The story line gets lost in all the noise of the side tasks that involve you in a lot of politics and seemingly \"important\" decisions that really mean nothing to the actual story line. To be clear if you step back from the tasks and attempt to go straight to \"saving your sister\" the game is likely to present a harder experience start to finish and the story line is likely to be better served.\n\nThings I liked about the game:\n(1) The \"open world\" feel to it that really didn't restrict you from taking whatever path you wanted to through the stories and the landscape.\n\n(2) The world - it felt consistent and presented in a great deal of detail. The side quests seemed important to the NPCs involved in them and could suck you in with their detail and intrigue. Plus I just really liked the way it looked.\n\n(3) The crafting system of stacking like named items - at first this wasn't overly obvious as the key to real development, but once you figure out what is going on you can get very strong very quickly. The potions were also a nice touch and critical to getting strong in the game.\n\nHints on playing the game.\nYou will start out very weak... get a two handed pike type weapon as soon as you can and learn to keep things at arms length by jumping back. eventually the battle rhythms will become clear.\n\nEverything \"stacks\" and gets better - start stacking early... this includes magic. \n\nMagic seemed to be very under powered for the game... in the end we had \"bolts\" that were stacked 150 deep with maxed \"boosts\" and they still only did a tiny fraction of the damage a single sword hit would do. The one exception was the reflective shield earth magic... reflecting 80% or more of the damage received turns you in to a tank that no longer has to dodge. Found fire area spell to be fun in keeping things distracted while you beat on them\n\nUse the horse as a chest - no matter what the hype, fighting from horse back is no fun and the critter can't climb hills of which the world is full and he dies with a single stray arrow if he is near a battle and you aren't on him.\n\nGet to the first big town as quickly as you can and learn alchemy - making potions is the only way to be successful in the game long term.\n\nThe control button is your friend when it comes to the game of inventory tetris... of which there is a large amount of in the game with all the different alchemy parts etc... CTRL allows you to move/use/sell/drop a stack of items rather individual items.","timestamp_created":1600813738,"timestamp_updated":1600813738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76033716","author":{"steamid":"76561198250748928","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2769,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1215,"last_played":1612705508},"language":"russian","review":"2020 Но вместо дума или чего другого \"свеженького\" и однообразного я запускаю \"2 мира\".

You're not obliged to follow a strict line. Skills are developed sensibly so you don't get overpowered too soon and hence lose the challenge of enemies who get tougher as you progress through different regions. Strategy and cunning are as important as brute strength. The controls can take a while to get used to but the manual tells you all you need to know. The horses are a great asset in open spaces at full gallop - you can floor enemies with a well timed weapon swipe. Choose the type of weapon to suit the enemy. On the downside, horse can get stroppy in combat when there's not much wriggle room, and not go where you want it to, so some combat is best on foot.

Where to begin? Do I recommend it? Yes, but only if you're willing to put up with a few things!\n\nSo originally I had this game on Xbox 360. I never played it properly for the story, I just kinda ran around, killed people and got weapons which is perfectly fine!\nIt wasn't until I picked it up again on Steam that I wanted to give it a proper go. I decided to follow the campaign and also complete quests whenever I got them and I have to say I had a lot of fun doing so!\nDespite its flaws, Two Worlds is a relatively immersive game. It's not as in-depth as many other fantasy RPGs with their multi-skill levelling and a plethora of crafting to be had. That being said, it lends itself to its own beauty. It's not an amazingly flashy game and there are quite a few bugs. But there's something about this game that I absolutely love.\nIt might be the painfully awful voice acting that has this quirk to it that I enjoy, or it might just be the simplicity of a game that doesn't require you to grind at one particular school of combat or magic to be good at. \nEverything is quite easily accessible, and if following the quests, you can pick up a lot of useful skills and also XP to level faster!\nIt is completely open world and the map is quite large. It has quite a few different environments, enough to fill your desire for fantasy.\n\nWhy I like it:\n1. It's an easy going game\n2. It's well embedded in the fantasy genre\n3. The combat is satisfying albeit a bit janky at times, but it's what I call reactive & live combat (swing each time you press)\n4. There are different combat styles and magic to unlock and experiment with\n5. Alchemy is completely open and you can create a potion out of any natural ingredient\n6. The world is nicely designed and interesting\n7. There is fast travel but it's restricted to specific portals you've unlocked\n8. It has a nice equipment levelling feature (combine 2 of the same item to level it up)\n\nThe flaws I mentioned before are as follows:\n1. Dialogue doesn't seem natural at all\n2. Quite a few bugs with quests - sometimes they don't complete or complete automatically\n3. The ending is very disappointing\n4. It's not a massively immersive story (probably due to its length & voice acting)\n5. There's not an awful lot to do aside from quests and combat\n6. There's no controller support - I had to use a plugin (preferred controller as I started on Xbox)\n\nThese I imagine are quite representative of the game's age. But I think it's aged well for the game that it is. I would return to play it again. The only thing holding me back from doing so is the ending:\nSPOILER:\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nThe ending basically stops the game completely and the only way to carry on playing is to load a previous save and not do the final quest. I find this quite irritating especially if you want to do side quests or have a sense of 'full completion'. It just seems a bit strange to abruptly end the game completely.","timestamp_created":1597262992,"timestamp_updated":1597262992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.643744409084320068","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74109776","author":{"steamid":"76561199011721481","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":386,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":315,"last_played":1610239862},"language":"english","review":"the game is really fun i tried it first on xbox then i got it for my laptop and remembered how fun it was i would defiantly encourage you to try it","timestamp_created":1597107161,"timestamp_updated":1597107161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74053399","author":{"steamid":"76561198045557795","num_games_owned":464,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1278,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":766,"last_played":1597966970},"language":"english","review":"This game is god tier.

Und auch wenn es nicht furchtbar ist, kann ich es nicht empfehlen! Ausführliche Review folgt.\n\n1. GRAFIK\nDie Grafik präsentiert sich solide und sieht auch für heutige Standards noch ziemlich gut aus. Die Welt sah schön aus und ich bin gerne umher gelaufen.  zumindest dort, wo die Umgebung fertig gestellt wurde von den Entwicklern.... Nur wirkte die Umgebung oftmals ein bisschen riesig für den Charakter. Außerdem wirkt die Grafik etwas \"krisselig\" und die Auflösung ist leider gefühlt sehr niedrig.... \n\nRating: 3/5\n\n2. STORY\nDie Story von Two Worlds fand ich ganz interessant und war positiv überrascht! Es handelt sich zwar um nichts unglaublich Innovatives, aber es gab auch schon alles unter der Sonne. Die Präsentation der Geschichte war auch hier ziemlich solide und glaubhaft. Zumindest der Anfang war vielversprechend für mich.\n\nRating: 3/5\n\n3. NPCs\nLeider nicht wirklich allzu bemerkenswert. Ich erinnere mich an niemand mehr, der irgendwie vorkam. Außer an die Schwester des Protagonisten, die aber abwesend ist erstmal.\n\nRating: 1/5\n\n4. GAMEPLAY\nDas Gameplay in Two Worlds ist leider furchtbar. Es fühlt sich so an, als wäre alles unglaublich umständlich gelöst worden und wäre so viel einfacher gegangen. Das Spiel kam mir stellenweise unspielbar vor allein wegen der Steuerung! Ganz zu schweigen von Quests, die man nicht lösen kann, weil sie so verbuggt sind...\n\nRating: 1/5\n\n5. WIEDERSPIELWERT\nGeht leider gegen Null, obwohl man sehr viel Freiheit dabei hat, wie man seinen Protagonisten gestaltet! Aber die Steuerung hat mich leider komplett vergrault. Ich kam leider nie so weit, um beurteilen zu können, ob es irgendwelche Entscheidungen oder irgendetwas gibt, dass den Wiederspielwert steigert....\n\nRating: 1/5\n\nTwo Worlds ist mit 9 von 25 Punkten doch ziemlich im unteren Bereich. Das Spiel hat zwar Potenzial und sicher seine Liebhaber, aber es ist ganz sicher nicht für jeden etwas.","timestamp_created":1594161805,"timestamp_updated":1594162040,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561752974987030029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72230181","author":{"steamid":"76561198079597876","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":4831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2626,"last_played":1634751486},"language":"czech","review":"Stará grafika, ale zábavná hratelnost.

The world is huge, beautiful and got a lot of things to discover, including various bioms, cities, factions/races, bandit camps etc. Gothic 3 is a worthy comparison in that aspect. The Lore is pretty immersive, RealityPump created something very own here. Main and Side Quests are okayish, some are excellent, others are boring, most offer choices with consequences. The Main Quests leads the player into nearly every corner of the world which connects you to various side quests and so on...\nThe typical Two Worlds Engine is as genius as in the second game, easily understandable but still complex enough to create one of the best Character Progression Systems ever (TW2->TW1 but still top tier). There are nearly zero tutorials or tips thus its about the player himself to learn how the game is working. Really Really enjoying this game as an oldschool RPG Fanboy. Although be careful before buying TWEE; Animations are being displayed in a very low FPS rate which can not be improved nor fixed which CAN be hurting to watch and/or cause sickness.","timestamp_created":1594054057,"timestamp_updated":1594122374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72031928","author":{"steamid":"76561198028578621","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":382,"last_played":1616300757},"language":"english","review":"I played this so much on xbox 360 back in the day, and it's still one of my favorite games.

That being said, it has some issues that make me see why people don't like it.  \n\nThe voice acting is hilariously bad, but I find it charming.  Just don't take it too seriously and learn to laugh at how silly they sound.  Combat is simplistic, but it can be entertaining if you don't just dodge spam.  Every enemy can be cheesed hard with the dodge mechanic, so it can be hard not to default to that.  As simple as the magic system is, I love it.  Upgrading weapons is simple but rewarding. I see people mention bugs a lot, but I've never encountered anything game breaking.  The main story isn't the best, especially early on, but the side stories and factions provide lots of entertainment.\n\n I strongly suggest trying this game if you enjoy any type of hack and slash rpg fantasy games.

Get it on sale with managed expectations and you should have a good time. Plus once you get bored you can just burn the main quest line in like two hours to finish the game. \n\n[b][u]Pros[/u][/b]\n[b]Items[/b]: The available items and weapons in this game are great. Some are just re-hashed gear with different color schemes but overall there is a large variety of weapons and armor to choose from. Another thing that was great is the fact that they [b]actually have pole-arms and spears.[/b] I've played countless RPGs and that always seems to be a weapon set that's left out so it was great to seem them included. \n[b]Gear Improvement[/b]: Admittedly this took me a while to figure out, but once I did it opened up a whole new aspect of leveling my gear to insane stats. It allows you to simply drag and drop identical gear on top of each other to improve their stats, which you will find more than enough of since money and equipment are not hard to come by.\n[b]Magic[/b]: The magic system is pretty interesting as well, as it allows you to stack spells (similar to gear) and gain spell booster which add various enhancements like duration damage etc.\n[b]Progression[/b]: You will always feel like you are progressing and gaining more abilities which is a nice touch.\n[b]Mounts[/b]: There are a variety of horse based mounts throughout the game which provide greater inventory space and speed up long distance travel.\n[b]Fast Travel[/b]: There are portals scattered throughout the game as well as mobile portals the player carries which are extremely useful and awesome to have. This way you can pop in and out of dungeons without spend minutes or hours just back tracking.\n\n[b][u]Other[/u][/b]\n[b]Mounts[/b]: As I said there are mounts but they are pretty janky to control. Numerous times I would mount up for my horse to glide along some invisible wall out in the open or absolutely refuse to turn a direction and in some instances just steer wherever they wanted. It's a minor nuisance but not a deal breaker. \n[b]Story[/b]: The story is a bland affair: your sister is kidnapped you want to save your sister....pretty much sums it up.\n[b]Side Quests[/b]: Mostly boring if I'm honest. Most drum down to you're a mercenary so you do a lot of fetch/kill quests that have little if nothing to do with the story line. \n\n[b][u]Cons[/u][/b]\n[b]Beginning & End[/b]: Absolute weirdest start/finish to a game I've ever experienced. I had no idea what was happening when I started the game. There is no introduction what so ever. You're literally just thrown into the game with no clue what the story is or what you are doing. I didn't really find out what the story was until like an hour or so into the game because it never tells you until you start the main quest line. The game ends just as a abruptly. There is no ending you defeat the final boss and immediately load to the menu....weird as hell.\n[b]Spells[/b]: Certain skills/spells just don't work. This mainly seems to apply to magic that aims to immobilize targets that just do nothing. The animation will play but the actual spell does nothing. \n[b]Skills[/b]: I played melee with some magic abilities, think Death Knight, but I found a lot of the melee skills to be almost pointless. Many of the animation are extremely slow so it's quite difficult to pull off the melee abilities without getting hit out of the animation. Additionally, many of them are geared to single target encounters which is rare to come across, I can probably count every encounter involving a single enemy on one hand. \n[b]Weird Dialogue[/b]: There were times where I went to a new location, talked to someone for a quest just to get some weird interaction as if I already knew the person or person they were talking about which will throw you off. You can jump parts of a quest or outright screw it up by doing stuff out of order which really defeats the purpose of an open world RPG.","timestamp_created":1593242113,"timestamp_updated":1593242334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71305408","author":{"steamid":"76561198066022256","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":471,"last_played":1651814439},"language":"english","review":"This game is bad.
