It's a good game and I mean \"GOOD\" It doesn't milk Itself to the point It becomes unoriginal like Call of Duty, It's more than just your ol' run of the mill Shooter. The voice acting is really well done, it has marvelous story telling and for a game that came out in 2004 It still holds up! It looks great even to this day. The story over all is what kept me interested and because of that I managed to beat the game in the span of three days. I highly recommend Half-Life 2 to any if not all PC gamers.","timestamp_created":1429855756,"timestamp_updated":1429855946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15511883","author":{"steamid":"76561198143519508","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":2590,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":566,"last_played":1527447086},"language":"english","review":"palyed game went into the sewers  killed 20 guys got a explosive therw it at a robot came back to me stuck to me like died \n10/10 would die from my own explosive 4 life","timestamp_created":1429838530,"timestamp_updated":1429838530,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15510963","author":{"steamid":"76561198025371150","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3011,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1786,"last_played":1591083117},"language":"english","review":"How do you pick up cans?\n\n1/10","timestamp_created":1429832629,"timestamp_updated":1429832629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15509080","author":{"steamid":"76561198128380470","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":2636,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":749,"last_played":1437005701},"language":"english","review":"Play this game or your life will never be complete.

Так вот, посмотрел он левым глазом на до неприличия кошерную картинку HL, а правым - на унылые пейзажи актуальной на тот момент сборки STALKER'а. Посмотрел и ВНЕЗАПНО покраснел, раздулся, родил энное колличество кирпичей и, побрызгивая слюной, начал кричать о том, что STALKER'а нужно держать как можно дальше от сего чуда....\n\nНе знаю, стоит ли верить народу на слово, но, поиграв в этот шедевр, могу сказать только одно - ЛЕГЕНДА ВЕРНА НА 100%!!!\n\nНе люблю я коридорные шутеры. И не обращал никогда внимания на шумевшый в своё время HL. Не обращал до одного момента. Было это одним скучным, душным летним вечером. Слонялся я по просторам STEAM'а в поисках чего-нибудь бородатого, что могло бы завестись на моём MacBook'е Pro со встроенной видухой Intel HD4000 на борту (т.е., грубо говоря, вообще без видухи). И наткнулся на какие-то очень уж знакомые слова: \"Half Life2\". Установил, запустил и..... ОФИГЕЛ! Игрушка просто-таки летала на моём скудном железе. Ну, это можно было предположить. Но как она летала: великолепная физика, отличная анимация, некислая картинка, а игрушке, к слову, десяток уже стукнул! Вобщем, прошёл её с удовольствием. Сюжет, конечно, незатейлевый (я так и не понял зачем было всю игру накручивать километры по пригороду, чтобы в конце появиться на всё том же вокзале), концовка совсем непонятная. Но игра откровенно затягивает. До сих пор под впечатлением ))) Разработчикам удалось всё. Это - ира со своим настроением, со своим миром, со своим ритмом. Игра-исключение.

Поэтому чувствуешь себя этим героем и проникаешься в игру (а ещё ведь есть поддержка Oculus Rift!). \n2) Игра больше, чем тир: есть гравипушка.\n3) Графика, особенно после обновления движка, до сих не плохо смотрится (а вот скелетная анимация до сих пор уделывает многие игры). Вода очень красивая.\n4) Я когда-то прошёл эту игру на AMD Duron 750 MHz (на Intel Pentium 500 MHz тоже играбельно, но похуже) + GeForce 2 MX (то ли 32, то ли 64 МБ VRAM) на минимальных настройках.\n5) Можно менять в любой момент сложность.\n\n\n-\n1) В миссии, где отключаешь устройство подавления, на улице куча страйдеров и комбайнов и авиаудары; дак вот на фоне этого, Барни, блин, РАДОСТНЫМ ГЛОСОМ болтает с Фрименом, будто он в кафе. Вообще создаётся ощущение, что Аликс и Барни употребляют какую-то траву…\n2) Нереально быстро Фримен пользуется лестницей. Плюс, каким-то образом, пока лезешь, можно стрелять (даже из РПГ!) и ПЕРЕЗАРЯЖАТЬСЯ. В E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy (на движке Source) такого нет.\n3) Хотелось бы больше посторонних звуков в Сити 17. У Альянса всё-таки патрули на каждом шагу, а шума проезда машин и бабахов не слышно.\n4) (придирка) Не понятно как Фримен умудряется складировать столько оружия (и тяжёлых ракет), учитывая, что у костюма нет карманов (а если были бы, то даже бы планшет не вместился).\n5) Скорость движения не меняется в зависимости от оружия. Во время спринта можно перезаряжать оружие. Могли бы заодно и гравитацию низкую поставить.\n6) Подозрительно много ящиков с аптечками и комбайновскими зарядок.\nОни даже в обычных домах и в помещениях, где обитает Альянс, который по логике должен был раздолбать эти ящики \nи/или припасти/уничтожить аптечки (чтобы Сопротивлению не досталось).\nВот в [spoiler]Рейвенхольме[/spoiler] правильно поступили в плане этих комбайновских настенных устройств зарядки.\n7) Почему-то в игре нет ветра, который бы перемещал хотя бы листья (не о говоря о стволе самих деревьях)\n8) Если направить ракету на комбайна (хоть издалека), то почему-то он продолжает дальше стоять. А ведь даже кот или муравей сразу побежали бы от ракеты.\n\tИ это при том, что комбайны — это усовершенствованные организмы (а которые в начале игры с пистолетами — это [b]слегка[/b] улучшенные наши люди).\n\tИ не надо говорить, что это, мол, 2004 год — меня в StarCraft: BW (а там вообще куча правил) до сих пор убивают.\n9) Передвижения персонажей слишком заскриптованы (захардкожены).\n10) Много неоткрывамых дверей (вот в Dying Light целых два больших города и можно заходить в/на практически любой дом).\nИ если на двери комбайновской замок, то ничья граната не разрушает дверь. Однако в паре мест (по скрипту!) комбайны кидают гранату (или режут сваркой) и дверь дохнет.\n11) (придирка) Нет волн у воды. Если окунуться в воду и всплыть, то экран безупречно чист.\n12) Повстанцы, [spoiler]когда уже можно набирать отряд[/spoiler], только и говорят типа такого: «Круто! Это же [s]голодный физик[/s] доктор Фримен! Я немедленно пойду с ним!».\nА ещё они говорят мне (даже я спрячусь в угол лицом к стене), что мне следует перезарядиться, будто они подсчитали, сколько у меня патронов (даже на высокой сложности).\n13) Если бахнуть острым предметов в кого-нибудь, то этот кто-нибудь разделится на уже известные части. То есть нельзя посмотреть, что там, например, у комбайна в голове\nили отрезать одну руку/ногу.\n14) Проклятое достижение «Лямбда локатор» (точнее «Следопыт»). Очень рекомендую забить на него. Очень жалею, что решил выполнить (и гнома в эп2 зря нёс — весь геймплей угробил, никаких навыков не развил от него).\n15) Для Linux (и Mac OS X, PS3) не нативный OpenGL, а вызовы Direct3D на лету преобразуются в OpenGL. Поэтому играю через Wine с Gallium Nine, так больше FPS.\n16) Музыки по сути нет. Включается раз в час на десять сек музон и всё. Но атмосфера всё равно есть.\n17) Сюжет плохо чувствуется, когда ИГРАЕШЬ. Например, после того как успел погонять на лодке, уничтожить [b]вертолёт[/b], открыть блокаду, сходить к вортигонту в гости и т.п., уже забываешь, что ты тут вообще забыл, зачем тебе надо к [spoiler]Илаю[/spoiler], если и так комбайнов бьёшь как мух.","timestamp_created":1429740364,"timestamp_updated":1429741161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15495083","author":{"steamid":"76561198118292163","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":877,"last_played":1520560147},"language":"spanish","review":"Una de las mejores sagas de los videojuegos una obra maestra no hay palabras para describir lo maravilloso de este juego","timestamp_created":1429732150,"timestamp_updated":1429732150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15493920","author":{"steamid":"76561198087948002","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":553,"last_played":1639975021},"language":"english","review":"I guess it would be redundant to write good things about this game.

has been in my Queue for a long, long time. And, after playing through it I have two things to say: \"What a ride,\" and \"Why did I wait so long to play this game?\" I now understand the hype. I get it. People talk about it all of the time even more than 10 years after its initial release for one simple reason:\n\nIt's a [spoiler]damn[/spoiler] good game.\n\nI'm not usually not into Shooters, First Person or otherwise. But something about this game is just so... thrilling. It's not quite a horror shooter by today's standards (though, I'm sure when it was released, it had people screaming and flailing), but there are so many pulse pounding, heart racing, gut wrenching moments that it cannot be ignored. The artistry and, often times, very subtle ways of making the player feel exactly what the game wants him to feel. Spoiler: [spoiler]Most notably towards the end of the game, giving you, basically a god power and then ripping it away, forcing the player along whatever, seemingly arbitrary, path it desires to take, while the player is forced to look on, powerless--defenseless. It's absolutely glorious.[/spoiler] \n\nEverything about this game is perfect. Well… Almost.\n\nI found myself backtracking out of desperation. Almost constantly. I was never entirely sure of where I was going a good 70-75% of the time. I would be fine with this, if the NPCs didn’t all believe that I had an extensive knowledge of a place (well, many places) that I had never seen before. Sure, at checkpoints, there are sometimes maps on the wall, but they are poorly done and show no real indication of where you are actually going. Now, I’m not a big fan of the Fable 3 glowing-trail-that-shows-you-right-where-you-are-supposed-to-go method of leading a player, or even a compass on the HUD that points you in the right direction. But, I mean, come on, how many more lines of code would it have taken to give me a map I could access on the fly? I didn’t really need a “you are here” button on it, and it didn’t need to be interactive. Just a little something to keep me sane. [spoiler]Also, the waterfront chapter can burn. It is one of the primary offenders.[/spoiler]\n\nBut, even the sometimes confusing level design can be forgiven. It’s just another way of making the player feel hopeless and helpless. Most games take too kindly to funneling players along the story so much that it feels like the gameplay is interfering with the game. I’m looking at you Final Hallway 13. But that is something that HL2 just doesn’t do. It makes the player, once the actually accomplish something, feel like they did something meaningful.\n\nOne last thing and I swear I’ll shut up. How great is the way HL2 introduces you to new enemies? I’ll tell ya how great! It introduces enemies in a very “Mega Man” way. You almost always can see what new enemy you will be fighting before you actually have to engage that enemy. And, sometimes, you can actually SEE its attack patterns. This is done with [b]EVERY SINGLE ENEMY[/b] and almost every single concept of gameplay. It’s CRAZY! Crazy like a [spoiler]damn[/spoiler] fox. This is how games [i]should [/i]be designed. As a player, I never once felt overwhelmed by a new concept or enemy. Sure I had a lot of “OMG, that guy is spooky,” or “That was a lot tougher than expected,” or “I’m supposed to [i]make[/i] that jump?!” and, let’s not forget all of the “Gosh Dang-oh-Darn, that puzzle was the most convoluted thing I have ever seen,” moments. But I never once got overwhelmed by something. Stuck a few times, yes, but never felt like I COULDN’T progress.\n\n[h1] SUMMARY[/h1]\n\nThe main takeaway is this: If Half-Life 2 isn’t already in your inventory, you should fix that. It really is a problem. But, if you are going to go ahead and get it, [spoiler]which you will,[/spoiler] just shell out the ten extra bucks for the Orange Box. Because you WILL want Episode One and Episode Two. And also Portal. ^_^ Basically, you’ll get HL2 and HL2:E1 and get HL2:E2, Portal, and TF2, [spoiler]which is already FTP through steam,[/spoiler] free. It’s a great deal.\n\nTl;dr—8.5/10, Want map, crazy awesome game design in general, Orange Box get.\n\nThanks for your time and buckle up for the ride that is HL2.\n\nCheers,\nSuPeR_J03","timestamp_created":1429543524,"timestamp_updated":1429549154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15463918","author":{"steamid":"76561198087815805","num_games_owned":421,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1563,"last_played":1516581616},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 2 is a master piece.

The level of detail and polish that goes into everything you see and do in [i]Half-Life 2[/i] is baffling after 13 years - right down to the objects within the game’s environments, which are placed in such a way that it seems so natural and ‘right’ while simultaneously being perfectly placed to be the solution to a puzzle or an impromptu weapon. The interactivity is unmatched; you’re in the thick of it constantly, from turning the tide of massive firefights in the streets to a desperate dash across a beach infested by giant, deadly bugs. Everything has a certain weight to it that makes [i]Half-Life 2[/i]’s oppressive, lonely slice of life feel real and special in a way that’s much more effective than the common approach of having things occur around the player. Sure, it can be pretty heavy on the set pieces, but you’re usually in some way involved, at least to the extent that it never feels like you’re just waiting for the game to progress. Even in an early level when you’re literally waiting for somebody to arrive, you can run around the little laboratory and click on things and one of the other characters in the room will tell you something about it. We the player exist permanently inside [i]Half-Life 2[/i]’s world; we never watch Freeman interacting with other characters or equipment, we are, invariably, Freeman. He’s not a character in his own right, just a comfy outfit for you the player to wear. This lack of characterisation really highlights what [i]Half-Life 2[/i]’s all about - the world around you and the characters in it. It’s not about one man’s struggle in an alien dystopia, it’s about the alien dystopia itself.\n\nThe man we don’t learn a whole lot about is Gordon Freeman, PhD, a silent theoretical physicist who played a major role in an experiment 20-ish years ago which accidentally led to hostile alien soldiers (and wildlife) being released into the Black Mesa Research Facility. After being placed in a coma by the mysterious G-Man at the end of [i]Half-Life[/i], Gordon awakens on a train in ‘City 17’, a centre of operations in Eastern Europe for the Combine, an oppressive alien empire presumably having invaded earth after the first contact at Black Mesa. The design and pacing of the early chapters in City 17 let you know what’s going on (everything’s fucked) without anybody telling you directly. If the masked policemen sectioning people off and beating them like it’s 1945 aren’t enough to let you know things aren’t right (after all, it [i]is[/i] the former Eastern Bloc), stepping out of the train station to see an alien skyscraper stretching literally miles high into the clouds will wake you up pretty quickly. City 17 is basically a combination of nice Bulgarian architecture and evil metal contraptions jammed onto doors and into streets as blockades or bridges. The contrast between the Combine architecture, which is all glass bridges and black metal, and the New Classical architecture of the old city. The Combine themselves are a fun combination of the Nazi SS and the Martians from [i]The War of the Worlds[/i], using a combination of humanoid SWAT-style military police and bizarre aliens augmented with robot parts as the driving force of their oppression. A good villainous force with no face other than the puppet ‘Administrator’ of Earth, Wallace Breen, who overbearingly explains to you why no sex is allowed and it’s a [i]good[/i] thing via the Dystopian Future Propaganda TV™. Breen is a good character, and the Combine is a good oppressive force of evil, which is Character Design 101 as far as I’m concerned. If you don’t want some comeuppance for the nasty Nazis just based on their appearance, you’ll quickly come around after they spend the entire first chapter being total dickheads to you and everyone else. It’s the little things.\n\nIt’s a testament to the design of [i]Half-Life 2[/i] that everything from narrative cues to the next objective can be deciphered without any instruction other than control prompts for new mechanics popping up on screen. It’s so subtle that you’re not usually aware of it, but you’ll sometimes find yourself following little lighting cues that indicate the path to the next area, or the natural flow of the action during a tense shootout in the streets. More so than Half-Life, it’s a long, flowy adventure through a persistent world, hugely increasing the scope and scale of the original while maintaining the sense of place that made it so potent. Each location is richly detailed and has a coherent, constant theme throughout, from the tight, poorly-lit corridors of the zombie-infested Ravenholm to the vast, open swathes of beach that make up the coast and highway area, each level is unique - even when revisiting certain areas (like City 17) things have been shaken up enough to be distinct from previous visits. [i]Half-Life 2[/i] doesn’t work around it’s linearity, it embraces it wholly. Yes, there are more open sections with more opportunities for exploration, but it all funnels back onto the intended path, giving you room to breathe without losing the pace that’s so important to the game’s success. Everything has been painstakingly tested, placed and replaced to make a tight, self-contained experience that fully utilises the benefits of linear game design while avoiding all of the pitfalls. In short, playing [i]Half-Life 2[/i] is such a genuinely enjoyable experience that it's almost a suitable replacement for all the sexy time Dr. Breen says we can't have.","timestamp_created":1429132212,"timestamp_updated":1515503169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.441638916730880737","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15391538","author":{"steamid":"76561198138828568","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":881,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":332,"last_played":1590150087},"language":"english","review":"A classic game sequel. 9.5/10","timestamp_created":1429130964,"timestamp_updated":1529624944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwv2138wCcrPbOg=="}
