[/h1]\n\nEl juego en si es un FPS en el cual encarnamos a Freeman es vez más con el objetivo de detener los planes de Wallace, en si es un juego lineal donde los mapas en ciertas partes tienden a ser repetitivos  donde te atacan oleadas de enemigos y solamente te abres paso sobre ellos,  la variedad de enemigos no es muy extensa ya que solo hay 4 clases de enemigos que son los solados de la Alianza, vehículos, los insectos y los  zombies,  en cuanto a las armas hay mucha variedad pero en su mayoría solo encuentras munición de las armas principales (pistola, metralletas y escopeta) ya que son las que recoges de los enemigos, estos enemigos tienen una inteligencia moderada ya que se reposicionan si sufren daño y se cubren.\nEn varias partes del juego el juego intenta meter otro tipo de mecánicas  para evitar que se sienta repetitivo ejemplo: Uso del carro, Lancha, Oleadas de enemigos (defender un punto o persona), parkour y batallas contra vehículos o insectos grandes (como si fueran pequeños jefes).\n\nLo único que no me llego a gustar es el manejo de los vehículos, los personajes que se te unen como pelotón te estorban en lugares pequeños provocando que en ocasiones te puedan matar (principalmente me paso en el nivel de la mansión) y por último que no te indiquen por donde continuar la misión  provocando en ocasiones que estés dando vueltas para identificar a donde te debes dirigir para continuar.

Like the original Half-Life, it combines shooting, puzzles, and storytelling, and adds features such as vehicles and physics-based gameplay. Players control Gordon Freeman, who fights the alien Combine with allies including resistance fighter Alyx Vance, using weapons such as the object-manipulating gravity gun.\n\nThe game was created using Valve's Source engine, developed alongside. Development lasted five years and cost US$40 million. Valve president Gabe Newell set his team the goal of redefining the FPS genre, focusing on advanced physics systems and non-player characters. Valve announced Half-Life 2 at E3 2003 and released it through its new distribution service Steam after delaying it by over a year. A year before release, a hacker stole an unfinished version and leaked it online.\n\nHalf-Life 2 received acclaim for its advanced physics, animation, sound, AI, graphics, and narrative. It won 39 Game of the Year awards, and has been cited as one of the greatest games of all time. By 2011, it had sold 12 million copies. It was followed by the episodic sequels Episode One (2006) and Episode Two (2007). A prequel, Half-Life: Alyx, was released in 2020.\n\nLike the original Half-Life (1998), Half-Life 2 is a single-player first-person shooter in which players control Gordon Freeman. It has similar mechanics to Half-Life, including health-and-weapon systems and periodic physics puzzles, except with the newer Source engine and improved graphics. The player also starts without items, slowly building up their arsenal over the course of the game. Despite the game's mainly linear nature, much effort was put into making exploration rewarding and interesting; many optional areas can be missed or avoided.\n\nA diverse set of enemies is present, which usually require being approached with different tactics: some coordinate in groups to out-maneuver or out-position the player; others, such as the Manhack, fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors. Others use predictable but powerful attacks, while others hide before swiftly attacking the player. Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons, or make use of indirect means, exploiting environmental hazards such as explosive pressurized canisters, gas fires or improvised traps. For some portions of the game, Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers or medics and can send his team further from him or call them back.\n\nMany of the game's new features utilize its detailed physics simulation. Two sections of the game involve driving vehicles. Instead of button-oriented puzzles from Half-Life, environmental puzzles are also introduced with makeshift mechanical systems, revolving around the player's new ability to pick up, move, and place objects. Solutions involve objects' physical properties, such as shape, weight, and buoyancy. For example; In chapter three, \"Route Kanal\", the player is required to stack cinder blocks on a makeshift see-saw ramp to proceed over a wall. Alternatively, the player can build a crude staircase with the blocks, so the puzzle may be solved in multiple ways.\n\nPart-way through the game, Gordon acquires the Gravity Gun, which allows him to draw distant objects towards himself or forcefully push them away, as well as the ability to manipulate larger and heavier objects that he cannot control without the weapon. These abilities are required to solve puzzles later in the game, and can also be used to great effect in combat, as any non-static object within proximity to the player has the potential to be used as a makeshift defense, such as a file cabinet, or a deadly projectile, such as a gasoline can or buzzsaw blade.\n\nThe game never separates the player with pre-rendered cutscenes or events; the story proceeds via exposition from other characters and in-world events, and the player can control Gordon for the entirety of the game.

Keep hoping, people, Valve can't hold out on us forever!\n\n[h1] Introduction/Disclaimers [/h1]\n\nThis is a relatively spoiler-free review. There will be no mentions of what happens story-wise, but I will talk about game mechanics, weapon varieties and the new weapon introduced, and level layouts. I will also discuss the quality of the story, but I'll make sure not to spoil the story itself. If you consider these to be spoilers, read at your own risk. If not, yay!\n\nI'll also discuss the first Half-Life game, which I played the Source remake of, and Half-Life 2: Episodes 1 and 2.\n\nIf you've never heard of the Half-Life series, you're probably new to either Steam or the internet itself, what with the highly-anticipated launch of Half-Life: Alyx not too long ago. The series holds some of the earliest FPS games around that have gameplay that can reasonably hold up against the test of time--graphics are another story, but you can't expect too much from a series over a decade old.\n\nNow, these games are made in chronological order, with Half-Life Alyx being the only exception. The order of the main storyline is Half-Life, Half-Life 2, and Half-Life 2 Episodes 1 and 2.\n\nNow here comes the disclaimer, and the reason I can't recommend this series wholeheartedly...\n\n[b] Disclaimer:[/b] The story of this series [i] does not have a conclusion as of summer 2020. [/i] And, yes, the most recent installment was released in 2007, almost 13 years ago.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nIt's a shooter. You shoot things. Lots of things.\n\nWell, not quite. Your first weapon is the good 'ol crowbar, handy for whacking planks off of boarded up doorways and good for your general bludgeoning needs. Similar to the original Half-Life, you pick up guns and more powerful weapons as you progress through the game. The most notable difference in weaponry is that you have little to no access to the alien weapons that were abundant in the first game. Personally, I enjoyed the variety the alien weapons gave me, but it makes sense story-wise.\n\nThe level layouts are pretty open, similar to those of Doom (2016), which gives the game more of an open-world vibe. I recall in the original Half-Life that you could return to earlier levels simply by walking back the way you came. You can't do that very much in Half-Life 2, with drops and blockades making previous areas inaccessible, but it still has an open feel to it.\n\nThe biggest thing that distinguishes this FPS game from the rest is the introduction of the Gravity Gun, which allows you to move extremely heavy objects and move and throw lighter objects extreme distances. Now, I've never found \"pure\" FPS games (e.g. Call of Duty) to be notably fun, but the Gravity Gun makes this one of my favorite shooter games. You can kill enemies by shooting heavy items at them. You get an achievement if you kill someone with a toilet, for example. You can pick up sawblades and fire them at a group, taking down several enemies at once. You can carry crates and other objects to use as shields. You can shoot explode-y barrels at your enemies, just be quick about it if they're actively shooting you.\n\nAnd the achievements. Holy cow, if you're a completionist, this game is going to make you work for it.\n\nThere's the typical achievements you get with completing chapters and certain areas, just make sure you're logged into Steam otherwise they won't register (which is why I only have half the achievements...). There's an achievement you can get for completing an entire area by only using the Gravity Gun as your weapon. Luckily there's a lot of sawblades laying around, but that area is [i] spooky. [/i] There's an achievement where you have to find 40-odd secret caches of ammo in the game. Now, obviously for this one you could just look it up, but where's the fun in that?\n\n[h1] Game Mechanics [/h1]\n\nPuzzles are a recurring theme in the series, another aspect that sets it apart from other FPS games. These puzzles usually include the environment, which either must be navigated through or around. You might have to crawl through that vent to get around that fence, or maybe you can just stack some boxes on top of that car and jump it. Do you really want to try to parkour through that minefield, or can you just back away and throw a barrel at them? It's up to you.\n\nThe physics in the series is pretty neat. Now, with this being a game made well over a decade ago, it's not what you would consider \"realistic.\" That means that, when the physics break every once in a while, it's more amusing than immersion-breaking. Personally, I love the ragdoll physics that are in this series, and I don't really mind when things break physics-wise because it's entertaining. Another neat thing is that nearly every object is interactable. You can hold a health pack if your health is full, meaning you can stockpile them when there's an area you have to defend or otherwise stay in for a while.\n\nJust keep in mind that, when everything is interactable, you can accidentally kill yourself by shooting something up in the air or at a wall and it hits you at high speed. Don't forget to save your game!\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nThe Half-Life series is unique here. In the entire series, I can only think of one scene that can be truly considered a cutscene--and even then, it's an opening sequence. Since cutscenes aren't a thing, major events and whatnot are scheduled or triggered by characters' actions, including your own. The rest of the time, you can literally just wander around the room while other characters are discussing what's happening. But if you care about the story, you might as well stick around and listen...\n\nThe Half-Life series has a fascinating story concept that they executed very well. Or more accurately, that they [i] almost [/i] executed well.\n\nYou see, there's a problem. The story isn't complete, and where it leaves off is nowhere near a place I would consider a satisfying ending. This is the greatest flaw of the series, and the reason why I can't wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\nThe gameplay is great, and I would consider to be a must-play series if that were the focus. But the gameplay is deeply integrated and intertwined with the story, and one without the other simply wouldn't hold the same experience. That's why it's so disappointing that the series never came to a conclusion.\n\nNow, if you were to play this series primarily for the story, I would recommend playing Half-Life 1 and 2. That's it. Trust me, it's a better option than playing the episodes and knowing where that story ends unfinished.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this series. But the fact that it was abandoned with no explanation feels like an absolute betrayal. They never even publicly confirmed whether Half-Life 3--or Half-Life 2 Episode 3, or whatever they're calling the next chapter--was officially cancelled. I'd rather get an official notice that they're cancelling the game and the story is finished, rather than radio silence for another 13 years.\n\nIf or when they release Half-Life 3, I think a total remaster of the entire series would make an excellent apology for making everyone wait so long for the conclusion of the story.\n\nI can't wholeheartedly recommend this series, but I can't say it's completely bad, either. My advice, if you want to try it, would be to play the first Half-Life and see what you think before moving forward.\n\nOne-Sentence Summary: Best story I've ever known to go unfinished, 9/10 would accidentally blow myself up by using an explode-y barrel as a barricade again.","timestamp_created":1598392951,"timestamp_updated":1598392951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74911395","author":{"steamid":"76561198098410472","num_games_owned":249,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":1980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1204,"last_played":1624810151},"language":"english","review":"Very fun game, took me 10.3 hours (I didn’t finish it the first time I played it for some reason).

A rare type of game, and something every person on Earth that enjoys video games must experience. 10/10","timestamp_created":1598380030,"timestamp_updated":1609215576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74901804","author":{"steamid":"76561198273799263","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":328,"last_played":1617930584},"language":"english","review":"great game that holds up today","timestamp_created":1598378926,"timestamp_updated":1598378926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74901699","author":{"steamid":"76561198841117076","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1495,"last_played":1599175275},"language":"spanish","review":"Buenardo","timestamp_created":1598378773,"timestamp_updated":1598378773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74900069","author":{"steamid":"76561198164321670","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2434,"last_played":1598093324},"language":"english","review":"A very nice game, even in 2020 (although this might be because of nostalgia but still).\nI highly recommend it!","timestamp_created":1598376591,"timestamp_updated":1598376591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74899999","author":{"steamid":"76561198143746480","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2037,"last_played":1628981803},"language":"brazilian","review":"mesmo já sendo meio antigo, ainda é um jogo incrível e que vale a pena ser jogado","timestamp_created":1598376484,"timestamp_updated":1598376484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74899877","author":{"steamid":"76561198981629548","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1832,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":987,"last_played":1648716639},"language":"russian","review":"не плохо не плохо","timestamp_created":1598376316,"timestamp_updated":1598376316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74899243","author":{"steamid":"76561198327232806","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1892,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1702,"last_played":1632673348},"language":"english","review":"Hello, Gordon!","timestamp_created":1598375510,"timestamp_updated":1598375510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74898817","author":{"steamid":"76561198385935476","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":650,"last_played":1631359412},"language":"english","review":"awesome\n","timestamp_created":1598374998,"timestamp_updated":1598374998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74898463","author":{"steamid":"76561198919331477","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1029,"last_played":1605452768},"language":"russian","review":"Офигенная игра.
