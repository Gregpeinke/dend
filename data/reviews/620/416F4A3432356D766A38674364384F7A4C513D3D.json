In the beginning of the game, you meet a small little robot named Wheatley who is your companion throughout the game. With a personality of his own and a cool accent (I like it), Wheatley was a good addition to the game. Your goal is the same as the previous game; escape the test chambers alive. Although many gameplay mechanics and the story are the same, I feel that Portal 2 improved on a few things. \n    First of all, graphics. Of course, since it had a few years to evolve into a game that could support better graphics, the graphics are going to be better automatically, but I feel the jungle-like atmosphere really impressed me. Also, the additions of the Lens-Cube (as I call it) and a few other items really improved my expirience. The gameplay was longer and more interesting. All in all, I think that Portal 2 is a fantastic sequal that improved on Portal.\n     The one thing I have to say is that the original Portal's creepy atmosphere and the fact that you were alone are the biggest things that I feel Portal did better on. Of course, some people like to have more characters, and I agree with that, but Portal somehow manipulated my mind in a way that Portal 2 never could.","timestamp_created":1409522251,"timestamp_updated":1409522251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11939608","author":{"steamid":"76561198083548389","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":7681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2835,"last_played":1592287994},"language":"english","review":"10/10\n\nNOW WHERE'S PORTAL 3?!","timestamp_created":1409517368,"timestamp_updated":1409517368,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51542973518371582","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11939529","author":{"steamid":"76561198119398898","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4481,"last_played":1563493382},"language":"spanish","review":"¿Les gustó portal?

O enredo é bem bacana e a interação dos personagens é boa e os personagens em si são simplesmente hilários, principalmente GLaDOS.\nO jogo tem uma coisa que muitas vezes é bem difícil de se ver, originalidade. Pode até parecer ser meio chato ou bobo no começo, mas é simplesmente épico. \n\nJogar em co-op é mil vezes melhor, é diversão pura. Você e o seu parceiro precisam pensar e trabalhar juntos, o que muitas vezes pode ser complicado. Um pequeno erro seu ou dele e já era, morte na certa... Vamos começar de novo.\nUma coisa crucial aqui nesse jogo (mais em modo co-op) é o timing, vocês precisam ter um timing muito bom e se quiserem ir atrás das recompensas, ai é que além do timing, precisam de uma sincronização impecável. Enquanto isso, você vai quebrar muito a cabeça, morrer talvez algumas vezes um pouco até de mais :P porém você vai rir muito.\n\nTenha certeza de uma coisa que você vai ter e muito nesse jogo... Diversão!\n\nEnfim, a dificuldade do jogo é boa, é bem dividido, você tanto pode pegar testes em que vai resolver tudo em menos de 60seg, como você pode pegar outros que vão te fazer quebrar a cabeça por 10min, mas isso tudo sem te deixar cansativo ou frustrado com o insucesso. O gráfico mesmo sendo jogado em ‘low’ é muito bonito, a jogabilidade é ótima e a historia é muito boa, muito engraçada. \n\nPara quem se interessa pelo enredo do jogo e gosta de saber e entender tudo detalhadamente, talvez jogar o primeiro Portal seja uma opção melhor, mas de qualquer forma você consegue jogar o 2 tanto em SP, como em co-op (que envolve pequenos detalhes da estória) sem problemas nenhum.\n\nOk. Zerei o jogo em sp e co-op, ganhei todas as recompensas, pronto, agora acabou o jogo. Ainda não! Existem uns desafios que você pode fazer tanto no sp, como no co-op. Esses desafios são alguns testes (que você provavelmente já deverá ter feito, se terminou o jogo em um dos modos) e que você deve refazer em certo tempo e usar certo números de portais,  competindo com seus amigos da Steam que também jogam. \nAlém disso, existem os ‘community teste chambers’, que são feitos por jogadores como eu e você e não pela Valve, o que é muito engraçado e muito criativo. Você vai encontrar testes muito fáceis e chatos, mas em compensação vai encontrar testes bem difíceis, criativos, inusitados e engraçados. \nO melhor é que você também pode criar seu próprio teste e envia-lo para que outros jogadores também possam jogar e avalia-lo.\n\nPara vocês terem uma ideia, já peguei um teste desses em que era uma sala minúscula com vários laisers e um cubo, eu tinha que encontrar um modo de conseguir fazer o único laser ligado ir de encontro a vários outros. Eu fiquei ali, quebrando a cabeça por uns 15 min até que conseguir entender o que deveria fazer e quando fiz, não deu certo. Kkkkk\nPensei, pensei e pensei e finalmente consegui sair de lá, depois de um bom tempo quebrando cabeça. Pode parecer meio frustrante falando assim, mas seja lá quem criou aquele teste, soube organizar as coisas de uma forma bem dinâmica e leve, mas ao mesmo tempo bastante confuso e complicado. Assim o teste fica difícil, mas não fica cansativo.\n\nOutro exemplo, mas bem diferente. Hoje (29/08/14), um pouco mais cedo eu estava jogando Portal 2 no modo co-op, quando eu e minha parceira encontramos um desses teste chambers onde o teste, na verdade não era bem um teste, era uma corrida feita com os elementos do jogo. Acho que foi o teste mais criativo que vi. Você pode escolher quantas voltas, pode colocar musica e enfim. Foi super divertido, fizemos apenas 4 voltas no total, mas foi o suficiente para embolarmos de rir!!\n\nPortal é um jogo bonito, original, leve e bastante divertido. E o melhor, não é caro.","timestamp_created":1409331753,"timestamp_updated":1409331753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":39,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.805626213550567627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11910087","author":{"steamid":"76561198104089671","num_games_owned":543,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":876,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":575,"last_played":1463516847},"language":"schinese","review":"9/10,非常棒的第一人称射击解谜类游戏\n

Pero lo que hace recomendarlo esque no hay jugos con estas características, y no es pro ser malo, lo que pasa es que es si diferente y es un juego diferente como hobra maestra. Gráficos buenos, optimizaciones en mi opinión muy buenas, y una amarabilla la historía y el final como de pekícula épica con un melodía que te deja santo (almenso durante un rato xd). [A mí me dejó eclipsado y marabilllado o, que bonito] Solo le pongo una contra, Al final entre los qeu aprentan ser finales y luego que sigue la historia, al final lo acabas y te queda el worshop y los puzzles que crees o te descargues, pero el tremendo esfuerzo que se ha tenido por cada puzzle es muy dificil de encontrar ren whorshop, marabilla detodas formas xd.","timestamp_created":1409283879,"timestamp_updated":1409283879,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11904130","author":{"steamid":"76561198041235887","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":850,"last_played":1338706800},"language":"english","review":"What can I say about Portal 2 that hasn't been said?

Más y mejor.\n\nSobre la historia se profundiza un poco más, se presentan más personajes y un poco la historia de Aperture Science, aunque gran parte de esta pasa desapercibida. Portal 2 tiene modo cooperativo, que añade muchos más puzzles para jugar con amigos, una muy buena experiencia sin duda. Aparte también tiene un creador de mapas, permite crear todo tipo de mapas personalizados. Al tener soporte de la Workshop se puede jugar mapas de otra gente, lo que da horas y horas de contenido extra.\n\nEn conclusión si te gustó el primero este es mucho mejor y con mucho más contenido, tiene una duración perfecta y no se siente tan repetitivo pese a ser jugablemente idéntico.\n\n\n===[ Gráficos ]===\n☐ Malos\n☐ Normales\n☑ Buenos\n☐ Muy buenos\n\n===[Precio/calidad ]===\n☑ Cómpralo\n☐ Espera a que baje de precio\n☐ Acorde a lo que ofrece\n☐ Free to play\n\n===[ Dificultad ]===\n☐ Fácil\n☐ Fácil de aprender/difícil de dominar\n☐ Dificultad Media\n☑ Difícil\n☐ Muy difícil\n\n===[ Horas de Juego ]===\n☐ Corto (2 - 10 horas)\n☑ Tiempo de juego medio (de 10 a 25 horas)\n☐ Largo (más de 25 horas)\n☐ Muy Largo (de 50 horas en adelante)\n☐ Duración Indefinida (Juego online)\n\n===[ Historia ] ===\n☐ No tiene\n☑ Pasa desapercibida\n☐ Mala\n☐ Del montón\n☐ Buena\n☐ Muy buena\n☐ Espectacular\n\n===[ Bugs ]===\n☐ Exageradamente Bugeado\n☐ Muchos bugs\n☐ Algunos bugs (lo normal)\n☑ Apenas tiene (muy pulido)\n\n===[ Jugabilidad ]===\n☐ Mala\n☐ Pasable\n☐ Normal (con sus pros y contras)\n☑  Buena\n☐ Excelente\n\n===[ Sonido ]===\n☐ Malo\n☐ Normal\n☐ Bueno\n☑ Excelente","timestamp_created":1409268201,"timestamp_updated":1593474005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11902327","author":{"steamid":"76561198136003730","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7047,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3590,"last_played":1649331417},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel find ich Super!","timestamp_created":1409267342,"timestamp_updated":1409267342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11902146","author":{"steamid":"76561198090469210","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":803,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":323,"last_played":1620521066},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 é foda, campanha offline do c4ralho e modo co-op mais f0da ainda!","timestamp_created":1409266018,"timestamp_updated":1409266018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561855673789978027","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11902089","author":{"steamid":"76561198138425843","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":603,"last_played":1501123676},"language":"english","review":"\"Sorry fellas, she's married..to science.\"","timestamp_created":1409265570,"timestamp_updated":1409265570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11902007","author":{"steamid":"76561198140817345","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":411,"last_played":1584827769},"language":"italian","review":"Si lo consiglio a tutti!!!!
