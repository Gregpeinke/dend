Die Spielreihe kann man vor allem in das Genre des Ego-Shooters einsortieren, allerdings besitzen diese Spiele auch eine Vielzahl an Rätsel-/Puzzle-, Parcours-/Jump 'n Run-, als auch Adventure-Elementen. Da neben dem Erledigen von Gegnern, auch Hindernisse unter komplexe Situationen bewältigt, wie auch verschiedenste Rätsel gelöst werden müssen, um beispielsweise Türen zu öffnen oder Sprengfallen zu deaktivieren. Die Handlung, wie auch der Stiel von \"Half-Life\" ist sehr an Science-Fiction angelehnt.\n\nWie bereits angemerkt, knüpft die Handlung von dieser Erweiterungen unmittelbar nach den Ereignissen von \"Half-Life 2\" an, als der \"Dunkle-Materie-Reaktor\" explodiert und Dr. Gordon Freeman, wie auch Alyx Vance von den Vortigaunts gerettet werden, indem Sie die zwei Protagonisten vor der Starre bzw. dem Zugriff des mysteriösen G-Mans retten.\nDurch die Explosion des Reaktors, wurde die Zitadelle stark beschädigt. Alyx und Gordon wurden dabei von den Trümmern der Zitadelle begraben. Der Roboterhund \"Dog\" - dessen Herrchen Alyx ist - ist jedoch zur Stelle um beide zu befreien. Als Gordon wieder im Besitz der Gravity-Gun ist, gelingt es den Protagonisten ein funktionsfähiges Computerterminal in der Zitadelle zu finden, über dem Alyx Kontakt zu ihrem Vater Eli herstellen kann. Er bittet Gordon und Alyx die Gegend so schnell wie möglich zu verlassen, weil der Kern der Zitadelle kurz vorm explodieren steht, wodurch die gesamte Stadt ausgelöscht wird. Daraufhin meldet sich Dr. Kleiner zu Wort und erläutert den Plan, den er in der kurzen Zeit entwickelt hat.\nUm die Explosion hinauszuzögern, müssen Gordon und Alyx nun erneut die Zitadelle betreten, damit sie den Kern manipulieren können. Geplant ist daraufhin die überlebende Zivilisten zu evakuieren und gemeinsam mit einem Zug aus der Stadt \"City 17\" zu flüchten.\n\nMeine Persönliche Bewertung nach meinen Kriterien:\n\nStory 77,5 / 115\nGameplay 26,75 / 40\nGrafik und Gestaltung 14 / 25\nSound 14,25 / 30\nAtmosphäre 16,5 / 20\nSonstige Besonderheiten 15,75 / 20\n\nIn den Punkten Gameplay, Grafik, wie auch Sound ist die Erweiterung \"Half-Life 2: Episode One\" identisch mit dem Hauptspiel. Daher liegt der Fokus bei den Standalone-Erweiterungen auch bei der Handlung.\n\nAuch wenn ich die Handlung von \"Half-Life 2: Episode One\" recht gut finde, kann es leider nicht mit der Handlung des Hauptspiels \"Half-Life 2\" mithalten. Auch wenn es sich hierbei \"nur\" um Erweiterungen handelt, und diese in der Regel weniger Content besitzen, finde ich es trotzdem etwas schade. Dies liegt allerdings vor allem daran, dass die (volle) Trilogie nie erschienen ist und dadurch eine Menge Potenzial verloren ging. Zum jetzigen Standpunkt (ich denke, dass sich daran auch nichts ändern wird - Möglich ist es trotzdem) gibt es nur zwei von geplanten drei Erweiterungen. Wobei beide Erweiterungen leider das selbe Konzept besitzen. Dadurch wirkt die erste Erweiterung inhaltlich recht generisch, da sie meiner Meinung nach von \"Half-Life 2: Episode Two\" in den Schatten gestellt wird. Ich will damit nicht sagen, dass das Spiel langweilig ist, nein ganz im Gegenteil. Wer \"Half-Life 2\" gespielt hat und es mochte, empfehle ich dringendst die Erweiterungen ebenfalls spielen - und dies nicht nur, weil sonst eine Lücke in der Handlung besteht. Jedoch ist meiner Meinung nach diese Erweiterung im Vergleich am inhaltsschwächsten.","timestamp_created":1572732243,"timestamp_updated":1620124092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56328369","author":{"steamid":"76561198999285681","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":1077,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":213,"last_played":1654866833},"language":"english","review":"It's

Picking up where HL2 left off you start under a pile of rubble at the base of the Combine HQ and you’ve got a revolution to secure. Lord knows what the point of the G-Man at the start is about…he plays no part in this game. So what’s it all like then?\n\nIt uses the same engine as HL2, but it does not suffer the goddamn death of a grey crayon that game did. Here there certainly are more shades of grey than ever collected on one screen, but at least it is justified and splashed with a little colour. You are in the Combine HQ tower (again) and escaping from City 17; there is a sense that you’ve been here before and that things are somewhat reused. Being in the accommodation area and the flats of City17 certainly does feel re-hashed as does another central elevator scene, which is little more than a static swarm shooting level, just as we had in HL2. The game play also lacks variety…you are on foot the entire time despite there being the opportunity for other vehicle use. You are stuck with just the Gravity gun for about a third of the game and then it gives you all of the other weapons in quick succession and you don’t use half of them. \n\nThese small complaints aside there are some nice moments…Barney is back…and yes he gives you a crowbar again. You have to take an interest in people this time, Alyx fights with you most of the way and whilst she is capable of killing most things, she is not invincible and your game ends if she dies…not just you. You also have to escort people at one point as well. This interaction and having to be aware of others is a welcome aspect of the game; In HL2 I largely felt I was alone. \n\nAgain, like the other games there is generally only one route to go, but that’s fine, if done well that works. There are more puzzles in this game and they are enjoyable ones. In this sense they have tried to put some of the original HL into this that was lost in HL2. The initial mission to shut down the Combine power core is particularly enjoyable; mixing some great FPS and puzzle moments together. This is HL at its best. \n\nThe weapons feel solid both in noise and recoil, but ammo and health are probably a little too easily available on normal difficulty. The music is good, but only in parts. Usually when you come to a level end it heightens and adds to the tension. There are some wonderful set pieces in this game, but the biggest problem is that it is too short; it’s only about seven hours of gameplay or less if you are any good. Just as you get into it and start getting that one more level feeling…boom you’ve finished, this episode at least.\n\nIt’s short and a little too similar to HL2. Both of these keep it a good game instead of a great one. At only £5 on Steam it is most certainly worth it though.
