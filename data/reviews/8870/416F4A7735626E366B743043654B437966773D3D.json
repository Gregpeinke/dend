It certainly did not disappoint.\n\nLet us break down Bioshock Infinite in terms of visuals, gameplay and story. \n\nFirst off, this game is jaw dropping to look at, even by today’s standards. The lighting and sense of scale are especially spectacular. It brings the city of Columbia to life and encourages you to explore it. You will often spend more time side tracked, just admiring the buildings and interiors. It is a linear game, but it often does an excellent job at making it feel more like an open world, where exploration rewards you with more items, collectibles and additions to the narrative. You uncover the cities secrets if you will.\n\nGameplay is solid, if not very demanding in later stages. My first playthrough was on the medium difficulty, and it got very challenging in the second half and beyond. I died many, many, many times.... I'm currently on my second playthrough, having unlocked the '1999 mode' (wish me luck.... I'm gonna' need it).\n\nThe game has a small number of weapons, but they all feel distinct and purposeful in different scenarios, though I spent most of the time running around with the good old pistol, since it seems to be the most versatile gun in the game. It is annoying how you can only carry two firearms at a time though, so if you're going to upgrade a weapon, make sure it's one that you use all the time. However, the Sky Hook is truly amazing. It is hands down the most satisfying melee weapon I have ever used in a game. It's brutal, gory and bloody awesome!\n\nThe Vigors make you feel like a force to be reckoned with, my favourite being Charge, with Possession being another good one. They make this game stand out from other shooters by giving you supernatural powers and a profound sense of dominance over your enemies. Why throw grenades when you can release deadly crows from your arms!?\n\nThe story is perhaps the main reason to play Bioshock Infinite, something that you simply must experience yourself, so I won't spoil anything, but I can report that Elizabeth is a truly enchanting ally. Unlike most AI characters, she is genuinely reliable and does useful things to help you in combat!\n\nBasically, this game is amazing. Aside from a few oddities here and there, it is a solid story driven action game and I certainly will be playing the DLC, as well as the first two BioShock’s.\n\n(On a side note, there is an annoying bug which causes the audio to distort overtime. There is an easy fix though, so just look it up on Google.)","timestamp_created":1499813376,"timestamp_updated":1499814077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33466573","author":{"steamid":"76561198066871713","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":79,"playtime_forever":1097,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":702,"last_played":1542800940},"language":"english","review":"nice gameplay, really smooth\n\nthe BEST sidekick i've ever seen/played with\n\nrealy nice story\n\ndissapointing ending (my opinion)","timestamp_created":1499811120,"timestamp_updated":1499811120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33464832","author":{"steamid":"76561198043789369","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":509,"last_played":1499800674},"language":"english","review":"loved the story!!!","timestamp_created":1499805294,"timestamp_updated":1499805294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33463902","author":{"steamid":"76561198077921121","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":970,"last_played":1511876636},"language":"brazilian","review":"puta que pariu, q jogo bom no final do jogo ficam tantas icognitas mas o jogo eh muito bom\n","timestamp_created":1499802559,"timestamp_updated":1499802559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33463130","author":{"steamid":"76561198197595601","num_games_owned":247,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":383,"last_played":1589509992},"language":"english","review":"Although this game is highly praised.

Games给你搭了个影棚过了过眼瘾，这无疑让人有相当的落差感。\n\n开场乘坐火箭（？）直升三万英尺，然后映入眼帘的是让人美到窒息的天空之城哥伦比亚，绝不亚于生化奇兵1进入潜水球发现销魂城的震撼，但当你想体会体会其中的人文风情，你就被城管发现，然后不得不开干，而且是一口气从头干到尾。\n\n这让我感觉非常不爽，想体会这种反乌托邦题材的游戏显然不是你杀杀杀就能感受到的，而游戏通过录音来提供剧情的补全这种做法我只感觉让隔阂感更深。整个游戏之后就是僵硬的寻找补给>杀敌>听磁带，而后期到处都是似曾相识的高光建筑其实看着并不让人讨喜。整个人感觉就像是住在装修齐全的样板房里一样，美是很美，但没有水电。\n\n游戏手感：2 如果布克能像前几作的主角和DLC海葬2中的伊丽莎白那样，持有所有武器，我可能还能给个5~6分，但很可惜原本糟糕的手感加上只能拿两种的枪械，2分我想是个合适的评价。\nIrrational Games显然想让人更多的通过异能与敌人进行作战，但我觉得他们的异能设计的相当糟糕，远不如前作中的质体能力，华美的游戏场景带来的一个副作用就是你很难找到你的敌人在哪里，因为你的眼睛可能已经被各种光影效果和渲染闪爆。\n\n画面做的偏向卡通但并不意味着游玩手感也要偏向“卡通”，里面像什么霰弹枪/突击枪除了浪费子弹之外屁用没有，里面有七成的枪械打哪都准就是打目标不准，然后直接导致售货机中大部分关于枪械的升级无用。\n\n在敌人的硬直系统方面老肯倒是很好的“致敬”了前作，如果没有玩过前作听不懂我冷笑话的，我就这样告诉你们：敌人几乎没有硬直，无论你打中了头/腿/肩或是其他什么地方，敌人都只会微微一晃，地上流几滴番茄汁，继续跟你全武斗。抱歉我玩的是2013年的FPS不是03年的FPS，而生化奇兵无限的射击手感我觉得极好的展示了什么叫“一丑遮百俊”，越活越回去了老肯，二十年前在DOS上运行的毁灭战士手感比你高不知道到哪里去了！（一切形式吹DOOM）\n\n恩，主要可能还是我更偏好有着大量支线的FALLOUT，生化奇兵1和2虽然也是线性流程，但给人的感觉非常之好，人物之间的斗争，剧情的一波三折，最后的惊天秘密等。而无限在开场之后的惊艳只感觉剩下了无穷的“突突突”。\n\n地图设计：4.5分。我想这可能是对生化奇兵无限不感冒的原因，生化奇兵无限看似给你了极大地探索空间，可实际上只是大堆的空气墙和跳不下去的量子云传送门，我能够对一个游戏起到画龙点睛作用的就是对于地图秘密地点的收集，或者说解密，生化奇兵的前作在这一点上做的也很好，比如火焰质体可以融冰发现一些秘密补给，而冰系质体又可以冻住水面，到达一些平时去不了的地方。\n\n无限虽然有很多的异能，但完全没有吸取前作的优秀经验，除了吃老本的海葬DLC想起来这回事之外，本体中异能除了战斗就只能战斗，哦还有抢超市，唉老肯你的想象力怎么这么匮乏了？而且说实在的大部分异能只会给自己带来更多的麻烦，我宁愿一直用枪，而不愿意一个火球在自己脸上开花。\n\n我想归根到底恐怕还是Irrational Games内部的问题，扯皮来扯皮去，眼高手低，粉丝过高的期望加上老肯并不是一个能够驾驭得住别人的人，生化奇兵无限游戏所呈现出来的正好是一种矛盾，这倒是与Irrational Games之后的解散遥相呼应了。\n\n现在游戏版权又交回了2K手里，希望有个天才来继续BIOSHOCK的故事吧，一个人，一座灯塔，一座城市的故事。（不然还是雪藏起来以后卖版权也还好，别糟蹋了）\n\n生化奇兵无限

Even as a departure from Rapture, and all we knew from Jack, and Johnny Topside in the first games. I cannot gush about this enough. From excellent environments, colorful, but somber, to the vigors, compacted from the first two games, but upgradable, the game feels more impactful. \n\nComparing my playthroughs between bioshock, and infinite, (subtracting things like graphic capabilities of 2007 and 2013, of course), I found myself much more invested in the world, characters, plot, etc. I love elizabeth, and I feel the want to protect her, and heartbroken in her story as a deuteragonist, and later protanganist. We actually get to see her, up close. Same with comstock, and the Lutece twins, where as in the first game, besides, spoilers, killing andrew ryan and fontaine, all other important characters are basically kept away from us. Behind glass, where we can't see their emotions, reactions, and thoughts.\n\nThe combat feels more autonomous. In playing bioshock after this, I feel like I'm only smashing buttons. But in infinite, I feel my own impact on the enemies, and the stakes seem higher when an enemy hits me. \n\nOver all, the game feels more appealing, and emotional. Five stars. If I complain about anything at all, it would probably be how lifeless NPCs can look out of cutscenes. For example, Daisy fitzroy when we meet her, versus when she kills Fink. Her eyes are different, and void. But, of course, this goes hand in hand with the uncanny valley, and probably will be remedied in later instalments of Bioshock, if we see them.","timestamp_created":1499646371,"timestamp_updated":1499646371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33416693","author":{"steamid":"76561198015299304","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1072,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1562703726},"language":"english","review":"Amazing 10/10.

The two weapon system feels overly restrictive and doesn't leave much room or any room at all for player experimentation when it comes to what weapons you use and how you use them and combining them with the vigors. The combat isn't terrible but it's not that great either. The story is the meat of the game here and if you don't mind very restricted combat then I would say go for it but in terms of gameplay mechanics the game leaves a lot to be desired. Fortunately the DLC Burial at Sea fixes some of the issues with the combat except for the two weapon system.

玩谁死谁：无限 有没有人性啊，主角又死了XD 一代老死，二代累死，三代被自己女儿淹死，就连DLC也没放过主角，哪怕不是一个人。海葬一被钻头钻死，海葬二被扳手敲死。不过剧情不错，人设也不错伊丽莎白超萌的，而且这个队友我觉得可以说是我玩过的所有游戏里最能帮上忙的队友了。能帮你开锁，被打残了会给你找医疗包，没子弹了她也会尽可能寻找一些子弹给你，平时还会帮你四处搜刮资源，有时还能帮你探路，周围有敌人他还会警告你，只帮你忙，绝不拖你后腿。剧情有点烧脑，大概意思就是我们控制的主角在一次受洗中出现了接受和不接受两个位面，接受的成为了神父（以下称之为神父）创造了天空之城，而我们控制的是不接受位面的主角，神父派人来主角存在的位面提议用他的女儿也就是伊丽莎白拿来抵债我们的主角一开始同意了，但后来突然后悔，试图夺回女儿，慌乱之中神父叫人关闭了传送门伊丽莎白也就被关闭的传送门切断了一节手指，这也是为什么她有控制位面的能力，主角也就疯了，时常把找女儿和某件事弄混，最后就成了要去一个地方把一个叫伊丽莎白的纽约去抵债。结尾主角说要复仇，最后被淹死是因为如果在受洗后主角还活着那么这场悲剧就会永远一遍遍持续下去，所以他必须回到受洗前然后杀死自己。","timestamp_created":1499596753,"timestamp_updated":1499596753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33399805","author":{"steamid":"76561198396280564","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":438,"last_played":1522245421},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情很有内涵，引人深思。天空之城的设定加上蒸汽朋克的风格，不愧为第九艺术。值得购买的佳作。","timestamp_created":1499595244,"timestamp_updated":1499595244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33399702","author":{"steamid":"76561198097465333","num_games_owned":423,"num_reviews":121,"playtime_forever":7715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":974,"last_played":1635656136},"language":"english","review":"Ending
