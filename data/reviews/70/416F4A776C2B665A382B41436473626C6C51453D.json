Allá va:\nDescubrí este juego (más bien su demo Half-Life: Uplink) allá por el 2004 aproximadamente, y cuando la acababa la volvía a jugar. Deseaba jugar la versión completa, y desconocía sus expansiones y mods de los usuarios. Un día que estábamos en u ncentro comercial vi un pack llamado Half-Life Generation que contenía Half-Life, sus dos expansiones y Counter-Strike 1.5. Le pedí a mis padres que por favor me lo compraran, y aunque tenía 9 años, lo hicieron. Por aquel entonces no pensaba en descargar los juegos pirata, así que fue un logro para mí.\n\nA lo largo de estos años lo he ido jugando, junto con Counter-Strike, y este año he descargado mods y he vuelto a revivir aventuras de personajes distintos en este universo, dándole variedad a lo que ya me encantaba.\nPara mí, fue de los primeros shooters en primera persona en 3D que marcaron un antes y un después. Da igual que fuera lanzado en 1998, que tenga solo 4 modelos de científicos y militares, y un solo modelo de guardia de seguridad. Es inmortal.\n\nSi todavía no has probado este gran juego, te invito a que lo hagas, y si puedes, compra sus expansiones aunque no estén en oferta, no está muy caro el pack. No te vas a arrepentir. Yo sigo sin haberlo hecho, y tantos años conociéndolo, jugándolo, y que no haya cambiado mi modo de pensar sobre él, tiene que significar que el juego es bueno.","timestamp_created":1515976207,"timestamp_updated":1568914061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471698105335235596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39351739","author":{"steamid":"76561198086341520","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":1379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1606444927},"language":"english","review":"WHY do we all have to wear these RIDICULOUS TIES!","timestamp_created":1515971549,"timestamp_updated":1515971549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471314907073974609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39351413","author":{"steamid":"76561198168242826","num_games_owned":506,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":510,"last_played":1516987345},"language":"spanish","review":"8/10 Buen Juego.","timestamp_created":1515970422,"timestamp_updated":1515970422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56081080436706543","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39350626","author":{"steamid":"76561198244273708","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":385,"last_played":1633278472},"language":"english","review":"One of the greatest game of all time.

To gra, która zmieniła świat rozrywki. I dobrze, bo to gra która powinna to zrobić. Jest niesamowicie dobrze zrobiona, z niesamowitą fabułą, która stworzyła wiele uniwersów. Np. Portal. Model strzelania stworzył serię CS, a przynajmniej 1.6. Czyli strzela się dobrze. Ale gra nie jest bez wad. Ostatnie rozdziały to całkowite szaleństwo. Nie zawsze sprawiedliwe.

And it shows, not just in the graphics.\n\nAt it's time, it was revolutionary. Against Doom, Quake, and a tidal wave of other FPS games it somehow stuck out. Playing it now, it's hard to see why. Back then, there were next to no narrative based FPS games. Nowadays there a dime a dozen. So does Half Life still stand up today? Ehh. The graphics are dated, but depending on your taste this could be a pro or con. Shooting feels alright, nothing special. Everything is good. But just good. One thing this game does amazingly even today is it's pacing. You never feel bored, you're always doing something. I completed the game in about 4 hours, which is decently short, but that's because theres no filler. It's constant gameplay, be it the interspersed puzzles or a fight against aliens or military, you're doing something. There's even some pretty good platforming. Overall, Half Life is a good game. These days it's just good, but back in it's birth year it was better than sliced bread. If you see the game on sale, or even at full price and have some time to spare, pick it up.

Doch ein wichtiges Experiment mit einem unbekannten neuen Material geht gehörig schief und öffnet eine Verbindung zu einer Nachbarwelt. Unglücklicherweise sind die nun auftauchenden Aliens alles andere als freundlich gesinnt und auch das anrückende Militär hat offensichtlich andere Ziele als die verbleibenden Wissenschaftler aus Black Mesa zu retten ...\n\n[h1]Gameplay und Level[/h1]\nHalf-Life ist ein flotter Shooter in der Ego-Perspektive, bei dem man jederzeit auf ein großes Waffenarsenal zurückgreifen kann, welches Dr. Freeman mit sich herumträgt. Das reicht von gewöhnlichen Pistolen und Sturmgewehren bis hin zu einem Raketenwerfer und einigen exotischen Alien-Waffen wie einem Gewehr, das Energiestrahlen verschießen kann.\nDie Feuergefechte mit feindlich gesinnten Widersachern wechseln sich dabei regelmäßig ab mit Levelabschnitten, in denen man entweder simple Puzzles lösen muss oder seine Fähigkeiten im Überwinden von Hindernissen mit Sprüngen und Klettern an den Tag legen muss.\n\nLevel und Schauplätze sind angenehm variiert und bieten oft durch cleveres Design und visuelle Indikatoren Hinweise auf den weiteren Pfad, sodass man selten stecken bleibt und nicht weiß wie es weitergeht.\nIn vielen der Level gibt es abseits des Hauptpfades außerdem versteckte Wege und Nischen, die den Spieler mit Gesundheitspacks oder Munition belohnen, weshalb es sich oft lohnt, die Augen offen zu halten und ein wenig zu erkunden.\n\nBesonders auf die Lebenspunkte unseres stummen Protagonisten sollte man stets ein Auge haben, da Lebenspunkte nur über Medi-Packs, erste-Hilfe Stationen an den Wänden oder in seltenen Fällen auch von verbündeten Wissenschaftlern regeneriert werden können.\nZusätzlich hat Gordon allerdings auch noch die Möglichkeit die Anzugenergie seines HEV-Anzugs aufzuladen, was es erlaubt einen gewissen Anteil von Schaden zu absorbieren.\n\n[h1]Grafik, Musik und Vertonung[/h1]\nHalf-Life hat seit der Erstveröffentlichung nun schon einige Jahre ins Land gehen sehen und das merkt man dem Spiel grafisch sofort an. Figuren sind detailarm, Texturen niedrig auflösend und man kann hören, dass die Audio-Qualität mit heutigen Standards nicht mithalten kann.\nTrotzdem mindert das den Spielspaß nicht im Geringsten und alles in allem ist das Spiel sehr gut gealtert und kann sich heute durchaus noch blicken lassen, besonders in Bezug auf das clevere Leveldesign und das gute Gesamtgefühl.\n\n[h1][b]Fazit[/b][/h1]\n\nDie Abenteuer unseres stummen Brechstangenschwingers Gordon Freeman gehören zu den absoluten Klassikern in der Geschichte der Videospiele und trotz des Alters kann Half-Life auch heute noch ohne Probleme überzeugen durch ein solides Waffengefühl, flottes und abwechslungsreiches Gameplay in clever gestalteten Leveln und die oftmals wirklich überraschend hinterlistige KI.\nEtwas schwächer sind in meinen Augen jedoch die finalen Kapitel des Spiels und besonders der finale Bosskampf ist eher vergessenswürdig und nicht allzu spaßig.\n\nAlles in allem trübt das aber nur geringfügig die Spielerfahrung und es ist aber sehr schön zu sehen, dass das Spiel ohne jegliche Kompatibilitätsprobleme auf modernen Systemen laufen kann.\n\nEin wirklicher Klassiker, gerne mal ausprobieren!","timestamp_created":1515778865,"timestamp_updated":1519281781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39286360","author":{"steamid":"76561198157193042","num_games_owned":859,"num_reviews":530,"playtime_forever":39,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1482499624},"language":"english","review":"One
