I sometimes found myself looking at walkthroughs of this game because I couldn't find a ladder or a path that advanced me through the next section of the main story. The abstract graphics appear unprofessional compared to today's modern games and can be understandably underappreciated by today's youth, who are more in favor of great display during gameplay. However, you have to give credit that this 2004 game has one of the best storylines ever. The plot is ingenious and contains smooth transitions, and it is a successful sequel to the first Half Life. This game is like the oldies, where a great story was the key to a game's success. In fact, it remains true today -- Storyline = Success. In short, the pros outweigh the cons.

Why? It does everything right in what a FPS game needs. Many nuanced details, simple but oddly rewarding little puzzles as you pass through the many environments, the environments themselves, all strung together as you see just about everything City 17 has to offer. Between run down slums, abandoned industrial parks, a country side with spits of run down buildings in the distance, radiated rivers, giant bug infested shores, head crabs and zombies coming out of the wood work all along the way and a physics engine which even today rivals modern gaming. On top of all that, the story which goes almost untold from the silent protaganist, Gordan Freeman, who in all honesty is about as lost to the happenings of the world as the player is. Only slivers of clues and a very indirect method of story telling always seems to provide just enough to keep people coming back for more.\n\nEdit: Weapon variety. You eventually have something suited for every situation you find yourself in, assuming you've explored the environment and scrounged around for ammo. A fast firing SMG, the trusty little pistol, laser guided rockets, the loud and certainly power Combine Assault Rifle and some other rather unique weapons to the Half Life universe. Such as ant-lion lure, a Zero-Point Energy Field Manipulator AKA the Gravity Gun and of course a crow bar used for everything but it's intended use. Weapon variety is one of the things that keeps this game fresh like a jar of unusually old pickles with a sweet crunchy taste that have undeniably aged well in their, what can only be known as, a secret goo.\n\nThese days, the graphics are clearly aging, but retain a certain quality that is undeniable. Though a few bugs and glitches still exist in the game, at this point, you would have to try to cause a glitch to happen. But all in all, this is one of the most polished games you can run across from the mid 2000's, along with it's two following episodes. Along with that, the only way you wouldn't be able to play Half Life 2 on it's top graphics is if you PC is from 2007 or has spam bursting out of the hard disk drive and spilling across your motherboard.\n\nI honestly can't give any good negative to this game. It was a sublime experience back when it released and to this day, remains so. The gameplay remains smooth as can be and continues being one of those gems many other developers can only dream of. If there is a downside to this game, the only one I can really bring out is the AI is plain and simply old. It's not bad and can be challenging enough, but to any vertern FPS gamer of this modern day, it will come across as a little dumb, but that said, the AI won't hold back just how good Half Life 2 is.\n\nSo did I have fun? You can bet your bottom dollar I had fun. Will you? Of course! You can typically get all the Half Life games for dirt cheap most of the time and when it's on sale, you can get them for just under $5(USD). I guarentee, it's one of the best purchases you'll make in gaming for a long time to come.\n\nP.S.: I'm wearing rose colored glasses when it comes to this game, so my opinion is cleary biased.","timestamp_created":1498798865,"timestamp_updated":1499154612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33023053","author":{"steamid":"76561198078744993","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":74,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":74,"last_played":1447205108},"language":"english","review":"Whoever
