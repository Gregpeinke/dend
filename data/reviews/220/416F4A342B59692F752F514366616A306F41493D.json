I am new to PC gaming altogether but have been very much active to know this product. I know that my review doesn't count or seems to be important because it is such an old and popular game that everyone would have played it by now. It's seems so easy to play HALF LIFE 2 but it's the same reason that I didn't want to invest my time on this (due to Old Graphics ). This year 2020 even being a very bad year for people worldwide but the video games industry has seen a massive boom in this year. Now all the new games are the best and greatest AAA titles that achieve photo realism to a different level but at that stage where does the old HALF LIFE 2 stand?\nI am seriously not being a PC fanboy or a PCMR patriot but playing OLD and GOLD games like this is a big BIG advantage to the PC community. Half Life 2 is not anyway a great or the best game in 2020 but man I had fun playing this game and enjoyed every bit of story it has to offer. Is this as good a console exclusive?\nThe answer is NO. But again Has any console exclusive been a breakthrough as big as HALF LIFE 2? Nope.\nYou might be new to PC gaming or you might have switched from CONSOLE to PC. I would highly suggest you before starting any AAA fancy title just give HALF LIFE a try and experience how graphics doesn't matter, how photo realism is just an add on, how fun a video game is, how you can achieve peace for some period of time.\nOn conclusion this game doesn't need itself to be justified by any review because it's a GEM.\nI bought it for INR 29/- (i.e. 0.35 USD).\n10/10 HISTORY DEFINING.","timestamp_created":1599981655,"timestamp_updated":1599981655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129016876220703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75891539","author":{"steamid":"76561198375566743","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1618,"last_played":1601121880},"language":"russian","review":"Проснитесь и пойте, мистер Фримен, проснитесь и пойте..

One of the things I like most about this game is that every chapter feels unique with some really cool mechanics in each and you feel your progress as you go through them. I also think the G-Man is one of the aspects that sets this game apart from others - that mystery that is going on between him, his employers, Gordon, and everyone else is really intriguing.

I can't recommend this game enough for anyone the next big thing.\n\nAfter completing this game for a second time I can honestly recommend this game from the bottom of my heart. Visually on it's own this game is a sight to behold but put it in VR and the world becomes so much more alive. Gameplay while teleport jumping is an odd choice as well as the lack of melee weapons and sometimes slow locomotion the game makes up for it by having new enemies around every corner that make fights tense and panic inducing especially without something like a trusty crowbar to help you on your journey. On that note I can't describe how enjoyable it is being able to interact with about 95% of the objects in the game and while you can sometimes feel that 5% the majority makes up for it tenfold. Achievments and Resin make alternate playthroughs enaging by changing up what upgrades you have at what time as well as creating unique challenges which reminds me a lot of Bioshock especially when combined with the insane horror-esque areas in the game. As for the story well I best keep that hidden for new players but all i'll say is that the humor from portal 2 returns in a more fitting manor as well as story moments which will make your jaw drop or send chills down your spine as soon as the game starts up. As for my more deeper thoughts\nseeing city 17 in a new perspective is quite honestly amazing as well as the vorts and righter sunny segments. Jeff is an amazing example of expanding an idea in interesting ways that I haven't seen in a long time. Going up to the vault and seeing it become destroyed in front of you is intense but not as intense as the Gman and the ending giving me pure joy every time I play it.\nwhile VR is a bit expensive right not with a VR ready pc and headset going from $500-$2000 it may seem like a lot but VR is home to hundreds of cool games with 20-30 equaling this game in length and sometimes surpassing it in experience (for half the price no less) Half life: Alyx is a sight to behold and can only be played to believed.","timestamp_created":1599854552,"timestamp_updated":1599854552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460829466581344604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75808639","author":{"steamid":"76561198802131905","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":902,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":753,"last_played":1609474473},"language":"english","review":"source engine is wack but the game is awosme","timestamp_created":1599849097,"timestamp_updated":1599849097,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75808144","author":{"steamid":"76561198269546517","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":827,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1652503066},"language":"english","review":"Love the half life series.

I recommend this to anyone looking for a somewhat challenging game.","timestamp_created":1599758210,"timestamp_updated":1599758210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75756505","author":{"steamid":"76561197976700264","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2976,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2976,"last_played":1408274875},"language":"english","review":"Still the best game ever","timestamp_created":1599758160,"timestamp_updated":1599758160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75754729","author":{"steamid":"76561199009606566","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":339,"last_played":1657035660},"language":"russian","review":"Не ходите дети в Рэйвенхольм гулять","timestamp_created":1599755715,"timestamp_updated":1599755715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75751794","author":{"steamid":"76561198400322448","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":741,"last_played":1639313443},"language":"polish","review":"Fajna gierka polecam","timestamp_created":1599751664,"timestamp_updated":1599751664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75745330","author":{"steamid":"76561198823531117","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":643,"last_played":1641765494},"language":"english","review":"Nice","timestamp_created":1599743107,"timestamp_updated":1599743107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75745016","author":{"steamid":"76561198427226373","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":173,"last_played":1617487639},"language":"koreana","review":"kpoop","timestamp_created":1599742630,"timestamp_updated":1599742630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75743907","author":{"steamid":"76561198372871823","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":797,"last_played":1648801732},"language":"english","review":"The physics in this game is amazing, it has a beautiful storyline and I 100% recommend you get it\n","timestamp_created":1599740826,"timestamp_updated":1599740826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75742624","author":{"steamid":"76561198186109379","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":2355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2355,"last_played":1658794117},"language":"english","review":"Somethings wrong if you don't own this game.","timestamp_created":1599738605,"timestamp_updated":1658834304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75742430","author":{"steamid":"76561199006353920","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":21,"playtime_at_review":2744,"last_played":1659606330},"language":"russian","review":"Это шедевр.Сюжет крутой и интересный.
