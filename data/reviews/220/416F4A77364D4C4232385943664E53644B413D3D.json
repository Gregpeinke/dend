Many players remember the first time that they walked the streets of City 17 and experienced the oppressive Combine rule, and the unsettling feeling that I got whenever the zombies eerily screeched over Ravenholm. In Half-life 2 you continue exploring the nightmare after the resonance cascade. You play as Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist forced to survive the alien invasion that took place during the incident. After the events of Half-life, you are put into stasis by the Government Man and awoken on a train similar to the tram in Black Mesa. As the train stops you exit to the train station and are greeted by Dr. Wallace Breen, your previous boss at Black Mesa and now the figurehead of the Combine on Earth. The Combine is a massive inter-dimensional organization composed of allied and enslaved alien species. They took control of Earth in an event called the 7-Hour War that took place in between Half-Life and Half-Life 2. Eventually you join the resistance and begin an uprising against the Combine. As you progress, you become even more powerful and your arsenal enlarges. You also gain more reputation and become the face of the Resistance.\n\nUnlike the first game released in 1998, Half-life 2 introduced physics that make combat way more enjoyable and strategic. For example, when you see a group of combine police on a wooden bridge you could just shoot them; or you could shoot the platform above them to drop bricks onto their heads. What about that explosive barrel? Maybe you want to just shoot the wooden bridge that they are standing on. As you can see you have many options with the combat but it doesn't stop there. Instead of the first game's jumping puzzles they added in physics puzzles and significantly better thought out puzzles in general. Graphically this game still looks great for being released in 2004 and looks even better as they upgraded the Source engine in the later versions and updates. The enemy and ally A.I. has improved a lot when compared to the original. Your allies will give you ammo and health when they see you are low and will take cover and duck around in a fire fight. If they see a better weapon then they will pick it up and begin to use it. Unlike the first game your allies don't get stuck around corners or objects for the most part. Unfortunately they can still get in your way in narrow corridors. The Source engine also excels in the new realistic facial expressions, and I think that the characters in Half-Life 2 still feel more realistic than most games nowadays.\n\nOn top of that, it's price is a steal! It's only $9.99 for one of the most entertaining and ground breaking FPS' you will ever play. This game has an amazing story combined with the great physics and nice graphics. It also has some replay value, due to how detailed the environments are, and if you want more, the modding community is enormous. Half-Life 2 is by far one of my favorite games personally. If you enjoy the game then consider trying the episodic chapters that you can buy seperately for a really cheap price. These take place right after and go in chronological order.

Un Gordon Freeman que te deja vivir su aventura de científico guerrillero que actúa a puro instinto, es el personaje ideal para sumergirnos en su mundo.\n\nEl personaje de Alyx está perfecto. Cómo no te bloquea, y a la vez te hace sentir como el líder de la rebelión, cargando toda la sabiduría del primer juego, es excelente.\nEl dinamismo de armas también le aporta mucho al juego, pero la que más importa, es la anti-gravitatoria. Qué perfecta que es ese arma! y los acertijos que tiene el juego forzandote a usarla lo hacen más emocionante.\n\nBásicamente, la saga Half-Life es una saga que no te podés perder.\n9.5/10","timestamp_created":1403231246,"timestamp_updated":1403278136,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10546880","author":{"steamid":"76561198064975782","num_games_owned":627,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":559,"last_played":1407203869},"language":"english","review":"If you only ever play one Valve game (which you'll realize won't happen after you complete your first) let this one be it.
