I just want to say that I loved this game and it was perfect in almost every way. When I was playing I could really tell how hard valve worked on it. I couldn't find a bug, glitch, or anything of the sort anywhere. The dialouge was amazing and so was the story. I think this may have been the best dialouge of any game I've ever played. The puzzles are terrific, and engaging but they never get too tedious. There are awesome moments when something clicks in a puzzle and it is terrific when that happens and you finish a very hard puzzle. It is awesomely priced when you see how much work was put into the game to perfect it and make it as awesome as it is. I am very impressed. As for those who may be worrying there is not enough content I still have co-op mode to do as well as an infinite amount of community test chambers. It is easy to see why this is the top rated game on steam. Probably the only con this game has is it can be a bit hard at times, I myself never needed a guide but I can easily see how others might and there were parts where I very nearly broke down and looked at a guide but I figured it out right at that moment.
