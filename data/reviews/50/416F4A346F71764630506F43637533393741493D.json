Le nuove armi e tipologie di nemici introdotte infatti donano varietà al titolo, nonostante una sensazione di déjà-vu scontata, ma che di certo non rappresenta un punto a sfavore. Da segnalare inoltre anche una difficoltà maggiore rispetto all'opera principale, anche se parliamo di alcuni specifici punti dall'avventura.

The new additions to the game are really interesting, and work pretty well for the most part. I do have a few issues with it though. The only issues I have is one issue with the mouse, and the AI. The mouse will sometimes just not want to work, but you can fix this by enabling raw mouse input. The AI though can kinda just want to kill you for no reason. Like, I will literally blow up a tripmine trap, and the gad dam squad members will literally shoot me. I guess this issue can be fixed by telling them to stay put. Though when the AI does want to help you, which is basically every time you get to see Otis, it really shows the prowess for a game made in 1999. The AI works for the most part though, I'm just having some personal issues with it.

What is even the point of playing as the enemy then? \nThe entire reason the HECU were enemies was because they were ordered to cover up the Resonance Cascade, but this game starts near the end of the Half-Life campaign where the soldiers begin to evacuate the facility. Why even bother making this expansion? It's just Half-Life but without the amazing set pieces that game offered.\n\nAdrian Shepherd is the protagonist of this game, and a pretty boring one at that, he never speaks or give us anything that would develop his character. Adrian is just a Gordon Freeman clone, except not even as interesting.\n\nFriendlies can and will shoot you if you are in line of sight, sometimes they won't move unless they feel like it.\n\nThe whole experience feels like a giant waste of time to me, you start the game off as a reinforcement for the HECU that is currently fighting the aliens, not even halfway in the game you are then told the next objective is to evacuate black mesa. Fast forward maybe two hours later, if that, the game ends and black mesa is nuked. The ending is a big letdown, when I first beat the game, my initial reaction was \"Wait, that was it?\" I wasn't aware that it was the final boss either, \n\nValve has not directly stated that Opposing Force is cannon. So considering that, I would say that this is probably a very good experience if you look at it as a fanmade project, but this is suppose to be an expansion to Half-Life, which it fails to do me imo. The story adds nothing that we haven't seen from Half-Life already, and the levels leave more to be desired.","timestamp_created":1626305130,"timestamp_updated":1626305339,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485163658857345581","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95737497","author":{"steamid":"76561199039416353","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":33,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1625795345},"language":"latam","review":"Es del año del pedo, se crashea una banda, la mira está tildada de fábrica, la traducción está bugueada y aún así sigue siendo un juegazo.\nCompralo solo si está en descuento y te viene en pack con las otras partes.\n","timestamp_created":1626285034,"timestamp_updated":1626285034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95734295","author":{"steamid":"76561198826746336","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":12,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1602983164},"language":"english","review":"Forever doomed to be flying around in zen forever.
