It brought fewer new elements into the game than the previous two and wasn't well acclaimed by fans. The game upon release on steam suffers from bugs caused by the engine changing and various other things. The game was also originally supposed to be an exclusive for the doomed Sega Dreamcast. The plot takes place during the events of half-life and Instead of playing as gordon freeman, you play as the ordinary watchman Barney Calhoun(the one you see banging on the door in the beginning of half-life). The story also features some new faces not yet seen in the series.\n\nPROS:\n-The story is very well paced and put together very nicely. You play as Barney Calhoun during the cascade and cover up operation in black mesa. Not spoiling the rest in case you haven't picked up a copy in the 20 years its existed.\n-The environment is very immersive as it is a long seamless road to the end of the game with, as the definition of seamless implies, zero cutscenes or immersion breaking interruptions.\n-The gunplay involves the same weapons from half-life with no new additions. The arsenal available is pleasently loud, very powerful feeling, and quite fun to use when eliminating the enemy.\n-The ending is great for what it is\n-Has an HD reskin to give a fresh coat of paint.\n\nCONS: (Not even half-life is safe from sin, sorry) Please note that i am extremely aware that this game is an oldy.\n-Controls feel floaty and thats not very great to say when this game is a puzzle platformer.\n-Same issues as the original, guns feel not very effective at some times and very effective at others. No idea whats going on here but it hasn't deterred me from playing.\n-Unlike the other half-life games before this one, this installment is the buggiest out of the bunch. Plentiful missed triggers and some doors not opening like they should all throughout the entirety of the game. Buy at ones own risk.\n\nThis game isn't a must have unlike the original but usually it comes bundled with it so give it a play(used to come free). I picked the entire series up in a frantic buy in a summer sale and it was worth it. if anything it's textures for gmod if you don't have much interest in it. With the bugs still not being fixed to this very day we have the second lowest score out of all half-life games that i'll be giving out.\n\n6 blue vests out of 10\n\nNormally i'd say Decay is up next but i've run into a snag...it's not on steam.\n\nThe game is very much available elsewhere but hasn't had an offical release on steam. Only thing i can do is go overtime on this one and plant my review here. DOUBLE REVIEW.\n\n*clears throat*\n\nHALF-LIFE: DECAY<\n\nThe fourth installment in the half-life series is once again the progeny of valve teaming with gearbox. It brought a handful of new elements into the game than the previous three with one being a choice of a protagonist. The game was never released on steam and still to this day is a playstation 2 exclusive minus the couple of ports to the PC. The plot takes place prior/during the events of half-life and Instead of playing as gordon freeman, you play as a pair of gordon freeman's colleagues. The story also features some new faces not yet seen in the series.\n\nBeing that this game is a platform exclusive i have not played it. My review here is based on the combine overwiki and gameplay footage.\n\nPROS:\n-The story is very well paced and put together very nicely. You play as either Gena Cross or Colette Green during the cascade and cover up operation in black mesa. Not spoiling the rest in case you haven't picked up a copy in the 20 years its existed.\n-The environment is very immersive as it is a long seamless road to the end of the game with, as the definition of seamless implies, zero cutscenes or immersion breaking interruptions.\n-The gunplay involves the same weapons from half-life with no new additions. The arsenal available is pleasently loud, very powerful feeling, and quite fun to use when eliminating the enemy.\n-The ending is great for what it is\n\nCONS: (Not even half-life is safe from sin, sorry) Please note that i am extremely aware that this game is an oldy.\n-Controls feel floaty and thats not very great to say when this game is a puzzle platformer.\n\nThis game isn't on steam as i've said before so you can't purchace it. Decay is available as an unoffical port elsewhere to download by the various european/eukrainian developers that made it so.

Surely, Freeman might have put the final nail in the coffin, but what more factors could have affected the outcome? A broken supercomputer, a malevolent Russian infiltrator; or perhaps an oversleeping scientist. The possibilities are torrential, and in retrospect anything seems conceivable ... perhaps the catastrophe could have been avoided?\n\n[b]Meet Barney Calhoun[/b], a Black Mesa security guard. His job is simple; main objective: to protect facility equipment and research personnel. He may have Level 3 security clearance into the top-secret Sector B, but don't be deceived - Calhoun is an ordinary guy. But he is about to experience something extraordinary.\n  The 16th of May started out just like any other day: the halls of Black Mesa are still somewhat empty,  tired staff grumbles their discontent over yet another early morning, the complex has not yet sprung to life. Calhoun is savoring the silence of the break of day; but suddenly something breaks the silence. Gunshots from down the corridor echoes throughout the vacant rooms. Down the hallway the shooting range has fallen victims to its first wielders, confirming the outset of a new day. A few guards steps through the entrance and greets Calhoun, as if just to confirm it further. \n  For an outsider the halls could be hard to navigate, but for the employees it's perfunctory. A left turn; another left; straight forward and to the right: Barney enters the locker-room. It's mandatory to wear your bulletproof vest at all times, and today is no exception. His locker creaks uninvitingly - as if auguring the imminent event - and it sends his 9mm pistol (it's standard-issue among the wardens) toppling to the ground with a resounding clunk. Some turned their heads, others couldn't be bothered. He picked it up and shifted its weight in his palm. The cold metal sent chills down his spine. Chills, in the most delightful meaning of the word. Barney Calhoun is ready for duty….\n\n[b]Blue Shift[/b] is the second and ultimate expansion pack for Half Life, offering a final viewpoint on the legendary disaster. It contains the same elements you might expect from a Half-Life title: aliens, guns and puzzle-solving - heuristics can be the only way forward. But unlike its precursor, this standalone game do not feature any new substance. Gameplay remain identical to that of the original which hankering fans discerned as trite. In a lamentable juxtaposition of the series previous releases, Blue Shift received a lukewarm reception. Critics claimed it was somewhat abbreviated and largely regarded it as “more of the same”. Although; when it comes to Half-Life, more of the same doesn't sound that bad.","timestamp_created":1503362066,"timestamp_updated":1503362066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56505429744720459","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34397776","author":{"steamid":"76561198398912053","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1527343373},"language":"schinese","review":"通关了，流程比半条命原版要短，也更简单。win10输入法换成英语就不会闪退","timestamp_created":1503330957,"timestamp_updated":1503330957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34387241","author":{"steamid":"76561197968079109","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":49425,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17721,"last_played":1508012768},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um excelente game aprovo demais classico dos classicos","timestamp_created":1503286277,"timestamp_updated":1503286277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34375026","author":{"steamid":"76561198027728858","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":177,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":177,"last_played":1503221743},"language":"english","review":"Short but a still good addition to Half-life games.

No new weapons, no new enemies, not even all of the ones that showed up in the main game.  It also lacks the polish in its set pieces that the original has, and has rather more back-tracking than other games in this universe.  That said, the gameplay is still enjoyable; it's still Half-Life, even if the weakest incarnation.\n\nGameplay aside, there's little other reason to play this.  The story of one security guard's escape is rather low-key and underwhelming.  Yes, the player character shares the name of the NPC from HL2.   But as a silent protagonist, he has no personality and might as well be anyone.  There is some world-building as we see more of Black Mesa, including its history with teleportation experiments, and its done fairly competently.

Кроме небольшой смены «угла зрения» (читай: пачки карт для новой кампании) никаких нововведений означенная смена не предусматривает. Сама кампания никудышная, карты оформлены бедно и абсолютно безыдейно. Действо сопровождается музыкой, выдернутой из предыдущего адд-она, Opposing Force, причем, что самое замечательное, оттуда были позаимствованы самые отвратительные треки. Одно хорошо – «Синяя смена» чрезвычайно короткая; прохождение занимает часа 3 от силы.\n\nЕдинственным интересным моментом Blue Shift в свое время был вот какой: на диске вместе с игрой поставлялся бонус – пакет новых, высокодетализированных моделек оружия и вражин. Этот пакет можно было напялить также и на оригинальный Half-Life, и на Opposing Force (сейчас во всех трех играх в «Стиме» уже по умолчанию есть специальный переключатель в настройках). Правда, лично я «отреставрированные» модели не перевариваю: они лучше детализированы, все так, однако часть новых экземпляров выглядит безвкусно. \n\nПодведем итоги. У Blue Shift есть свои достоинства. Кампания короткая, как уже упоминалось выше – это первый несомненный плюс. А кроме того, бывают шутеры и хуже; в конце концов, это же Half-Life.
