Главной его особенностью стало существенное изменение геймплея. Мир и локации получились более открытыми, что позволяет часто маневрировать, передвигаться на большие расстояния и использовать недоступные ранее тактики. Продолжительность эпизода существенно подросла по сравнению с первым. Сюжет развивает и продолжает общую историю, сталкивая Фримена с новыми врагами и игровыми ситуациями, завершаясь неожиданным, очень сильным и эмоциональным финалом.\nТехнологически, эпизод построен на обновленном и доработанном движке \"Source\". Физика реализована на новом, качественном  уровне. Сильно выросла детализация мира, а улучшенная работа с тенями и светом сделали его более живым. Всем фанатам лучшего в мире шутера от первого лица играть строго обязательно. Ненавистникам Гордона Фримена, серии игр \"Half-Life 2\" играть строго не рекомендуется.

Gordon and Alyx have barely survived the blast of the Combine's reactor blast. They thought they succeed in their mission only to discover that the combine is attempting to reopen the rift to the Xem world. After Alyx contacts her father at the freedom fighters' base in the middle of the forest, Gordon and Alyx must travel there to help defend the base from the Combine and put an end to their attempt to connect to the Xem world. The game provides more to offer and has a very good way of putting a player through a lot of suspense. The game ends with a cliffhanger as it was intended to continue on to an Episodes 3 & 4. However those segments were either cancelled or in development hell, and for years Valve went on and off about the status of a \"Half-Life 3\" which is intended to give the franchise a conclusion. There has been leaked artwork on the project and a huge demand from die hard fans that want to see a true ending to the franchise with another game. Even the Naughty Dog company expressed high interest in making the third game by striking a deal with Valve. So there is a noise for a continuation for Half-Life, it's just uncertain when it will happen. I just hope it will happen in this life time cause Half-Life is one of the most prized first person shooter games of all time it strongly deserves a true conclusion cause after playing this game I want to see what will become of Gordon & Alyx and maybe even see what becomes of the G-Man as well. Only time will tell from this point, so until then keep on fighting for Half-Life 3 to happen.","timestamp_created":1462946179,"timestamp_updated":1462946179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22906505","author":{"steamid":"76561198156605998","num_games_owned":333,"num_reviews":90,"playtime_forever":33,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1466513310},"language":"thai","review":"มะมัน","timestamp_created":1462943873,"timestamp_updated":1462943873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22892550","author":{"steamid":"76561198162917711","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1012,"last_played":1511054163},"language":"english","review":"can not get the game to play!
