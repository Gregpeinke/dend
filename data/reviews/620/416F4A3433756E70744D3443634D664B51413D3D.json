I was already a fan due to their famous games, such as: Half-Life and Half-Life 2 which I also loved. Then I go to play Portal 2, and it had evolved in so many ways. You somewhat feel how better it is to control your character, with not only the keyboard, but the excelent controller support. Graphics have had some great improvement, and the puzzles are SO much more challenging, and without a friend or a playthrough guide you will face some times where you are just so baffled, but its the best kind of brain teasing needed. The new co-op was implimented in with two robots to play as, instead of a human(like the singleplayer and first game had), the co-op is used well to make sure you work together to get the tests done, and some charming customization added in as well. A workshop is in the game as well, that gives us user made levels, all Valve games have this, but this game alone has so much replayability value due to it. The only thing after all that, is the numerous mods, both payed and free that uses Portal 2 as a base, which has given us unique games like Apeture Tag, along with Portal Stories: Mel. All in all, this game deserves a 10/10! Amazingly fun, tons of replayability value, and definitely worth even the base price of $20. But seriously Valve, learn to count to 3 soon so you can continue these amazing game series, or you could just ignore that idea and make a stupid mobile bridge constructor spin off...

It's not just hopping from one room to the next. The atmosphere changes as the story moves along (while retaining the humor).\n\nAfter you complete the main story mode, there are a number of options, from playing co-op online, to designing your own test chambers in the steam workshop. You can also compete (indirectly) against friends in challenge mode, to see who can beat a level fastest or with the fewest portals. I've recently discovered commentary mode, where, at various checkpoints in the game, you can activate it for a commentary from one of the game developers.
