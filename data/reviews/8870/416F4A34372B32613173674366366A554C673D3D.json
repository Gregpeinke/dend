В обзоре на вторую часть я писал, что её можно и пропустить. Так вот, запустив, только запустив Infinite, я сразу понял что был прав. Графика стала ярче и приятнее, оружие не выглядит слепленным скотчем и им намного удобнее пользоваться, исчезла эта неприятная лично мне замкнутость пространства, сохранены атмосферность и антураж - на некоторые вещи так и тянет постоять полюбоваться несколько минут.\nСюже оставил смешанные чуства. С одной стороны всё класнно, очень классно. Но с другой - к концу всё так завернули, что у меня мозг потёк. Возможно когда-нибудь я перепройду всё это, попробую понять....\nСтоит ли играть?

The game offers a fairly fast paced action that might sometimes feel a bit tedious. Bioshock Infinite contains a multitude of weapons that are era specific and are lovely to use.\n\nYou also have access to powers, known as vigors, which you can use to dispose of enemies or to just help you make your way through the game. The vigors can also be combined with each other making it an intriguing system to play around with.\n\nIn addition to Weapons and Vigors you have other tools, like the skyhook, which lets you jump around from hooks attached to the side off certain buildings.\n\nThe stealth system within the game is good. The detection is based around both sound and vision so walking on a carpet can suppress your footsteps while walking on puddles of water or broken glass will make them louder.\n\nThe games scenery and enviroments are absolutely outstanding. When I got the first glimpse of Columbia I was speechless. \n\nThe voice acting in the game is great as well with excellent dialogue. I'm quite serious now, I can't describe how PERFECT some parts were with how the characters acted and what they said. This game has brought forward some amazing quotes. In addition to that, all of the characters are well made and very sympathetic. \n\nI like games that have a good story, and Bioshock Infinite has just that. The story  is incredibly rich when it comes to content and will leave you with memorable parts that will make you smile when you think back.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a game that you will not regret playing.

What else do you need!\n\nCons\n\n- You may feel \"This again?\" at times.\n- Some of the enemies were annoyingly hard.\n- The ending was far fetched, even for a game like this.\n\nThis one got a lot of hype, especially for the graphics/visuals.  It doe snot disappoint at all.  Columbia city is a marvel to wander around in.  It does feel kind of locked down in a few places, but for the most part you really feel like you are wandering around the place.\n\nThe NPCs around the city are lively, interactive, and fun to watch.\n\nBe warned there is some borderline non-PC topic material here, if ethnic commentary or male/female stereotypes bother you, just be aware.  NONE of that takes away from the game though, and it really lends itself to the authenticity of the setting.  So I appreciated that.\n\nAnyway, the game!!\n\nAs you know if you read my reviews, all I really care about is that it is fun.  Is it?  Hell yes it is!\n\nYes it is more of the same Bioshock flavor in a new shinier serving.  But who cares.  If it ain't broke right?\n\nThe weapons are fun, the enemies are fun (Most of them ;P), the environments are fun.  The story got a little crazy at times and I had to slow down to keep up with it (I get lost in the shooting sometimes) but if you follow it close enough you'll be fine.\n\nThe Elizabeth \"power\" just makes everything that much more interesting.\n\nOverall I don't think there were many times where I was rushing through a boring area or stumbling around lost.

No voy a negar que sea un jodida maravilla gráficamente y que sea muy bonito de ver y blablabla... Pero coño, Infinite no es más que un BioShock capado y lineal hasta la saciedad.\n\nRazones de porque es un BioShock capado:\n\n· Para comenzar, se nos quita la opción de poder llevar todas las armas. Ahora únicamente podemos llevar 2, lo cual veo una verdadera mierda porque en las entregas anteriores, gracias a la gran variedad de armas que teníamos a nuestra disposición para llevar a la vez, podíamos escoger una arma u otra para acabar con según que enemigos. Ahora sólo podrás acabar con tus enemigos con lo que te encuentres por ahí. Y si las armas son una mierda, te jodes.\n\n· Ya no podemos cargar con botiquines ni jeringuillas de EVE. Lo veo una auténtica mierda porque el estar en según que situaciones y no tener botiquines jode mucho o el tener toda la vida y encontrarte con un botiquín que no puedes guardarte para usar cuando tengas poca vida, también.\n\n· Ya no hay Little Sisters ni Big Daddies ni ningún ser de esos de anteriores entregas. Se acabaron los finales alternativos y las misiones secundarias. Bueno, el juego tiene misiones secundarias (que se basan en volver 2 kilómetros atrás para buscar una llave o abrir algo) pero las puedes evitar perfectamente que no te pasará nada.\n\n· Es jodidamente lineal. Sólo trata de echar hacia delante y cargarte a 3 o 4 soldaditos de vez en cuando, ya está. Algún que otro \"Handyman\" o \"Patriota Motorizado\" le da algo de vidilla, pero nada más.\n\n· La mayoría de vigorizantes son de anteriores entregas o si no son \"re-skins\" (como por ejemplo los cuervos, que son las abejas)\n\nEl juego realmente trae pocas novedades a parte de que ahora los \"plásmidos\" pasen a llamarse \"vigorizantes\" (nombre feísimo) como lo son \"el gancho aéreo\", arma cuerpo a cuerpo curiosa y que a la vez nos servirá para montarnos en los carriles para ir de lado al lado de Columbia y Elizabeth.\n\nNunca he sido muy fan de que en los FPS tengas compañeros ya que me gusta que el protagonista puede enfrentarse a todos sus problemas él sólo, pero sinceramente Elizabeth no me ha parecido mala compañera. No estorba, es esencial para la historia, puede [spoiler]abrir desgarros para proporcionarnos torretas u otras cosas[/spoiler] y encima de vez en cuando nos pasa vida, munición o dinero. Una delicia de compañera (no como la asquerosa Alyx). \n\nY bueno, poco más tengo que decir de esta decepción de juego. Que a ver que sí, que la historia muy bonita y esas cosas, pero jugablemente es aburrido y lineal hasta la saciedad y encima le han quitado cosas de las anteriores entregas.\n\nSi quisiera disfrutar de una buena historia, me hubiera comprado un libro o hubiera visto una película, pero he pagado por un juego y quiero algo que jugablemente me divierta, sea entretenido y valga la pena.\n\n[spoiler]El final es una copia del de la película \"Looper\"[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]En este juego se muestra la América más nazi que he visto en mi vida.

These choices do not matter at all, but you're still forced to choose. \n\nOften in the game, you may want to take certain radical actions, but the game will not allow you. This can be so infuriating that it leaves the player simply wanting to quick. \nThe gameplay makes up for the frustrations, and offers a much more open-space to fight in than previous Bioshock games, with agility and strategy being important to succeed (at least on higher difficulties). \n\nI found it surprisingly difficult to gather up enough funds and resources in the game to upgrade all my abilities and also get the weapon upgrades I wanted. \n\nI recommend new players hold on to their money, and each time they enter a new \"area\", look up how many \"infusions\" are in the area - the game does not have a hard save/load function, and going back to find something you've missed is often extremely tedious. \n\nThe achievements are somewhat fun to attempt to obtain, but I did find it unrewarding in the end.","timestamp_created":1412027130,"timestamp_updated":1537289009,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492106318473815918","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12292695","author":{"steamid":"76561198079460513","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":759,"last_played":1452898534},"language":"english","review":"I'm not sure about this one.

Bioshock 1 helped define a generation of games, but this just seems tired. \n\nSo, I recomend this game for the experience of playing it, and I would definitly recommend buying the Burial at Sea DLC also.  \n6/10","timestamp_created":1412018988,"timestamp_updated":1412018988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12292165","author":{"steamid":"76561198102182662","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1393,"last_played":1587218248},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра","timestamp_created":1412015941,"timestamp_updated":1412015941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12290928","author":{"steamid":"76561198100778692","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1075,"last_played":1425833342},"language":"spanish","review":"Totalmente recomendado si os han gustado las dos primeras entregas :)","timestamp_created":1412008952,"timestamp_updated":1412008952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12290568","author":{"steamid":"76561198016761009","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":4561,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2760,"last_played":1613788608},"language":"english","review":"six flags ripoff","timestamp_created":1412006828,"timestamp_updated":1412006828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12290062","author":{"steamid":"76561198027901315","num_games_owned":427,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":1693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1348,"last_played":1436736138},"language":"russian","review":"Отличное приключение,наполненное быстротечными,но все же запоминающимися моментами.много кто уже расписал игру как только можно,посему лишь поставлю 8/10 за высокую планку ожидания и столь низкую планку реализации по моему мнению.1-й биошок больше запомнился хотя бы антуражем Восторга,что не сказать о карамельной Колумбии","timestamp_created":1412003964,"timestamp_updated":1412003964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12289916","author":{"steamid":"76561198102982887","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":312,"last_played":1410339664},"language":"koreana","review":"바이오쇼크 3번째 시리즈\n\n1,2의 배경인 해저도시 랩처를 벗어나 공중도시 컬럼비아에서 벌어지는 환상적인 스토리.\n\n백인우월주의와 페러렐월드 등의 시대적인 배경이 녹아있다. \n\n매 시리즈마다 감탄이 절로 나오는 명작\n\n전반적으로 플레이에 어려움은 없으나 \" 엘리자베스 \" 의 지속적인 아이템 공급으로 난이도가 더욱 낮게 느껴지는 게 단점이라면 단점.","timestamp_created":1412003159,"timestamp_updated":1412003159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12288793","author":{"steamid":"76561198042769656","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1230,"last_played":1430431398},"language":"german","review":"Das beste Spiel was Ich besitze :)","timestamp_created":1411996214,"timestamp_updated":1411996214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12288206","author":{"steamid":"76561198012593072","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":672,"last_played":1471888528},"language":"english","review":"Here's the thing: I don't normally like FPS games.

I continuously wanted to see what was next. The world is beautiful and colorful. The vigors are awesome, although somewhat overpowered.

I did get all the tropies on PS3 and played it again when this was on Steam sale.

D'un côté une vaste arnaque qui à force de vouloir bouffer à tous les râteliers construit un gameplay tout en façade: pas un jeu d'exploration en monde libre mais un FPS couloir, un soupçon de tactique et de Roleplay illusoires qui favorisent en fait le bourrinisme et la recherche d'items compulsive, pas vraiment une réflexion sur le totalitarisme mais plutôt une narration à tiroirs fourre-tout. Mais cet espèce de gigantesque montage d'idées qui tend l'expérience de jeu vers le néant reste intéressante parce qu'elle redouble le contenu narratif et ses histoires de mondes parallèles et trouve un accomplissement dans l'incroyable direction artistique qui va encore plus loin dans le collage d'influences que les précédents Bioshock. On navigue de l'esthétique révolutionnaire communiste aux fantasmes de grandeur religieuse en passant par la Guerre de sécession, l'art antique, tout ça passé au mixeur Jules Verne, et cela de manière assez organique et cohérente.\nDu coup on comprend très vite que l'intérêt du jeu réside presque uniquement dans la contemplation. Les phases de jeu ne servant qu'à générer des images, la First Person devient un prétexte à la scrutation et visuellement il faut avouer que le jeu en a sous le pied (même si l'émerveillement du début du jeu tend à s'estomper au fur et à mesure). Donc même si le jeu est une grosse déception en terme de gameplay (je ne me souviens plus des précédents opus mais j'avais pas souvenir d'un tel manque), ça reste une expérience qui vaut le détour.

The skylines make it a lot easier to get around the battle stages, and the tears add even more potential for crazy chaos, although they sometimes feel like they're there just so Elizabeth has something to do. I'm not a big fan of the carry limit on guns though; like a lot of modern shooters, Bioshock Infinite allows you to only carry 2 guns with you at any time. In a game series that's all about creative combat, this feels like an odd choice (although the number of different guns in the game is huge), and fortunately the devs chose to go back to letting you carry all weapons at once for Burial At Sea.\n\nThe game is less about scavenging than the first one. You still get some freedom about the way you explore an area (and going straight for the objective will mean you miss out on a lot), but it lacks the sense of desolation that you get in Bioshock 1 and 2, simply because in those two games, you walk around in Rapture after the civil war, while Infinite takes place before/during the civil war in Columbia. It makes sense but I still miss it.\n\nThe graphics are stunning. Columbia looks absolutely gorgeous, the first time you see the city is very reminiscent of the first time you see Rapture in the original Bioshock (and also an obvious call-back to that famous scene, only the bathysphere is a rocket this time). Rapture also looks incredible in the Burial At Sea DLC.\n\nUnfortunately, the game holds itself up considerably less well in terms of storyline and characters. Frankly, Father Comstock just isn't nearly as interesting a villain as Andrew Ryan, and the struggle between him and the Vox almost boring compared to the battle between Ryan and Atlas. In that regard, Fink feels like he would have made for a much better big bad. This becomes even more painfully obvious in Burial At Sea, when old characters make their returns.\nThe Luteces, on the other hand, are absolutely brilliantly voiced by Courtnee Draper and Troy Baker as two bickering siblings, and the moments in the game where you encounter them are among my favourite.\n\nI'm not going to say much about the ending to the main story. Yes, it sucks. As for the ending to Burial At Sea, well... That made a lot more sense, actually.\n\nAltogether Bioshock Infinite is not a perfect game, but I had a LOT of fun playing it, and I fully recommend it and the Burial At Sea DLC.","timestamp_created":1411730355,"timestamp_updated":1411730355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12243985","author":{"steamid":"76561198026638029","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1995,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1995,"last_played":1396699300},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite games of all time.\n\nAmazing setting, storyline and characters, well written and voice-acted.

Здесь нет ничего лишнего — ни «приклеенной» RPG-составляющей, ни надуманных сюжетных поворотов. Геймплей, сценарий, графика, музыка в синхронном звучании создают поистине потрясающую стимпанковскую атмосферу. Когда ты проходишь по солнечным улицам парящей над небесным сводом Колумбии, слышишь приятную музыку, раздающуюся из каждого радиоустройства, подбираешь всякую дребедень, а твои действия сопровождаются характерным «биошоковским» треском и хрустом, то понимаешь, что мир Infinite совершенно уникален, и одно лишь нахождение в нем становится настоящим праздником.\n\nДизайнеры уровней проделали, не побоюсь этого слова, грандиозную работу. Внешний облик Колумбии заставит трепетать сердца даже самых притязательных любителей графики. Локации разнообразны, декорации на протяжении всего прохождения постоянно меняются, каждый квадратный метр города полон каких-то мелких деталей. Хочется ходить по этому миру, заглядывая в каждый закоулок, слушая все диалоги случайных прохожих, просматривая наборы забавных картинок в каждом кинетоскопе.\n\nНемаловажную роль в погружении в мир играют аудиозаписи, повсюду разбросанные жителями города и главными действующими лицами.","timestamp_created":1411716824,"timestamp_updated":1411716824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12242084","author":{"steamid":"76561198076320783","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":510,"last_played":1410694501},"language":"english","review":"great story and fun gameplay","timestamp_created":1411708256,"timestamp_updated":1497047665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12241992","author":{"steamid":"76561198128862527","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1411777393},"language":"english","review":"Not as excellent as the first, but new gameplay, story, and easter eggs keep me coming back. 8.5/10 would skyhook again","timestamp_created":1411707524,"timestamp_updated":1411707524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12241319","author":{"steamid":"76561197999337717","num_games_owned":481,"num_reviews":146,"playtime_forever":1466,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1466,"last_played":1411849109},"language":"english","review":"BioShock Infinite really utilizes its art style and general look very well, its usual mindscrewing plot line is in full effect here too. The end result is a damn good game that's certainly worth your time if you haven't played it yet.\n\nDLC's a bit more complicated. Clash in the Clouds is a basic arena fighting expansion but offers enough content within that to actually be an enjoyable purchase, though expensive (thus picking up the Season Pass or this DLC on sale is worth it). On the other hand we have Burial At Sea Episode 1 and 2 that brings the story together with the original BioShocks, which I was looking forward to more than CiC. Ironically enough, it's not as good. It IS good because it's more Rapture and it's an interesting look at Rapture, even if we're back seeing mad splicers and wrecked building interiors all over again. It also is more BioShock story and general atmosphere.\n\nTo best describe it though is to mention a short \"event\" that occurs near the beginning of Episode 2. One of Cohen's little pieces to be precise. It's a shock video, you watch it, weird things happen, it plays with your expectations, but you have this nagging feeling you know what's going to happen. Then it happens, a spooky thing jumps out behind you AHHHHHH! Oh wait, you saw it coming, it wasn't quite as shocking as was intended. That's Burial at Sea. It does some pretty interesting things with expectations but you still see it coming from far enough away to rob BaS of its story shock value, which BioShock does a good job at offering normally. So is it really necessary? Well, I'm not sure. It feels a whole lot like BioShock Lite more than a nice expansion, even if it looks pretty damn sharp. And don't get me started on the fact that stealth is a huge mechanic in Episode 2. It's interesting but not a lot of fun to mess with.\n\nBut yeah, BioShock Infinite is still a good game, it's DLC is a bit more mixed.","timestamp_created":1411701207,"timestamp_updated":1411701207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12240836","author":{"steamid":"76561198024912201","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1277,"last_played":1411610684},"language":"english","review":"This game has an incredible storyline!
