evreninin unutulan karakteri Adrian Shephard...\n\nYaşanan bütün bu öngörülemeyen sonuçları bir başka perspektiften daha görmek zevkliydi. Ana oyunu gölgede bırakmadan efsane bir yan oyun çıkarmak zor olsa gerek. Hikayesel olarak biraz boşlukta bir oyun gibi görünse de, bence Adrian'ı ileride çıkacak olan oyunlarda göreceğiz.*\n\nOyuna Half-Life'tan farklı olarak yeni silahlar ve mekanikler eklenmiş. Bence gayet başarılı olmuş. Özellikle ipe tırmanma mekaniği gayet güzel bir ekleme olmuş. (Her ne kadar klavye kırmama sebep olsa da.)\n\nSerinin diğer oyunlarıyla olan bağlantıları da bayağı iyiydi.**\n\nSonuca gelecek olursak, bence güzel bir ek hikaye ve vereceğiniz paraya değecektir. Ben yaz indirimindeyken 1 veya 2 TL civarı bir şeye almıştım. Pişman olmayacaksınız.\n\nSpoiler:\n\n*: Half-Life: Alyx'in sonu yeni oyunun geleceğini bağırarak söylüyor resmen. G-man'in \"Gordon'dan başka kimseyi bulamıyorduk.\" demesi blöften başka bir şey olamaz. Adrian dururken Alyx'i işe almak biraz fazla saçma olurdu, değil mi? Adrian'ı Barney'i gördüğümüz gibi ilerideki oyunlarda görmeyi çok isterim. Adrian, G-man'in gizli silahı ve bunu kullanmak isteyecektir.\n\n** Gordon'ı portala atlarken görmek, Gina'nın cesedini Xen'in kuytu köşelerinde görmek gibi diğer oyunlarla olan bağlantılar beni tatmin etti açıkçası. Her ne kadar Gina'nın ölmesine çok üzülsem de 😞 (neyse ki Collete'in cesedi hala bulunamadı.

Opposing force adds a ton of new weapons, including a desert eagle, m60, and AWP, all of which are a ton of fun to use and really compliment the gameplay. The military theme is a nice departure from regular half-life 1, and these weapons add to that feeling. That being said, Opposing Force has some rough edges, and there are a few very frustrating difficulty spikes towards the end. That, and the final boss is very underwhelming, boring, frustrating, and is just overall not fun.

Half Life was a big success so Valve wanted to make a sequel. But that would require a new engine and a completely new... game so while they worked on that, they hired Gearbox Software to make some expansions for them so that HL fans could get some more HL without a decade long wait. I am so glad Valve still does stuff like this today. The first expansion Gearbox made was HL Opposing Force which is what I'm reviewing right now actually if you couldnt tell. The story follows Coorperate Adrian Shepard, unlike the base game where we folllow Gordon Freeman. Shepard is a military boy who was apart of the gang tasked with Black Mesa-ing... Black Mesa, but his plane crashed and bada bing bada boom scientists help him spies sent by the same military tries to kill him and woah cool boss fight. Ok the story part of this is done. The game takes some stuff from HL and also adds some new stuff making it a real expansion. A cool new gun, a sniper rifle that supposedly replaces the crossbow which the sniper is better in goldsrc and only goldsrc cuz bodies dont ragdoll. And it's big feature is squad mates wow so cool. People to try to do your work for you but die fast if you do nothing. Jokes aside the squad mates are actually cool in this game and I dont have many complaints other than the fact that if you accidently shoot one then theyll try to kill you back but if you're like me that will only happen once or twice. The game is short and time well spent. If you check my steam hours I beat it in around 5 hours but a lot of people claim to beat it in a shorter amount of time so it's just a quick run through that you can beat in around a day. It's an amazing expansion and I hope Crowbar Collective makes a remake of this like they did with the original, though I highly doubt it.

В первую очередь хочу отметить, что я глубоко люблю всю серию Half-life, и поэтому просто не мог после прохождения первой и второй части не сыграть в аддоны к первой. Opposing force являетя, по моему мнению, лучшим из двух (трёх, но Decay нет на ПК). Новый протагонист - Адриан Шепард, боец HECU. В целом, считаю его не менее харизматичным чем Гордона и Барни, только он и единственный, кто не имеет продолжения своей истории после событий в  Чёрной мезе. Теперь к механникам. В Opposing force было введено много нового оружия, появилась механника с пушкой-барнклом и загадками с ним, портальная пушка и снайперская винтовка. Появились новые враги - представители Расы X. Спорное решение, которое не получило продолжения, но я не считаю их настолько плохими, по крайней мере опустив канон и смотря на них только сходя из геймплея. Новые локации атмосферны, особенно последние уровни с парковкой и даже ядерной бомбой. Итого, 8/10.","timestamp_created":1653426332,"timestamp_updated":1653426332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115958004","author":{"steamid":"76561198405581267","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":398,"last_played":1653159599},"language":"hungarian","review":"Classic","timestamp_created":1653422951,"timestamp_updated":1653422951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115953948","author":{"steamid":"76561199174649026","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1655140599},"language":"brazilian","review":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","timestamp_created":1653416930,"timestamp_updated":1653416930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115945825","author":{"steamid":"76561198108912377","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":430,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1653567222},"language":"english","review":"Very epic","timestamp_created":1653405302,"timestamp_updated":1653405302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115942660","author":{"steamid":"76561198262515379","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":490,"last_played":1654446531},"language":"russian","review":"Почти шедевр)) '3","timestamp_created":1653400521,"timestamp_updated":1653400521,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540389955043792725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115912240","author":{"steamid":"76561198844707872","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":383,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":383,"last_played":1599065213},"language":"english","review":"almost as good as the regular game","timestamp_created":1653338197,"timestamp_updated":1653338197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115898649","author":{"steamid":"76561198088261129","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":193,"last_played":1653317947},"language":"english","review":"Probably the worst Half Life experience I've ever had.

Стандартные говнопрыжки, очень глючные нпс, которых нужно постоянно подталкивать, чуть не сломалась сохранка и было пару вылетов в предпоследней главе, но в целом норм, играть почти не мешало. Уже встроен фикс для Full HD, мелочь, а приятно.  \nСложно, да. Порой необоснованно сложно, хотя играл на нормале. Ниндзя - это разрыв жопы, а их здесь ОЧЕНЬ много. \nЕсть много нового оружия и игра заставляет использовать его по максимуму. Почти всегда не хватает патронов, а хп и костюм бьли по 100% один раз за прохождение, но это, как по мне, сбалансировано и заставляет играть аккуратнее. Нет чувства безопасности, передышки редкие. Очень атмосферно реализованы хаос и прорыв к точке эвакуации.  \nПо сравнению с оригинальной халфой сюжет даже ИНТЕРЕСНЕЕ, более живые нпс, бесподобный G-Man, местами приятный саунд, БОСС-ВЕРТОЛЁТ, и даже [spoiler] прообраз Вовы Виста в одной из последних глав! [/spoiler]\n\nВ итоге довольно бодренький в 2к22 шутер, как для игры из раннего палеолита. В принципе, если посмотрите прохождение на ютубе или вообще пропустите Opposing Force, то вы ничего не потеряете. Не сказать, что аддон значительно расширяет лор вселенной Half-Life, но мне было интересно и я не пожалел. Концовка вообще топ.\n\n[b] 6 ручных барнаклов из 10 [/b]\n\n[i] P.S.
