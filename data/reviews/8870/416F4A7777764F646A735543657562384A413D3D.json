That it could make you feel and care for the characters, so much that you would be thinking about them, worrying for them and doing everything in your humanly power to make sure that everything went the way you wanted it too. That is the feeling Bioshock: Infinite will bring to you and anyone who plays this game and truly immerses themselves in the story, putting yourself in the shoes of Booker Dewitt and getting the feeling that these in game events are actually happening and that you are involved.\n\nThis is the best game in the Bioshock series, without a doubt, simple things like the main character being able to speak and having a companion,to huge things like the world being fueled by slavery, racism and capitalism, not to mention the fact that the game is absolutely stunning visually and the added feature of zipping through parts of columbia on sky hooks and landing on enemies heads to send them flying through the air and off the map are all features that make this game such a unique and mind blowing experience.\n\nThe characters are amazing, the gameplay is easy to pick up and the story is the best story I have ever experienced in a game, the link up with the city in the sky Columbia to the underwater utopia that is Rapture is special and the added DLC of Burial at Sea parts 1 and 2 that bring the Bioshock series to a close, is some of the finest storytelling that not just gaming has ever seen, ENTERTAINMENT has ever seen (Yes better than TLOU).\n\nIn short, buy this game and play it, I have completed this game 3 times already on the Xbox (where my original playthroughs are) completed all the DLC, and I fully expect to be going back to play this game time and time again, I 100% hope this isn't the end of Bioshock as a series, but if it is, all I can say is it has been an amazing journey, and Bioshock sits at the top of my most treasured games list and will for a long time.\n","timestamp_created":1396527654,"timestamp_updated":1396527654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.594759285449981689","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9712983","author":{"steamid":"76561198086851326","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":40,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40,"last_played":1396492199},"language":"english","review":"BioShock Infinite is my 2013 Game of the Year. Plain and simple. The game manages to do what the sequel to the original BioShock failed to do which was bring us the same awe and wonder that the original gave to us. While following a new storyline, the game feels true to its predecessor giving an astonishingly well crafted blend of story, beauty, and gameplay. Upon my initial playthrough of the game, I could not put it down and believe it is an experience that everyone needs to at least give a try. For those not fans of shooters, don't worry. BioShock is its own breed of shooter and, with the power of vigors, doesn't necessarily feel as though you are playing a shooter.

Elizabeth also has the power to pull a rocket launcher out of her arse and scream \"Booker catch!\" just at the right moment. all that hype, and all she turns out to be is a vending machine in a corset, at least in gameplay. in character, she is pretty and well voice acted. \n\nanyway, other gimmicks include the skyrails. they are probably the most fun thing in the gameplay, because it was at least something different. but sadly, the original promise of having these skyrails be huge and expansive in previous trailers and such have been replaced with such limited use, which really does suck. the plasmids-i mean vigors- are essentially the same thing (and they kinda don't fit into the universe as much as the first 2 games did, but whatever), with one of them-forgot what it was called- pretty much replacing hacking with a \"press button to get free stuff\" on a vending machine rather than the hacking a vending machine that required skill. it removed a hell load of depth from the game. dumbing down at its finest. and speaking of vending machines and upgrading stuff like weapons, the weapons are so generic and boring, and don't change how the gun looks in the slightest. compared to Bioshock 2's upgrades that were cool and added visual pieces to the weapons (for example in B2 you could upgrade your drill to make it freeze people, and the visual cue that it gave was that the drill was covered in ice), all the upgrades were included simply \"faster firing rate\", \"bigger clips\" etc. and all the weapons were generic, compared to bioshock 2, which was a huge disappointment. \n\n\nlastly, you will horrendously murder thousands of people throughout the game, it's ridiculous. it feels so unnecessarily violent for the type of game, and the type of story, it was trying to be/to tell! this is a BIOSHOCK game, sure there was blood and gore in the series, but the game is never about shoving a got damn skyhook in someone's head and ripping it off! the bloodiness of the game feels like the game's attempt to appeal to the masses. at times i forgot who the hell i was shooting at, because there was just SO MUCH MURDER, at least the first two games didn't have so many enemies in one area all thrown at you at once that it becomes confusing, because that is what this game does.\n\nnow before i get onto the good stuff, i'll just say that i played on the HARD difficulty, just like i did with the other Bioshock games. this may be the reason why i feel this way about the gameplay (and probably the reason why i didn't enjoy the other games as much; i was told that the series was easy, and it should be played on the hardest difficulty for a challenge, or else it is too easy). GOD KNOWS how terrible 1999 mode would be, if i played through the game on 1999 mode, i would have screamed and screamed, espesially at the fucking Lady Comstock bossfight.  but anyway, i'll get more onto difficulty at the end.\n\nit would be a disappointment to a Bioshock fan from a gameplay perspective, i'll tell you that in a nutshell.  \n\nnow on to the good stuff. \n\nthe game looks AMAZING. definitely one of the best looking games ever with a distinctive and colourful art-style, complete with high resolution textures yet high performance. running the game on max is a real treat. this makes the presentation of the game spectacular, with majestic floating buildings and clouds, as well as wonderful god rays. not trying to sound like a creep here, but Elizabeth especially is highly detailed and beautiful, with the reflection of lighting shown on her hair, the subtle movement of her clothing as she moves, and even some \"battle scars\" like torn clothing are highly detailed. check out some of the screenshots i took of the game, absolutely stunning.\n \nnow, the story is probably the best part of the game, and sadly, the only other thing that the game has for it, apart from graphics and such. i like to call it \"the Inception of video games\", because it will confuse you, but it will confuse you a hell of a lot more than Inception, because really that movie is only confusing the first time, if you pay attention in re-watches you'll understand. anyway, yeah i am not going to spoil it, but i'd say just play the game just for the story. at first it starts off as the generic \"generic ex soldier guy is sent to save damsel in distress\" and for the most part that is what the story is kinda like with a few twists and turns here and there, but it all comes together at the ending, which will make your brain explode without taking a few days to think and research about it. hell, i am still to this day having trouble trying to describe it, but i do know what happens, its just really hard to describe without loosing your head. you'll think back about the events you experienced throughout the game and think \"ohhhhh, so THAT'S what that means\" and such. just because of the story, i am considering getting the story DLC for the game, but i have my fingers crossed for a discount first.\n\nfinal thoughts? \n\nbuy this game for the story if you want to know what all the fuss is about, but don't play through on hard unless you want to. i recommend playing on either easy or medium, especially if you just want to experience the story. it's a shame i have to recommend it like that, but it is the truth. Bioshock Infinite offers an amazingly presented game with a complex storyline, let down only by the gameplay. i suggest that you also wait  for a discount, it was 10 dollars a couple of weeks ago or something, and that is amazing value for money.   \n\nedit: just adding stuff i forgot to mention.","timestamp_created":1396503431,"timestamp_updated":1396577150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9710991","author":{"steamid":"76561198078536511","num_games_owned":501,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1048,"last_played":1423483364},"language":"japanese","review":"bioshockシリーズは前々から気になってて、今作初プレイ。\n前作のプレイ動画等々はみていましたが、ホラー部分が目について、購入を控えていました\n今作はＰＶを見るにそこまで、ホラー要素が目につかなかったので購入\nプレイしてみた結果、思ってたよりかはカジュアルなＦＰＳ\nホラー部分はちょくちょくありましたがあまり怖くはなかった（後半のライト野郎以外は）\nそれと今作のヒロイン、エリザベスがよくできたＡＩ、戦闘中に自分の状況を判断して\nアイテムをなげてくれたり（弾薬、ライフ等）ティアというものを使い、遮蔽物などをつくってくれる\nしかもかわいい（個人的に）\n問題点は敵がエリザベスの近くにいるのにエリザベスを攻撃せずにこっち側を攻撃してくる\nバイオ４のアシュリーのようにさらってくれたら、スリルが増したと思う\nストーリーはかなり理解しずらいものの後半はのめりこんでしまう\n少し最後が、わかりずらかったのが問題点\n総合ではかなりおすすめな一本\n飽き性の自分も二週目をたのしんでいるので\nＦＰＳ好きな人だけではなくともプレイしてほしい一本\n\n2016 11月追記\n\"うぉぉぉぁぁぁぁ、マジか! で\" 賞 に選ばせていただきました。　プレイヤーをぐっと乗り込ませる怒涛の展開、二年たった今でも忘れません。","timestamp_created":1396500789,"timestamp_updated":1480000380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.604864358901977539","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9710810","author":{"steamid":"76561198078441995","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":711,"last_played":1477636012},"language":"english","review":"What an ending wasnt expecting that. was dumbed down alot from the other 2 Bioshocks. still fun.","timestamp_created":1396498291,"timestamp_updated":1396498291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9710747","author":{"steamid":"76561198079024139","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":416,"last_played":1609639286},"language":"english","review":"Offers nothing new to gamers, bad visuals, terrible story and boring gameplay 0/10","timestamp_created":1396497397,"timestamp_updated":1396497397,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496240615844726563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9710474","author":{"steamid":"76561198122221044","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1110,"last_played":1396491255},"language":"english","review":"Nice graphics, great gameplay and good story line","timestamp_created":1396493525,"timestamp_updated":1396493525,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9710397","author":{"steamid":"76561198095459911","num_games_owned":335,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1090,"last_played":1523132627},"language":"english","review":"Burial at Sea - Episode 2: Most emotional send-off to the best game ever.\n10/10","timestamp_created":1396492472,"timestamp_updated":1396492472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9710262","author":{"steamid":"76561198033287061","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1680,"last_played":1477525785},"language":"english","review":"Quite possibly one of the most captivating plots.

It's admirable for its creativity, and mature (in the best sense) in its willingness to tackle the ramifications of the socio-political ideas it explores.\n\nI've been seeing a lot of what I feel are excessively critical reviews of all things Bioshock, in the wake of the original game, and honestly, the bias bothers me. The original Bioshock was so innovative in it's day, and it seems as though too many reviews since that first release tend to devote extra zeal to pointing out the (typically minor) flaws of any Bioshock release, while taking any and every strength or innovation as merely the players' due. \n\nTo put it another way, it seems as though every point of excellence counts for half, while every flaw warrants triple the weight. I can't explain the bias. Franchise fatigue? Heightened expectations since the series is considered top-rate? Simple envy? I couldn't say. But , by this point, the practice annoys me no end.\n\nThe gameplay in this release is largely stealth-based with plasmids as a corollory, and while fun, it unavoidably makes one wonder what it would be like to play a Bioshock game where _all_ the various play options were available simultaneously. This version does well, but it's clear that stealth is meant to be your primary approach.\n\nThe story? There's so little I can say while avoiding spoilers. Is it well-done? Yes. It's grimmer in places, but in the service of the points it's making. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, there's a little too much emphasis on tying together all the various aspects of the Bioshock franchise, to the point where some connections can feel forced or implausible, but the story is solid over all.\n\nThe ending left me a bit cold, personally. It was well done, certainly, but a bit darker than I would have preferred. Also, someone who hasn't played the original Bioshock might have been completely baffled by the outcome -- even I had to think a moment to make the necessary connections. People who haven't played the original game, might well find themselves utterly lost by the significance of the ending.\n\nAll in all, a quality ending, honest in addressing the themes of the franchise -- although, personally, I would've preferred it if they had left things on a brighter note. In Bioshock, all the possibilities exist, after all. This installment ends in the \"past\" of the franchise; I would've preferred to finish my time with Bioshock in one of the brighter future(s) we already know are to come.\n\nVerdict? Definitely worth a purchase if you're already a fan of Bioshock, and want to see all aspects of the original franchise-story.","timestamp_created":1396464989,"timestamp_updated":1396464989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9707004","author":{"steamid":"76561198107253334","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1661,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":650,"last_played":1449398071},"language":"russian","review":"Elizabeth,i love you","timestamp_created":1396464806,"timestamp_updated":1396464806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557015657424926758","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9706957","author":{"steamid":"76561198071139365","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":927,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":174,"last_played":1642632387},"language":"english","review":"great game very intresting and greaat fps !","timestamp_created":1396464480,"timestamp_updated":1396464480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9706923","author":{"steamid":"76561198084843307","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1808,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":757,"last_played":1589804389},"language":"german","review":"Eines der besten Spiele die ich je gezockt habe :) Und die DLC einfach der Hammer!!!\nKauft es ihr werdet es sicher nicht bereuen ;)","timestamp_created":1396464330,"timestamp_updated":1396464330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567901253700256348","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9706827","author":{"steamid":"76561198042844403","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":92,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":92,"last_played":1396024704},"language":"english","review":"I downloaded this just to stare at main girl's ass and tits.","timestamp_created":1396463576,"timestamp_updated":1500581604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9706812","author":{"steamid":"76561198073185161","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":495,"last_played":1432948894},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo muito bom \n","timestamp_created":1396463477,"timestamp_updated":1396463477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9706722","author":{"steamid":"76561197994076655","num_games_owned":583,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3124,"last_played":1396504496},"language":"english","review":"I do not typically play First-Person Shooters. I am not very good at them, and overall I don't tend to enjoy playing them. If a game has a 3rd person mode, such as Skyrim, I will play in 3rd person 90% of the time. It takes something very special for me to sit through and play a FPS, let alone beat it multiple times.\n\nI am currently on my 3rd playthrough of BioShock: Infinite, I am hunting those last few achievements, and completing the game on hardest difficulty.\n\nI am a BIT of an achievement hunter. Not every game do I feel the desire to do it, but the few that I do, I usually get all of them, bearing there are none that are so ridiculously hard to get that it is like pulling teeth.\n\nI played the first BioShock when it was fairly new, maybe a month or two after release. Two playthroughs I think, so I did enjoy it. BioShock 2 I just couldn't get into, and I never played more than a few hours.\n\nMy initial anticipation for BioShock: Infinite was great. After the first teaser trailer, then the early-gameplay video had me frothing at the mouth. However it was still quite some time before the game was released, and by the time that Hype for the game was resurfacing I had already lost interest.\n\nThe game was released, to universal praise, and I was glad to hear that. However I held off in buying. I waiting, patiently, until the price dropped below $10, and then picked it up myself.\n\nCall me cheap, or frugal, and even though I have gotten over 80 hours out of this game, I still think I would have waited to play it. I have deeply enjoyed it, although I do have a few gripes.\n\nGripe #1: No Manual Save\n-I am a father. I have two fairly young children, and I don't typically devote my entire attention to a game. I frequently need to stop playing, at any moment, walk away and take care of whatever needs taking care of. The inability to save at any moment has *GREATLY* padded my Steam playtime, as I have been forced to pause the game, and walk away, for hours at a time, or lose my current progress.\n\nGripe #2: Elizabeth as a Non-Combatant\n-I think the thing that got me most excited for the game was the early-gameplay video, where Elizabeth uses her powers to assist you in combat, by making plasmid, or now Vigor combos. I remember being incredibly enthralled by the idea of using my and her powers to great effect. As was unaware they had removed this feature when I was playing the first time, so I kept thinking to myself, \"When are they going to introduce using her powers with mine?\" This thought prevailed through damn near the entire game until I reach the point where I had rescued her after being separated, and we were STILL not using power-combos. That is when I realized they removed the feature, and it was very disappointing.\n\nGranted they did allow you to use her powers in other, interesting ways... However it did not have the same impact, to me at least, as being able to do plasmid/vigor combos with her.\n\nGripe#3: Weapon Upgrades\n-One of the things I liked most about the first BioShock was that you had a limited number of upgrade options for weapons, and those upgrades were exceptionally powerful. The same goes for plasmids. I remember thinking about exactly *WHAT* weapon/plasmid combos would be best for my playstyle, and having to live with that decision for the rest of the game. Not so with Infinite.\n\nYou get enough money throughout the course of the game that upgrading weapons isn't really a problem. Sure at some points you might be strapped for cash and there is an upgrade available that you want and can't afford, but just wait a bit longer and you can get it. The upgrades also were very generic. 2 Damage upgrades, and then usually a clip/accuracy upgrade, and a weapon specific upgrade, that isn't very impactful. Coupled with the fact that there is no variety to ammo and you end up with weapons that are extremely generic, and have little to no difference from one to another. A machine gun is just as good as a shotgun. A pistol is just as good as a carbine. The only difference is how you want your weapon to look. I think I ended up going with Handcannon/Sniper Rifle throughout the whole game my first playthrough.\n\nThose are the only real problems I have with the game. Overall I have enjoyed it immensely, but I feel with a few tweaks it could have been much better.\n\nStory was amazing. Visuals were mind-bowing. Voice acting was top notch. Gameplay itself was par for the course, but that isn't a bad thing. Very much enjoyed it. I will probably end up getting all of the DLC(once it goes on sale) after finish my next playthrough.\n\nDo recommend playing.","timestamp_created":1396462793,"timestamp_updated":1396462793,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9706511","author":{"steamid":"76561198069549090","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1343,"last_played":1649542993},"language":"russian","review":"Это замечательная игра.

С отсылками к основной игре тоже всё плохо, они оставляют больше вопросов, чем дают ответов.","timestamp_created":1396452081,"timestamp_updated":1396452081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514300405979156494","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9705090","author":{"steamid":"76561198009906731","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1311,"last_played":1396451855},"language":"russian","review":"Для меня это был 21 час интересного сюжета и отличной игры!","timestamp_created":1396451910,"timestamp_updated":1396451910,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9704881","author":{"steamid":"76561198076432849","num_games_owned":434,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":683,"last_played":1532634093},"language":"english","review":"Shooter parts really ... normal.

Некоторые проекты даже стали легендами благодаря таким связкам сюжета. За последние годы я практически не видел такого хорошего сюжета в одиночных играх, как это сделала команда из Irrational Games, сделав BioShock Infinite...\nИграя и пройдя этот проект, я еще раз убедился, на сколько важным элементом является сюжет игры. Последний раз я видел настолько хорошую историю со времен, ну не знаю, последних частей Half-Life и Fallout. Играя можно испытать много разных эмоций: начиная от восхищения и заканчивая шоком. Научная фантастика  и научные теории здесь отображены настолько невероятно, что часто осознаешь - действительно ли такое в реальной жизни? И, как многим кажется, это правда, хоть это не доказано.\nНесмотря на сам сюжет и историю, в игре немало важны и другие составляющие, такие как графика с оптимизацией, звуковое сопровождение и геймплей. \nЗвуковое  и музыкальное сопровождение выполнено в самом лучшем стиле игры - начало 20 века. В один момент ты спокойно идешь по дороге, слышишь свежий ветерок, детский смех и продавца хот-догов, который зазывает покупателей; ни о чем не подозреваешь, как внезапно ты слышишь что то интригующие, что может перевернуть \"с ног на голову\" все твое представление об игре и о твоей миссии в ней. Или ты только только закончил очередную схватку, как тебе предстоит бой с боссом или крайне тяжелым противником, музыкальное сопровождение которого ты слушаешь во время сражения...\nГрафика и оптимизацией игры оправдали все мои ожидания - всё крайне правдоподобно и красиво отображено, включая даже самые мелкие детали, которые, казались бы, не существенными. Даже у игровых моделей \"отполирован\" до практического идеала проектов каждый полигон. Оптимизация крайне хорошая, что позволяет владельцам не совсем старых ПК спокойно играть, без лагов и со стабильным FPS.\nГеймплей в игре крайне необычный и немного непривычный. Здесь действует правило \"по стволу в руки\", что позволяет нам переносить с собой только два любых оружия. Еще одной фишкой является энергетики - напитки, которые нам дают невероятные способности, начиная от гипноза и заканчивая ловлей пуль и снарядов врага. Крайне невероятным является комбинированием энергетиков и другими \"напитками\" либо с тем же огнестрельным орудием, что позволяет нам  придумывать и использовать самые разные комбинации в игре. Еще одним элементом геймплея является возможность находить и искать вещи в разных ящиках, бочках и других местах и закоулков, что дает нам  больше возможностей находить и искать припасы, особенно после очередной схватки. Также радует ИИ врагов, который делает схватки еще тяжелее и захватывающе(Не на легком уровне сложности игры).Отдельно следует выделить ИИ Элизабет, которая в критические ситуации всегда может помочь, будь то патронами и аптечками, так и деньгами и взломом замков, в местах которых всегда есть что то полезное и ценное.  \nМир в игре уникален и неповторим. Колумбия - это что-то больше, чем просто город в облаках. Локации просто поражают своей уникальностью, простотой и, порой, серьезностью. Вот ты идешь по городу, который живет своей жизнью: вот там ярмарка, в другой стороне радость обычных жителей, которые занимаются своими делами, чуть дальше  к этому воздушному острову присоединяется мост с другого, что бы люди успели  кто-то на праздник, кто-то на работу, а кто-то просто гуляет... Порой все изменяется: ты видишь Б-гом забытое место, в котором живут нищие и беженцы, которые отбирают и дерутся за еду, что бы прокормить хоть как-то семью.

На первый взгляд обычный шутер, казалось бы, что интересного можно придумать в жанре FPS? Тысячи разработчиков уже истоптали эту дорожку вдоль и поперек. Не тут-то было! Если за дело взялся сам Кен Левин и Irrational games, как минимум будет неплохо. Но в итоге вышло просто замечательно. \n        5 долгих лет прошло с релиза Bioshock-1, игры года 2007. Столь долгое ожидание было не напрасным - Bioshock Infinite поразил всех - как игроков, так и критиков - сходу взял за горло и всадил аэрокрюк по самые гланды! :)\n       Идеально выверенный геймплей, который не хардкорен, но и спуску на высоких сложностях тоже не даст, нестандартный сюжет, наблюдая за которым до последнего не знаешь, чем же все закончится. Харизматичные персонажи, особенно живой получилась Элизабет, напарница протагониста. Стоит отметить, что в процессе прохождения в голове рождаются мысли, предположения о дальнейшем развитии событий, отчасти они подтверждаются, но и сюрпризов хватает. Шутка ли, до сих пор, через год после релиза на игровых форумах кипят споры о концовке игры, - от абсолютно бредовых, до весьма любопытных.  \n        Но есть и недостатки, их просто не могло не быть: если первая часть Bioshock была чистой воды фантастика, то Infinite тяготеет к более сказочному жанру, хотя поймете вы это ближе к четвертой четверти игры. Тем не менее сюжет в идейном наследнике (BI - не прямое продолжение серии, скорее, ее переосмысление) будет получше предшественников. \n        Если бы не оглушительный успех the Last of us, вполне заслуженный, я считаю, то быть Bioshock Infinite игрой года 2013. 9\\10.","timestamp_created":1396368393,"timestamp_updated":1396373445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592391312122344971","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9695414","author":{"steamid":"76561197981395992","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3150,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1570,"last_played":1404159513},"language":"finnish","review":"Aikaisempaa kokemusta minulla ei Bioshock pelisarjasta ollut, mutta kaveri suositteli ja päätin kokeilla.
