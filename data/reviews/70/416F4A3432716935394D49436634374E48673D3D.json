A lot of modern day shooters fail to provide the atmosphere and the fluid simple controls of this great title, There have been so many people reviewing this game so I'm finding it quite hard to start so i guess i shall start by telling you what the game is about.\n\n-----SPOILERS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDr. Gordon Freeman arrives late for work at 8:47 am in the Black Mesa Research Facility, using the advanced Black Mesa tram system that leads through the facility. He arrives at the Anomalous Materials Lab, his work place, and he is informed by the security officer that the scientists have a special experiment today, so he goes to the locker room and puts on the hazard suit. He goes to the lab's lower levels, and arrives at the Anti-Mass Chamber, where he is instructed that the specimen to be used that day is the rarest and also the most unstable specimen the lab has ever worked with. He is tasked with pushing the specimen into the scanning beam of the Anti-Mass Spectrometer for analysis. However as soon as he pushes it, it explodes, and creates a sudden catastrophe called a \"resonance cascade\" \n-----SPOILERS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe story is really good, its actually quite funny, modern games often spend massive amounts of money on spectacular scenes and explosions and deep heart felt commentary in order to set the mood......But How does half life do it that right with a 8-10 minute opening \"TRAM RIDE\" into the Black Mesa facility, and all it really is, is Mr. freeman going into work that day, and that scene alone provides one of the most enigmatic experiences i have ever felt in the prologue of a game.\n\nplayers enlist the help of traumatized scientists and trigger-happy security guards to get through high-security zones, sneaking and fighting your way through ruined missile silos and Cold War cafeterias, through darkened airducts and subterranean railways. When you finally come in sight of the surface, you realize that the inhuman monsters aren't your only enemies-for the government has sent in ruthless troops and stealthy assassins. Their orders seem to be that when it comes to the Black Mesa, nothing gets out alive... and especially not you. \n\nThat said the journy would be nothing without great enemys with complex ways to kill them like the headcrabs, and nothing would kill them better than the coverted crowbar that \"Freeman\" Wields. The weapons apart from that are nothing special, exept maybe the laser designated RPG launch\n\nThere are no levels in Half-Life, or, more specifically, it lacks the concept of levels and episodes we've come to expect. The game is a continual stream of locations from beginning to end. You can move back and forth at will (with only a few exceptions), as can those who are pursuing you. And though the brief loading time between zones is the one artifact that breaks the flow of the game, the transitions are thankfully brief.\n\nWeapon, ammunition, and health placement follows the same philosophy. You'll hardly ever come across an item that is just bobbing and spinning in place like some gift from the heavens. Valve has done a good job of justifying the typical health and armor meters. Freeman is wearing a hazard suit, used by researchers involved in dangerous experiments. To regain health and armor energy, you must fill up at power stations. These are almost always located in logical places, usually near areas where dangerous work would be performed. There are no power-ups to be found. Weapons and ammo are taken from supply closets or the corpses of fallen security guards and soldiers. Even the more experimental weapons have their proper place - in the weapons research department of the facility. And late in the game, once you've left the research facility, the supply of ammo and first aid kits is believably scarce.\n\nThe only problems with Half-Life are the results of it being so ambitious. The fact that all of the humans in the game look like clones takes from the otherwise realistic atmosphere. The diversity of the levels and puzzles will undoubtedly leave you thinking some areas were better than others. But complaints that arise are simply a reaction to the fact that the game is so close to ideal. Half-Life is an exceptional single-player game and a solid multiplayer game.\n\n----------------------------------------\n10/10 - masterpiece","timestamp_created":1387756000,"timestamp_updated":1387756000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8208049","author":{"steamid":"76561198074273906","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2820,"last_played":1430292790},"language":"english","review":"oh half-life.

I can honestly say it is the game that sparked my love and passion for gaming.","timestamp_created":1387043952,"timestamp_updated":1387043952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527963817119598389","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8043534","author":{"steamid":"76561198081429848","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":3710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19,"last_played":1659017053},"language":"brazilian","review":"foda","timestamp_created":1387042807,"timestamp_updated":1387042807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8037309","author":{"steamid":"76561198063584171","num_games_owned":907,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1029,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1630061670},"language":"english","review":"This game is a nice mix between story and gameplay.
