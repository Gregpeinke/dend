Das Ziel ist es die Wellen erfolgreich zu meistern und zu überleben um dann in der letzten Welle sich den Patriarchen (EndBoss) zustellen! Zwischen den Runden gibt es eine Shopingtime (basiert auf den Schwierigkeitsgrad), wo man sich Waffen kaufen kann. In Killing Floor gibt es schon einige Waffen, wie z.B. der Klassiker \"die AK\" oder auch skurille Waffen wie \"ein Kettensägeblatt-Armbrust\"! Es gibt 6 verschiedene Klassen, die alle ihre eigenen Boni haben und auch ihre eigenen Klassenwaffen. DIese kann man unabhängig von den anderen Klassen hochleveln bis auf die Stufe 6 (dies kann schon eine Zeit dauern). Auch anzumerken sind die herausfordende Schwierigkeitsstufen. Der Unterschied zwischen \"Einfach\" und \"Normal\" sind gewaltig und machen mit den richtigen Team sehr viel Spaß!\n\nSeit einigen Updates ist nun auch ein \"Story\"-Spielmodus vorhanden, indem ihr einige Aufgaben bewältigt und nebenbei einige Zombieklone abschießt. Die Aufgaben variieren je nach der Karte und können auch sehr schwierig sein.\n\nFazit: Killing Floor läuft auf der Unreal-Engine und läuft wohl auch auf älteren Rig flüssig, bietet dafür auch eine \"outdatet\" Grafik. (Noch Anzumerken ist das Doppel-Rendering der Scopes). Es bietet sehr viel Spaß in Coop und hat auch einen lustigen Humor, macht aber in Single-Player nicht sehr viel Spaß. Also definitiv ein Coop-Shooter! Es macht für 18 Euro sehr viel Spaß und es gibt auch Events, wo neue Spielmodi/Maps erscheinen! Sucht euch paar Freunde und kauft es euch oder wartet bis es im Angebot ist!\n\n-Silmos","timestamp_created":1378407599,"timestamp_updated":1411512842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514824807643890381","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7184220","author":{"steamid":"76561198090934375","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3162,"last_played":1405853468},"language":"english","review":"best game","timestamp_created":1378400293,"timestamp_updated":1378400293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6199521","author":{"steamid":"76561198061076826","num_games_owned":428,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":47198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10879,"last_played":1644073575},"language":"japanese","review":"ゾンビと戦うWave制COOPサバイバルﾏﾆﾏﾆﾏﾆ","timestamp_created":1378394194,"timestamp_updated":1378394194,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520873606204986572","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7244489","author":{"steamid":"76561198095992352","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":790,"last_played":1431263620},"language":"french","review":"Je vais résumer ce jeu en 3 mots: Simple, pas cher et complet !","timestamp_created":1378325874,"timestamp_updated":1399664519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1941903","author":{"steamid":"76561198000040299","num_games_owned":332,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":53215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32964,"last_played":1452573726},"language":"english","review":"BUY IT!!","timestamp_created":1378281901,"timestamp_updated":1378281901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2894414","author":{"steamid":"76561198014208326","num_games_owned":353,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":5273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4132,"last_played":1641593238},"language":"english","review":"One of the best PC exclusives there is.

I've been yet to find a game that can properly replicate the grim and oppressive tone this game provides in it's artstyle and gameplay philosophy, it's a game that won't try to hold your hand, if your team messes up for even a second it's game over but in a way that rarely feels cheap or like something you had no way of dealing with, your death is nine out of ten times your own fault. On top of it's laser focus gameplay the weapons and gore, while nothing state of the art or perfect are designed in such a way to give the player immediate satisfying feedback this combined with enemies having \n a focus on being heavy hitters over bullet sponges makes every bullet feel like it counts. \n\nThat being said no game is perfect and Killing Floor is no exception, while the guns are satisfying there is an overall lack of variety in what weapons are viable, this can lead to gameplay becoming potentially stale as time goes on. On top of that one of the DLC weapon packs is objectively overpowered giving you access to cheap incendiary flare pistols that do massive damage even when used off perk and the Buzzsaw Bow which gives the melee centric perk a ranged option that does massive damage with potentially INFINITE ammuntion. Additionally this game has wildly inconsistent hit boxes that only sometimes actually match up to the Specimen's actual head and is one of the few things in this game that can actually screw you over regardless of how well you're doing. Lastly this game is just plain old and while this comes with the usual issues of a limited and often times elitist remaining player base, it also comes with the issue of the game running poorly on newer hardware ( this really depends on what hardware you're running I can run it just fine but some of my friends have complained of frame drops, missing textures or just not even being able to run it at all due to an upgrade, though certain things will crash your game or cause issues no matter your hardware).\n\nIn conclusion Killing Floor is a spectacular horde shooter with satisfying gunplay, challenging gameplay and a downright evil tone. But suffers from lack of variety and old age.","timestamp_created":1378244544,"timestamp_updated":1627326653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577464818954467773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2002565","author":{"steamid":"76561198000809132","num_games_owned":767,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":12699,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5309,"last_played":1625215336},"language":"english","review":"Fun for those who loved COD Zombies!

И вот игра Killing Floor как раз из этой серии.\nСюжет игры довольно прост - ученый генетик стал проводить эксперименты по клонированию и создал армию зомби. Проведя опыты и над собой он смог стать особенно сильным, устойчивым и опасным и решил вместе со своей армией зомби захватить Великобританию. Ваша задача - уничтожить его и его армию. Действия в игре очень просты: Вас и вашу команду (если играете по сети) высаживают на захваченный участок территории и вы отбиваетесь от волн зомби. Каждая волна - это более мощная (более опасные виды зомби) атака, от которой вам необходимо отбиться. Между атаками открывается магазин - в нем вы можете купить любое необходимое вам оружие. А самая последняя волна - это тот самый ученый, которого вам необходимо убить. Самая прелесть и интерес игры в том, что есть огромное количество разного оружия и типов игрока - можно играть берсерком (атаковать оружием ближнего боя (катаны, топоры, ножи, мачете)), огнеметчиком, гранатометчиком, снайпером, медиком и техником. При использовании оружия данного типа игрока вы получаете бонусы к мощности, количеству патронов и другим характеристикам оружия и персонажа. Так же можно вместе с командой занять оборону и отбиваться от орд зомби (у игрока имеется сварочный аппарат, чтобы заварить дверь и держать оборону в помещениях). \nДвижок игры не очень тяжелый и многие компьютеры потянут эту игру. Мультиплеер и одиночная игра сделаны одинаково. В общем - играть просто, легко и интересно. Тем кто любит пристрелить кого нибудь на ночь - милости просим.","timestamp_created":1377973373,"timestamp_updated":1377973373,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6331555","author":{"steamid":"76561198063962638","num_games_owned":382,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":47472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4453,"last_played":1625951879},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor Coop de Survival Horror que tem pra PC,\nNota 10 !","timestamp_created":1377970926,"timestamp_updated":1377970926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548254609107971191","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6343822","author":{"steamid":"76561198064236237","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7832,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5149,"last_played":1584502589},"language":"english","review":"KILLER GAME!

And are not to be trusted ever.\n\nWith over 700 hundred hours logged in this game you could say I'm a fan. This is easily one of my favourite games of all time. That being said I might be a little biased. This is my kind of game, team based shooter that requires little to no communication. It can help but is not needed if everyone knows their job. There are classes in the game which each get perks for certain weapons. There is a samll learning curve. But with a \"small\" effort you can learn quickly. This is not a run and gun shooter, though it is compared with left 4 dead. It has little in common outside of zombies and co-op. Instead of running to a escape point. Like in left 4 dead. You find a defendable loction and hold out through waves of zombies. Which makes the game more about the guns than the maps. Which I prefer. Guns are pruchaesed at random  trader location on the map between waves. There are 4, 7, and 10 wave games. And a boss fight at the end with a enemy called, The Patriarch. A roid raging psycho with a rocket lancher a chain gun, and the ability to cloak himself. The game is not without it's flaws. Zombies can get stuck on the environment or in spawn points. Slowing the pace of, or all togather stopping the game. But the minor flaws are out shined by the addicting gamplay. With an almost mmo style class system requiring a balanced team to work  in harmony to achieve the oldest of goals.

Grab it while you can, lads.\n\nOkay, bad way to start off a recommendation, but whatever. If you haven't played this game yet, it's essentially a game dedicated entirely to Horde Mode. Fight waves upon waves of different types of specimen (stop calling them zombies, if you have been calling them zombies), until you come across the almighty \"father\" of these creatures, the Patriarch. Rinse and repeat on another map.\n\nWhat helps make each match different would be how everyone else plays, as there are multiple perks (classes) to choose from in the game. The more you play as these perks, the better the stats for those perks become. But be prepared to do a lot of grinding to even level up. It's not so bad in the early levels, but as you rank higher, it requires more to get to the next level. The best way to explain that is with this example: You're a level 3 Commando, and you just inflicted a total amount of 1.5 million damage with assault rifles. Congrats, but you haven't killed 2000? Stalkers, so you don't get to rank up until you kill more Stalkers. If you play the game casually like I do, it's going to feel like forever until you get into the higher levels, as a head's up. I'll let you be the judge on whether or not that kind of leveling system is good or not.\n\nIf you haven't heard yet, this game is famous (or imfamous) for its dialogue. It's so bad, but in a good way. Think of it as like a cheesy B-movie of sorts. Considering that this is an independent game and has the feeling of a B-movie anyways, I think this is okay. Even I come back to quoting some stuff, from time to time.\n\nOne thing I especially need to mention is that this game is heavily supported by the community, in terms of custom maps, mods, and even dedicated servers. Don't believe me? Check out the Steam Workshop for this game, and you'll see how big the community's support for the game is.\n\nOh yeah, did I mention this game is essentially Horde Mode? Yep, only game mode, so if you're not a fan of it, don't play this game. However, if you're alright with it, I recommend playing this game with friends. This game is meant to be for a group of six people, so you know what to do. Also, this game does tend to go on sale a lot for cheap, so to be honest, I would wait until a sale pops up before buying the game.","timestamp_created":1377663865,"timestamp_updated":1385406988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3153900","author":{"steamid":"76561198018293168","num_games_owned":765,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":10095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":621,"last_played":1656751143},"language":"english","review":"What call of duty zombies should have been.

And we were lucky that happened. \n\nUpon starting the game and getting right to the Zed killing your character is this cute looking military guy called Corporal Lewis. Watching him and the other characters \"run\" is one of the more amusing animations in this game. They kind of waddle. \n\nWhile the graphics are sorely dated at this point, it's the gameplay that keeps people coming back. Up to six squad members battle it out to kill the most Zeds to earn money to upgrade weapons. But you have to work as a team in order to make it to the boss round and win. There are a large variety of Zeds. From the small but quick Crawlers to the large and slow Bloats (think Boomer from Left 4 Dead). They all attack differently and you have to be prepared for it or you could end up dead lickity split. \n\nThere are two Zeds however that stand out. The Fleshpound (think the Tank) and the Scrake (not like the Charger but kind of close). These two are extremely powerful and take certain perks (loadouts) to kill. Then there is the boss, the Patriarch. It takes all your ammo and your squads ammo to really take him down which makes it very satisfying when you do. \n\nAnother great addition to this game were holiday events the devs would release. So in the summer they had a \"Summer Sideshow\" event a couple of times where you got new achievements and maps to unlock and circus Zeds to fight. Then there were Halloween events with their own set of achievements and maps and Halloween Zeds and lastly Christmas events.\n\nFun gameplay, has awesome holiday events that transform the enemies and locales to fit either the 4th of July, Halloween or Christmas. Plus has the villain who needs a hug the most.","timestamp_created":1376620466,"timestamp_updated":1485393250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544072985649108887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7227902","author":{"steamid":"76561198094297771","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":141,"last_played":1539452111},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito dahora","timestamp_created":1376618153,"timestamp_updated":1376618153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5663354","author":{"steamid":"76561198053732968","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":1671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1614,"last_played":1395555902},"language":"english","review":"Don't buy this game unless you like being angry and being bored.","timestamp_created":1376610126,"timestamp_updated":1376610126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499451160430908203","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6929116","author":{"steamid":"76561198079670070","num_games_owned":385,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1819,"last_played":1388515236},"language":"english","review":"Good game.

Killing Floor adds alot of varity of weapons and classes. Like if  you wanted to be a guy that blows these specimans away with a shotgun theres a class for that. And with these classes, you can level up and adding growth to the game and not just killing specimans mindlessly without getting a reward out of it. Also when you get at the very end of the waves, you have to fight a huge boss speciman and you and your teamates have to gang up on him to defeat him.
