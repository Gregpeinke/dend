The story was not my favorite but it still is well done and if you can pull symbolism out of details that seem insignificant you should be able to enjoy this game. \n\nThe main campaign while the majority of my time in this game was very Bioshock in layout and traversing it. The sky hook I felt is underutilized while the Vigors did not seem to have the same heft and synergy as they did in the first two games. The areas were different enough that you could traverse them without much assistance from the navigation button (N by default on M+K), which was a great change as the constant arrow pointing you in the right direction was less than enjoyable.\n\nClash in the Clouds I played 2 waves worth and shelved it. Its not bad from the couple of rounds but I wasn't interested in playing a wave arcade based DLC at this time.\n\nBurial at Sea 1 and 2 were fantastic fun to play and much more of a challenge compared to the main campaign. Both brought about 10 hours of playtime as well as spoilers to the main game. Highly suggest playing the main campaign first before either DLC.\n\nPlayed on Medium difficulty and Mouse and Keyboard.","timestamp_created":1589569206,"timestamp_updated":1589569206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69187025","author":{"steamid":"76561198450231382","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":440,"last_played":1647289861},"language":"thai","review":"good\n","timestamp_created":1589563235,"timestamp_updated":1589563235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69184627","author":{"steamid":"76561198067301331","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":791,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":415,"last_played":1591274659},"language":"tchinese","review":"epic game \n","timestamp_created":1589560316,"timestamp_updated":1589560316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69174322","author":{"steamid":"76561198829447910","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1589546761},"language":"schinese","review":"一直卡死md刚见到伊丽莎白 怎么搞都解决不了","timestamp_created":1589547611,"timestamp_updated":1589547611,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69173617","author":{"steamid":"76561198071332812","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5010,"last_played":1589546610},"language":"russian","review":"Без русской озвучки покупать ничего не буду","timestamp_created":1589546698,"timestamp_updated":1589546698,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.373179018497467041","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69170922","author":{"steamid":"76561198983533673","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":705,"last_played":1589542503},"language":"russian","review":"жесть","timestamp_created":1589542888,"timestamp_updated":1589542888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69168425","author":{"steamid":"76561199015664225","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":489,"last_played":1630589904},"language":"schinese","review":"good\n","timestamp_created":1589539136,"timestamp_updated":1589539136,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69166898","author":{"steamid":"76561198333773283","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1738,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1359,"last_played":1650473469},"language":"english","review":"there are some bugs that needs fixing but the game is Good i love the bioshock games so much  wish there was more i would buy it so yeah i recommend this game and the rest of bioshock games","timestamp_created":1589536737,"timestamp_updated":1589536737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69162683","author":{"steamid":"76561198968053954","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1322,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1322,"last_played":1589510345},"language":"english","review":"You know the level design and the narrative are awesome when they blend into an extraordinary experience when you find little tidbits of information (like in the first game, Atlas wife and kid name were seem in a poster in the theater as stars) that scratch the barrier of the storytelling initially provided to you just enough to make you suspicious that nothing is what it truly looks like.

My second problem is \"Why is this a Bioshock Game.\" If you argue that it is about the idea of there being a \"utopian\" city gone wrong with a prominent leader and the systemshock/bioshock plasmid mechanics, then yes I'd be fine with it being a bioshock game. The problem comes when they try to connect the 2 games to each other without explaining it all that well and it really feels out of place and again detracts from the overall experience. The vigors in this game don't feel as good as the Plasmids in Bioshock, the 2 weapon limit kinda kills some of the fun, the gun upgrade system is dumb, and the whole lose money when you die thing is a little annoying but understandable.

It just goes to show you how little they care about the gamer, not to mention the fact that we have to get stuck listening to their insulting remarks every time we lose a battle.

Also the games colour pallet matches perfectly with the art style to create a visual experience you wont find in many games let alone first person shooters.\n\nThe gun play also feels great, the guns feel responsive and most importantly fun to use. There is also a variety of weapons that i did not expect, which really was a welcome surprise, yes some guns feel like re skins but the obvious differences in each guns strengths and weaknesses really gives some tense, on the spot decision making as you pick what guns to partner up and take with you as you can only hold two guns, which may seem negative however the element of strategy it introduced when deciding on what guns to use was fun.\n\nlastly I'm going to avoid spoilers but the story is really compelling, in the beginning it seems like you can brush it off and just kind of enjoy the core gameplay, which, don't get me wrong you can, but towards the end of the game there are so many different factors that come into play, making it a really cool and complex sci-fi story that to be honest you'll have to watch a youtube video to understand, however i do recommend purchasing the burial at sea expansion as it really does add a lot to the story and makes the game feel alot more complete.\n\nNow the ugly part the criticisms, some of which are very nit picky. The main issue i feel i had with the game was, at times, it felt very repetitive, the reason i say this is at times i did feel i would come across a wave of enemies and say \"not again\", usually i can enjoy or live through wave based shooters, for example doom eternal however something in this game felt off, like the enemies just kept coming and coming, which can be easily looked past however it was one thing that did prevent me from many long sessions of playing the game.\n\nMy last little criticism would be simply the overwhelming aspect of ammo management but not particularly in a great way, the game is a high flying action game, your shooting all the time however the momentum can be broken once you lose ammo and it can bug you as a player every now and then but like my other criticism can be looked passed.\n\nOverall i really do think you should get this game if you have any sort of liking towards first persons shooters as the game is different due to the vigors (sort of magical abilities that can be used in combat) and even past that the guns feel fun and responsive so i don't see any reason to not pick this up, especially in a sale as it usually drops to £4.99 or below or £9.99 as part of the Bioshock collection so, a must have.","timestamp_created":1589403741,"timestamp_updated":1591204103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69084886","author":{"steamid":"76561198048973246","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1048,"last_played":1589400396},"language":"english","review":"This is sadly a Bioshock game in name only, as this merely happens in the same universe as the older games, though the term \"universe\", might be a slight misnomer in this case, and this game shares some elements from earlier games with different names and implementations. This game is fine for casual gamers, as this is mostly a generic fps-shooter with linear level design, but players who are looking for more action oriented games might want to steer clear from this (and no, having a hidden way to unlock hardest difficulty with Konami code doesn't make this game hardcore). I'm giving this a negative review purely because this game is a downgrade from previous games from a gameplay perspective and because this game tries too hard to be intellectual piece of art, but falls flat as infinite dissections of this game's plot have already proven.\n\nGameplay of this game is basically a regular FPS game, with powers (\"magic\") you can use against your enemies. Alternative ammo crafting from previous games is completely gone and Gene Tonics (\"Passives\") are no longer behind inventory and monetary management, but instead given at you at certain sections and you can change your passives whenever you want. You can no longer collect health and \"mana\" items so there isn't really any inventory management in this game.  Hacking minigame is also gone and replaced with one-time currency based lockpick system (ie. you use certain amount of collected lockpicks to instantly open locks). Research system is also gone as is the intense atmosphere of dark insane underwater city. The new skyhook system is kind of neat but it really only makes you overpowered. This games is also very linear in its level design, which was kind of a bummer as earlier games weren't nearly as linear as this was. Little nickpicks include following: you cannot manually save as apparently people can get stuck with manual saves (which is more of an issue with autosaves getting you stuck in a glitch), you can carry two weapons and this game is obviously designed for consoles as some menus in inventory are unintuitive to navigate with KB+M.\n\nThis game is a decent casual shooter, but a big disappointment for a sequel and for all the hype it got.","timestamp_created":1589403277,"timestamp_updated":1589403277,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555451035499572754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69084742","author":{"steamid":"76561198150438643","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1770,"last_played":1609985133},"language":"english","review":"The bioshock franchise is hands down my favourite game series period.

In that sense, it is a masterpiece. The combat is highly addictive and the visuals are great. The beautifully designed fantasy setting will compel you to explore the world with a childish fascination in everything around you. The protagonists, Dewitt, whom you play as, and Elizabeth, the young lady that appears on the game's cover-photo, are extremely well developed (in terms of characterization) and genuinely interesting. The story's immersion is unreal. I completed it in just two playthroughs since I couldn't stop playing. I sat at my desk for 6 consecutive hours, twice. \n\nEvery fan of story games should play this, if not for the story, for the combat which is arguably equally as immersive.","timestamp_created":1589257913,"timestamp_updated":1589269395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68988481","author":{"steamid":"76561198054871263","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1148,"last_played":1586669327},"language":"english","review":"Masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1589252644,"timestamp_updated":1589252644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68984420","author":{"steamid":"76561198953498250","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1589337562},"language":"schinese","review":"不知道是电脑原因还是啥，从不掉帧，但有时会突然卡死，任务管理器都开不了，只能强制关机，而且为什么，没有保存按钮？？？？？？？？？？\n","timestamp_created":1589245323,"timestamp_updated":1589245323,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68981759","author":{"steamid":"76561198801757125","num_games_owned":241,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":1015,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1015,"last_played":1538952693},"language":"spanish","review":"si, pero el uno es mejor.","timestamp_created":1589240694,"timestamp_updated":1589240694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68979685","author":{"steamid":"76561198844894210","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1036,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1006,"last_played":1589237085},"language":"schinese","review":"欧亨利结局","timestamp_created":1589236695,"timestamp_updated":1589236695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68975408","author":{"steamid":"76561198109952903","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":907,"last_played":1622118510},"language":"english","review":"Best story ever :'(","timestamp_created":1589230064,"timestamp_updated":1589230064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68970953","author":{"steamid":"76561198408295037","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1269,"last_played":1656022870},"language":"russian","review":"Моя любимая часть !
