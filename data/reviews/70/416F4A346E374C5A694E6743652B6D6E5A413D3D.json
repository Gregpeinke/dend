Next thing you know you have to crowbar yourself through a facility to find a way to escape or stop the invasion. Yes, this is the plot. Sadly there is not so much lore that you actually get told. Though the plot is very deep, especially towards the ending, you do not know exactly what is going on all the time and just follow your path clueless.\n\nGameplay\nSince Half-life runs on the source engine, you might be familiar with its controls and gameplay. The game is a nice mix between shooting stuff and solving puzzles and trying desperately to find out how to get further. Sometimes this can be extremely frustrating and I once stopped playing it for about 6 months before picking it up again. On the other hand you feel really smart when you do not get stuck for an hour. One small uncomfortable thing is switching weapons, because in order to do that you must klick to confirm your weapon switch.\n\nGraphics\nAs you already saw in the screenshots above, the game is older and thus does by far not come up with modern graphics, models, animations or other. It will not bother you, but if you are used to modern games with high end graphics you might miss many details.\n\nBugs\nOne time a gate did not open, even though it should have. It took me a while until I realised that, but the best way to solve this problem is to simply use the console command noclip and fly through it.\n\nThe game is a classic and I recommend you playing it, since his sequels are even better and when half-life 3 comes out one day and you want to play it, why not play the other ones too. Maybe do not buy it for 10€, rather think of buying it in a bundle when it is on sale.\n","timestamp_created":1479845609,"timestamp_updated":1479845609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26748322","author":{"steamid":"76561198008891983","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":79,"last_played":1437421606},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor serie de jogos, HL SZ","timestamp_created":1479830343,"timestamp_updated":1479830343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26748207","author":{"steamid":"76561198071271233","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":4033,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2288,"last_played":1650845686},"language":"turkish","review":"Oynadığım en iyi oyunlardan biri \n\nArtı Yönleri:\nDeathmatch'ı çok eğlencelidir.\nKonusu çok güzel.\nOyunun hikaye moduna kendinizi çok kaptırabilirsiniz ben bu oyunu aralıksız tek seferde hikaye modunu bitireibliyorum.\nMüzikleri fena değil.\nBaştaki tren yolculuğu <3\nGauss silahı çok hoş\n\nEksi Yönleri:\nHikaye Modu çok zor\nHikaye Modu beyin yakıyor, bulmacalar oyunda çok çok fazla.\n\nPuan: 9/10","timestamp_created":1479829996,"timestamp_updated":1479829996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498328864574432373","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26747051","author":{"steamid":"76561198175173802","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":143,"last_played":1423622628},"language":"turkish","review":"çocukluğum :)","timestamp_created":1479825145,"timestamp_updated":1479825145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26745051","author":{"steamid":"76561198075779723","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":604,"last_played":1479763678},"language":"russian","review":"Классика вечна...","timestamp_created":1479814775,"timestamp_updated":1479814775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26740977","author":{"steamid":"76561198141186972","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2461,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":1431,"last_played":1660019120},"language":"english","review":"After 20 years, Half-Life is still worth the money.

Non ci sarebbe bisogno di aggiungere altro. Pietra miliare della storia videoludica; best VG evah, ecc, ecc... Nessuno lo mette in dubbio. Ma recuperarlo oggi? Cosa significa per un gamer di oggi approcciarsi a questo titolo? Dirò la mia, trovandomi proprio in quella fase mistica della vita in cui si decide di recuperare tutto il vecchiume \"importante\" (saghe storiche come Half-life, Deus ex, Final fantasy, ecc) anziché dedicarsi a titoli anonimi odierni. Sottolineo quindi come \"l'effetto girella\" sia del tutto assente, non avendolo mai giocato in passato in nessuna forma.\n\n\n- comparto tecnico (ovviamente) deludente\n- storytelling debole (si lo so, all'epoca era avanti anni luce, oggi è arcaico. #stacce)\n- gameplay meh\n- puzzle e platform un po' troppo predominanti e senza una vera \"scintilla\"\n- nemici sicuramente interessanti, ma non abbastanza\n- boss fight ridicola\n- noia, noia, noia... \n\n\nSi salva, ovviamente, la storia in sé che, lo si capisce già da questo primo capitolo, è davvero intrigante, ed essendomi già spoilerato qualcosa dei titoli successivi ne ho avuto la conferma. Il modo in cui viene raccontata però è davvero troppo deludente oggi, sorry\n\n\nQuindi lo sconsiglierei? Difficile rispondere a questa domanda. Intendiamoci: il gioco in sé è una palla. Vi romperete le balle a portarlo avanti (personalmente  l'ho finito in 24 ore, davvero tante IMHO, di cui almeno 15 di noia) e sarete probabilmente tentati dal dropparlo o guardarvi semplicemente un gameplay sul tubo. Tuttavia è innegabile come abbia realmente fatto la storia, e la trama su cui è basato è sicuramente valida e meritevole di spenderci del tempo. Se non altro perchè credo l'unico modo per godersi TUTTA la storia di Half-life sia cominciare necessariamente da questo. Io ho deciso di farlo, e sono sicuro che alla fine di questo lungo percorso (HL, HL Opposing force, HL Blue shift, HL2, HL2 ep1 ed ep2) sarò contento di non essermi tirato indietro. \n\nMa se siete dell'idea che un videogame debba prima di tutto divertirvi... beh, probabilmente sarà  molto meglio girare al largo. O forse partire da HL2 e recuperare quei pezzi di trama mancanti su Wikipedia)\n\n\n--------\n* aggiungo questa postilla per chiarire un concetto importante: HL non è palloso perchè è vecchio.

Die KI ist recht gut. Es gibt kleine, schnelle, starke, gut geschützte und fiese Gegner. Fies, weil einige aus dem Nichts spwanen. Teils technisch bedingt, teils vermutlich storytechnisch im Rahmen des \"erlaubten\", aber allzuoft wird man einfach beim ersten mal davon überrascht, von wo man unter Beschuss genommen wird. Die Waffen, mit denen man sich wehren kann, sind vielfältig und haben sogar oft Primär- und Sekundärfeuer, was einem das Leben erleichtert. Manchmal sollte man richtig tricky vorgehen und manche Gegner nicht frontal angreifen. Eine geeignete Lösung einer brenzligen Situation ist nicht immer leicht erkennbar.\n\nDas Tempo ist hoch, unser Held, Gordon Freeman, rennt immer (es sei denn, man befiehlt ihm, langsam zu laufen), wesewegen man schnell vorankommt, ohne dass einem ein Finger wehtun muss. Die Steuerung ist fast hervorragend. Die Bewegungsrichtung wird mit der Maus vorgegeben, wie es in modernen Spielen üblich ist. Schlecht finde ich, dass Gordon sich bewegt, als liefe er auf Eis, d.h. er schlittert immer noch etwas weiter, obwohl die Taste schon losgelassen wurde. Eine exakte Steuerung, z.B. bei Sprüngen, die in manchen Passagen nötig wäre, ist so erschwert. Zudem gibt es haklige Situationen, besonders beim Überwinden halbhoher Hindernisse, wo man oft mehrere Versuche braucht, bis es klappt.\n\nNeben der Aufgabe, Gegner zu beseitigen, muss man auch noch Knöpfe drücken, Kisten schieben, Portale in der richtigen Reihenfolge betreten, u.ä. Die Rätsel sind nicht sonderlich schwer, aber immerhin zeigen sie, dass Half-Life kein reiner Shooter sein will, sondern auch etwas Adventure enthält.\n\nEine Geschichte gibt es auch. OK, sie ist nicht so tiefgründig, aber immerhin ein Anfang (in die richtige Richtung). Wir erfahren davon in geskripteten Sequenzen (keine Cutscenes), in denen Wissenschaftler mit uns reden.\n\nDie Grafik ist (aus heutiger Sicht) schlicht, aber nicht schlecht. Die Anzahl der Polygone ist halt gering und die Texturen verschwommen. Mehr war halt damals nicht drin. Dem Shooter-Erlebnis tut es aber keinen Abbruch.\n\nIch fand 2/3 des Spiels sehr unterhaltsam. Die Level und die Aufgaben waren abwechslungsreich. Ab dem Lamda-Kern fand ich den Schwierigkeitsgrad aber zu hoch. Ein falscher Schritt genügt dann oft schon, um in einen Abgrund zu stürzen, während Horden von Aliens einen attackieren. Manche würden sagen, da wird es erst richtig interessant und trennt die Könner (wie sie es sind) von dem einfachen Spieler-Volk. Ich gehöre wohl zu letzterem, obwohl ich viele andere FPS (Unreal, Crysis, etc.) durchspielen konnte.\n\nDas macht das Spiel nicht automatisch schlecht, mir wäre es aber lieber gewesen, wenn die Schwierigkeit nicht ganz so hoch getrieben worden wäre.\n\nNicht zu vergessen ist das hervorragende Speichersystem mit automatischem Speichern an Kontrollpunkten, Quicksave und explizitem Speichern. So kann man immer auf ältere Speicherpunkte zurückgreifen, wenn man nicht weiterkommt.\n\nSehr gut ist auch (nicht immer selbstverständlich), dass man die Tasten umbelegen kann.\n\nPro & Contra:\n\n+ Sehr gutes FPS-Erlebnis\n+ (Heute noch) akzeptable Grafik\n+ Gutes Speichersystem\n+ Fast sehr gute Steuerung\n\n- Es wird zum Ende hin sehr (zu?) schwer\n- Die Bewegung ist wie auf einer Eisbahn (man gleitet nach)\n\nWertung: 08/10\n\nEin guter FPS, ein Klassiker, ein Meilenstein, dessen Schwierigkeitsgrad ich zum Ende hin als zu hoch empfand, wesewegen ich ihm nicht alle 10 Punkte gebe, aber dennoch auf jeden Fall empfehlen kann. Selbst heute noch macht Half-Life viel Spaß.\n\n[i]Der Nachfolger Half-Life 2 (Rezension [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198063825413/recommended/220]hier[/url]) hat mir noch besser gefallen.[/i]","timestamp_created":1479131389,"timestamp_updated":1479944534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.465282708406448364","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26599797","author":{"steamid":"76561198147329096","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":950,"last_played":1653590701},"language":"english","review":"The best FPS! awesome story and gameplay.","timestamp_created":1479131324,"timestamp_updated":1479131324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26598449","author":{"steamid":"76561198182274299","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1063,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1032,"last_played":1585462035},"language":"english","review":"9.5/10 would get scared crapless by headcrab in air vent again\n\nI love this game. You are in control of the character the entire time, even in the so called \"cutscenes\". Ok, so the graphichs and shooting mechanics have aged a bit. But compared to the sequel, I'd probably say that I enjoyed this one more. The atmosphere is great and believable.

Plus without this game you wouldn't be praying to lord Gaben 20 times a day.\n\nOf course their are a few things wrong.
