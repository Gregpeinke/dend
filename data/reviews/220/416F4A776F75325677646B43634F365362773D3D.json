Set the bar for FPS for a generation or two. Often feels like Matrix-type action. \n\n- Update: There are a lot of great mods... the original Substance v0.84 is a diehard favorite for me, I always try to emulate the feel that weapon-set gave...but there are many great alternatives I discuss below. 'Synergy' is a good favorite option lately. \n\n- Lots of fun and amusing moments, good storytelling through a game. The level design and puzzles are really great. \n\n- Half Life 2: Update is a free mod/update for the game that works really well and has all the achievements and it really does make the graphics look a good deal better, AI seems smoother too sometimes, definitely improves the experience, making the game more immersive, and suspension of disbelief alot more tolerable, improving the story and gameplay. The lighting and reflections are great and much more realistic. \n\n- Deathmatch Tactical 1.2 is an awesome frigin' mod with the best substance weapons, and bullet time, it's freaking great, you can switch between tactical and substance modes, spawn all the weapons/ammo without using impulse_101, spawn extra enemies, sniper and crossbow have scopes, and the combine and blood effects look awesome. \n\n- Garry's Mod automatically loads Half-Life 2 maps if you have HL2 installed, so you can play through the entire campaign co-op, or with a portal gun, custom weapons, etc. etc. to your hearts content. \n\n- Cinematic Mod is another awesome mod, and all these mods have their own shortcuts by the way, meaning you can have all these versions of the game to play whenever you want and they wont interfere with each other. Cinematic mod also upgrades the graphics and changes the way the weapons look and act in some cool ways. Deathmatch Tactical and CM both have aiming down the sights for example. CM enables many changes that you can customize, including harder difficulty (always lethal headshots). \n\n- All the HL2 games and Black Mesa have good soundtracks and great memorable gameplay moments that are epic to behold the first time and subsequent times after. \n\nI definitely recommend this game. If you've never seen, heard of, or played this game, buy it and play it now!!! And I would recommend playing Half Life 2: Update!\n\nI hope my review helped inform and give ideas to others as to the best ways to experience this game of legends.","timestamp_created":1484291205,"timestamp_updated":1574726858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29218392","author":{"steamid":"76561198273386383","num_games_owned":322,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":3440,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":626,"last_played":1629898750},"language":"english","review":"Amazing","timestamp_created":1484289871,"timestamp_updated":1484289871,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29218115","author":{"steamid":"76561198294859998","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":404,"last_played":1656305668},"language":"russian","review":"интелект самый лучший лучшая игра ин тзе ворлд всё очень красива и класна динамический сюжет","timestamp_created":1484288297,"timestamp_updated":1552311885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29216761","author":{"steamid":"76561198119478816","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":309,"last_played":1575133974},"language":"english","review":"Neat","timestamp_created":1484280892,"timestamp_updated":1484280892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29215580","author":{"steamid":"76561198018092143","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1589304449},"language":"english","review":"cool","timestamp_created":1484274613,"timestamp_updated":1484274613,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29211741","author":{"steamid":"76561198286502889","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":3729,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1697,"last_played":1655753745},"language":"brazilian","review":"Pra mim, um dos melhores jogos de fps com historia que marcou minha infância :)","timestamp_created":1484256456,"timestamp_updated":1543147754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29209623","author":{"steamid":"76561198010315744","num_games_owned":1106,"num_reviews":617,"playtime_forever":116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":108,"last_played":1493590850},"language":"english","review":"One of my top 3 fps games.  \n\nGreat atmosphere,  great story and characters.","timestamp_created":1484249260,"timestamp_updated":1486865076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.441784977912902832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29207436","author":{"steamid":"76561198354112691","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1734,"last_played":1593801307},"language":"russian","review":"1)Сюжет.

of the greatest tech demos ever made 10/10\n\nBut seriously, this game was revolutionary on its release and I still feel like nothing else has come close to it over a decade later. For those that missed this when it first came out, Half-Life 2 is basically why we have realistic physics, facial expressions, environmental lighting, and 3D sound. They pioneered so many different technological breakthroughs and set the bar for what all video games, let alone FPS's, could be. \n\nNot only is it the technological marvel of its time but it is also unrivaled in terms of gameplay. There is so much variety that seamlessly integrates with what you are doing in the story. It's hard to even know where to begin when talking about how great the gameplay is. One minute you're committing ant-lion genocide and the next you are commanding them to slay anything that isn't you. You could be solving a slow meticulous puzzle one second and then suddenly have to deal with a wave of man-hacks. All this variety, cohesion, and suspense make for a truly gripping experience that is impossible to put down. \n\nIf I had to have a complaint it would be that a lot of the story is a mystery until you dig deeper into the lore of Half-Life. \"What are these combine things I'm killing and why do they look like humans if they are aliens???\" are questions I had so I know other people have had them as well. There are logical explanations for everything but most of it is merely hinted at in the game. Some very important details about the game such as the 'Seven Hour War' are footnotes in the game that could easily be missed by an unexplorative player. Even someone like me that's played the game countless times had to look up videos explaining very basic things about the games story. This is more of a nitpick than a deal breaker but it's the one flaw I feel the game has. \n\nSome highlights of the game are the way it feels extremely vast. Escaping from City 17 and driving miles away only to return later felt right. It felt like I took the long road and I had to work to get where I went. It felt like I had left the City and moved a long way away to the outskirts of town and when I came back to City 17 via detour it still felt just as believable. This is one of the games greatest strengths. Its sheer size is massive and yet the scale is so believable because you feel so immersed in the game. I feel like my life is in danger when I'm several hundred feet up in the air on a wobbly bridge because if I fall off I fall a very long way before going splat. I feel like I just drove many miles out of the way because I did. I wasn't magically teleported anywhere (*cough*...you know what I mean). If I ended up some place, it's because I fought tooth and nail to get where I was. This makes the game feel extremely real in ways that most games don't. Add that to the fact that there are no cutscenes that break this immersion and you have yourself a hell of an intense experience. \n\nThis game has truly stood the test of time. It still feels fresh and fun so many years later and doesn't seem nearly as dated as its (amazing) predecessor. There are few games that I can just sit down and play nonstop without loosing interest. It's very rare that a game will glue me to the edge of my chair the way HL2 does. This is why I consider it to be one of the greatest video games of all time...even if you have no clue what just happened after you beat it.","timestamp_created":1484137721,"timestamp_updated":1484384762,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502380967140197754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29181675","author":{"steamid":"76561198198771013","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":977,"last_played":1554022743},"language":"koreana","review":"명작게임","timestamp_created":1484137598,"timestamp_updated":1484137598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29178312","author":{"steamid":"76561198019199835","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1151,"last_played":1484121842},"language":"english","review":"A pesar de jugarlo varias veces aun me sigue gustando ! \n\n\nPara disfrutarlo al maximo, miren las curiosidades en Youtube!","timestamp_created":1484121422,"timestamp_updated":1484121422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29177784","author":{"steamid":"76561198098079118","num_games_owned":272,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1586184664},"language":"schinese","review":"[spoiler] 玩一个小时，难受一天[/spoiler]\n","timestamp_created":1484118054,"timestamp_updated":1484118054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29177507","author":{"steamid":"76561198140488370","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":196,"playtime_forever":635,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":620,"last_played":1510863731},"language":"german","review":"Das ist ein geiles spiel","timestamp_created":1484116342,"timestamp_updated":1484116342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.46875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29176978","author":{"steamid":"76561198318107990","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":992,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":97,"last_played":1544013355},"language":"spanish","review":"Que mas hay que decir de este titulo que no se halla dicho, simplemente genial\n","timestamp_created":1484112845,"timestamp_updated":1484112845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499375790357589722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29173898","author":{"steamid":"76561198332074745","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1768,"last_played":1587341399},"language":"english","review":"very good game u know good game","timestamp_created":1484096766,"timestamp_updated":1484096766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.46875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29173389","author":{"steamid":"76561198292743289","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1575381170},"language":"french","review":"Tres bon jeux a quand hl3 ?","timestamp_created":1484094523,"timestamp_updated":1484094523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29173050","author":{"steamid":"76561198119573975","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":881,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":840,"last_played":1486234777},"language":"english","review":"It's not just my favorite FPS or Valve game of all time, but it's my true #1 favorite game of all time!
