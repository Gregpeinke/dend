Voici mon avis :\n\nAu niveau des graphismes, techniquement c'est un peut mieux que le premier épisode des aventures de Chell, on voit que le moteur de Valve : le Source Engine, à été poussé au maximum de ces capacités malgré son grand âge (Il a plus 9 ans l'animal). Sinon pour les environnement c'est plutôt réussi, les différent endroit visité sont cohérent et immersif. \nLa jouabilité quand a elle il n'y a rien a dire c'est parfait, c'est simple a prendre en main, et les nouveauté au fil du jeu sont là pour qu'on ne se lasse pas du principe de base.\nParlons durée de vie, sachant que Portal ce fini en 7h de jeu, Portal 2 nous offre le triple du temps qu'offrer son petit frére ce qui nous donne environ 21h de jeu rien que pour la campagne solo. Ceci est dû aux énigmes qui se corse au fur et à mesure de l'aventure mais aussi aux différents dialogues entre les différents personnages du jeu qui sont marrants a voir comme a écouter. En plus, il y a un mode coop excellentissime et un éditeur de salle qui permet de prolonger le plaisir du jeu a l'infini.\nLes musiques sont excellente, elle colle parfaitement a l'ambiance du jeu. Même choses pour les doublages en VF qui sont trés bien réalisé.\nPortal 2 c'est aussi un scénario sympathique qui permet d'en connaitre un peut plus sur l'univers du précédent épisode et quelques rebondissement sont là pour nous surprendre tout au long de l'aventure. Un jeu tout public qui fera en rêver plus d'un !\n\nPetit parenthése : Pour plus de compréhension avec les différents clins d'oeils que nous offre ce jeu, je vous propose de jouer a Half-Life 1 et 2 mais aussi au premier épisode de Portal si cela n'est pas déja fait.","timestamp_created":1375097007,"timestamp_updated":1375097007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7212974","author":{"steamid":"76561198093115854","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":514,"last_played":1398277014},"language":"spanish","review":"Cake 2!
