It’s a strong start to the game, as opposed to delving deep beneath the ocean and exploring an abandoned and ruined utopia as you did in the original, you now ascend above the clouds to a bustling city basking in golden sunlight. [/b]\n\n[h2] Story [/h2]\nYou play as protagonist Booker DeWitt, a former agent and soldier. Booker has run into hard times and has run up a huge gambling debt. He’s been offered a lifeline to wipe out the debt which involves travelling to Columbia to bring back a mysterious young woman named Elizabeth. She’s been locked in a tower for nearly her whole life by Comstock who refers to her as “The Lamb”.\n\nThis is no simple boy-rescues-girl yarn. as the tale develops it dabbles with religion, the contradictions of revolutions, American self-image, racial segregation and some head-spinning metaphysics. The story doesn’t always deliver on the ambition but the result is one of the most intelligent stories ever to grace a game.\n\n[h2] Gameplay [/h2]\n\nFor much of the game you’ll be accompanied by Elizabeth. She doesn’t carry a gun but she does perform a vital support role by digging up health packs and vigor-restoring salts in the heat of the battles to fling your way if you want them (which you will).\n\nAt first, gun-fights can feel a little clunky, especially with the weaker weapons initially offered, but this decreases with time — and once new weapons are unlocked and upgraded, the sense of damage each offers is greatly enhanced. It’s vigors that offer the most fun. Relying on a supply of salts, they are collectible abilities that unlock special powers and aids for the player. once you're into 3-4 hours of game, overall the combat is tight and besides some elements which i won't spoil for you, it's gonna be little bit repetitive.\nArguably, the game’s biggest weakness is its linearity. With a world this expansive and rich, the lack of exploration possibilities and a progression system feels somewhat disappointing.\n\n[h2] Verdict [/h2]\n\n[b]Bioshock Infinite’s imaginative setting, clever story and rapid-fire action is a near perfect combo. Its tale might, at points, fail to deliver on its ambition but even at its worst it is 10 times better than average game.[/b]\n\n[b]Overall, Bioshock Infinite isn't just a great addition to the FPS genre but gaming as a whole, raising the bar for story telling in video game and making characters that will be remembered for a long time. Bioshock Infinite will be remembered as one of 2013's strongest games and if you're reading this and haven't yet given it a try I would highly recommend you to do so.[/b]\n\n[h1] My Ratings : 9.5/10 [/h1]","timestamp_created":1610527673,"timestamp_updated":1610527744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511111080646514893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84599696","author":{"steamid":"76561198145768013","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1610442848},"language":"schinese","review":"针不戳","timestamp_created":1610526700,"timestamp_updated":1610526700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84599234","author":{"steamid":"76561198151649951","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1610525797},"language":"schinese","review":"受不了了，老是有崩溃闪退，想玩下去，结果一个崩溃就搞得我要注销或者重启一次电脑，太难受了","timestamp_created":1610525957,"timestamp_updated":1610525957,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576638400554656982","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84596499","author":{"steamid":"76561198973107512","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46,"last_played":1636038085},"language":"schinese","review":"这是一部优异的游戏，初次见到它时，我为它的画面感到困惑，画风像是老游戏，但画面细腻。战斗略微无聊，但是，当我前去拯救我的安娜时，我只在乎那个少女，我爱安娜。剧情优秀，结局优秀，这是我的信仰。","timestamp_created":1610521104,"timestamp_updated":1610521104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84592444","author":{"steamid":"76561198821612064","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":109,"playtime_forever":1301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1301,"last_played":1572679347},"language":"schinese","review":"画风很特别的一款射击游戏，玩法一般般，主要是看风景以及剧情","timestamp_created":1610513807,"timestamp_updated":1610513807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84588295","author":{"steamid":"76561198140839619","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":641,"last_played":1609567864},"language":"koreana","review":"영화 한 편 다 본 기분임","timestamp_created":1610506970,"timestamp_updated":1610506970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84583770","author":{"steamid":"76561198091229361","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2193,"last_played":1610920314},"language":"english","review":"No quería dejar reseña, pero tuve que hacerlo para dejarle un pulgar arriba.

Oyunu 2014 senesinde PS3 versiyonunu alıp 2 kere Hard zorluğunda bitirmiştim. 2015'te masaüstü biligisayarımı alırken indirimlerden kapmıştım ilk 2 oyun ile beraber ve PC platformunda da Hard zorluğunda bitirdim. Oynanış olarak çeşitlilik bol, grafikler güzel, atmosfer HARİKA , hikaye güzel ve beyin yakma garantili. Ana hikaye kadar arka planda baya derin bir hikaye var oyunu bitirdikten sonra araştırmanızı öneririm spoiler olmaması için yazmıyorum buraya. Season Pass'in içinde Burial at the Sea ve Clash in the Clouds içerikleri var. Bu içeriklerden ilki olan Burial at the Sea eklentisinde ilk iki oyunda bolca gezdiğimiz Rapture Şehrine geri dönüyoruz. Burial at the Sea bir ve iki olmak üzere iki bölüme ayrılmış haldedir iki bölümde Season Pass içinde mevcuttur.

I'm ready.\" 我知道，我准备好了\nBooker: \"Are you sure?\" 你确定吗\nEliz:\"Yes. \" 我确定\n\n这和布克在为了伊丽莎白牺牲前的对话一模一样：\n\nEliz:\"Booker, are you sure this is what you want.\" 布克，你确定这是你想要的吗\nBooker: \"Yes, this is the only way to undo what I have done to you.\" 我确定，这是能够补偿我对你所做的事的唯一办法。\n\n这样有意为之的对话，以及整个海葬2里伊丽莎白都是在幻想的布克的引导下前进的种种设置，都是在告诉玩家：伊丽莎白做出这样的选择，是因为布克。而布克在《无限》里的牺牲，不是毫无意义的，也不是一种逃避。他认为自己的罪孽深重，不是简简单单的“解决问题”就能赎清的。而他这种想法，也深深的烙印在了自己的女儿身上。\n\n[spoiler] [b] 淹死布克的不是游戏里的伊丽莎白！她脖子上没有挂饰！ [/b][/spoiler]\n\n海葬二里伊丽莎白对幻想的布克的态度是最能解释这一点的。她从一开始讥讽布克，到电梯里对布克的怀念，再到最后承认自己离不开布克，并不是她态度上产生了转变，而是她逐渐认识到自己藏在内心深处的对父亲情感的过程。伊丽莎白在无限剧情结束后，以为自己是憎恨父亲的，因为两个世界的父亲给她带来了极大的伤害。她认为布克和Comstock都是罪人。这点可以从无限结尾里伊丽莎白的表情还有语气看出来（当然还有Ken Levine在采访里也是这么说的）\n在布克进门前她还是迟疑了。海葬一结束后，她意识到自己为了自己目的而牺牲了Sally，就像Comstock夺取了她的童年，布克卖走了她来还债一样。她是气愤的，因为她最不想成为的人就是她的父亲。而在她在拯救Sally的过程中，她逐渐理解了布克的感受，也渐渐接受了他对自己带来的影响。她意识到自己不仅早就原谅了布克，而且还接受了他对“救赎”的价值观。布克为了赎清对她的罪孽而牺牲了，如今她全盘接受了她父亲的做法，也走上了父亲的道路，牺牲自己去赎清自己对Sally犯下的错。对我这种玩家来言，这是温暖的，但是也是悲伤的。因为这条路的终点对伊丽莎白来说只有死亡。但是伊丽莎白还是义无反顾的走进去了。\n\n就是这样，DLC1+2和无限的本体让布克和伊丽莎白两个人物的塑造形成了一个循环。她父亲是伤害伊丽莎白的人，是关心伊丽莎白的人，是拯救伊丽莎白的人，也是塑造了伊丽莎白的人。所以伊丽莎白在电梯里说：\n\nElizabeth：\"Booker, I miss you. You were the only one who ever...you were my only friend.” 布克我想你，你是唯一一个对我···你是我唯一的朋友。\n\n她想概括布克对她做的事情，但是她概括不出来。所以她只能用“朋友”这个词来形容布克。在孤独和恐惧下，她终于拥抱了自己的情感，接受了在她内心深处，她最关心的，影响她最深的人就是布克的事实。这样看来，在海葬里伊丽莎白一直拒绝管布克叫父亲也不难理解了。在她眼里，她憎恨的人是她的父亲，而她爱的是布克。Ken说“海葬二对玩家来说像是一封情书”，我大概也能理解了。布克和伊丽莎白之间复杂而令人痛心的关系，让这个游戏超越了游戏，成为了一件文学作品。\n\n可能在海葬一里，伊丽莎白这么坚持的邀请“布克”跳舞，只是为了圆她在海滩上未曾实现的一个心愿吧。\n\n-----\n\nKen Levine真的是难得一遇的奇才，他的故事是属于只有你去体验了才能理解的，也大概是为什么他在电影界反而碌碌无为吧。这个游戏最大的错就是它是一款游戏。它的剧本单独提出来是足以让任何评论家写上几万字的解析的。只可惜游戏是面向所有人的，它没有《李尔王》和《麦克白》的高贵，也没有文学的魄力让自己的观众坐下来静静思考。所以认为编剧故意喂屎，为什么伊丽莎白明知道会死却还要重返销魂城的人，我只能恳求你们，认真的读一下这个故事吧。\n\n\n----------DLC通关前评测（现在对故事的看法已经大不相同了，但是没删留个纪念吧）------------\n \n很不能接受本体的结局。并不是说这个结局多么糟糕。作为一款游戏，这个结局的目的是给玩家留下深刻的印象，而它确实做到了。一个能让玩家接受的结局很可能就像迪士尼电影似的看够即忘。然而我还是得说说这个结局价值观的冲突之处：\n\n如果说命运给带来了曲折，一个没有重新选择能力的人会选择接受他的命运，把希望放在未来。对我们平常人来说，如果说另一个世界的布克给另一个世界的伊丽莎白带来了痛苦，起码这个世界的布克能陪着另一个世界的伊丽莎白在巴黎共度余生。痛苦随着时间只会变成人生中的一部分而已。\n\n整个无限的剧情就是卖掉女儿的布克杀出天空城救出自己女儿----一个赎罪(redemption)的故事。然而玩家控制的布克，唯一成功的布克，居然选择了自杀。这让我不能苟同：整个无限的剧情在结尾前是布克解决问题，救赎自己的过程。本体的结局通过平行世界的悖论杀死了布克，整个天空城不会出现，伊丽莎白不会出现，布克也不会卖女儿，只留下布克和安娜还在一起的世界。看似完美的解决了问题，然而事实上问题根本就没有出现。我不敢苟同Ken对人生的看法。如果遇到问题的解决办法是让问题消失，这不是一种逃避吗？If there's no sin then how do you call it a redemption?\n\n在布克杀死Comstock，解放伊丽莎白那一瞬间，这个世界的他已经赎清了自己的罪孽：自己经历了苦难救出了女儿，而Comstock也为自己的罪过付出了代价。然而Ken把平行世界的理念强行揉进了玩家的价值观里：为什么其他所有没有成功的布克，所有变成Comstock的布克的罪过需要由这个已经赎清自己罪过的布克来承担呢？为什么伊丽莎白宁愿保证所有的自己消失和一路照顾自己的布克死亡也不愿意去巴黎看一眼呢？伊丽莎白一句：“还有其他Comstock在其他上百万的宇宙里活着”，否定了玩家在游戏里做的一切努力。即使伊丽莎白和布克了解多元宇宙的存在，但是在现实生活中的玩家可遇不到这东西，你要如何说服玩家让玩家认同布克自杀让全宇宙的Comstock和伊丽莎白都消失才是完成了救赎呢 [spoiler] 这甚至和《圣经》里对赎罪的定义都是冲突的 [/spoiler]？假如说我跟你说你现在自杀可以拯救其他多元宇宙里的70亿人，你有多大可能会去做呢？\n\n伊丽莎白的转折也稍显突兀。如果说是后半段手术的折磨把她变成了一心只想复仇Comstock的人，这个转变在玩家的体验里是被完全跳过了的。唯一的挽留就是在开门前主世界的伊丽莎白问：Booker, are you sure this is what you want? 我认为Ken在写剧本的时候绝对应该在开门之前这一段多下点笔墨，不应该让伊丽莎白就这样放一路陪伴自己的布克就这么走向自己的死亡，起码应该多说两句话吧？虽然陪伴玩家的伊丽莎白并没有忍心亲手杀死布克，不过脖子上没有挂针的细节完全不足以支撑起伊丽莎白情感的冲突。\n\n同是13年的作品，美末1的结局就更能让我感同身受。乔尔怪罪自己造成了女儿的死，于是他费尽万苦保护了艾莉，救赎了自己。即使艾莉的死有可能拯救全人类，对他而言也是毫无意义。带着私心说，我想要的结局是，布克在伊丽莎白问他：Are you sure this is what you want? 的时候布克应该收回开门的手说：What happened happened, what's important is right now.\n\n至于其他世界线，关我屁事。","timestamp_created":1610426938,"timestamp_updated":1632508094,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":159,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.90217822790145874","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84530215","author":{"steamid":"76561198326617701","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":626,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":626,"last_played":1590517722},"language":"koreana","review":"자~ 바이오쇼크 를! 한판~만 할거에요 뽈롱","timestamp_created":1610423743,"timestamp_updated":1610423743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84528990","author":{"steamid":"76561199023692508","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":847,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":842,"last_played":1610421569},"language":"brazilian","review":"joi","timestamp_created":1610421502,"timestamp_updated":1610421502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84527191","author":{"steamid":"76561198130586003","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":898,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":834,"last_played":1610729696},"language":"thai","review":"เกมเพลย์ไม่ง่ายมาก แต่เนื้อเรื่องสนุก การเล่าเรื่องและดำเนินเรื่องดีแนะนำ","timestamp_created":1610418287,"timestamp_updated":1610418287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84526917","author":{"steamid":"76561197965149345","num_games_owned":482,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1281,"last_played":1610321654},"language":"english","review":"An amazing game with very good atmosphere and fun combat.

Und zwar vom ersten Teil an.\n\nAuch wenn Infinite nicht mehr tief unter dem Meeresspiegel in der Unterwassermetropole des wahr gewordenen Wahnsinns namens Rapture spielt, sondern - genau entgegen gesetzt - hoch oben über den Wolken in einer fliegenden Stadt namens \"Columbia\", mangelt es dem dritten Ableger weder an einer eigenständigen Identität, noch am gewohnten \"Wahnsinn\" und einer Detailverliebtheit, die das ganze Universum ausbaut und elegant abrundet.\n\nAnders als in den Teilen zuvor (1960 und 1968) findet man sich in Infinite im Jahre 1912 wieder - hier sind wir als Protagonist Booker DeWitt unterwegs zu einem Leuchtturm, von dem es aus in die Luftstadt Columbia geht, mit dem Auftrag ein Mädchen namens Elizabeth zu retten, um durch ihr Aushändigen an den ominösen Auftraggeber eine \"alte Schuld zu begleichen\" - was auch immer dies bedeuten mag. Anders als in Rapture erleben wir Columbia fast ausschließlich in hellen, sonnen- und farbreichen Farbtönen und haben immer mal wieder Passagen, wo wir uns in einer lebendigen NPC-Welt wieder finden (, die teilweise auch durch unsere Taten gestört und leer gefegt werden kann, wenn wir gemein zu bestimmten Leuten sind). Aber gerade der Anfang, der mit dem Leuchtturm zunächst einen Einklang zur Vermischung mit dem Rapture-Universum anschlägt, dann aber in eine ausführliche Walking-Simulator-Vorstellung der neuen Welt mündet, überzeugt indem das Spiel sich Zeit nimmt, um die Welt auf- und auszubauen. Wir lernen religiöse Fanatiker kennen - allen voran den merkwürdig-bedrohlichen Prediger Comstock und bald die wundervolle Elizabeth, die uns dann fortan begleitet und selbst eine kleine Selbstfindungsreise durchmacht. Besonders cool ist, dass Elizabeth sogenannte Risse erschaffen kann - Portale in oder Objekte aus einer anderen Welt herbeischwören. Und nicht nur das: Auch hilft sie uns, indem sie uns Mana und Munition sowie Geld zuwirft - gerade in brenzligen Situationen, wenn uns jene Ressourcen knapp werden. Denn anders als in den ersten beiden Teilen bedient sich Infinite der modernen \"2 Weapons at the same time only\"-Mechanik, sodass wir nicht mehr den wütenden Rambo mimen können, sondern immer abwägen müssen welche Waffenkombi gerade die beste ist. Alternativ geht's - wie auch schon in den Vorgängern - darum die Plasmide (hier einfach nur \"Kräfte\") taktisch gut einzusetzen. Bekanntermaßen übernehmen wir Mensch und Maschine, sodass sie uns im Kampf unterstützen; setzen Feinde oder Gewässer unter Strom; stürmen Gegner fort; jagen Krähenschwärme auf sie oder legen Brandfallen. Besonders das Design der Kräfte-Trinkflaschen ist absolut originell.\n\nAnsonsten können wir neuerdings auch mit einem Skyhook an Frachthaken oder Skylanes springen und dort Luftangriffe starten, höher gelegene Orte erreichen oder uns einen Flucht- bzw. Stellungswechselvorteil verschaffen. Egal wie hoch Booker normalerweise springen könnte - der Skyhook verschafft ihm fast übermenschliche Kräfte. Das tut dem Spielspaß aber keinen Abbruch. Denn wie immer geht's hier nicht nur ums Kämpfen, bei dem wir generell viele Ansätze (auch das Schleichen) haben, sondern auch um die Entdeckung der Umgebung an sich. Lockpicks, Skillverbesserungstränke, Audioaufnahmen (erneut eines der großen Highlights) sowie einfach nur jede Menge Zaster = wer genau hinschaut, wird IMMER belohnt.\nCool sind aber auch die neuen Kleidungsstücke, die uns Zusatzboni ermöglichen und jederzeit ausgetauscht werden können sowie die Tatsache, dass wir Kräfte und Waffen durch Geld aufwerten können (anstatt durch feste Upgradestationen). \n\nUnd dass Elizabeth als Helferchen nie Schaden nimmt und wir uns nicht ständig genervt um sie kümmern müssen, verdient eine separate Erwähnung in einem einzelnen Absatz. Dies ist kein NPC-could-die-all-the-time-Escort-Game - Gott sei Dank!\n\nDie Hauptkampagne ist lang, super interessant, wird nie langweilig, beinhaltet stets spannende Orte, sieht heute noch sehr gut aus und spielt sich hervorragend - und natürlich bekommen Fans der Reihe wieder wie in Teil 1 ihren Mindfuck am Ende - denn hier ist wieder Irrational Games aka Grandmaster Ken Levine am Zug.\nWer A sagt, muss auch [u]Seebestattung[/u] sagen: Denn wer mit der Hauptkampagne durch ist, [b]muss[/b] unbedingt die Seebestattungs-DLCs spielen! Was hier - gerade mit Episode 2 - dargeboten wird, sprengt alles was ich sonst von einem DLC zu erwarten hätte. Story, Rapture-Revisiting, Universums-überschlagende Auflösungen und eine hochqualitative Inszenierung. Infinite funktioniert ohne die Seebestattungs-DLCs nur halb so gut. Also immer das Komplettpaket erwerben und genießen!\n\nIch hoffe die Marke wird eines Tages noch einmal wieder auferstehen und ein weiteres glanzvolles Kapitel hervorbringen - auch wenn das echt ein heißes Eisen ist, welches untalentierte Menschen schnell versauen könnten.

if it's on sale for five dollars, which is what I paid.\n\nThe shooter mechanics are \"meh\" at best.  Weapons are not nuanced, and the \"vigors\" (magic spells) are useful but very situational.  Which, to be fair, is true of magic spells in any game.\n\nAs for the much-praised story... again, \"meh\" at best.  I've been reading and writing science fiction for over forty years; this story would make for a forgettable novel.  It tries too hard to be original and edgy.  As a result, when you get to the final scene, you'll be left thinking to yourself, \"Hold on just a minute!  These pieces don't all fit together properly.\"  That's because the ending is a non sequitur.  Like I said, it's a try hard.\n\nThe anti-Americanism running throughout the story is annoying, but at my age I've grown used to it and learned to ignore it for what it is:  the misinformed bleating of the poorly-traveled.\n\nSo why do I recommend this game?  Production values.  The effort that went into creating the city of Columbia is truly breathtaking.  It is apparent that the artists spent many thousands of hours lovingly crafting every detail.  The music direction is likewise quite good.  Think of the game as 10 to 15 hours (depending on how thoroughly you explore for loot) of wandering through spectacular scenery while annoying people are shooting ineffectually at you.","timestamp_created":1610293911,"timestamp_updated":1610293911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84433395","author":{"steamid":"76561199006099985","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":136,"last_played":1618237829},"language":"english","review":"My most favorite game off all time","timestamp_created":1610290409,"timestamp_updated":1610290409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84432196","author":{"steamid":"76561198063034201","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":1516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1501,"last_played":1611748311},"language":"english","review":"Big fan of Bioshock games in general and I think this is another great entry in the series, probably the second best Bioshock after the first one, has an engaging story, Im not going to get into the ins and outs of inter dimensional physics etc etc, I liked it and thought it was mind blowing.\nGraphics are good and still hold up today.
