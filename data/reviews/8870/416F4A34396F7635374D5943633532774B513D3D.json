Which is this one? Defenetly story over gameplay. But -- you may ask, is there are like poor or non existant gameplay? No me mates, let's dig into game entirely and split pros from cons.\n\nGraphics: Let's get it out of the way ASAP. Pretty, colorfull, astonishing at a times. Overall it is one of the most betufull games I ever saw in me life.\n\nAnimations: Porn to yer eyes! I can't describe it, it's awesome. Smooth and complicated motions of charecters and NPCs, flawless execution of moves, and skyhooks mechanics that feels just how it should work. Just play the game and experience it, you wont be disapointed.\n\nSound and music: I hardly remember any music in the game... So the OST is not the best, even though in musem from CitC DLC you can actually discover that there is music, pretty good, but not that it will stuck with you not even for a while. Sound design on the other hand is great! Sound operators must been working overtime to create such a earfest. Voice actors done amazing job (And you will be banished to HELL if you played this game on any languige except for ORIGINAL) the charecters sound very lively, and prays be Courtnee Draper that lass made Eli a real life person, I can't imagene any other voice of Eli than her's.\n\nGameplay: Well that what you've been waiting eh? I already menthioned that this game is story first... But it actually has gameplay! Like total: If ye played an other Xshock you know the drill. Vigors (Plasmids, Psypowers) and Gunplay (but with a twist, now you can carry only two guns). The game was simplified in compareson to previous shocks. Hacking is now power not a skill-based mechanic or mini-game or QTE, no variety of ammo to load in ye gun, no puzzles or cunny corners, and no way to die (you can't turn off resurection like in Bioshock 1 and 2). Does this makes Infinite lesser Bioshock? Yes and no. There are still a hell lot of gameplay! Skyhook that will allow you to \"fight and flight\", ters that can change the battle condition providing additional advantage to you and disadvantage to foes, and because you restricted to 2 guns and can't carry a lot of ammo you forced to use Vigors in combo and change tactics from battle to battle (think back to SystemShock or Bioshock where you could fight with you favor tactic for entire game). there are a rich variety of enemies from simple cops to fearsome Handymans and Crowmagicians. basicly, you wont be disapointed or bored, game is FUN. Only jsut go with hard or 1999 mode from the begining -- this will make game fun, when Normal is basicly easy and easy is basicly: \"I'm 9 years old, playing with gamepad, and this is my first game actually, so cut me a slack\".\n\nStory: A meat and bones of a game... I can talk for hours about it. But spoilers and if ye never played this game before, you know the drill. But let's just say, that what developers done is so complicated and smart, that you wll have to play gme twice and keep a notepad (or have a really good memory) if you want to actually discover everything that happened. There a like 5 stories in one, easch with branching path and twists.... Well, i hope you're a smart lad or lassie, or you will probably loose a connection to a 3-4 stories to a middle and will fully give yeself to remaining 2-1, but even then you will be lost to a full picture. So yeah, game provides smartness of 90-s early 2000 games like Deus Ex or Eden. I could've talked some more, but will spare you and will shut up. Go play a bloody game (for the 2-nd or 3-rd time if needed) and just discover everything for yeself.\n\nDLC Clash in the Clouds: A set of challenges. Your standart Arena with dares, if you like those -- you will have some more fun time with Infinite, if not... Well there is a musem where you can spend money that you earned from arenas to unlock; art, music, charecter models and videos it worth it yes.\n\nDLC 2: Columbias Finest simply adds some gear to a begining of a game, that will greatly help! Not only at the begining ut throughout the game too. If there will be discount you can buy it. On the other hand, this DLC makes already easy game a walk in a park. So suit yeself. Youc an still buy it but restrain from using.\n\nDLC 3: Burial at the sea Ep 1. More of our favorite Eli and Booker. Eli now a grown up lass, and she hires Booker from Rapture to help her with a search. There is a twists and turns. You will see Rapture before it was destroyed and HOLLY MTF this DLC is hard! Ammunition low, Eli is less helpfull that in original game, money cees to exict, and it doesn't help that now you can carry all guns in ye inventory. Is it wort it? Totaly! Not only because it's not bad by itself, but also because it connected to ep 2.\n\nEpsiode 2: You play as Eli! Yay... Eli is dead! What? No, she just lost her powers, right? Sort off. Ok now we are getting close to spoilers. But yeah, you play as Eli, she lost her god powers, and now has to rely on stealth. That's right, Episode 2 is a stealth game in Bioshock universe. Is it good? Pretty good, like Dishonored actually. What about the story -- grand finalle!

The gameplay is bearable but does leave much to be desired. The story is amazing, featuring realistic and practical characteristics of quantum mechanics and character driven twist that make you feel for them, you will want to come back and play it again. The story by the end made me feel closure and it did well to explain the craziness. The a.i of the enemies is pretty great, with only afew flukes. But the pride and joy of the game is your a.i partner elizabeth who dynamically follows you with appropriate animation for her surroundings, it makes for the some of the best companinship in any game. It's half life 2 ep 1 with alyx good. She reacts vividly to everything going on and will help you given your predicament.\n\nOverall it's a must play for the story the gameplay is nothing to flusture over. Casually playing through will land you 15 hours of gameplay, it is VERY linear and not as dynamic as I wish it was. The game is not as open ended as the 2011 gameplay promised and all the mechanics overall are used in a linear non strategic manner.

When you play a game like bioshock you go \"Oh boy\" I got this new ability that gives me an advantage over my opponent.  In Infinite, I rarely had the need to use any of the useless vigors you find throughout the game, all that was needed to succeed in this game was using the very boring guns that were available. Oh boy a machine gun, oh cool a sniper. That hasn't been done a million times.  There's a tacked on run n gun system and you take cover. Sound similar? I wanted more of the original game, I wanted to combine the experice from the other games to make my experience unique, and what do I get? A dumbed down shooter that feels boring.  You are limited to TWO weapons.....How's that fun? It's terrible, It leaves no room for creativity, you just mow down stuff with boring weapons and then move on to the next area. Rapture felt alive, this one was just really frusterating. I felt rushed, Good story =/= a good game. The story could have been told in a book, and it would have been better than this.  It just feels bland and something I have done a million times.  There was no real exploration, there was no real point. In Bioshock 1 you can find interesting side stories, that you had to find and use your limited resources to find. There was very little reward for exploring in Infinite.  The fact that there's a shield recovery system in this game, just makes it that much worse. What happened to shock shield, where whenever you took damage you would electrocute the attackers...There's no uniqueness in this game.  Just a boring upgrade system and boring weapon upgrades. \n\nIf you want a casual, stupidly cinematic call of duty experince with bioshock get this.  This doesn't live up to the series, and you can argue against me if you want but I just wanted to get another opinion out on this game.","timestamp_created":1403853022,"timestamp_updated":1403853022,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459294915199279785","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10861483","author":{"steamid":"76561197990774733","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":845,"last_played":1451223697},"language":"russian","review":"Игра класс!","timestamp_created":1403853007,"timestamp_updated":1403853007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10861135","author":{"steamid":"76561198039037011","num_games_owned":464,"num_reviews":140,"playtime_forever":264,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1403850617},"language":"english","review":"Before you just dislike this review just hear me out, the good about this game is it does a very good job at being atmospheric and the story is pretty good, but this games combat is so repetitive it feels like a chore, i dont even know how i finished it. the combat makes this game very very very boring for me theres no enemy variation, only a couple of abilities and not alot of guns plus the mechanics are so simply it makes this game hard to play through. i know all you fanboys will disagree because of the story or say the potions are good enough to hold the combat. but that is simply not true, i give this game a 5/10.","timestamp_created":1403851989,"timestamp_updated":1489989259,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10861014","author":{"steamid":"76561198004066798","num_games_owned":320,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":918,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":918,"last_played":1383925735},"language":"english","review":"Really fun game, fast and action packed.

I was kinda afraid of being disappointed with playing a clone of Bioshock. Boy was I sure surprised when I got the game and played it! There were many elements of the game that made it a Bioshock game (successor) but still managed to have an identity of its own. Sure there were still Plasmids/Vigors, and you still had to save a girl/girls (little sisters and Elizabeth) but Infinite is an entirely differnt experience altogether with the new characters, the surprisingly populated streets of Columbia, the enhanced combat experience and most of all the brilliant story.\nYou have to finish the game in order to fully be amazed at Bioshock Infinite's story. If you still haven't played this game you better start now before you get too old or too preoccupied to appreciate vidoe games! You will never regret spending your time in Columbia! \nPlayed Infinite first on the 360 and now I just bought it from the Steam Summer Sale for my PC.

Now I have played all of them and I can say that I am completely unimpressed with Bioshock Infinite. I may be the only one to ever say this, but this game is awful.\n\nLet's start with the idea of free will. The point of a role-playing game is to take on a persona and act as if you are living this alternate reality. Typical elements of RPG style games are character creation, dialogue choices, story event choices, and typically the ability to alter the way the game plays out, giving multiple endings, and allowing replay value. Bioshock Infinte has none of this. This game is a first-person shooter all the way, resembling Doom more than Fallout 3. Bioshock 2 certainly had some free will in the player's decision to kill or not kill many individuals, it pretended to be more of a RPG/FPS. But Bioshock Infinite lacks any such finesse.\n\nHow about the story? Well, the payoff at the end is a sad joke. It doesn't even make sense, and pretty much negates the whole conflict of the game. Every single interesting point where the game could take off is cut off and pushed aside, instead replaced with almost new beginning to the story, and skipping about everything that was suposed to be intriguing. The entire game you a dragged and pushed along a pre-ordained line of events, with no say in how you want things to actually turn out other than who you shoot first. It may as well have been a movie, but that would have been as fun as when they made Doom into a movie.\n\nFinally, why is it even called Bioshock? It has nothing to do with the previous 2 games, and can make no connecting lines to System Shock (as Bioshock was rumored to be a early step in that story, and tribute to that franchise). Unlike previous Bishock games, there's barely any frame of reference of when and where this story is taking place. Somewhere between 1886 and 1932, maybe? Hovering 300 or 500 ft in the air above North America or the Atlantic Ocean? No other nation on Earth is trying to attack this flying city, or is there nothing left of the world below? It's all vague when it really needs to be established since Paris and New York are mentioned in the game.\n\nSo I would say, for $5 it's worth it. Don't expect much and you might really enjoy it. But game of the year? I guess there's no one trying to make great games, so maybe it was. I find that hard to believe.\n\nI think I'll go play Machinarium again...","timestamp_created":1403839332,"timestamp_updated":1403839332,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479985684156417847","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10857044","author":{"steamid":"76561197985313644","num_games_owned":403,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":591,"last_played":1402528308},"language":"english","review":"A stunning experience, both in terms of the typical 'Bioshock' gameplay, and in terms of the incredible world of Columbia, where prejudice and violence are commonplace.

Infinite é o terceiro game da série BioShock, e conquanto não seja imediatamente parte da história dos jogos anteriores ele apresenta conceitos de jogabilidade semelhantes e também um tema com semelhanças aos games anteriores.\n\nBioShock Infinite se passa em 1912 durante o crescimento do excepcionalismo americano,o protagonista, o ex-Pinkerton, agente Booker DeWitt, enviado para a cidade flutuante localizado em Columbia com a missão de encontrar uma jovem mulher, Elizabeth, que foi mantida em cativeiro na maior parte de sua vida. Columbia é uma cidade fictícia estilo Steampunk suspensa no ar por meio de uma tecnologia chamada de \"levitação quântica\", dirigíveis gigantes e balões. Columbia é uma cidade utópica cheia de vida, cor e alegria…ou pelo menos assim parece. Tudo tem o seu porém, e enquanto se passa pelos belos cenários, há vários NPCs contentes ou interessantes ao longo da nossa jornada, também descobrimos ao longo do caminho um lado sombrio desta cidade que recria a “era excepcional” dos Estados Unidos da América. Temas maduros como a descriminação racial, sexismo e religião estão expostos no jogo de uma maneira bastante frontal e convincentes, que tanto podem chocar como impressionar. \nDurante os acontecimentos, as tensões raciais aumentaram até o ponto onde Columbia está à beira de uma guerra civil, travada entre os governantes \"Fundadores\" e o insurgente \"Vox Populi\", duas facções com ideologias opostas. Os Fundadores são a facção política que prevalece na cidade, eles são racistas ultranacionalistas que mantiveram o poder e controle sobre Columbia, e procuram manter Columbia puramente para cidadãos brancos americanos, negando a estrangeiros sues diverso privilégios. O Vox Populi (latim para \"voz do povo\") são um grupo de resistência oposta aos ultra-nacionalistas. Formou-se a partir de vários grupos com ideologias semelhantes, eles lutam para tomar o controle e restaurar os direitos de cidadania colombiana para as pessoas de todas as raças e religiões. No entanto, anos de lutas amargas têm impulsionado o Vox Populi em direção a oposição com um tremendo ódio cego, resultando em métodos mais violentos e brutais.\nAlém da disputa interna, Columbia é devastada por \"Tears\" (ou fendas) no tecido do espaço-tempo. Sendo o resultado de experimentos científicos do passado, essas fendas se revelam passagens para universos alternativos, e também permitem a interação com eles. Enquanto a maioria dos cidadãos colombianos consideram estas fendas como mera curiosidade, algumas pessoas têm explorado a visão oferecida por eles para criar radicalmente novas armas e tecnologias, enquanto outros copiaram músicas futuristas, baseando-se em canções ouvidas a partir das fendas, trazendo elementos anacrônicos para o ano de 1912.","timestamp_created":1403837139,"timestamp_updated":1403837139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10856212","author":{"steamid":"76561198041746811","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":835,"last_played":1460951957},"language":"english","review":"In a tldr format, this game has a wonderful story but lacks good combat dynamics to support it, making the game very repetitve  .

Pra mim a saga BioShock é a melhor de todos os tempos. BioShock Infinite juntamente com DLC Burial at Sea é o melhor jogo que já joguei nesta geração. Sobre as DLC, no episódio 1 foi criticado que teve várias pontas soltas que não foram explicadas, parece que as pessoas esquecerem que iria ter o episódio 2 que ia explicar tudo detalhadamente.\nVocê perceberam que eu não citei pontos negativos né ?

Девятнадцатилетняя девушка, обладающая сверхъестественными способностями. Заключена в башню Агнец в Колумбии. Охраняется крылатой машиной по прозвищу Соловей. Bioshock Infinite концовка оставила больше вопросов не лежи ответов! Ken Levine пообещал раскрыть часть всех секретов в первом DLC Burial at Sea. В первом DLC Элизабет представила из себя нечто вроде Лютесов, в конце BioShock Infinite произошло некое собрание Элизабет со всех миров. Благодаря такому состоянию она способна видеть бесконечное разнообразие со всех миром, Ken Levine предоставил нам элигантную фразу в виде способность видеть двери и то что за ними. За ними она видит то что Комсток он же Букер Девитт, которому удалось сбежать от нее и избежать наказаниев другом мире и попадает в rapture. Но продолжу историю DLC Burial at Sea где Элизабет нанимает Букера,что бы найти пропавшую девочку Салли.. Этим же заманить его на смерть, где Букер умрет от руки большого Папочки. И теперь мне стало ясно что все Комстоки погибли во всех мирам. Во втором DLC Burial at Sea где все Элизабет слипаются в одну где она становится обычной девушкой. Это дорога смерти Элизабет \"Туз в рукаве\", тут отвлеку ваше внимание и вспомню Bioshock тот самый в котором все начиналось... имя главного героя Джек, он же сын Эндрю Райана главный враг Атласа он же \"Фрэнк Фонтейн\"! Фонтейн был убит Джеком, тем самым спас 5 девочек вырастив их как дочерей вот все что нужно знать о первой части Bioshock... Туз в рукаве то что хотел узнать Атлас во втором DLC Burial at Sea. Скажу о Элизабет со сверхъестественными способностями она знала о Джеке, знала что он спасет Салли и других девочек, знала что Атлас убьет её. Не смотря на все она шла до конца, она хотела прервать круг жестокости.. в которой она сыграла не малую роль.... Погибла ли Элизабет на всегда, скорее всего ДА! Буду только думать о том что в другом Мире Дочь Букера \"Анна\" не станет Элизабет, и он не продаст ее в карты, и Они будут отличной семьей!!
