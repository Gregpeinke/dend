Your companion, Elizabeth, plays a pivotal role in the game immersion. She will make you shout, swear, immediately regret your words and cry. She will grab your attention, point you to clues you'd overseen otherwise, and even provide you with a timely help in combat.

Жив.\n— А с этого? Мёртв.\n— Та же монета.\n— Но другая плоскость.\n— Орёл.\n— Решка.\n— Мёртв.\n— Жив.\n— Тут как с велосипедом.\n— Ты ведь не разучилась.\n— Просто нужна смелость сесть на него.\n\nТо, что будет в следующие несколько часов вашей жизни нельзя объяснить не чем. Возможно, вы и в первые пятнадцать минут поймете, что это лишь бред создателей или же будете идти до конца. И боюсь, это может вас расстроить…\n\nBioshock Infinite – Является шедевром. И далеко не в планах геймплея или же графики. Он захватывает вас еще с первых минут, и вы с головой погружаетесь в чудесный мир. Мир, где нет тьмы, мир полный загадок, и конечно приключений. Вы будете смотреть по сторонам и восхищаться его красотами до конца игры, по детски тычась во всех прохожих в ожидании, что они расскажут вам какую-либо историю. Не находите? Ведь такие же чувства у нас вызывали игры лет 5 назад. Взять тот же S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Ведь мы могли часами сидеть возле костров и слушать истории. Или же осматривать знакомую нам территорию. Я уже молчу про всякие виды каких-либо TES:Skyrim или открытые миры WOW. Но что-то я ушел от темы. Вернемся назад в Bioshock.\n\nИ вот перед нами исчезает картинка и звучит расслабляющая музыка, а мозг пытается собрать все элементы этого пазла в один. Мы думаем «За что?», и ведь всё то, что пережили герои за всю игру, было напрасным? Почему нет Happy End’а? Неужели судьба не могла поступить с ними иначе? Каждый раз повторять одно и тоже ради чего? \n\nBioshock Infinite становится чем-то типа утопии в небесах. И если «Восторг» показывался нам уже разрушенным и видели руины былого величия, то сейчас мы застаем настоящий рай. Но в скором будущем с помощью легкой руки Буккера ДеВитта мы склоняем чашу весов в сторону хаоса. Город находится на пороге гражданской войны. И любое действие может склонить чашу весов в чью-либо сторону. И при этом это все происходит в 1912 году!\n\n«Приведи девчонку, и мы в расчете» именно с этой мыслью герой рассматривает фото и плывет в таинственный маяк. Двое людей в лодке все время спорят, кто из них должен «огрести». И привозя Буккера на маяк, оставляют выполнять «Работу». И первое, что видит Буккер это надпись. «Смой Грехи свои» на что он конечно отвечает «Нет, спасибо». Поднимаясь выше, он видит труп человека. С еще одной надписью «Не подведи нас». Кого это «Нас»…Хм…и кто заказал девчонку, мы узнаем не скоро. Но дальше будет только интереснее.\n\nПожалуй следующий 10 минут я не смогу описать. То, что мы увидим не описуемо. Это Колумбия и не та, что стоит на какой-то грешной земле, а парящая в небесах. С её залитыми солнцем улицами, с механическими лошадьми и людьми, кто приветствует главного героя. Однако не стоит забывать, что это не то чем кажется. В этом «Рае» не все так спокойно. Расизм это одна лишь из причин почему вам может не понравится в этом городе. Попав на ярмарку вы это отлично поймете. И после этого начнется самый настоящий Bioshock. Вот вам и экшен шутер.\n\nНу а все же игра – шедевр. И хоть в ней много минусов, но все же после того как вы увидите эту игру. Вы будете думать так же как и я. Почему судьба обошлась так с героями, и могло ли быть иначе? Но больше не смею вас задерживать. Идите и играйте уже в него.\n","timestamp_created":1399632849,"timestamp_updated":1399632849,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":33,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.770146369934082031","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10060352","author":{"steamid":"76561198025988135","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":872,"last_played":1400164114},"language":"english","review":"DAT ENDING ?!

The game takes the story of a man trying to repay a debt, and weaves into it a comprelling indictment of racism, conspicuous consumption, capitalism without regulation, slavery, political corruption, and religious fundamentalism. The fantastical city of Columbia in the clouds is a mirror that reflects the darker side of our society much like Star Trek was back in the day. The society of Columbia is a reflection of what the ultra-conservatives of our world believe America should be, but then the game tears that society assunder to demonstrate just how fragile that world-view is.\n\nIrrational Games set the bar rather high with this 3rd installment into the Bioshock series. The city of Columbia is a vibrant, bright and colorful place. A vast contrast from the drab brown worlds of most other FPS games. The floating city seems alive with people living out their daily lives around you, then like a rock through a glass house shatters it and the truth of the evils of their way of life comes boiling to the surface. Even in a ruined state, the bloating city is still in some way terribly beautiful. A striking reminder that beauty is only skin deep, and underneath that thin veneer the city festers and rots.\n\nThis is superb storytelling combined with amazing visuals and simple gameplay mechanics. Though simple, the gameplay mechanics of running, shooting, and using Vigors is anything but simplistic. The added gameplay elements of the skyrail system and cargo hooks you can latch onto really change the gameplay dynamics. You can drop in on enemies, use vigors to thow enemies into the air and do extra critcal damage, or knock them off of ledges or over railings. The weapons are diverse with their own properties. Some are more effective than others for a given situation. Elizebeth's abilities add yet another lay of dimension to the gameplay. This adds an element of strategy to every encounter, as running in guns blazing isn't always the best course of action, but luring enemies into traps often is. This is a nice departure from the mindless and uninspiring run & hose a room down with bullets gameplay that's become the norm with most other FPS games these days.\n\nPerfect, this game isn't, but I dare you find me one that is. Bioshock Infinite is wonderful in its execution, the story is compelling and thought provoking, the gameplay is inspiring and innovative, and the ending....oh my gawd. Too many games these days don't focus on giving players a great ending. The ending of a game should be a reward for the player and all of their accomplishments. Yet, too often the ending is treated as an afterthought. Usually ending in an abrupt and melodramatic way. Bioshock Infinite gives you an ending that will be debated and pondered for years to come, and that's how game endings should be.\n\nOverall, if you liked the previous Bioshock games you will love this one. If you like games with superb storytelling, great graphics, and gameplay uses the \"complexity out of simplicity\" philosophy then you will love this one. Highly recommended.\n\nBioshock Infinite sets the bar high for all future story-driven FPS games.\n\n","timestamp_created":1399576964,"timestamp_updated":1399576964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10055148","author":{"steamid":"76561198043825392","num_games_owned":565,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":583,"last_played":1445940257},"language":"english","review":"Such an immersive storyline, and powerful storytelling to go along with it.
