It was awarded as the Game of the Decade in the VGA Awards. The award was received by Gabe Newell, Valve founder.\n\nThe game takes place 20 years after the Black Mesa incident of Half Life ( The game that chaged it all ) . Gordon Freeman awakes from hibernation in City 17 and become part of the resistance to face the Combine Empire and attempt to defeat it. In the game Gordon meets Alyx Vance,  who is part of the resistance. The game is one of the pioneers in introducing a playmate .\n\nHalf Life 2 presents different enemies . The Headcrabs still produce that feeling of rejection when they attack. The action is breathtaking but it breaks , not like Call of Duty games where you shoot without breathing.\n\nThe narrative is implemented throughout the game, not with recording or notes , it is not necessary. The experience is brilliant. The Source engine allows good management of physics and the introduction of a new weapon. The gravity gun . The technology also allows open spaces in addition to traditional outdoor passageways and internal spaces .\n\nThe handling of the narrative and physics puzzles changed the way the FPS games developed from there into the future . It was a turning point in games history the same way it was the first Half Life .\n\nThe game was released for PC under Windows , required a 2 Ghz processor . 512 MB ​​of RAM , and a graphics card compatible with Direct X 8.1 .
