The gameplay and graphics remain unchanged, and there is nothing wrong with that. The game picks up right after the explosion that ended the main game. The main goal of this \"add-on\" game is to escape City 17. \n\nThe first part of the game is enjoyable, particularly the portion with the modified gravity gun. There are few things as satisfying as yanking enemies from afar and throwing their ragdolled-bodies around. However, that part of the game is short-lived and ends after you complete a couple of puzzles.\n\nThe rest of the game feels like a brief glimpse into a \"horror masterpiece.\" I often found myself running out of items to throw with my gravity gun. There were a lot of instances in which I had to crawl through air vents, stumble through the dark, and hide while Alyx shot at and killed many enemies. Despite these commonalities, this game kept me engaged with its solid pacing from start to finish.\n\nThe story is simplistic, and the achievements will add a little replay value to this game. I was able to complete every achievement on the first playthrough... so you can accomplish this feat too. For me, the citizen escort portion was the hardest portion of the game. At least, it was the hardest part until I realized that I could use the rocket launcher to kill everyone and everything. When I find time, I will probably go back and beat the game with guns-a-blazing. I'm sure the game will play differently if I do. \n\nIn the end, this \"add-on\" game can be completed in under five hours. It is a solid addition to the Half-Life lore, and the game does not strive to be too ambitious. Simply put, you should play Episode One shortly, if not immediately after you beat the Half-Life 2 main game.","timestamp_created":1490845921,"timestamp_updated":1490846044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30817408","author":{"steamid":"76561198001366948","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":321,"last_played":1423598130},"language":"russian","review":"Я люблю страусов, а страусы любят меня.

This allowed them to capitalise more efficiently on rapidly improving graphical technology and dispense their content a lot faster. Released in 2006, Episode 1 is the direct continuation of HL2 which charts Gordon and Alyx’s treacherous escape from City 17. Technically, it attempts to improve and advance every aspect that its predecessor established.\n\nThe gameplay of Episode 1 is based almost entirely around the concept of you working in partnership with your AI companion, Alyx. This mainly involves Alyx following your lead and helping you during combat, but there are also several innovative sections which reinforce the idea of teamwork. These include a dimly lit area where you need to use your flashlight to illuminate enemies for Alyx to shoot; and a section where you need to clear Alyx’s line of sight while she supports you from afar with a sniper rifle.\n\nShe has been programmed to act as a support role, remaining reticent during puzzle sections and hanging back during ‘boss’ encounters. This feels like a well-balanced design choice as it allows the player the freedom to advance at their own pace and feel more of a sense of accomplishment at overcoming challenges.\n\nThe AI has seen significant improvements, especially in path finding abilities. Alyx in particular has had a substantial upgrade, giving her new animations for crouching and synchronised kill moves for a lot of enemy types. Enemy AI has also seen developments as Combine soldiers can now crouch and take cover more effectively. They have also been given a rope repelling animation which always looks visually engaging. The only new enemy type introduced is the Combine zombie, or ‘zombine’. They are an entertaining addition that adds a new threat to the undead portions of the game.\n\nThe puzzle sections are still relatively easy and should not take anyone too long to solve. Despite this, they are slightly more diverse than the simple physics based puzzles of the original game and still serve as an effective diversion from the combat scenes.\n\nGraphically, Episode 1 has seen some major upgrades. Valve has adapted their Source engine to include new developments in HDR (High Dynamic Range) lighting, which was originally showcased in their Lost Coast tech demo. This really helps to elevate the presentation to a high standard; for example the shader effects used around the Citadel core still manage to impress me today. There have also been further advancements in facial expression modelling which helps bring some more personality to the main characters.\n\nOverall, Episode 1 is a solid entry into the HL2 series. The main criticism that can be presented is its length; it is only five chapters long and can be comfortably completed in less than 10 hours. However, it is worth mentioning that there is also a developer commentary mode which provides some insightful observations if you are at all interested in the design process, or if you simply want to get a little more replay value.\n\nPersonally I feel that Episode 1 provides the least story enhancement of the series, which can make it feel more inconsequential. However, from a technical stand point it does improve on almost every aspect in terms of gameplay and graphical experience, and is a well-polished presentation that serves as a good stepping stone into Episode 2.","timestamp_created":1488111201,"timestamp_updated":1491850797,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593094944953918457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30191275","author":{"steamid":"76561198289497683","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":558,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":294,"last_played":1506023026},"language":"russian","review":"Великолепная гравика, геймплей, и сюжетная линия!","timestamp_created":1488102721,"timestamp_updated":1488102721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30165277","author":{"steamid":"76561198110823517","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":75,"playtime_forever":13,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1647416998},"language":"english","review":"Good addition to Half-Life 2.","timestamp_created":1488023998,"timestamp_updated":1488023998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30127715","author":{"steamid":"76561198092507474","num_games_owned":496,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":914,"last_played":1487884992},"language":"english","review":"[h1]Half-Life 2: Episode One Brief Review[/h1]\n\nTo be written...\n\n\n[b]Should you buy it now, wait for sale or never touch it?
