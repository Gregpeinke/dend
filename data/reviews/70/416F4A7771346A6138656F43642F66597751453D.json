[/h1]\n\nThe Half-life franchise, a well-known behemoth of a series that revolutionized the video-game industry with its then innovative game-play and narrative, a story told with zero cut-scene interruptions, having direct control over your character during every scripted sequence, breaking no immersion. That is not the only thing it brought to the industry, from believable level-design where the entire world and levels having a sense of continuity, a very believable health system to NPC scripting that set new standards in the industry in 1998.\n\n[b] The Half-Life games hold a special place in my heart. [/b]\nAnd none of them would've been possible if its wasn't for the success of Half-Life (1).\nWhat can you expect from this game? Well, first - this game carries some of the best level designs I've ever seen, from complete freedom of exploration to smartly hidden secret, vent-shaft crawling and well placed enemies and puzzles. The pacing of Half-Life is especially great, there was never a dull moment in Half-life were things felt out of place - everything happens in a certain order but without being predictable at the same time.\n\nSh*t goes south when you are least expecting, leading to some really cinematic events that occur through out the game becomes something surreal due to the fact that you are still in-control and have to use your quick-wits to get out of the situation. For example,[spoiler]that one part where you enter a ventilation-shaft and start crawling towards the exit hatch, until a soldier opens the hatch and throws in a satchel charge - and you have to quickly crawl back out of it and drop into the water. And the best part of it? Looking up while underwater to see the fire burst out of the shaft.[/spoiler] Immersive scripted scenarios like these requiring your interaction is what makes this game so good.\n\n[i]We all the know the iconic crowbar-wielding, HEV-suit-wearing, maniac who carries around 30 freaking weapons around while crawling down the nearest ventilation-shaft. Gordon f*cking Freeman.[/i]\n\nThe story is told through the perspective of a scientist that works for Black Mesa; a secret research facility located somewhere in the border of Mexico. Minutes after beginning a test with some sort of anomalous material, the experiment triggers a Resonance Cascade opening to an alien dimension, allowing every creature to teleport into Black mesa and start f*cking sh*t up. After that, all hell breaks loose. But, of-course, [b]GFF, the man, the myth, the legend, picks up a f*cking crowbar. Supposed that this is your first time, I leave the rest for you to find out.[/b]\n\n[i]\"When their only experience of humanity was a crowbar coming at them down a steel corridor.\"[/i]\n\nHalf-life has a grim-atmosphere, where there are countless deaths around you and everything is a clusterf*ck of events - but at the same time, the game carries some sort of charm, especially the voice acting of the NPCs and the AI and so on.\n\nThe puzzles of this game aren't those that stop you where you stand and force you to think, rather the puzzles almost always put you under some sort of timed pressure where you just have to quickly figure things out or face your death. Trail and Error is key in this game, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nTo add to the badassery of Freeman, there is an amazing soundtrack by Kelly Bailey that plays at the perfect moments to hype you the heck up, Some of these soundtracks are so good that they got remastered and reused in the second game as well. The sound designing of this game is also very well done.\n\nVisually this game is very dated, you can judge from the screenshots - It's a game made in 1998, what did you expect? But for this game, you have to look past the graphics and focus on everything else it does [i]so right. [/i]\n\n[b]Thanks to the modding community, this game holds a tremendous amount of replayability.[/b]\nThought I recommend at-least a single vanilla playthrough to understand why this game is praised by many, after that - there a tons of mods to give you your money worth. We got:\n[list]\n [*]Sven Coop - The Entire campaign in co-op!\n [*]Brutal Half-life - Just like the brutal-doom mod, makes the game a glorious festival of fast-paced adrenaline pumped gut-spilling.\n [*]Absolute Redemption - Fan-made non-canon continuation of the game with believable original voice acting.\n[/list] And so much more! Checkout: Aublak's Half-life list of best HL Mods for more.\n\nHalf-life, until this day, has so much going for it - and it is never too late for you to join it.\n\n[h1][i]Pay the full-price, wait for an individual sale, or wait for that regular Valve Pack Sale where all the games made by valve are sold in a bundle for less than $12.68! Whatever you do, this game is hella worth it.[/i][/h1]\n\n- Now excuse me while I go through my third moded playthrough.","timestamp_created":1559347873,"timestamp_updated":1579863673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":34,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.776250779628753662","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50983129","author":{"steamid":"76561198263688813","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1308,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1308,"last_played":1504813769},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра.","timestamp_created":1559347419,"timestamp_updated":1559347419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50983039","author":{"steamid":"76561198290509332","num_games_owned":378,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1623843479},"language":"russian","review":"ну класс, что тут еще сказать. \nЭто классика, 6лять.","timestamp_created":1559346870,"timestamp_updated":1559346870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460021913051605225","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50982850","author":{"steamid":"76561198363190204","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1615246329},"language":"english","review":"10/10 eggs","timestamp_created":1559345976,"timestamp_updated":1559345976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50981847","author":{"steamid":"76561198338110374","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":5511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":413,"last_played":1659917061},"language":"english","review":"nOice game","timestamp_created":1559340898,"timestamp_updated":1559340898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50981131","author":{"steamid":"76561198851919285","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1383,"playtime_last_two_weeks":67,"playtime_at_review":67,"last_played":1660493234},"language":"polish","review":"Gordon doesn't need to hear these reviews, he's a highly trained professional","timestamp_created":1559337467,"timestamp_updated":1639039150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50980377","author":{"steamid":"76561198125726169","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37,"last_played":1620059731},"language":"russian","review":"Классика","timestamp_created":1559334130,"timestamp_updated":1559334130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50978803","author":{"steamid":"76561198256095174","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":23,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1553120518},"language":"finnish","review":"Nyt on niinku positiiviset.

They can only do one action at a time, allowing you to brute force your way\nto victory.\n\nIf I had to list something bad about the game, it would be the weapon selection.\nThe maximum ammunition capacities make the list seem like too much. Although this is addressed in both the {true} sequels\nas well as half-way through the game's story, it's still a bad way to balance the game.\nAnother bad addition is the \"[i] HD [i] Content\". Gearbox software ( formed to create Opposing Force ) ported the game a couple of times,\nand created new models, textures and sounds that they brought to Blue Shift, a port of a cancelled port's extra story.\n\nI know I'm not the only one who heavily dislikes the content, so I deleted the \"[i] HD [/i]\" models and textures, leaving only the sounds.\n\nIf you want to do this, after the game is installed go to your steam directory, \"steamapps\", \"common\", \"Half-Life\", \"valve_hd\" and delete\nfolders labeled \"models\" and \"sprites\", as it will now only enable \"[i] HD [/i]\" sounds when the appropriate box is checked in video settings.\n{ yes you will have to do this each time the game 'updates' or you reinstall } ( yes I know this is just a guide now ).\n\nThe final feature I would like to discuss is the included \"[b] Deathmatch [/b]\" game mode.
