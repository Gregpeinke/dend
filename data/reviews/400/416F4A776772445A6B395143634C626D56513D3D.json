That.\nWhat I really enjoy about this game is that it doesn't take the story and smash you over the head with it in wall after wall of painful exposition. Some things are spelled out by GlaDos while others you come across and have to piece together for yourself. The game trusts you to figure out what's going on and I appreciate that. Especially after dying on the same level in the same way eight times in a row. It makes me feel al little better about myself.\nGlaDos is quite possibly the best video game villian ever written. She's funny and terrifying at the same time, like that one aunt everyone avoids at the family christmas party. They could have easily hammed her up and gone overboard with it but somehow managed to find the perfect balance between cold emotionless android and snarky embittered librarian.\nThe puzzels are challenging, but do-able. There is always a solution even though it is not always obvious. Keep at it and solving the tests becomes almost addicting. Once you get to post game and start the challenges it's even worse.\nThe game is very brief and when you play the second game you discover it only barely scrapes the surface of the Portal world, but I feel like that's fair for a game that was released in a bundle with two other games. It's more like an animated short than a box office movie, but you more than get what you pay for.\nSeriously, you just need to play it.

Jest to logiczno-platformowa gra ukazana z perspektywy pierwszej osoby.\n\nSilnik fizyczny gry jest bardzo dobrze zaprogramowany. Interakcja z otoczeniem jest na tyle duża, że wprowadza złudne odczucie posiadania duszy przez każdy, nawet najmniejszy element. Grafika jest dopracowana i idealnie oddaje klimat gry. Muzyka wprowadza nas w laboratoryjny klimat panujący podczas rozgrywki. Fabuła jest dość interesująca, lecz nie jest mocną stroną Portala.\n\nBohaterka gry o imieniu Chell budzi się w komorze relaksacyjnej jednego z pomieszczeń obiektu badawczego Aperture Sience Enrichment. Po paru sekundach wita ją sztuczna inteligencja - GLaDOS władająca całym kompleksem. Informuje ona główną postać o konieczności przeprowadzenia specjalnych testów. W jednym z nich otrzymuje broń, dzięki której tworzy portale. Ostatni test ma się zakończyć doszczętnym spaleniem obiektu testowego, którym jest Chell, jednak udaje się jej uciec. Przedziera się przez biura pracowników i korytarze pełne zabezpieczeń do samego serca sztucznej inteligencji. Dowiadujemy się, że GLaDOS zabiła wszystkich pracowników neurotoksyną. Poprzez wykorzystanie broni tworzącej portale oraz działka rakietowego, Chell niszczy superkomputer i ląduje na powierzchni parkingowej przed kompleksem. Ponieważ bohaterka nieszczęśliwie leżała w uległej pozycji została zaciągnięta przez wędrującego za nią eskortującego robota spowrotem do obiektu wypoczynkowego w Enrichment Center.\n\nReasumując, do plusów gry możemy zaliczyć:\n- poprawność w sferze fabularnej\n- możliwość rozwiązywania zagadek z pomocą broni tworzącej portale\n- silnik fizyczny\n- grafikę\n- pokonywanie przeszkód\n- konieczność logicznego myślenia \n- poziom trudności.\n\nNatomiast do ewidentnych minusów trzeba zaliczyć:\n- wybitnie krótki czas potrzebny do zakończenia wątku głównego\n- zbyt wygórowana cena, jak na niecałe trzy godziny dobrej zabawy.\n\nMoim zdaniem, Portal nie jest tytułem godnym polecenia ze względu na znaczące minusy gry.\n\nPozdrawiam\nPaweł","timestamp_created":1461612138,"timestamp_updated":1483693346,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48116949200630188","comment_count":15,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22629744","author":{"steamid":"76561198042710097","num_games_owned":468,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":244,"last_played":1646861409},"language":"english","review":"Do you seriously not know anything about Portal?

A game I would argue is one of the defining games of the 21st century. But, at times, it doesn't feel like a game. After all, it rewards you for breaking its own rules. Sure, GLaDOS tells you not to do that, but it's 100 times more fun to do it anyway just to spite her. And that is why Portal succeeds. It has great gameplay, contains shocking story depth for a game that only features two speaking characters, and, to top it all off, it's hilarious. Sure, it's a little short, especially when compared to Portal 2, but don't skip out on this game. See where it all started.
