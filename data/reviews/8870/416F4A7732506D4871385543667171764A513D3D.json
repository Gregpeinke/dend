There where I would get bored of a third playthrough in the original Bioshock, this one doesn't get boring. The atmosphere of this one is EPIC. It's way better than the first one. \n\nThe gameplay is also more exciting. In Bioshock 1 you would feel rather lonely, now you have a companion, which takes away that loneliness but also brings it back during the story. \n\nThe story is the best I've seen so far - nearly all games are repeating the same story with better graphics and different gameplay but this story and the thought behind it and how it all makes sense in the end - the more you know about the discussed subjects, the more you are amazed by the complexity of the story. \n\nDefinitely but this game.

I'll say this now, I am a story player, I will play games for fun and interesting gameplay and I love puzzles, but the best way to get me to play a game is to get me to play till the story makes me want to finish it, even if it's just to see how the terrible story ends. \n\nBioshock has always been a fairly fun, interesting and story filled series. Sadly, I have to say, I did not enjoy Infinite as much as I should have, for mildly the same reason that I hated World War Z. It's not the same style or story, it's just named the same. The gameplay is fast paced and fairly well done, the characters and story are nice, if a bit too, in my oppinion, unlikeable in some cases. I also had some complaints about how, where and, I guess going with the stories silly theme, when the story went. It would have been an alright story, but I feel it tried a bit to hard in many cases to do a story that has been done quite often.\n\nOther than those complaints, these are my personal ones that point towards my earlier mention of only mildly similar stories sharing names when I feel they shouldn't. Bioshock was a series about Governmental extremes faults and mildly satirizing it, showing that every view is wrong when you make it the only view, and Infinite seemed like it was doing that at first but decided to go off the rails pretty hard near the end. Also on my personal complaint list, a bit part of Bioshock was Rapture, least to me. Columbia is a completely different place with a fairly different feel to it, so it annoys me they used an old cliched story in order to force it to be ok for them to change everything about Bioshock and claim it's still bioshock.\n\nIn closing, if you liked Bioshock for it's gameplay, you'll have loads of fun with this game, if you like story, you'll probably enjoy this game, but if you liked Rapture, Ryan and the Big Daddies, you'll probably want to look away, and if you dislike overly grand and expanded stories based around old cliched twists and the such in story telling, you'll probably want to avoid this as well.","timestamp_created":1397350496,"timestamp_updated":1397350496,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488836020231246948","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9801420","author":{"steamid":"76561198047931655","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1215,"last_played":1623980213},"language":"english","review":"Let me just start off saying that: Before Bioshock Infinite, I've never played a Bioshock game, much less watch anyone play it. I've heard about it and saw a few video clips here and there but other than that, the series never really striked my fancy because I never knew what kind of game the Bioshock series was. I found out about Infinite when a coworker told me how good it was from start to finish; he never spoiled anything for me, thankfully, so when I borrowed the game from a friend, I was coming in with no prior knowledge of anything Bioshock related.\n\nNow let me follow that story with this statement: Bioshock Infinite is quite possibly the best game I've ever played. \nAs I've said before, I've never played Bioshock 1 or 2 but even without that, Infinite still held it's own as a stand-alone game within the legendary trio. \nInfinite immerses the player in a story that they can't quite wrap their head around other than one simple objective \"Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt\". As the player progresses, they unwravel truths about the world around them and about Columbia. \nNeedless to say the game, throughout the entire playthrough, keeps the player on their toes with smooth combat, a well-written story, emotional music and immersive atmosphere; and I have to say that the atmosphere of this game is far beyond any of that which I've played before. \n\nBioshock Infinite inspired me to play 1 and 2 after the fact which also sealed their stories deep within my heart and I will say that if you haven't played 1 or 2 either that you need to if you plan on getting the DLC for this game. \n\nDespite me having beaten the game at least 5 times and bought it twice; the game never gets old to me and suprisingly has rather decent replayability value. \nTo me, Infinite is the perfect game with little to no flaws; it gets everything right and sets the bar for it. The only thing that disappointed me was the game leaving me wanting more.\n\nThat's why I give this game a solid 10/10.","timestamp_created":1397346217,"timestamp_updated":1397346217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9801212","author":{"steamid":"76561198060814465","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":679,"last_played":1588945013},"language":"english","review":"(Y) Me likey","timestamp_created":1397344314,"timestamp_updated":1397344314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9801100","author":{"steamid":"76561198041992572","num_games_owned":379,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1167,"last_played":1552774865},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games","timestamp_created":1397343303,"timestamp_updated":1442531182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9801029","author":{"steamid":"76561198107666517","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":175,"last_played":1489862231},"language":"english","review":"This is a realy good game a must buy","timestamp_created":1397342789,"timestamp_updated":1397342789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9800882","author":{"steamid":"76561198114222511","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":365,"last_played":1398942762},"language":"turkish","review":"Kendine has dünyası, iyi yapay zekası, her noktayı araştırma merakı, işte oyun budur... :)","timestamp_created":1397341486,"timestamp_updated":1397341486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9800619","author":{"steamid":"76561198010045713","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1832,"last_played":1397339316},"language":"english","review":"10 out of 10, Amazing Storyline.","timestamp_created":1397339394,"timestamp_updated":1397339394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500480294227600098","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9800608","author":{"steamid":"76561197970273347","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4569,"last_played":1410616398},"language":"spanish","review":"un buen juego en si buenos escenarios un argumento aceptable aunque el final sea un poco malo.\nlas espansiones dejan un poco que desear la primera sabe apoco muy corta\nla segunda estabastante bien pero lea faltado armamento deberian haber ampliado los cargadores y tambien con un final nada bueno\npara mi analisis le doi  un 7 en general","timestamp_created":1397339323,"timestamp_updated":1397339323,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9800498","author":{"steamid":"76561198083962501","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24986,"playtime_last_two_weeks":93,"playtime_at_review":7617,"last_played":1660109068},"language":"english","review":"I'm more of a casual gamer than anything, spending most of my time running a business, but Infinite has been a fantastic escape and I've thoroughly enjoyed playing it through about 6 times since I purchased it last year when it came out. \n\nIrrational Games has a deplorable gift of building up the player with their culturally/biologically sculpted expectations of heroism, positive emotionalism, and pseudo-intimacy between carefully crafted primary and secondary characters in a game, whether it be through their classic pre-recorded audio collectibles or in-game scene transitions, or, for Infinite, the 1 on 1 interfacing with Elizabeth, and then finalizing the psychological investment with an ending that baffles the mind and, at the same time, destroys all the intricate compilation of creative and emotional intimacy established between the established characters and the player. This leaves 90%-95% of their gameplay worth re-playing for the emotional and environmental experience, and the endings usually depressing and draining. Whether spawned from a narritive commentary on humanity or just the latest and greatest in shock endings, for me and others it's a good point to skip back to the beginning and re-experience the parts that breath vision and excitement into our busy lifes. \n\nKevin Levine's gift for fantastically crafted story telling is unparalleled in this game, but his personal touch on gaming resolution errs more on the side of shock-value than bringing the masterpieces he creates to justified and re-visitable conclusions. From a psychological point of view one could link the hopelessness or pointlessness of many of the underlying themes running through both Bioshock 1, 2, and Infinite with the ideology that mankind is collectively and individually just an accident in an ongoing timeline that exists with or without us, and with 88-89% of the world not sharing this point of view it becomes more than clinically obvious why the game's potential hasn't reached as many people as it should have. Thankfully we all can embrass the universal human traits that he uses to negociate the audience through his wonderland.\n\nBut, whether the investment in storyline ideologies was an decision to subvert the marketing potential of the game, or the developers and producers were just trying to stand their ground on creative premise, the rest of the game is a fantastical interfacing with a real-world fantasy that creates as many questions as it attempts to answer in the realm of cross-dimensional quantum variations. \n\nGraphics, characters, music, and gameplay, there isn't another game like this one, and it's worth replaying the first 90% of it over and over again, and then spend the night arguing with your friends over all the plot holes in the last 10%. Definitely worth your time and money.","timestamp_created":1397338676,"timestamp_updated":1402092326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502297103404998779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9800491","author":{"steamid":"76561198124084501","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":988,"last_played":1528509045},"language":"english","review":"AWESOME XD <_<","timestamp_created":1397338607,"timestamp_updated":1397338607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9800386","author":{"steamid":"76561198090790637","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":877,"last_played":1610325551},"language":"brazilian","review":"O que falar sobre esse jogo que vicia aponto de querer jogar sem parar mas, ao mesmo tempo medo de chegar ao final rápido demais.

Finally I cannot leave here without meantioning the best soundtrack I heard in games since Dark Souls.","timestamp_created":1397332105,"timestamp_updated":1397332105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9799506","author":{"steamid":"76561198037143468","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1506,"last_played":1397330117},"language":"spanish","review":"Gráficos impecables, jugabilidad excepcional... ¿Retos? Probadlo en dificultad 1999 (Sí, a partir del 2000 los juegos empezaron a hacerse asequibles)\n\nLa historia os sumergirá inmediatamente en un mundo tan impresionante como Rapture, pero con mucha menos sensación de claustrofobia. Y sobre todo, cosa que me ha encantado y me ha motivado muchísimo ¡Ya no estrás sólo! No sólo por Elisabeth, si no por todo el elenco de PNJ's que hay distribuidos y que hacen de esta experiencia algo mucho más interesante.\n\nCuidados detalles en la trama argumental harán que te hagas una y otra vez preguntas. Y te harán disfrutar de una historia interesante y apasionante. Llegarás al final deseando que continue.\n\nSólo me queda decir: Este juego ha merecido muchísimo la pena.","timestamp_created":1397331687,"timestamp_updated":1397379851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9798395","author":{"steamid":"76561198127939339","num_games_owned":516,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1428175064},"language":"russian","review":"Просто шедевр!

Isso tudo com gráficos extraordinários e personagens muitos carismáticos e reais. Se você tiver oportunidade não deixe de jogar!\n\nDos 3 DLC, os mais interessantes são da saga \"Burial at the Sea\" (Enterro no Oceano) - O Primeiro episódio mostra um outra visão do primeiro Bioshock com jogabilidade do Infinite, e o Episódio 2, além de uma jogabilidade totalmente nova, mostra uma nova história do primeiro bioshock e alguns detalhes de assuntos em Bioshock Infinite. (Aconselho a todos que antes de jogar o episódio 2, termine o primeiro bioshock, isso vai lhe dar uma visão mais ampla sobre os acontecimentos). O DLC \"Clash in the Cloud\"(Confronto nas Nuvens) é mais no estilo \"se desafie\", com confrontos em área fechadas, também existe a possibilidade de ver a imagens e detalhes dos personagens e bastidores do desonvilmento do jogo.","timestamp_created":1397324046,"timestamp_updated":1397324046,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9798153","author":{"steamid":"76561198080077117","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":845,"last_played":1412109437},"language":"english","review":"This game crashes so much its not funny \nIt has a freaking ton of game breaking glitches on the Mac its not funny\nBut It is very pretty\nso pretty\nVERY PRETTY\ngah I just want to finish it!!!
