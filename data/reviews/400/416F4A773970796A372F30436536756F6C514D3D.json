Portal 1 and 2 are childhood games for me -they are a pair, do not separate them. I played the original right out of 'The Orange Box' and beat it in maybe 6-10 hours spaced out across three days on my old beloved Xbox 360 (It was impressive for my age, I swear- the adults in my life we're impressed at how I beat it faster than they did). My disc of Portal 2 was broken when I was about halfway through the game, and like that disc, my heart was broken. Fast forward several years, and Portal catches my eye again -this time right here on Steam. It's on sale, along with its pair, Portal 2. I get both after a few heart-filled pleas for Steam money.\n.\n.\n.\nI proceed to beat both games in an afternoon.\nGranted, I expected some fairly quick gameplay, being that many a moon had passed since I last thought about the game, but I surprised myself. Portal, despite being easier than I remember, was just as beautiful and pulled at the same heartstrings it did when I was but a young gamer. I cry when listening to 'Cara Mia Addio' and no I'm not afraid to admit it. I feel like I'm connecting to something I was sure I had lost when I play the Portal franchise.\nSo what are you waiting for? Buy the game. buy 'em both. I don't think your heart will be touched exactly the way mine was- heck, I doubt anyone has my exact experience with this franchise- but no matter what, it's a touching game and by god if it hasn't changed the way I look at gaming as a whole, then I'm not me.\nHappy testing :]","timestamp_created":1640206787,"timestamp_updated":1640206787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106311694","author":{"steamid":"76561198114697044","num_games_owned":389,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1640204970},"language":"russian","review":"It's hard to overstate my satisfaction © Still Alive","timestamp_created":1640206519,"timestamp_updated":1640206519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106309995","author":{"steamid":"76561199089088245","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":292,"last_played":1638470644},"language":"turkish","review":"Güzel oyun portal falan var böyle mavi turncu falan \n","timestamp_created":1640204602,"timestamp_updated":1640204602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.655172407627105713","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106309295","author":{"steamid":"76561198239935782","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":345,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":345,"last_played":1619376726},"language":"english","review":"DO NOT BE DECEIVED\n\nTHIS IS IN FACT A VIDEO GAME, NOT A PORTAL!\n\nTitle is completely misleading","timestamp_created":1640203842,"timestamp_updated":1640203842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106308498","author":{"steamid":"76561199087758389","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":135,"last_played":1630323203},"language":"english","review":"YES PORTAL","timestamp_created":1640202931,"timestamp_updated":1640202931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106307250","author":{"steamid":"76561199053320995","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":65,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65,"last_played":1640054930},"language":"english","review":"It's very fun!

so, I'm very late to this, I know, but I just got this game and finished it.\n\nFirst, it doesn't take much time to complete, but isn't short. If you have a few hours, you'll beat it in one day. Just the right length. Second, while it may not seem there's much secrets or any story, I found 2 hidden rooms with some person obsessed over the Companion Cube. Also, the story's pretty interesting. however, you don't hear much of it until the very last part, which makes the game feel a little dragged on and boring after a while. Also, the credit song I loved. So, it's a rather good game. Good for...
