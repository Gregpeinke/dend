This game has an interesting puzzle mechanic with the Portals, and constant witty lines coming from the game's narrating bot (and one giant plot twist that the Internet has managed to spoil for just about everyone). The credits song was so touching that I almost wanted to tear up a little. I wish I had auditioned with it in my high school's talent show, but I can't sing, and didn't first play this game until after my graduation. Oh well. If you find the first runthrough a bit easy, you'll love/hate the challenge levels. They are very, very difficult. Oh lawd.\n\nAll in all, 10 dollars might be a bit steep (I bought it on sale for 2.49), but this game is most definitely a Valve classic that you have to buy. I am looking forward to playing Portal 2 for the first time shortly.\n\ntl;dr this game is a perfect 10. Buy it.

Die Firma ist berühmt für ihre Erfindungen, scheint aber Probleme zu haben, ausreichend Testsubjekte für all diese Erfindungen aufzutreiben, weshalb man die Mitarbeiter nun dazu aufgerufen hat, freiwillig an  Testreihen teilzunehmen. \"Ein Roboter könnte vielleicht schon morgen deinen Arbeitsplatz übernehmen. Beweise uns, dass du ein wertvoller Mitarbeiter bist und melde dich freiwillig für eine Testreihe\", kann man auf einem der Plakate an der Wand lesen. Das Gebäude, in dem du dich befindest, scheint verlassen zu sein. Das einzige was du hören kannst, ist die angenehme weibliche Computerstimme des Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (GLaDOS), die dich freundlich dazu auffordert, an einem Test teilzunehmen. \n\nDiese Tests sind zunächst sehr einfach und bestehen erst einmal darin einen Würfel zu finden und ihn auf einen Schalter zu legen, der dann eine Tür öffnet, durch die man die Testkammer verlassen kann. Stück für Stück werden verschiedene Rätselelemente hinzugefügt, bis man sich schließlich würdig erwiesen hat, das neuste und beste Gerät aus dem Hause Aperture Science zu testen: Die Portalwaffe. Der Begriff Waffe ist vielleicht ein bißchen irreführend, weil man damit niemanden erschießen kann. Man kann mit ihr zwei ovale Portale erschaffen, indem man auf eine bestimmte Art von weißer Wandverkleidung schießt. Diese beiden Portale sind nun miteinander verbunden und wenn man eines der Portale betritt, so kommt man aus dem anderen wieder heraus. \n\nLeider stellt sich schnell heraus, dass unsere bislang recht freundliche Testleiterin GLaDOS gleich an mehreren schweren Persönlichkeitsstörungen zu leiden scheint und dringend die Hilfe eines ganzen Batallions von Psychatern und Therapeuten bräuchte. So werden ihre Kommentare mit der Zeit immer bissiger und die Testkammern Stück für Stück immer gefährlicher, bis sie sich letztlich in den wahnhaften Gedanken hinein gesteigert hat, uns unbedingt entsorgen zu müssen.\n\nSchaffst du es, dem Labyrinth aus Testkammern zu entkommen? Kannst du GLaDOS überlisten? Bist du wirklich schlauer als dieser gemeingefährliche Computer? Wenn du dich traust, erwarten dich viele clevere Rätsel, eine epische Story, ein monumentaler Endkampf Mensch gegen Maschine, die Freiheit natürlich und nicht zu vergessen ein Stück Kuchen, oder war das mit dem Kuchen nur gelogen?\n\n[h1]Umfang[/h1]\nPortal besteht aus 18 Testkammern (Story 12 + 6 fortgeschrittene) und dauert für routinierte Rätselspieler in etwa 5-6 Stunden. Es lässt sich locker an ein zwei Abenden durchspielen. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nDas Gameplay ist absolut tadellos. Ob mit Tastatur und Maus, oder mit einem Controller, Portal spielt sich gleichermaßen gut. Die Spielidee ist einfach und genial. Die Firma Valve hat offenbar ein Händchen für erfolgreiche Computerspiele. Die Testkammern sind ohne Ausnahme sehr clever gebaut. \n\nDer Charakter wird aus der Egoperspektive gesteuert. Portal ist zu etwa 80% ein Rätselspiel, zu 10% ein Adventure und zu 10% ein Geschicklichkeitsspiel. Die geschicklichkeitslastigen Bereiche sind durchweg recht einfach und bieten hin und wieder eine angenehme Abwechslung zu den kopflastigen Knobeleien. Die Geschichte ist originell und witzig. Wer genau hinschaut, entdeckt auch reichlich Gesellschaftskritik. \n\nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad von Portal ist mittel, zumindest sofern man Portal 2 noch nicht gespielt hat, dann wäre der erste Teil eher als leicht einzustufen.\n\n[h1]Grafik und Musik[/h1]\nDie Grafik ist für damalige Verhältnisse umwerfend und auch für heutige Begriffe noch ganz ansehnlich. Die nüchternen und etwas trostlosen Strukturen und Farben des Testlabors schaffen eine beklemmde Atmosphäre. Überall findet man Glasscheiben, hinter denen Testleiterräume zu erkennen sind und haufenweise Kameras. Es dauert nicht lange, bis man sich eingeschlossen und beobachtet fühlt.\n\nDas Spiel läuft auf der Source Engine und schneidet auch auf jedem noch so schlechten Computer sehr ordentlich ab. Die Physik ist überzeugend und ganz gleich in welcher Auflösung, Portal macht immer ein gutes Bild.\n\nDie Musik ist von Jonathan Coulton, einem amerikanischen Musiker, der für seine Lieder über die Geekkultur bekannt geworden ist. \n\n[h1]Kritik[/h1]\nPortal ist schmerzlich kurz ausgefallen.\n\nViel Negatives gibt es nicht zu berichten, dafür eine Menge Positives. Portal hat jeden erdenklichen Spielepreis gewonnen, bei über 23.000 Steam Nutzerreviews 98% positive Wertung erhalten, eine Metacritics-Wertung von 90 und ist sogar vom weltberühmten Museum of Modern Arts New York als eines von 21 besonders wertvollen Spielen in eine Sammlung aufgenommen worden.\n\n[h1]Fazit[/h1]\nSolltet ihr vorhaben, euch in dieses Universum vorzuwagen, dann möchte ich darauf hinweisen, dass man zuerst Portal 1, dann Portal 2 Singleplayer und zuletzt Portal 2 Multiplayer spielen sollte, denn in dieser Reihenfolge verlaufen die Geschichte und auch die Rätselelemente. Sogar die Komplexität und der Lernfortschritt passen sich diesem Schema an.\n\nPortal ist unumstritten ein Klassiker und ein wirklich innovatives Spiel. Es gehört definitiv in jede gute Spielesammlung. Ich habe mich keine Sekunde gelangweilt.

It looks amazing (ignore the mainly white rooms). \n\nThe game is short but if you listen to the commentary (which I did) then you would see that this game was a test, a prototype, into seeing if this type of game will catch on to the general player. It was only in Portal 2 when the game has a back story added in as well as levels outside the testing chambers. \n\nIt was to demonstrate the capibility of the source engine and the minds of the Valve team.\n\nFor £7 though...? No. Portal needs to be bought with Portal 2. \n\nOne of my favourite games is indeed Portal (I say Portal but what I mean is Portal and Portal 2 combained as this Portal game is pretty much a prologue for the second one).\n\n","timestamp_created":1463160077,"timestamp_updated":1463160077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22952080","author":{"steamid":"76561198064345572","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":966,"last_played":1507749809},"language":"english","review":"Portal was the first game in a long time that really surprised me. This was something really new and refreshing amidst all the other games I'd played thusfar. The shooting of the portals, the main gamemechanic, is original and fun! Your mind twists itself to grasp the possibilities these portals bring, in order to solve the puzzlerooms you're in. Don't worry, in the beginning you're guided step by step how to use your portaldevice. \nThere's an ominous, creepy atmosphere, there's great environmental storytelling: as you find your way through this strange building/factory, very little is explained, and yet you're able to piece a story together based on the abandoned rooms and occosional writing on the walls. Of course the ramblings of the Glados-entity are a crucial part of the storytelling. \nReally a musthave game, as well as its sequel Portal 2. In my opinion sequels rarely manage to top the original, but Portal 2 is a nice exception.","timestamp_created":1463136747,"timestamp_updated":1463136805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22950858","author":{"steamid":"76561198150265788","num_games_owned":581,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":288,"last_played":1463129448},"language":"schinese","review":"非常非常！！！有意思的游戏！\n难度的话 全线就18和19关有点难吧？19关时不时卡一下，主要是提示少了点，不过还是非常有趣~\n试想一下如果现实发明了游戏内的枪，那会发生什么？不会失却本来的动能，就是说可以无限叠加~~那就是永动机？！差不多了吧！起码半永动能做到了~\n相信大家都试过在游戏内脚下打一个洞，头上再打一个洞~然后无限往下掉，根本停不下来！根据设定应该是不会失去动能的，然后你无限掉无限叠加速度会越来越快到~到你出不来或被强大的动能扯碎，如果游戏是这样就好笑了~2333 (已经迫不及待想玩2啦，听说2更好玩？！）","timestamp_created":1463130004,"timestamp_updated":1463130004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwooPW1NQCerzGVw=="}
