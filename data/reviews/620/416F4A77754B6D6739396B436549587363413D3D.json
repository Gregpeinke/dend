However aside from the community's work, and just focusing on the game itself the puzzles arent great there just... Good. Now dont get me wrong there creative. But I played Portal 2 from start to finsh (Although I never played the first game.) and they are really really hard. But when I finally understood how to beat it I didnt get that: \"Oh cool!\" feeling. I just got that kinda \"pfft really? Geez so obivous.\" And thats one thing I dislike about the puzzles, now this might not be for everyone but during my playthrough to me I felt kinda mocked as I did not realize how easy and quickly it could be solved when everytime the answer is hidden. But aside from that the game is really good on the dialouge and other things like Co-op, thats pretty cool.\n\nAnother thing I would like to mention is the story, eh. Its ok, some people call it a novel. And im not going to spoil it because it is well written, and has a pretty cool moment at one point or another. But what it really is, is just three characters, one doesnt even talk. And the other two are just robots who are opposites for a while then one of them becomes exactly like the first one. While the second robot just becomes a potato, not this is cool seeing the robot's personality change but eh I dont know. \n\n9/10 Good!\n\nAlso! I received this game for free in case you were wondering. And yes I would recommand it for its price but highly recommend you get it on sale, its a bit pricey, but theres only one payment so for the full content and that helps.","timestamp_created":1485907113,"timestamp_updated":1485907113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29615314","author":{"steamid":"76561198071990463","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1145,"last_played":1642747017},"language":"brazilian","review":"Mais uma excelente obra da Valve.\nO jogo conta com uma narrativa linear que nunca cai em tédio, já que é todo feito de puzzles extremamente bem criados e de dificuldades diversas.\nTem o melhor estilo de ficção científica creepy.

(Note I play through shared libraries, Because I may or may not have forgotten a couple passwords here and there >.>) The stort is amazing, Not as nostalgic as Portal but I adore the humor, elegance and beauty of this masterpiece. Never thought such a simple concept could be turned into such a wonderful game. Beautiful.\n\n_____________________\nPros:\n-Amazing storyline, Doesn't feel linear or straightforward. With hundreds of unique easter eggs from turrets singing to the borealis, it is always replayable. \n-Unique and lovable characters, From the wide diversity of the cores to GlaDos and the turrets, Everything is lovable. \"SPAAAACE\" is by far my favourite line, Hands down.\n-Still looks good, After six years. The game is still beautiful and still has a thriving and big community. Granted the game was made by Valve but nonetheless, Impressive!\n-Humor, This is the games strong point. If you're looking for a game with smartass, witty comments from your enemies/friends. You will love this, It never gets old and every line of dialogue has been carefully planned out and executed.\n-SPAAAAACE\n\nCons:\n-Editor is a bit hard to get a hang of. The limit of items for use without external mods, (BEE, BEE2 etc.) is a huge downside for me. I can't be bothered to install any of that and i expect everything in the story to be available to mappers, Imagine the possibilities if we made dialogue, triggered explosions/animations, using the unique characters and potentially making your OWN story all in the base game. I'd pay an extra $20 just for that.\n-Wasn't a huge fan of Cave Johnsons area of the game. I genuinely found it boring and excessive. But that's personal prefrence, I hugely prefer just the test chambers, Confined and straightforward. (Remember, this is an opinion :c)\n\nOverall, The game is remarkable. 10/10 all round.
