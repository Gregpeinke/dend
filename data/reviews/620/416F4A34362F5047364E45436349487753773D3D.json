Not only is it 98%, but that makes it one of the highest rated games on Steam, above Half Life 2 and many others. If you don't like puzzle games, you might still enjoy Portal 2. The humor makes you want to keep playing. Also, this game is like Easter in terms of easter eggs. There's so many that it's kind of scary. There are even easter eggs inside of easter eggs. If you haven't played the first Portal, I recommend that you play that first. Also, if you have, and didn't enjoy it, you might want to wait for a sale to buy this game if you plan on buying it. \n    Portal 2 is well written, and features the voice talent of J.K. Simmons (Peter Parker's boss, and now Comissioner Gordon!) as Cave Johnson. The addition of gels was a great idea, because it adds more variety to the gameplay. Also, Custom Levels are extremely easy to make, and are fun to play. Co-op levels really do require full cooperation and a headset. It's nearly impossible to communicate without one. \n   With all this being said, Portal 2 is a great puzzle game. This may surprise you, but if you dig deep into the lore of this game and pay really close attention to every detail, Portal 2 is a really creepy game. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I'll just say that it's all very subtle and ambiguous. If you do plan on getting into the lore of Aperture Science, I recommend you read the comic (I forgot the name) and watch a lot of YouTube videos. \n   In conclusion, Portal 2 is one of the greatest modern games, no, one of the greatest games ever, and can be enjoyed by a wide variety of people. I hope that if you buy Portal 2 you enjoy it as much as I did. (I played and beat it on Xbox 360 and here on Steam) \n\n\n\n\n\nP.S.

But it doesnt feel long, its an enjoyable game and the modding adds endless hours. As well as the multiplayer game. The community for multiplayer [You can choose to get matched with a random player if you dont know anyone who has the game] from my experience isnt that bad.
