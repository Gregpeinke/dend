Un juegazo en toda regla.\nPara la época en la que fue publicado destaca muy positivamente en todos los apartados:\n\n-Historia: Por el contrario que sus coetáneos, Half-LIfe se enfoca en la campaña, dejando al multijugador en segundo plano.\nEl juego nos cuenta las aventuras de Gordon Freeman, un investigador del laboratorio Black Mesa.\nÉsta comienza como un día normal en la vida de Gordon, aportando realismo. Pero al realizar un experimento, se abre involuntariamente un portal hacia Xen, lo que provoca que sus habitantes invadan y causen el caos en el laboratorio, dando lugar también a la actuación del gobierno para encubrir el evento.\nLa historia es bastante consistente, y engancha al jugador a descifrar todos sus misterios. \n\n-Gráficos: Se caracteríza por usar una modificación del Quake engine, llamada Goldsource, este le confiere unos modelados muy decentes para su tiempo y unas buenas animaciones, exceptuando la repetición de un único modelo para los guardas.\nEn lo que a efectos y texturas se refiere, se nota el paso de los años, presentando unas texturas en interiores medianamente competentes a día de hoy, pero en exteriores es donde aún se nota más la antiguedad del título, ya que en lugares como el en el desierto, esto es perceptible al observar como están echas las montañas situadas en la lejanía.\nHablando de los efectos, estos siguen notandose antiguos, pero al contrario de las texturas, estos dan mejor la talla.\n\n-Sonido: Half-Life no presenta una banda sonora épica ni memorable, ni falta que le hace, su apertado sonoro destaca por la presencia de efectos de sonido que aumentan la inmersión del jugador en el juego, dando lugar a que éste sienta la soledad que sufre el protagonista en los eventos que acontecen en el título.\nLas diversas armas poseen cada una sonidos característicos que las diferencian bien unas de otras, al igual que cada arma, las criaturas que nos atormentan en nuestra travesía poseen sonidos que nos permiten diferenciarlas perfectamente.\nEl doblaje al español es bastante deficiente, usandose las mismas voces para los científicos y los guardias de seguridad de Black Mesa.\n\n-Jugabilidad: Esta es simplemente excelente, presentando una muy buena curva de dificultad y siendo tremendamente adictiva, presentando una amplia variedad de armas, presentando desde pistolas, hasta lanzacohetes, pasando por armas de rayos.\nLos movimientos del personaje responden bien, aunque transmiten una sensación extraña en secciones enfocadas al plataformeo, siendo este un pelín impreciso.\nLa salud de nuestro personaje se recupera mediante botiquines o máquinas de curación, también presenta indicador de armadura, que reduce el daño recibido en función de como se encuentre de lleno, éste se recupera de la misma forma que la salud.\n\nEn definitiva, es un \"must have\".","timestamp_created":1457814107,"timestamp_updated":1458743679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.422110557556152344","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21797160","author":{"steamid":"76561198032798314","num_games_owned":301,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":382,"last_played":1504899715},"language":"english","review":"Why

I would personally classify it as the definitive PC First-Person Shooter of the late 90’s.\n\nIn the early 2000s, before I could buy my own PC and was rocking a Compaq Presario 6000 with a Voodoo3 card, I can remember playing what I thought was a demo for this game only to now realize that I was playing the “Half Life: Opposing Force” Demo. You can imagine my frustration when playing through Half-Life in 2016 (Yes, it’s taken me this long to get to it.) while screaming “Where’s the monkey wrench?”\n\nIn this game, you play as Gordon Freeman, a 27 year-old doctor on his way to work to analyze crystals from an alien world, but when things go wrong, you have to use whatever you can find at your disposal to escape with many surprises, and betrayals along the way. It’s worthy of a few play-throughs and I personally played through the original release here, the Source Version, and Black Mesa which is a Redo of this game (With the last levels disappointingly missing).\n\nThe game is a somewhat linear, basic feeling shooter that involves action, puzzle solving, and a good bit of strategy. This is a game that forces you to think and I recommend keying the quick save and quick load keys to “c” and “v” respectively. There are varied weapons from the signature crowbar melee weapon to alien weapons, aliens AS weapons, and a gun that charges up and blast helicopters out of the sky. \n\nI appreciate the challenging difficulty that doesn’t hold your hand. It make you take a threat seriously when you can die quickly, something I miss from games of this age.\n\nThe prime objective is finding the path out, with many, many enemies in your way.\n\nClassic PC gaming doesn’t get much more iconic than this.

Having never played a Half-life game, I wanted to jump in with the first in the series, and I was so glad that I did.\n\nBeing an older title with dated graphics, gamers today may be quick to overlook this game and head straight for Half-Life 2 and its consecutive episodes. It could be considered a fair decision given how long it was before HL2 came out. It isn't [i]essential[/i] for you to play this game to enjoy Half-life 2; but I'm here to tell you that despite its age, this game still deserves the right to be rediscovered and enjoyed by newcomers. Half-life 2 gives plenty of references to its origin and they'll go over your head if you don't take a look here first.\n\nThe game can feel clunky at times. The shooting mechanics see plenty of improvements from Valve in later titles, the AI is dumb, the graphics are bleak and there are very few voice actors- but these are caveats that can be easily overlooked once you are invested in the plot and having fun figuring out how to progress through the levels. Not only that but once you learn a little about the context in which this game was released, you'll forgive it entirely.\n\nIt's 1998 and this game busts on to the scene to become the first narrative-driven shooter. Pioneering for its time and provided a benchmark for the genre. Treat your playthrough of this game as a history lesson, let the game transport you backwards in time and afterward you will be left enriched. Do you enjoy using Steam? Valve make great games right? This was Valve's first project. It all began with this game. Play it. If games were like novels this would be required reading.","timestamp_created":1457218273,"timestamp_updated":1457218418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21649138","author":{"steamid":"76561198055391760","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":344,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":121,"last_played":1606252470},"language":"english","review":"Bunny hop everywhere and ignore the story completely!

He sent us many steam sales which killed our wallets instantly, and i will be awaiting HL3 so he can decimate our wallets completely with no hopes of recovering. Half life has brilliant level design and simplistic graphics. This is why it is true art. It doesn't require fancy story line or graphics to be fun, It's just fun. similar to megaman and castlevania story isnt important, nor graphics, but the gameplay. Many people today dismiss 8-bit games like them as bad BECAUSE of their graphics, which overall is stupid, obviously. I really wish people played more games like this to show how good games can be without the graphics. (as long as they are pleasing to look at not barphic textures plasted everywhere) Backtracking in this game isnt needed until one part and its actually guided unlike most backtracking, which is excellent level design. Overall Design of the game and levels, fun factory and graphics are great and I look forward to playing more of the Half life series.","timestamp_created":1457047837,"timestamp_updated":1457047837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21607799","author":{"steamid":"76561198167248501","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1383,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1323,"last_played":1584987599},"language":"czech","review":"Grafika Half-Life 1 samozřejmě není na dnešní dobu nijak nádherná ale na to že hra vyšlaskoro před dvaceti lety je celkem dobrá.

It had everything i desire from a game in 1998. It is impressive. \n\nFor today's standards, it has aged graphics, but still plays extremely well, and is really entertaining. Story is told mostly via dialogue from other characters, as the main character is mute, well at least in the game(s). I doubt he is really mute if he got a job like that.\n\nYou shoot your way through aliens, and soldiers which try to kill everything inside the Black Mesa Facility. Levels are diverse, game is long enough for single player campaign. I love it.\n\nApart from SP, game has multiplayer modes, which probably isn't that much populated. To compensate that, there are tons of mods for HL1. New gamemodes for MP, new maps, whole new single player games. Just google some of the best mods, and you have so many that you won't know which to play. \n\nClassic, you should play this if you have not already. If you have, play it again!\nIf you are turned off by the looks of the game( Which I don't think should be a problem, it's older game)\nLook up Black Mesa on steam. It's HL2 Mod, which remade HL1 into HL2's engine, which better visuals and other tweaks.  Black Mesa is still missing the games ending at the moment( Early 2016), but otherwise it's solid example of good remaster.","timestamp_created":1457006354,"timestamp_updated":1457006354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593538284301757813","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21598970","author":{"steamid":"76561198281516181","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":45237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1775,"last_played":1650008299},"language":"english","review":"GREAT GAME","timestamp_created":1456995561,"timestamp_updated":1456995561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21597997","author":{"steamid":"76561197970888258","num_games_owned":4677,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":61,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1630806803},"language":"norwegian","review":"This is one of the games that are just fantastic and epic, this game started a history of games, like Portal series, Team Fortress series, Counter-Strike series, Day of Defeat series and ofcourse the Half-Life series.\n\nI recommend this game for everyone 10/10 :)","timestamp_created":1456988824,"timestamp_updated":1456988824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58591991662979126","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21597677","author":{"steamid":"76561198071059789","num_games_owned":595,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":304,"last_played":1527505606},"language":"english","review":"also amazing","timestamp_created":1456986627,"timestamp_updated":1456986627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530123472213745117","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21596146","author":{"steamid":"76561198069358725","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1010,"last_played":1456198550},"language":"koreana","review":"난 이거 다 깨고 나서 알았는데, 하프라이프1 소스가 있네;; 가격도 같고... 나처럼 그냥 스토리가 궁금한 사람은 source 버젼이 더 나을듯.","timestamp_created":1456976571,"timestamp_updated":1456976571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p8WkndMCcv+wUg=="}
