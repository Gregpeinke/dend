I mean really you can skip it.\" Of course there is a grain of truth in that statement, when held in the light of Episode 2 or even Half-Life 2, Episode One leaves much to be admired. This can be attributed to the games eco-centric location throughout the ruins of City 17 and the Citadel and the lack of varying companions throughout the game. While doing an excellent job making Alyx seem like a more believable character with well scripted combat sequences and animations you can't help but feel that she's holding your hand through it all. Personally I loved EP1 because the raw urban combat of the final levels of Half-Life 2 were my favorite levels, and Episode One extended on that making for an entire game focused on the best part of HL2. All that being said it's not imperative that you play it, and you can go from HL2 straight to EP2 without worry about missing on vital story points.","timestamp_created":1326055775,"timestamp_updated":1326055775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3637930","author":{"steamid":"76561198025478065","num_games_owned":606,"num_reviews":331,"playtime_forever":208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1371000066},"language":"french","review":"Très bon jeu, même si un peu moins bien que Half-Life 2.\nAlyx Vance est un très bon personnage secondaire, non sexualisé,  à des lieues des personnages féminins clichés des autres jeux.","timestamp_created":1325872734,"timestamp_updated":1325872734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484918802976608276","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1579789","author":{"steamid":"76561197995042519","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":0,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":0},"language":"english","review":"Disappointingly short, but nonetheless an essential game to play if you liked Half Life 2 (which should be just about everyone out there...)
