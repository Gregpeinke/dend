O profeta Comstock é quem reina em Columbia, e é adorado como um deus.\n\nEstamos na pele de Booker DeWitt, um antigo soldado que também trabalhou como um agente. Booker foi enviado para a cidade para resgatar Elizabeth, sendo esta a única forma de se livrar de uma dívida. Elizabeth está mantida em cativeiro por Comstock, que através da propaganda espalhada pela cidade, se refere a ela como ''O Cordeiro de Columbia'' (ou, ''A Semente do Profeta''), preparando-a como a sua sucessora. Ela é considerada perigosa, por isso é mantida trancada em uma torre até que esse dia chegue.\n\nElizabeth pode abrir Fendas, rasgos para outra realidade e criar versões alternativas do mundo. Apesar de não pegar numa arma ou atacar, Ela ajuda durante os combates fornecendo munições, saúde e Sais (Sais são equivalentes ao EVE dos Bioshock's anteriores) além de abrir pequenas fendas que fornecem acesso a pontos importantes, como torretas, proteções e ganchos. Fora do combate vai oferecer o dinheiro que encontra, abrir fechaduras, decifrar códigos e chamar a atenção para algo que possa ter passado despercebido.  \n\n [i]''Um ponto importante para destacar é que, ao contrário da grande maioria dos companheiros de IA ao longo dos tempos, Elizabeth não precisa de babá. Pelo contrário, ela cuidará de você, jogando munição e saúde no meio da batalha''[/i]\n\n\n[h1]COMBATE[/h1]\nO combate de Bioshock continua fantástico, temos metralhadoras, rifles, espingardas, lança mísseis (e granadas), etc. Tudo isto pode ser melhorado com pentes de munição maiores, dano extra, carregamentos mais rápidos e outras características.\n\nAssim como todo Bioshock temos os plasmids... Bolas de fogo, relâmpagos, pequenos ciclones, etc. Tudo que gostamos em Bioshock, agora com grandes combinações. As interações dos plasmids com o cenário continua, ou seja, podemos elêtrocutar uma poça de água, atear fogo em uma poça de óleo, etc.\n\nO combate é ágil no verdadeiro sentido da palavra, graças à sua outra grande evolução: Skylines. Algo semelhante a trilhas de montanha-russa que se estendem pelo mapa e nos permitem deslizar através do cenario. Assim podem tentar alcançar uma posição mais vantajosa ou escapar de uma situação perigosa. Além disso, muitos equipamentos oferecem bónus quando utilizamos esses trilhos.\n\nAo mesmo tempo, o ritmo é quase perfeito. A ação frenética é equilibrada com sequências mais calmas, onde o jogo permite que os jogadores visitem áreas povoadas sem grandes incómodos (a não ser que roubem alguém ou ataquem um guarda). Existe muito para ver e descobrir.\n\n\n[h1]GRÁFICO E SOM[/h1]\nColumbia é um local memorável e tem um ambiente estupendo. A iluminação é impressionante, desde os raios de sol que passam pelas nuvens, as velas da catedral criam um efeito magnífico no interior, a fumaça e o fogo que se vislumbra no horizonte é um espetáculo. As grandes vistas panorâmicas de estátuas, os espaços abertos, os dirigíveis e os bairros, tudo com pequenos detalhes, como as decorações das lojas e as propagandas, tudo foi muito bem produzido.\n\nA atmosfera é acentuada com uma trilha sonora excelente. As interpretações dos atores impressionam, seja ao ouvir a conversa de um casal ou uma discussão marcante na história.\n\nBioshock Infinite é o terceiro jogo da serie Bioshock, muitos dizem que será o ultimo. Mas infinite não encera um arco... ele abra infinitos arcos... afinal, [i]''Sempre há um farol, um homem, uma cidade''[/i]","timestamp_created":1651456905,"timestamp_updated":1651458827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502934277057647705","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114806976","author":{"steamid":"76561198145746416","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":891,"last_played":1651446381},"language":"czech","review":"Gran finale of grand series","timestamp_created":1651447232,"timestamp_updated":1651447232,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114804036","author":{"steamid":"76561198362921318","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":911,"last_played":1653324567},"language":"thai","review":"ตอนเเรกกะว่าจะเสพบรรยากาศในเกมเฉยๆรู้ตัวอีกทีก็จบเกมเเล้ว เนื้อเรื่องดีมากๆ!! ตอนนี้พึ่งเล่น \nDLC Burial at Sea จบได้ดาร์กมากๆ ทำเอารู้สึกผิดที่มาเล่น DLC ต่อเลย ส่วนตัวชอบเเนวนี้อยู่เเล้ว","timestamp_created":1651442315,"timestamp_updated":1657452730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114803641","author":{"steamid":"76561198799245299","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":18,"playtime_at_review":1434,"last_played":1660372915},"language":"english","review":"This is honestly one of my favorite games of all time.. the game manages to be flawless with its Amazing Gameplay and a story that kept me playing it for hours upon hours.. and an ending that makes it into the top 10 best endings ever in video games.. left me breathless..\nmy favorite bioshock of all time.. 10/10","timestamp_created":1651441685,"timestamp_updated":1660371663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114796705","author":{"steamid":"76561199181829967","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":386,"last_played":1652407433},"language":"latam","review":"exelente como toda la saga","timestamp_created":1651432394,"timestamp_updated":1651432394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114796399","author":{"steamid":"76561198009471528","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1809,"last_played":1567252702},"language":"koreana","review":"추천 하기도 그렇고 비추천도 애매함 전투는 재미있는데 스토리가 갑자기 후반에 엘리자베스가 급정색빨고 냉정한척 하는거  빼면 괜찮음","timestamp_created":1651432024,"timestamp_updated":1651432024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114794160","author":{"steamid":"76561199039903511","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1065,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1065,"last_played":1651425436},"language":"english","review":"I found it fun and challenging.

Well.... I agree the game and gun play could have been better in ways, I wish they had stuck with the original Bioshock format on the combat. That being said, the story is EPIC and blows away most of the other game story lines I have played through. Whoever says this story is bad simply didn't get it or are not fans of stuff that might make you think a little bit. Basically, they are basic bitches. I can confidently say that. Allow me to explain. \n\nI first played this game on the Xbox when it released as I was a long time Bioshock fan. I beat the game and understood the core concept which alone is great but it still left so much I didn't know/understand. So... I played it again. This time I paid close attention and gathered all the audio logs. Took about a week on and off piecing things together and writing down the timeline and it split my brain wide open. I wont tell you anything on that other than this. \n\nThe twins, although not critical to the gameplay whatsoever, are extremely important figures in the story. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION to them and find the logs. Seriously you will not regret it at all if you manage to pull it off. \n\nOverall I give this game a 8/10. The only things I would say it lacks is as I said, slightly better combat and maybe a prequel DLC. Otherwise, it's a masterpiece for the time it was made and will remain highly poised as one of the best video game stories I have ever experienced.","timestamp_created":1651343840,"timestamp_updated":1651343840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129016876220703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114735628","author":{"steamid":"76561198092034806","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1347,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":729,"last_played":1654709051},"language":"english","review":"Unpopular opinion: Infinite is the best one in the trilogy","timestamp_created":1651343780,"timestamp_updated":1651343780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506612241268157959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114733670","author":{"steamid":"76561197974622265","num_games_owned":814,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":3608,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2646,"last_played":1652560079},"language":"english","review":"When most games of the first twenty years of the new millenium are forgotten, people will still talk about this one.","timestamp_created":1651341315,"timestamp_updated":1651341315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483870983123779297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114733340","author":{"steamid":"76561199013375019","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1651542671},"language":"english","review":"Very good game with many twists and turns I 100% insist you play this game.","timestamp_created":1651340863,"timestamp_updated":1651340863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483870983123779297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114732274","author":{"steamid":"76561198997230373","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":678,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":533,"last_played":1655400238},"language":"turkish","review":"oyunun 2 kötü yanı var onun dışında bi sıkıntısı yok\n1.eski\n2.oyun biti :(\n(10/9.5)","timestamp_created":1651339508,"timestamp_updated":1651339508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114731350","author":{"steamid":"76561198129641554","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1037,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1037,"last_played":1651338168},"language":"spanish","review":"Una impecable entrega que hace de pre-cuela de los anteriores Bioshock, esta en particular tan bien elaborada la historia como Bioshock y Bioshock 2, a nivel gráfico totalmente inmersivo, un juego que envejece muy bien en todo su apartado técnico, tanto visual como el apartado de sonido que es igual en cuanto a gran calidad.

The enemies and the areas are far less memorable, the only thing that will make you remember an area will be some event you either really liked or hated. For a decent chunk of the game you are just going back and forth from one area to another and even three times in the exact same place just to get to your goal, this ended up being boring and even tho some very interesting things happened with the plot in this time it did not save it. The enemies lost their unique character and the game doesn't have the hard ethical question that made the previous two games what they are. The Handymen are a cheap replacement for the big daddies but they are far far worse. If they hit you your whole screen is usually taken over by their body so you don't even know what is going on. The few choices that you have in the game don't actually make any difference and there also a God awful boss fight against the First Lady, she is a bullet spunge and one of the most unfun bosses I've ever fought. The ending of the game is somewhat familiar to BioShock 2 in the way that is a repetitive fight against lots of enemies with the difference being that in BioShock 2 it was actually interesting cause of Eleanor and Sinclair. The death of the songbird also felt cheap cause: 1. Elizabeth did not need to take it with us through the tear, 2. I felt nothing about the bird, 3. The fact that it got angry just cause the thing we used to \"control\" fell out of our hand feels stupid. Very minor thing that could be better: I would have liked it if Elizabeth had slightly different dialogue as the way she sees Booker changes through the story and it would also be nice if she reacted when you upgraded your Vigors and weapons like the Little Sisters in BioShock 2.

The story while mildly interesting only really intrigued me towards the end. Combat is boring and poorly done, boss fights if you can even call them that are also awful as you can cheese some boss battles with a vendor/store that sells health and ammo. Which brings me to the next problem, ammo is incredibly scarce, you'll constantly be running out and you can only carry two weapons at a time. This wouldn't be a problem if the game was super fast paced and you could always find a weapon, but during the cemetery fight you'll almost certainly run out of ammo and the only way to progress is to die for ammunition as there are no weapons or no ammunition within the enclosed fight. \n\nAt least Elizabeth rule 34 is pretty decent, that's the only real positive I can think of when it comes to this title.
