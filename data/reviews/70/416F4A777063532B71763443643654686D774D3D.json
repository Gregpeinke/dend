It is there, according to the plot, that the federal research center of gigantic proportions, bearing the name \"Black Mesa\", is located, and it is there that a number of top-secret studies are carried out. The main character of the game is a young talented researcher Gordon Freeman, who works in the laboratory of anomalous materials.\n\nAn average-cleared scientist is unaware of the dangers of the work ahead. One morning, Gordon is sent to the test chamber for routine crystal analysis. The consequences of the experiment, however, are disastrous. The explosion of the crystal breaks a gap between the dimensions, from where alien forces begin to attack the Earth. Gordon, caught between the aliens and the US Army, seeks to get out of the complex before he is found and destroyed.","timestamp_created":1642228887,"timestamp_updated":1642228887,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527220606803894043","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108036350","author":{"steamid":"76561199162598794","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":619,"last_played":1648041864},"language":"english","review":"Play NOW!","timestamp_created":1642228205,"timestamp_updated":1642228205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108033193","author":{"steamid":"76561198080454346","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":44113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44113,"last_played":1595648017},"language":"english","review":"can be scary at times. well within acceptable range.","timestamp_created":1642223652,"timestamp_updated":1642223652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108031666","author":{"steamid":"76561199229242687","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":60,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1648756226},"language":"english","review":"this is great","timestamp_created":1642221519,"timestamp_updated":1642221519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108030050","author":{"steamid":"76561198836753481","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1654909446},"language":"spanish","review":"juegaso","timestamp_created":1642219272,"timestamp_updated":1643255910,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108028925","author":{"steamid":"76561198078652208","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1018,"last_played":1642977594},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor Jogo criado em toda historia da criação.

never enjoyed this game and I honestly struggle to truly understand why. It left such a mediocre taste in my mouth that it took me 8 years to get around to the rest of the franchise - Which I now love. It's for this reason that I wouldn't recommend this to new players, yet I strongly enjoyed Black Mesa (a modernised remake). I would recommend buying that instead as it does what the rest of the franchise does well and adds a bit more of an atmosphere. I can't write too deep a review as it's been 8 years since I played it, but having remembered parts through Black Mesa I would say that conceptually it was fantastic and anyone looking for an old school shooter without any modern visuals should go ahead and buy this over Black Mesa. Honestly a true technical marvel of it's time, but it just didn't resonate with me in any way.","timestamp_created":1642175793,"timestamp_updated":1642175793,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480349332094192505","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107989249","author":{"steamid":"76561198856643788","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1655710104},"language":"polish","review":"genious classic","timestamp_created":1642174683,"timestamp_updated":1642174683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107986905","author":{"steamid":"76561199230567915","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":42,"last_played":1643088881},"language":"russian","review":"очень жиза\n","timestamp_created":1642172194,"timestamp_updated":1643017108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107986049","author":{"steamid":"76561198982172675","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":457,"last_played":1657377187},"language":"english","review":"This game is the  best thing that I saw in my life.","timestamp_created":1642171237,"timestamp_updated":1642171237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107986002","author":{"steamid":"76561198452479450","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1626,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":395,"last_played":1642879257},"language":"brazilian","review":"Por favor, só não tente exterminar os Houndeye !!","timestamp_created":1642171198,"timestamp_updated":1642171198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107984345","author":{"steamid":"76561198378650680","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1111,"last_played":1650544536},"language":"english","review":"Just finished this game and it took me way longer than i expected, partially because i finished portal in a couple of hours and expected the same of half life. \n\nI think its a fun game, graphics, bugs, weird movement, dialogue volume too low compared to environment noise in certain sections i can excuse to it being an old game/ being an fps. \n\nI haven't played an fps before and maybe that's why i struggled with this game a bit but on several occasions i had to load last save a ton of times in order to get a section done or clear enemies with enough health/ammo (this holds true especially for the later sections). \n\nSome parts took way too long but that was sometimes because of me missing an interactive button or lever. Or not knowing that there was passage through that particular area but that's okay. That's what exploration is about.\n\nThe later sections were really hard for me and I had to look up a walkthrough for the final three sections due to not being able to figure out that i could destroy crystals/struggling with a fight/again not know that there was a passage in a particular place.\n\nThe story was a bit hazy for me since we travelled a lot and things were very diverse from what we originally started with.\n\nOverall i don't know I give this game a positive or a negative but I think its worth trying out anyway.
