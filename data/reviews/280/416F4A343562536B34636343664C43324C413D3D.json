I recommend playing the original.\n\nThe benefits in this version are mostly water effects, slight lightning improvements, enemy ragdolling and easier object pulling/pushing. Most of the disadvantages are listed below.\nThe story is simple and the game's got many weird elements compared to the current FPS's, but it's still a great game and a classic. Looks like it takes like 9 hours to complete when you loot every place, but know where to go and what to do.\n\nTo list a of a few really annoying or game breaking things, many compared to original Half-Life:\n-HITBOX/HIT REGISTERING PROBLEMS!\n    -The blast pit monster doesn't do damage to you or the security guard who's supposed to die.\n    -The leeches have almost non existent hitbox.\n    -The helicopter doesn't seem to register hits from gauss or RPG (didn't get it to even smoke).\n    -The gonarch or whatever has a crappy hit registering.\n    -The final boss has a crappy hitbox (I have beaten him in normal half-life with hard difficulty many times and this was 5 times harder in easy difficulty)\n-HORRIBLE VISUAL ARTIFACTS in \"residue processing\" and somewhere else too.\n-NPCs go \"YAARRG\" every 0.5 seconds if they are damaged.\n-The crowbar makes a metal hitting sound when you hit any object and so gets really irritating when destroying boxes.\n-The boxes take more time to break with crowbar, which adds to the previous annoyance.\n-You jump higher than you should (IE You can jump crouch straight on top of a box in the laser tripmine building)\n-The barnacles lower their tongue really slowly, but they can catch you when their tongue isn't lowered yet. This leads to some funny scary moments though.\n-Missing dialog/AI problems.\n\nAnd if you're new to Half-Life (and don't know whats supposed to happen or where to go):\n-You can jump crouch above one vent in \"we've got hostiles\" vent maze section, get behind a fence and get stuck in an area you've been before (your auto saves will get replaced by the being stuck ones too).\n-You see only blackness through the dam turbines, which has lead people to think it's not the right way and get stuck.\n-You can shoot the scientist through the glass in \"apprehension\" and the game doesn't end, so you can't get the door open.\n-The missing dialog/AI problems can really confuse you.\n\nIf you're hard-core and want the authentic Half-Life experience, buy the cds and patch the game to 1.1.1.0, cause the steam \"original\" version is bugged in many ways too nowadays. I would actually say that this Source version has better working AI in general than the other steam version.","timestamp_created":1413080552,"timestamp_updated":1413081252,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495110929012298584","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12454762","author":{"steamid":"76561198059791889","num_games_owned":319,"num_reviews":270,"playtime_forever":919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":919,"last_played":1408788055},"language":"english","review":"Hey Gordon","timestamp_created":1413061945,"timestamp_updated":1500115735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498392283916473389","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12443270","author":{"steamid":"76561198050385684","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":766,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":689,"last_played":1414934792},"language":"french","review":"Si vous découvrez ce jeu, tentez plutôt l'original (Half-Life tout court)  sinon lisez les critiques de Half-Life Source AVANT de tenter le remake qui n'apporte rien (certainement pas une meilleur expérience de jeu, ni de magnifiques graphismes comme on serait en droit de l'attendre, ni même rien de notable d'ailleurs.. en dehors de nouveaux bugs qui n'existaient pas à l'époque d'Hal-Life).\n\nHalf-Life Source est donc une erreur, une divergeance temporelle, un accident cosmique : il n'apporte rien et pire encore il :\n\n- supprime certain détails (moins gore par exemple)\n- rend les temps de chargements carrément plus longs et détestables entre chaque niveaux, lag en pleine action à cause de la même raison\n- lisse la difficulté qui devient en mode le plus dur clairement casual (je suspecte la sélection de la difficulté d'être buggée puisque c'est un jeu d'enfant en mode extrême..........) \n- sans parler d'éléments de jeu originaux qui ont disaprus\n- contrairement aux nombreux bugs qui eux se sont invités en famille....\n\n...et surtout le remake Source rend ridicule l'eau ou textures soit disant HD car au final, le jeu reste vieux et ceux qui veulent découvrir cet excellent jeu devraient se tourner vers l'original pour au moins une raison : c'est l'original en bien et en mal!

In some cases, the bugs can actually BREAK THE GAME. For example: On occasion, if you respawn after you die, you will spawn with NO WEAPONS. The game also seems to be signifcantly harder than the original. Now normally, this wouldn't seem so bad, but chapters such as \"We've got hostiles\", and ANY of the Xen levels really become a chore. Overall, if you're going to buy Half-Life, buy the original. In all reality, you should only really buy this for some Garry's Mod content. In the end, I am going to give this a 5/10.

This is just a much worse, buggier version of HL1. Avoid and play original.\n\nHalf-LIfe: Source is a, ehem, \"remake\" of Half-Life 1, which in this case means \"we took HL1 recources and transfered them off GoldSrc engine to Source Engine\". And yes, it contains single-player campaign of HL1... DeathMatch portion was released serapately later. Though now that you can only purchase bundle of Source with DM, it doesn't matter much. Yes, it comes with HD models from Blue Shift bundled\n\nSo, what remake brought? Nothing major. Just small things here and there. First, default things from engine changes - dynamic shadows from flashlight that HL2 Episode 2 brought into engine, for example. There is more of metallic reflective textures, that look ugly in the darkness. The water was changed into HL2 style one... Means more transperency yet the rippling animation was removed. Enemies don't have death animations anymore - they use ragdoll... Which sometimes looks clunky with low-polygon monsters. There are even occasional decoration object that now uses physics, like hooked boxes. And you don't throw boxes away over the hills when you try to move box sideways. At least it all comes along with HD Models pack from Blue Shift.\nOne of the non-graphics changes got to be improved AI, which I also think came. NPCs always react finely, while in original they would often first turn around slowly to face the threat. Security officers that follow you don't get lost as easily, you can even forget about babysitting them. And where in original they had \"shoot at some aliens\" as high priority, \"follow the player\" seems to be higher one in this remake... Which means that they will not shoot a thing if they will be busy following strafing player. Guards are better at guard duty, yep. On one of the notes, flying enemy with huge brain in final parts of games is now more aggresive, attempting to get into your face, all the time!\nSome of the damage values were changed. The biggest example got to be clowbar, it got buffed... Now, just like in HL2, it takes only one hit of this tool to bring down Headcrabs and Barnacles.\nSome of small bugs in HL1 were fixed, some new small bugs were added. Oh yea, and music stops when you go to the next area. \nBut overall, original is safer bet as mods for HL1 will work with original, not Source remake. But Source one isn't bad either. Much better looking today, at 2014 year thanks to engine updates, while at time of release it didn't look like it added much.\n\nDeathmatch multiplayer part of remake was released after single-player part and comes by default with bundle on Steam... But let's just say, it's dead and not worth checking out.\n\nP.S. I approve ability to start at any chapter, easier to pick up.","timestamp_created":1407768137,"timestamp_updated":1566932004,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494249790906906128","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11645708","author":{"steamid":"76561198045076710","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1529878382},"language":"brazilian","review":"Classico é classico... e com graficos melhores ainda.\nPra mim o melhor FPS de todos","timestamp_created":1407718631,"timestamp_updated":1407718631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562173843383789063","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45bSk4ccCfLC2LA=="}
