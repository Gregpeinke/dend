Surpasses the previous 2 BioShock games in all ways.\n\nGraphics are really good compared to the 2 past games.\nSounds are good.\nMusic is good and quite appropriate for the era the game is set in.\n\nStory is really good. Ending was not entirely surprising to me, as a few key moments in the story hinted at what was to come.\n\nGameplay is great and allows for numerous tactics and styles to fit in with how someone would play.\n\nFor anyone playing on a modern system, make sure you cap your frames per second to 60 or even 59, set vsync on and compatibility mode for Windows 7. This game glitches out badly with the UI in the game if frames exceed 60. You can't pick up objects, search containers or even quit the game once the bug hits and need to alt-tab out the game and restart the PC.

Music, people, environments are done really well, again. Colombia is a sight to see. Booker and Elizabeth are voiced pretty well.\n-Okay gameplay\nGameplay is mostly same with much more verticality. There are also little side missions. Weapon, vigor and equipment upgrades are more basic. I used handcannon and RPG most of the time.\n\nIt is definetely a game everyone should experience. Story, characters and environments are it's most powerful aspects even though it's a shooter.\n\nBurial in the Sea:\nFirst DLC is basicly fan service for Rapture but a good one.

V prvé řadě se [spoiler]skoro[/spoiler] neodehrává v podvodním městě Rapture, ale ve vzdušném městě Columbia, kde je až fanaticky uctíván jeho stvořitel a prorok Otec Comstock. Celý tento kult je doplněn skvěle zpracovanou propagandou v podobě krátkometrážních filmečku a plakátů. A právě toto společně se steampunkovou architekturou ve stylu první republiky dodává vynikající atmosféru, která je v mých očích i o něco málo lepší než u prvního dílu, který už sám o sobě nasadil laťku docela vysoko. \n\nSpolečně s novým prostředím pak přicházejí i noví nepřátelé. Zapomeňme tak na splicery, velké taťky a malé či velké sestřičky. Zde jsou proti nám [spoiler]různě ozbrojení zfanatizovaní lidé, lidé v robotických oblecích a nebo třeba moji oblíbení motorized patrioti, tedy roboti s rotačákem.[/spoiler] Čili, jsme zproštění nostalgického opakování z předchozích dílů a dostáváme nové nepřátele, kteří se ale drží navozeného stylu.\n\nCo se zbraní týče, tak výběr se podle mě opět povedl. Hlavně musím ocenit brutalitu zabíjení vrtákem na blízko, nebo třeba při skoku z výšky. Místo plasmidů jsou pak vigory, které jsou si v něčem podobné a v něčem zase úplně jiné. Ale hlavně, dají se efektivně kombinovat. Jediné, co mě pak ze začátku přišlo podivné bylo to, že můžu mít u sebe pouze dvě zbraně. Když se nad tím ale zamyslím, tak proč ne? Booker prostě není Rambo, takže prostě víc zbraní neunese.\n\nPříběh samotný je podle mě velmi povedený. Je pravdou, že jsem ze začátku úplně nepochopil možnosti [spoiler]přechodů mezi realitami, ale po chvíli jsem si zvykl, hlavně při možnostech využití v boji[/spoiler]. Samotný závěr [spoiler]pak byl podle mě až moc složitý, takže jsem chvílemi některé části nepobíral. Nicméně, po čase se mi to v hlavě dalo nějak dohromady a všechno to do sebe zapadlo. A na rovinu se klidně přiznám, že jsem až tak obrovský plot twist tentokrát nečekal.[/spoiler]\n\nAbych ale jenom nechválil, ve hře jsem narazil i na pár prvků, které mě tak trochu štvaly. Především to bylo automatické ukládání. Několikrát se mi stalo, že jsem potřeboval odběhnout a hru vypnout. Ale nikdy jsem nevěděl jak daleko jsem od posledního checkpointu a jak daleko je ten další. Tak trochu mi chyběla nějaká automapa a taky se mi občas stávalo, že jsem měl málo paklíčů, takže jsem se pak musel na dané místo zpětně složitě dostávat, což byla někdy otrava. [spoiler]A ta Lady Comstock taky nemusela být tak tuhým protivníkem, nějak si nedokážu představit, jak bych ji dal v 1999 modu[/spoiler].\n\nCo říci na závěr? Hra na rozdíl od předchozího dílu nerecykluje jedničku, ale sází na nové neotřelé místo, které si drží skvělou atmosféru. Příběh se podle mě taky povedl, hratelnost je taky víceméně bezproblémová.

Я был в \"Восторге\" от атмосферы, сюжета, геймплея и с удовольствием прошел ее, что насчет второй части?\n\nII.Вторая часть - это первая, но более скучная, долгая и  незамысловатая, в нее неохото возвращаться и тяжело играть из-за нудного процесса: Найди сестричку, убей папочку, стань папочкой, найди Адам, отбей атаку, и возьми Адам у сестрички, и так 3 раза в каждом уровне.

Shooting is solid but lacks a lof of the choice and interactivity that the original game had. Story is \"im 14 and this is deep\" bait. \n\nLevels feel like levels, not actual real lived in spaces like in Biochock 1's rapture. They have a \"museum\" feel to them and there is very limited interaction in them. The art direction and design is top notch though.\n\nShooting has been improved at the expense of depth/choice and utility in the plasmids. Now each \"vigor\" is just another way to deal damage, rather than a way to exploit a weakness of an enemy. Enemy variety is pretty lacking with most enemies being grunt soldiers, in which the game throws 8-10 of them to you at a time. Kill all of them, walk to the next \"arena\" rinse and repeat. There are no more tense moments of encountering splicers fighting big daddies or splicers surprising you. Its the same formula repeated throughout. \n\nWon't get into the story, the ending is convoluted and you will need to look up what actually happened. Many people consider this \"deep\" and therefore praise the game for it. The characters are forgettable unlike Andrew Ryan and CM Porter in B1 and Minerva's Den. \n\nThe 2011 E3 demo set the hype too high. I hope they deliver a bioshock game in the next one instead of a standard 2 gun FPS with bioshock elements.","timestamp_created":1629258607,"timestamp_updated":1629258607,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.432066500186920166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97777492","author":{"steamid":"76561199025833455","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":658,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":581,"last_played":1644678484},"language":"schinese","review":"巴黎为何这么遥远.....","timestamp_created":1629258396,"timestamp_updated":1629258396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97775549","author":{"steamid":"76561198400721203","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1629255298},"language":"turkish","review":"SAMANYOLU DİZİSİ","timestamp_created":1629255388,"timestamp_updated":1629255388,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97771960","author":{"steamid":"76561199186008909","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1642554626},"language":"spanish","review":"muy buen juego","timestamp_created":1629250005,"timestamp_updated":1629250005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97763894","author":{"steamid":"76561198156190792","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1656460844},"language":"spanish","review":"ta piola, tan piola que lo compre xd","timestamp_created":1629237178,"timestamp_updated":1629237178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540000021457672119","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97761271","author":{"steamid":"76561198051024728","num_games_owned":350,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1409192778},"language":"english","review":"Bisohock Infinite was the most ambitious title in the series, and the most disappointing.

Yes, it looks good, but my god, the atmospheric audio is the best in the biz, & I'm a pro audio engineer, so my ear knows.  There's so much love & detail put into the game, that it oozes out of  your monitor. It's no secret that the game's staggeringly beautiful, so much so, that it can hold it's own, w/many games released today.  If you're considering a replay or finally purchasing it, just do it. \n\nThis was technically my first game as an adult.  When I was 13, I played Super Metroid religiously, but then I got into girls & that was the end of that.  As a musician/composer, I didn't have the time for gaming, then later as an engineer, impossible, but then I got old, & was prescribed gaming therapy for some neuro issues I struggle with, & Bioshock Infinite was the 1st game I HAD to play. With all the hype,& in particular, the ad campaign, & w/all the buzz from the community, I had to find out what it was all about.  A couple months later, I'd find one of the only other games that has ever captured my devotion entirely (I guess I'm really picky?), & that's the infamous Fortnite, which I still play today, (I can see some artistic influences) & I'm one of only a handful of 40yr + players to ever qualify for FNCS finals. I've  grinded only a few games over the past 4 years & it's helped manage my neurological problems to a near miraculous degree, when nothing else did.  I was the worst. I was new to everything, from game mechanics, to KB/M, & it took me a year to become \"decent\".  \n\nPoint being; when I came back to Bioshock Infinite, on just medium difficulty, I got into some sticky situations a few times, because the game is legit challenging.  I can head-shot nearly everything that pops up (Thank you Kovaak), but the NPC's are pretty smart & quick.  They come from all sides, so no camping, & I actually died a couple times :steammocking: after deciding I could play thru w/o a death lmao.  I have no shame admitting that.  What did really surprise me, was my last save from playing it in 2017; surprisingly only 20hrs play-time, after I really struggled with the game as a noob?  I didn't realize or understand that guns could be upgraded.  Or that all the clothes were \"armor\", that I was supposed to wear & that could also be upgraded.  It all makes me wonder how in the F, I actually completed the game?  I know it's probably a 6-8 hr avg play-thru, but I can't over-state how bad I was, & how little I knew take advantage of.  That's the past tho, & thanks in part to this amazing game, my short-term amnesia treatment has been greatly improved, & that feels like a real miracle, even tho it took years of losing PvP matches in other games to get to where I am today.  It all started with Bioshock Infinite.

While 2 was certainly better than 1 in that regard (particularly through the addition of dual wielding), neither has the kind of enemy design or level design to be especially worth playing over other single player FPS games without the benefit of RPG systems to become stronger or the story to keep the player motivated.\nInfinite suffers from poor enemy design and poor level design even more than its contemporaries.  The levels often boil down into fairly basic rooms that are locked until you dispatch all the enemies in them, with little in the way of interesting elevation or terrain features (including skyhook) to take advantage of.  The enemies are, themselves, fairly braindead and even those with unique powers like the Fireman or Handymen don't have expanded AI as much as they have larger pools of health and new toys to hit you with that don't differ so radically from guns and skyhooks of normal enemies.\nBut, Infinite now introduces some new and original issues as well, problems one would assume that anyone making an RPG or FPS wouldn't make in the year 2013.\n== Progression and Death ==\nIn Bioshock Infinite, you get stronger via upgrading your guns and getting new gear.  You upgrade your weapons by purchasing upgrades for them with money.  However, money is also the main resource you lose when you die.  The practical upshot of this is that if you enter a certain encounter that is giving you problems due to your weapons being too weak and not having enough ammo, then you'll most certainly end up actually getting weaker by the end of it because you'll lose your 'experience' needed to make your weapons stronger.\nIn Bioshock 1 and 2, weapon upgrades were handled via dedicated, single-use upgrade booths rather than by the same resource you lost when you died.  This meant that when you died, you lose your chance to get more Health and Adam boosting items, but you weren't set back in your progression.  You lost time and convenience, not progress.\nThis issue is compounded by the fact that in Bioshock Infinite, in an attempt to present itself as a more serious FPS, the player is limited to carrying only two weapons at a time.  This, on it's own, is not an issue.  However, the ammo drops in each combat space are specific to the enemies' weapons you encounter in that space.  In other words, if you've got a pistol and a shotgun but all the enemies are using machine guns, then you're not likely to run into a lot of pistol or shotgun ammo.  This means you have to make a frustrating choice between keeping the weapons you've bothered upgrading or getting a weapon that has ammo available for it in your current area.  And that new weapon you pick up has to be upgraded separately of the other weapons as well.\n== Plot and Politics ==\nThe biggest issue with Bioshock Infinite though, by far, is that the plot is a major step back from that of its predecessors, both in its characters and its overarching events.  Bioshock 1 and 2 explored opposite sides of extreme economic theories falling apart in practice due to their incompatibility with contradictions in human behavior.  The failings of Andrew Ryan and Sofia Lamb is the overly simple model of human beings they construct in their heads to make their economic beliefs hold true.\nBioshock Infinite, by contrast, attempts to do the same with partisan political beliefs but ends up comparing apples to oranges.  It initially presents a society ingrained with abusive and bigoted beliefs, both in its citizenry and its laws, as the form of extremism for one side of the political aisle.  However, it chooses to compare that form of mundane horror to a more rare but shocking one in the form of a socialist/communist revolution gone out of control.  This centrism compares what was to what might be but only explores each at their most shallow level, and explores the contrast between these potentials even less.\nIdeally, the equivalent of Columbia for the Vox Populi would look something like a Stalinist Authoritarian regime, the kind that would come to sweep Russia and China in the 40s.\nThe choice to present the Vox Populi's extremism as an extravagant version of the Storming of the Bastille rather than the Reign of Terror might indicate how little thought was given to the text of the subject matter the writers were tackling.\nThis is wrapped up in the quantum mechanics plot point, wherein the idea of 'multiple possible worlds' is presented but used only to suggest that \"dude, anything could happen\" without properly tying the idea back to the core \"themes\" of almost nihilistic moral relativism presented in the previous political comparison.","timestamp_created":1629167892,"timestamp_updated":1629167892,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97709891","author":{"steamid":"76561198352142610","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1093,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":799,"last_played":1632699380},"language":"latam","review":"seex","timestamp_created":1629162080,"timestamp_updated":1629162080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97695979","author":{"steamid":"76561198345725444","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":631,"last_played":1635222963},"language":"latam","review":"Que puedo decir, el juego en sí me gusta bastante, su historia es interesante, diría que me gusta más que los dos primeros BioShock.\nEl juego tiene un problema, no hay un balance entre la acción y la historia como en half life, si no que estás en un constante tiroteo con enemigos, no hay descanso y eso llega a ser agobiante. \nEn general está bien, pero no es la joya que muchos dicen que es.\n\n7/10\n\n","timestamp_created":1629141715,"timestamp_updated":1629141715,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97689811","author":{"steamid":"76561199003919803","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1808,"last_played":1629410327},"language":"english","review":":thumbs_up: i like brutally murdering cops","timestamp_created":1629134163,"timestamp_updated":1629134163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97685808","author":{"steamid":"76561198326081408","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":514,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":514,"last_played":1629128195},"language":"schinese","review":"朋友介绍我入坑的，游戏成功地从各个方面惊艳到我了，我很难用语言去评价这样的一个艺术品，好评就对了","timestamp_created":1629129582,"timestamp_updated":1629129582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw25Tsp/sCcJPS9AI="}
