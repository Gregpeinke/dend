It's set in the same world and environment only this time from the perspective of one of the U.S. Marines of which were the enemy in the original game.\n\nI always enjoyed these add-ons for the different perspectives that overlapping ever so slightly. The detail in these games are great and despite how old they are i still really enjoy them. For me they are quite nostalgic to play, but i imagine maybe for others who are just now coming across these games, they might look a bit crap. With that said, i'd hope that the story would be enough to keep the new audiences interested. \n\nThe game runs great for it's age. The resolution for my screen wasn't compatible but it wasn't too bad, it was still very playable. Unlike my recent playthrough of Half-Life: Source, this one actually had no bugs or anything that stopped me in my tracks. I had no problems with this game from start to finish. Although, this game was a quite a bit shorter.\n\nI sunk about 5 hours into this game and completed it in that time, compared to the original game, which took me a lot longer, this game is fairly short. With that said it's still a great addition to the franchise. As far as mods go, this one was great. \n\nThere are interesting new additions in this game, a few of which i forgot about. New races of alien, new human enemies and new weapons. All of which kept the game interesting instead of it just feeling like the first one. Again, there is never a dull moment in these games as there is always something around the corner. Some of the puzzles in this game impressed me, as they were just as creative, if not more so, then the first game.\n\nAll in all I've definitely recommend this game if you have played the first one and can put up with the old style of the game.\n\n\nTL;DR : A great add-on to the original game, it's old but classic. You play from a different perspective from the first, get new weapons, fight new enemies and it's generally just a lot of fun, although shorter then the original game. \n\n\nFor anyone interested, My Review for Half-Life: Source:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/280","timestamp_created":1452364231,"timestamp_updated":1452383013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.700396239757537842","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20414198","author":{"steamid":"76561198044881290","num_games_owned":434,"num_reviews":126,"playtime_forever":754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":754,"last_played":1452320207},"language":"spanish","review":"Superior que el spin-off Blue Shift, en este se siente más el paso de las fuerzas militares contra esos aliens.","timestamp_created":1452320385,"timestamp_updated":1452320385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517786562442779541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20390854","author":{"steamid":"76561198154153201","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":720,"last_played":1654971566},"language":"russian","review":"хороший сюжет\nразнообразное оружие и враги\nминусы:\nужасная графика\nнедоработанный ии Npc\n\nигра не очень хороша в ней хоть и хороший сюжет и пушки но графика и нпс убивают на повал\n\nоценка 3/10","timestamp_created":1452233410,"timestamp_updated":1452233410,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.268638730049133301","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20367771","author":{"steamid":"76561197977627767","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2887,"last_played":1621817995},"language":"english","review":"Will forever be my all-time favorite of the original Half-Life expansions <3 Highly recommended for fans of the HL universe.","timestamp_created":1452144044,"timestamp_updated":1452144044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20352161","author":{"steamid":"76561198112346840","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":488,"last_played":1452310612},"language":"russian","review":"Игра не удивила сюжетом.

As I mentioned in my HL review, I wasn't too happy with Half Life's pacing - the environmental changes that were supposed to delay you were all too random-like - it was just obvious that game mechanics with the sole purpose of slowing you down. It was really unreal. Similarly, it kind of bothered me that even though Gordon IS the archetype of the clever protagonist, the man of science who rises and fights back - it's just surreal that every other scientist is older than him, and can't protect themselves at all. Hell, Gordon was more capable of fighting than the guards, employed by Black Mesa.\n\nSo, back to Opposing Force. You play with a soldier (not a bad guy, you don't need to kill scientists if you don't want to) , and your standard gear will be a Deser Eagle and a combat knife - I really liked how realistic this part is compared to Gordon's. The story and the character harmonizes, your character, and even HIS ACTIONS have their part and place in the story. Additionally, claimed by wiki it's his training, Shephard can climb ropes, which is an intresting mechanic in the game, and opens new dimensions in movement and game variety. \n\nAnd at this point I still have 3 great things to say about the game, but they are kind of interlope - \nfirst of all, the game introduces numerous new weapons - M249 (brutal machinegun), Displacer Cannon, Sniper rifle, the already mentioned Deser Eagle and then - New alien weapons! The rocket-launcher-like Spore Gun, the Shock Roach (my favourite) and the Barnacle Grapple.\n\nSecond great thing is partly about Barnacle Grapple - it can be used as a good-ish melee weapon, but it's main usage is just crazy - it can stick to any organic surface, including some pods on the walls, that appeared along with the alien invasion.  You have a grapple that can be used to close distances and move around some parts of the map - it's just brilliant. \nThe Second Great Thing is the creativity of level design. FINALLY the expansion, while being shorter than the base game, uses it's features much more frequently, while inserting these into the game almost flawlessly. There are not only  \"push the box 3 metres to the right to jump\" parts, there is a part when the same box needed to be used 3 times! I guess this is because they knew that after playing the base game, the player will know that they can be moved, and as s/he's accustomed with the feature, can use it in a more varied way.\n\nAnd the third great things is the overall game integrity. It's good, in my opinion way better than the base game was.  There is way less button pressing - once you need to free a medic to take care of the engineer, who can afterwards open a door with a flame cutter. Much intresting than pressing two buttons, isn't it?  Most blockades during the game are legit - a huge worm or pillars of flame in the waste burner(?). Things that delay your progress won't just randomly happen, but your way goes through paths where they delaying elements DO exist, making - at least in my eye - Opposing Force a much more immersive game then the original story.\n\n(On the sidenote - bossfight was less monumental, but far less frustrating than repeadly missing jumps in the shower of electric discharges of Nihilanth)\n\nI won't throw numbers around, but while I felt Half-Life was fun/good,  I *loved* Opposing Force. I wholeheartedly recommend this purchase if you enjoyed the base game, and you're intrested in the expanded story.","timestamp_created":1451952904,"timestamp_updated":1451954557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":67,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.827496111392974854","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20308704","author":{"steamid":"76561198026321058","num_games_owned":538,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2889,"last_played":1587238968},"language":"english","review":"A

I think this has more to do with the Steampipe version as I don't recall having any issue when I first played this game 10+ years ago. The game crashes when you sometimes load or go back a map meaning that you have to go back to the last autosave at times. There are numerus bugs throughout the game, you often get stuck in lifts and you can get stuck in walls during map translation (although that is also present in HL), furthermore there is a section where the roof of a lift goes through the bottom acting as separate lifts if one part gets blocked. There is one section where a scripted NPC is talking and mid-sentence he says one of the random idle lines and doesn’t finish the scripted line. But more importantly there is a major sound issue right at the end, the volume level of a section of a map is really really high, if you were playing the games moderately loud with headphones this could literally cause pain before you were able to turn the volume down.\n\nAs for the game itself, the map design doesn’t match that of Half-Life’s. In HL everything was well thought through and everything was in its place, in this things are a bit random. A couple of times there are scripted sequences that open up your path, these are obvious and makes the game fell scripted. There are reused sections from HL, although these have been altered and are not meant to be the same place as the ones visited in the original, there is even one section that seemed to be reference to a map in HL but it was evidently different and happened after another map, where that map happened first in the original. In addition there is not much of a story, at all.\n\nThe same can be said for the enemies, they are uninspired, overpowered and are just there to be something new. Valve cut a lot of content from the original because it wasn’t that great, Gearbox hasn’t seemed to have done that. A lot of the enemies are just not that fun to fight, and furthermore the use of the Black Ops in the original was infrequent, because they were much more powerful than the grunts. In this, they are used way too often, although most don’t go invisible. But ultimately Gearbox was just using an enemy that wasn’t used that much in the original, instead of what they should have done is create new human enemies, perhaps Black Mesa security forces or something. The use of the new aliens and overuse of the Black Ops was just an easy way to make the game seem different to the original, a lot of really good enemies were not used purely because they were used in the original.\n\nThe same can be said for the weapons, a lot of really good weapons from the original are not there and instead you have gimmicks and there are far too many of them. Furthermore there are way too many weapons that have regenerating ammo, once you get them you need never use bullets. There is a reason why Valve cut a lot of weapons from HL2, a methodology that Gearbox did not get.\n\nBut ultimately, this is not Half-Life, this was not made by Valve. It was a quick expansion made by Gearbox for those who liked the original. Considering that it is still a good game, it is not anywhere good as the original, but that’s more because of how good the original is. The design of the maps, weapons and enemies are uninspired, but it is still a Half-Life expansion, so it’s ok.","timestamp_created":1450711499,"timestamp_updated":1450711499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":26,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598100185394287109","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19823633","author":{"steamid":"76561198159717956","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":2567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1642935409},"language":"bulgarian","review":"Exselent game.","timestamp_created":1450705522,"timestamp_updated":1450705522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19819461","author":{"steamid":"76561198255350798","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1461096480},"language":"russian","review":"Отличный геймплей и графонистая игра,не дадут скучать вам,но конечно же для тех времен!\nОбщая оценка:\n-Отличная игра\n- От части сложная\n-Чаще сохраняйтесь\n-Вспомни молодость\n10 сохранении из 10","timestamp_created":1450683798,"timestamp_updated":1450683798,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19816198","author":{"steamid":"76561198253121246","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":386,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":386,"last_played":1450619122},"language":"italian","review":"HL: Opposing Force è la prima espansione di HL, che vede come protagonista il sergente Shepard, incaricato di uccidere Gordon Freeman. Quindi viviamo la vicenda dalla parte opposta per l'appunto: quella dell'esercito americano che ha come obbiettivo quello di seppellire il progetto Black Mesa e di uccidere chiunque si trovi all'interno della base, al fine di non lasciare dei testimoni. \nIl titolo è bellissimo e probabilmente è il DLC più bello tra i due realizzati. In questo capitolo vediamo l'introduzione di nuove specie aliene e di armi inedite. Nonostante il gioco risulti essere molto più corto rispetto al titolo originale, è comunque impegnativo. \nIl comparto tecnico non è affatto male per essere un gioco del '99, tuttavia il gameplay a tratti risulta essere un po' troppo ripetitivo a mio avviso.Oltre a questo, l'unica altra cosa che mi ha fatto storcere il naso è stata l'intelligenza artificiale dei tuoi compagni di squadra. Ci sono dei punti in cui devi ordinare ai tuoi commilitoni di seguirti per sbloccare una porta, ad esempio, e questi ogni tanto, si impiantano su un punto del percorso e si buggano lì, senza che tu possa quindi andare avanti. Tutto ciò risulta essere frustante poichè sei costretto a caricare un salvataggio precendente per sbloccare la situazione. Altre volte invece, ti seguono per un po' e dopo si fermano, come se si fossero dimenticati del comando impartito. Durante i combattimento con gli alieni, inoltre, i soldati sono utili quanto un calorifero alle isole Barbados: muoiono quasi subito, costringendoti a fare tutto il lavoro, non che me ne lamenti ma ci sono dei pezzi in cui avere del supporto di squadra sarebbe indispensabile. Alla fine sono risucito comunque a finirlo.
