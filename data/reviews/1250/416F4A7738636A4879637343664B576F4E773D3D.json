It won't wow you with a deep narrative or revolutionary gameplay. You shoot zombie-like things called \"specimens\" created by an evil medical corporation known as umbr- er. Horizine. Anyway, it's not a criticizm that its premise is so overdone because really, in this specific execution, it's not.\n\nExpanding on that idea, Killing Floor's focus is gameplay, and you can expect all the bells and whistles of other FPS. Just. Shinier. Polished. If it were a cake, it'd be gunporn flavored and the icing would be neat but predictable AI behavior. On paper it's easy to strategize and complete a map on even the hardest difficulty. In reality, something always goes wrong. Even after hundreds of hours, the game still plays like a somewhat campy horror movie. The community is generally pretty good, it's still strong and its sequel is on the horizine. If you don't have this, get it. Just know that it has a load of DLC, some of which offers weapons you can't get otherwise (but will see other players use.) Can use a steam emote here? :shivahstar:\n\nBut really. Good game. I always fall back on it when I have nothing else to play. A lot of my friends do too. Never have trouble getting a full server of competent players. But then, we got into it before the semetic dlc. It helps that it runs well on toasters.","timestamp_created":1424661484,"timestamp_updated":1424661484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14605091","author":{"steamid":"76561198145088747","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":88,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":63,"last_played":1481391289},"language":"english","review":"Do you have friends? \n\nGet it, that's all i have to say","timestamp_created":1424659310,"timestamp_updated":1506303094,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14605040","author":{"steamid":"76561198080999311","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1428511117},"language":"english","review":"YEa i like it alot","timestamp_created":1424658909,"timestamp_updated":1424658909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14604771","author":{"steamid":"76561198042333797","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":10279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10050,"last_played":1555038755},"language":"english","review":"This is one of those games i quote all the time.

It's not even on my favourite games list... How does that happen, I can't tell.\nThe background story is basically '28 Days Later' with the British accents included. This was the first game I've played from Tripwire, so I was mistaken to think that they were a British company. But instead of Zombies you have genetically modified human specimens flooding the streets, coming from an out of control cloning machine in a biolab. Sometimes the game calls them \"Zeds\" and characters sometimes refer them as \"zombies\", which is silly when you think about it...\nAnyway, the story is not really relevant neither it is canonically agreed upon. You play some soldier or a survivor joinning the soldiers in an attempt to contain the outbreak.\n\nThe Best Parts:\n-The guns feel overly satisfying! The best guns in a videogame! In the lunar map you can even use shotguns as propulsion. (which is silly when you think about it, but whatever)\n-Handguns are quite stylized: you can equip akimbo revolvers, Desert Eagles, M9 and MK23 all at once. With the Sharpshooter perk you can make them as effective as the most powerful machineguns.\n-You can always have more dakka.\n-You can weld doors shut. Even the wooden ones!\n-The characters have very memorable one-liners.\nThe Worst Parts:\n-The graphics are really terrible... Although the character and weapon models are OK.\n-It eventually gets repetitive. Clear the map, run to the shop, get more dosh, Clear the map...\n-There are 2 male voice actors, but they sound the same. Too few one-liners.\n\n8/10 DOSH!

Они – «подопытные» из дешевой и грязной программы правительства по изготовлению клонов-солдат. Самые простые могли разве что вцепиться в руку и попробовать схрумкать свою жертву. Те, что побольше, были первыми в очереди на вооружение. Ничего такого – просто бензопила или лезвие. Для начала. Им как раз начали давать пулеметы и ракетницы, когда правительство попыталось втихую закрыть свою секретную программу.Но, как это обычно бывает, программа закрываться не хотела. Подопытные вырвались на свободу. Ученые не смогли выключить установку для клонирования, и теперь жертвы эксперимента носятся за пределами лаборатории в гневе. Ну, некоторые носятся в гневе, другие плетутся, третьи, будучи в нем, прыгают. Отношение к оружию честное и уважительное – после выстрела обязательно вылетит красивая гильза. От удара, сотрясшего парня в камуфляже и противогазе, в руке у него дрогнет и «ствол», хотя затем выдержка возьмет свое, а прицел вернется на место. В дробовик патроны кладут один за другим, при этом пластина-ограничитель прогибается. Когда решают подлечиться и вкалывают в руку состав из походного шприца, ее на мгновение сводит судорога.

В КФ пять уровней сложности + разные классы персонажей, враги имеют свои серьезные особенности и в зависимости от сложности требуют от игрока уровня зaдpoтства, порой сопоставимого с контр страйком. При игре в КФ очень важно соблюдать два правила: 1) Не играйте в одиночку. Это коммандная игра.  2) Никогда\nне играйте на легком уровне сложности. Люди запускают игру в одиночку на легком чтобы посмотреть, что это вообще за игра и приходят к выводу, что она скучна и примитивна, в то время как на самом деле она дарит множество эмоций и веселья.

A content for 3-7 evenings, perhaps, until you've tried everything the base game has to offers.
