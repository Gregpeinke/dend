I never really played a lot of story FPS titles but this was a pretty sweet experience. I look forward to playing more titles from this series in the future, especially seeing how (I imagine rightfully) beloved it is. The gameplay is quick-paced and keeps you on your toes a lot of the time (hallways collapsing, enemies spawning right in front of you to try and shoot you down) and incorporates another thing I really like in video games: parkour (and also didn't make it hell ;w;). If you like fighting human soldiers, aliens AND zombies, guess what? This game has all of those out to get you. Not only that, but the friendly NPCs make the levels feel a lot less lonely, and help you out when you're in a pinch. In terms of sound design, most if not all sound clips in this game convey something clearly -- explosions sound like explosions, a scientist screaming means there must be some kind of level hazard or enemy ahead, etc. Visual design is also, while mutually outdated, pretty damn good for a game that came out only a year after Sonic R. The people look like people, and the aliens look like aliens. Soldiers look like soldiers, and aren't easily confused with Black Mesa's guards. All in all, I give it a solid 10/10 especially because the manual save system can make up for so much pain.","timestamp_created":1632261168,"timestamp_updated":1632261168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99755955","author":{"steamid":"76561198139192284","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":697,"last_played":1632166640},"language":"turkish","review":"Efsane.","timestamp_created":1632259609,"timestamp_updated":1632259654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99755844","author":{"steamid":"76561198173458954","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":614,"last_played":1632200507},"language":"english","review":"fuckin fun","timestamp_created":1632259415,"timestamp_updated":1632259415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99751804","author":{"steamid":"76561197985201579","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":572,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":435,"last_played":1632567455},"language":"english","review":"A masterpiece of epic proportions, the \"Saving Private Ryan\" of first-person shooters.","timestamp_created":1632252873,"timestamp_updated":1632252873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99750072","author":{"steamid":"76561198347842128","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":782,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":543,"last_played":1632432020},"language":"brazilian","review":"Dificílimo, MUITO DIFICIL.

I really, really, really hate most of it, but I do recommend it. I think absolutely EVERYONE should play this game at some point in their \"gaming career.\"\n\nI want to start by saying that I'm sorry. I'm sorry that after 10 hours of slogging my way through this game, although I DO recommend it, I can't say I enjoyed myself.\n\nMost of my issues with the game stem from the fact that it feels like Gordon is TRYING to get himself killed. What's that? You fell 10 feet? That's 15 health, down the drain. Did you step in a puddle of radioactive goop that you couldn't avoid, no matter how hard you tried? Sorry, that's 10 health that you've just lost. There are far too many instances where it feels like you're forced to take damage, and it only makes the experience more frustrating as a result. There's slippery terrain, radioactive puddles, lightning shooting out of the walls, pipes spewing hot gas at you, and giant green claw-things that are a nightmare to get around. For how strange and slippery Gordon's movement is, there sure are a LOT of instances of movement being needed to progress. Jumping segments, walking across tight pathways that are way too easy to fall off of, trying to jump across a gap but falling into it instead, falling into water and other dangerous liquids, etc.\n\nControls aside, I didn't enjoy the combat that much either. Shooting the enemies, namely the soldiers, feels actually pretty great, but they'll almost always gun you down before you can even fire off ten bullets, unless you're willing to sacrifice a third of your health while you shoot them. The headcrabs are hard to hit, the snipers and sheltered turret-soldiers CANNOT be killed unless you have explosives, the tanks vary from imposing to laughable, the minefield segments make me want to break my hand, and overall there are just so many instances of having to save preemptively, before proceeding to die 20 times before taking out every enemy and saving again not even a minute later.\n\nHowever, although I did not enjoy most of this game, I do think it is great for what Valve had at the time. The most fun I had with the game was listening to the goofy voice acting and watching the unique animations for particular points in the game. I have heard about Half Life for so, so long now, and I can say that I am glad to have played it, not only to see what the hype was about, but also to add it to my library of \"gaming knowledge.\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n====RATING: 8/10. \"Ignore the bullshit and you'll be fine.\"\n--------------------------------------------------------------","timestamp_created":1632120308,"timestamp_updated":1632238840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99659855","author":{"steamid":"76561198964672866","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":877,"last_played":1633562850},"language":"english","review":"cool game","timestamp_created":1632107545,"timestamp_updated":1632107545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99658234","author":{"steamid":"76561198318117021","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":2287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2128,"last_played":1632114406},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1632104902,"timestamp_updated":1632104902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99656738","author":{"steamid":"76561199028182773","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":154,"last_played":1652419647},"language":"english","review":"really jank and because of that its funny and its also just a really good game by itself\n","timestamp_created":1632102345,"timestamp_updated":1632102345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99653855","author":{"steamid":"76561198014978326","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":574,"last_played":1553137956},"language":"english","review":"Levels are far too linear and have too much scripted/cinematic crap.
