Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch, round, cake pans; cover bottoms with waxed paper.\n\n2.) In a large bowl, combine flour, 2 cups sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add eggs, milk, oil, and 1 tablespoon vanilla; beat until well blended. Pour batter into prepared pans.\n\n3.) Bake for 35 minutes, or until wooden toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean. Cool layers in pans on wire racks 10 minutes. Loosen edges, and remove to racks to cool completely.\n\n4.) Drain cherries, reserving 1/2 cup juice. Combine reserved juice, cherries, 1 cup sugar and cornstarch in a 2 quart saucepan. Cook over low heat until thickened, stirring constantly. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla. Cool before using.\n\n5.) Combine whipping cream and confectioner's sugar in a chilled medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer at high speed until stiff peaks form.\n\n6.) With long serrated knife, split each cake layer horizontally in half. Tear one split layer into crumbs; set aside. Reserve 1 1/2 cups Frosting for decorating cake; set aside. Gently brush loose crumbs off top and side of each cake layer with pasty brush or hands. To assemble, place one cake layer on cake plate. Spread with 1 cup frosting; top with 3/4 cup cherry topping. Top with second cake layer; repeat layers of frosting and cherry topping. Top with third cake layer. Frost side of cake. Pat reserved crumbs onto frosting on side of cake. Spoon reserved frosting into pastry bag fitted with star decorator tip. Pipe around top and bottom edges of cake.

We hope your brief detention in the relaxation vault has been a pleasant one. Your specimen has been processed and we are now ready to begin the test proper. Before we start, however, keep in mind that, although fun and learning are the primary goals of all enrichment center activities, serious injuries may occur. For your own safety, and the safety of others, please refrain from — *static* Por favor bordón de fallar Muchos gracias de fallar gracias *static* Stand back. The portal will open in 3, 2, 1...\n\n==========================================================================\nR A T I N G\n==========================================================================\n\n---{Graphics}--- : The atmosphere really makes you feel like a lab rat. And for good measure! Decent graphics that make you enjoy the storyline even better! 7/10\n\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☑ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}--- : Fun gameplay, fairly easy at the beginning and quickly becomes nightmarishly complicated. Be sure to analyse the environment to avoid spending hours locked in the same test chamber. 9/10\n\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It‘s just gameplay\n☐ Mehh\n☐ Starring at walls is better\n☐ Just don‘t\n\n---{Audio}--- : Very good soundtrack that gives a dark atmosphere to the game. Sounds are well crafted, don't forget to put it in 5.1 (or at least stereo) to help you during the game. GlaDOS's song at the credit is my personal favourite. 7/10\n\n☐ Eargasm\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ Earrape\n\n---{PC Requirements}--- : Although the levels do not require high-end graphics, it is much more enjoyable to play such a game on a fast PC to really get into the game. If you want to play without high end graphics, a decent PC should do the trick. 9/10\n\n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☑ Fast\n☐ Rich boiiiiii\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulty}--- : Very fun and easy to grasp at the start. But beware: as you advance in the came, the levels become exceedingly difficult. Don't overestimate GlaDOS. 10/10\n\n☐ Just press ‚A‘\n☐ Easy\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Difficult\n\n---{Grind}--- : The game takes many hours to master and understand the dynamic. Can make you start over several times to achieve your goal. Patience is your friend. The cake is a lie. The companion cube your best friend. 6/10\n\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☑ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You‘ll need a second live for grinding\n☐ Minecraft\n\n---{Story}--- : One of the best scenarios for such a game! It will mindfuck you as you try to escape GlaDOS and the Aperture Science complex! 10/10\n☐ Story?\n☐ Text or Audio floating around\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☑ Lovely\n☐ It‘ll replace your life\n\n---{Game Time}--- : Will last you around 10ish hours for sure to complete the game. Can take you longer if you have a tough time figuring out how to escape from certain test chambers. Some levels might take you 5 hours to figure out : one advice is sleep on it, next morning you'll get it over in less than 30 seconds. 6/10\n\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☑ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{Price}--- : Really worth the price for such an epic game! 10/10\n\n☐ It’s free!\n☑ Worth the price\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{Bugs}--- : A couple of minor glitches but very few bugs to speak of. 9/10\n\n☑ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{Overall}--- : A classic, epic puzzle game with a FPS style, an intriguing story and complex gameplay that will require you to master guns, skills and environment. A necessity. A must have. A game to be cherished! 9/10\n\n☑ Competes with the classics\n☐ Impressive but has something missing\n☐ Fun to play, easy to forget\n☐ Playable because you are bored\n☐ A decapitation or ♥♥♥♥ is more fun\n\n==========================================================================\nO P I N I O N\n==========================================================================\n\nAn incredible game that twists your brain. The goal is simple: get out of the room you are in with the portal gun, sometimes forcing you to think out of the box and plan your steps. Really entertaining. The script is also incredibly well written! A must for those that want to burn some brain cells while geeking!\n\n\"This Weighted Companion Cube will accompany you through the test chamber.
