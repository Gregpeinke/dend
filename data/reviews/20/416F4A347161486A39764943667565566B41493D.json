TFC is definitely more fast-paced, although fights tend to be more intense and last longer as classes generally move faster and are harder to kill.

There's also some interesting unique mechanics that haven't made it through the transition into TF2. I feel like most people looking to buy this are familiar with that game. Don't think of this as just TF2 with less players and worse graphics, there are a ton of little aspects that make it unique.\n\n I'd definitely recommend checking this game out during the next steam sale when it's a dollar or so. Also, I'd love to see more players enjoying and making content for this game as there's not many people active anymore","timestamp_created":1593302803,"timestamp_updated":1593302803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532600164413452148","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71526572","author":{"steamid":"76561198830196720","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1593663534},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo foda\n","timestamp_created":1593299063,"timestamp_updated":1593299063,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71490688","author":{"steamid":"76561198352428315","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":2442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":291,"last_played":1658328293},"language":"english","review":"VERY GOOD","timestamp_created":1593265872,"timestamp_updated":1593265872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71465206","author":{"steamid":"76561198353045889","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1657172669},"language":"english","review":"GOOD!","timestamp_created":1593240955,"timestamp_updated":1593240955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71453331","author":{"steamid":"76561198408662260","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":62,"last_played":1645595387},"language":"russian","review":"Классика), good","timestamp_created":1593227116,"timestamp_updated":1606385865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506896555423736572","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71428329","author":{"steamid":"76561199016526558","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5589,"last_played":1593629727},"language":"english","review":"i liked it","timestamp_created":1593200020,"timestamp_updated":1593200020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71424980","author":{"steamid":"76561197970536500","num_games_owned":541,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1744,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1738,"last_played":1643748617},"language":"english","review":"Loved this game back when it was called TFC before the net code update.

Porém, infelizmente não posso recomendá-lo e direi o porquê.\nBasicamente é Half-Life 1 Deathmatch com algumas classes que se diferenciam pelas armas. O jogo não possui nenhum modo single player, ou que você possa jogar contra bots, basicamente você precisa achar um server ou criar algum com seus amigos. \nO maior problema é que o game está praticamente \"morto\", se você é brasileiro como eu e quer jogar, sinto-lhe informar que não achará server com menos de 150 de ping. Isso atrapalha bastante para um game FPS competitivo. \nApesar de ser bom game que dê para se divertir, não posso recomendar para alguém algo que não funciona mais. Caso você queira algo semelhante, aconselho que jogue o modo multiplayer do Half-Life 1 que possui uma comunidade bem mais ativa e é praticamente a mesma coisa, ou caso queira mesmo essas diferenciações das classes, jogue o Team Fortress 2.\nEu realmente me decepcionei com o game, pois joguei ele no passado, e estava esperando que hoje em dia funcionasse tão bem quanto antes.","timestamp_created":1593134340,"timestamp_updated":1593134340,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556612372398376465","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71347838","author":{"steamid":"76561198849157364","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":798,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":73,"last_played":1654614459},"language":"english","review":"this game was the reason team fortress 2 exist, it was alot of fun\nthe fun classes were scout and heavy,\nthe maps are fun\n\ntry switching to wide screen and shit is fucked\nthe way to get true wide screen if you go to properties\nthen launch options\nand add the commands -w 1024 -h 768 -stretchaspect\nthe graphics are shit but that is the charm since it's from 1999, everytime i see the graphic, i always feel like im back in the 1990 playing doom or quake\ni give it a 9.5/10 classic masterpiece","timestamp_created":1593123343,"timestamp_updated":1593123343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.659817159175872803","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qaHj9vICfueVkAI="}
