Compared to Half-Life 1, it presents a variety of new enemies and bosses, awesome weapons, cool areas like alien zoos, good puzzles, and actually has a decent story. This is what Half-Life Blue Shift should have had, but merely only expanded with the current resources instead of getting creative.\n\nWhat I love about Half-Life Opposing Force is its creative liberty it takes to expand upon the ideas of the original Half-Life. It introduces the Displacer Gun, which does a great amount of damage, but also takes you to random areas in the Xen when alt-clicked, which is an insane idea! Even better, they introduce the barnacle-gun-thing (forgot its name), but it acts like a grappling hook and works really well! Other weapons are also introduced like an LMG, sniper, but I feel the creative ones take the spotlight.\n\nThe new enemies are amazing! They don't make different forms of the old ones, but instead create whole new aliens and Black Op enemies, alongside some actually useful allies. It adds a lot to the table and makes this game one of the most unique spin-offs in media history.\n\nAs mentioned in my other reviews, the graphics are nostalgic and are great for the time period they came from.\n\nThere are a few issues with the game, however. For one, the night-vision that replaces the flashlight is painfully bright. In dark areas, it actually almost creates the reverse effect so you can't see anything. Also the final boss, while being fun and presents a little challenge after exiting a Nether Portal, is way too easy. You can blame this on the regen pool, which I don't understand why people think a regen pool should be in a boss fight. It makes no sense: of course you're gonna lose health, that's the challenge. Regardless, it was still a memorable boss. One more additional thing, the Black Ops enemies were insanely powerful, especially the ones that became invisible. I did play on hard difficulty, but regardless the game shoves 20 at you simultaneously at some points, so it's almost impossible if you're not prepped, making you stuck in a cycle of saving and loading the game.\n\nOverall, I give it a 9/10.

Zaslouží si však tato 5ti hodinová akční paráda od vývojářů z VALVe tak převeliký titul?\n\nUjmete se role vojáka Adriana Shepharda, který je jako velitel jednotky vyslán na misi do mimozemšťany zatopené laboratoře Black Mesa. Originální plán byl pouze vyhubení mimozemské rasy spolu se zastavením Gordona Freemana, ale Adrian zjišťuje, že v prostorách laboratoří se vyskytují temní vojáci, kteří mají v plánu Black Mesu vyhodit do vzduchu.\n\nPrvně se vyjádřím k příběhu.\nJe velmi dobrý a celkově jsem fanoušek toho, že spatříme katastrofu z Black Mesy očima někoho jiného, než Godrona Freemana.\n+ jestě vidíme, co se dělo v laboratoři samotné, když pan Freeman odešel na Xen.\n\nTeď už ale k samotné recenzi:\nCo se v tomto dodatku změnilo?\nŘekněme, že nic a přitom hodně - lokace zůstala stejná, atmosféra také a gunplay taktéž - ale kluci z VALVe nám přidali hromadu nových hraček na ničení nepřátel. Od kulometu po odstřelovací pušku, více melee, nebo i pár kousků Xenských paranormálních zbraní. Pokud jste si nenašli oblíbenou zbraň v původní hře, tak si ji zde rozhodně najdete!\n\nJe hezký, že máte hodně zbraní... ale na co je použít?\nNo, bylo přidáno i více typů protivníků - nové druhy Xen mimozemšťanů, nebo třeba vojáci tajné korporace.\n\nDál nám hra předá dosti malých detailů, aby jsme na 100% věděli, že nehrajeme za vědce v robotickém obleku, ale za vycvičeného vojáka.\nJako třeba noční vidění místo baterky, verbování vojáků na naší stranu nebo nůž místo páčidla.\n\nVynechám tady svoje poznámky o gunplayi, nebo atmosféře, protože ty jsou úplně do detailu stejné jako v prvním dílu. Jenom vám stačí vědět, že atmosféra je perfektní a gunplay je zábavný!\n\nTakže tady máme perfektní dodatek, který si vzal ty dobré věci z jedničky a jenom přidal. Ale bohužel jsem během svého hraní narazil na pár chybek, nebo věcí co se mi nelíbili.\n- Přátelští vojáci se na mě po naverbování zničehonic zbouřili i bez toho aniž bych na ně vystřelil. Nevím, jestli to je bug a nebo jsem je prostě nějak naštval, ale několikrát jsem kvůli nim quicksavoval každou minutu.\n- Finální bossfight přišel z ničeho nic a v podstatě nic neznamenal.\n- Tajní nepřátelští vojáci byli někdy až moc OP.\n\nAle i přes tyhle malé chybky si Opposing Force ode mě zaslouží:\n\n8,5 / 10\n\nRozhodně se vyplatí zahrát, pokud jste hráli první Half-Life.\nJá osobně to neberu jako \"nejlepší dodatek ever\" ale vidím důvody, proč si to dost lidí myslí.\nStále preferuji první díl oproti tomuto, ale to neznamená, že vám to za těch pár éček nestojí.\nProtože rozhodně stojí!\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1608672739,"timestamp_updated":1608672739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82877847","author":{"steamid":"76561198174978790","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":1614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1609,"last_played":1608636846},"language":"english","review":"half life dint need more npcs this ruins npc balance\n\nthis is why blue: shifgt is actually superioiur","timestamp_created":1608636462,"timestamp_updated":1608636462,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82874553","author":{"steamid":"76561198367706799","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":2811,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":722,"last_played":1659000561},"language":"polish","review":"wciąga","timestamp_created":1608631919,"timestamp_updated":1608631919,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82874304","author":{"steamid":"76561198047853572","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":125,"playtime_forever":215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1608631476},"language":"english","review":"The superior one of two expansion packs.\n3,5/5","timestamp_created":1608631534,"timestamp_updated":1608631534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82871176","author":{"steamid":"76561198809669011","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":310,"last_played":1646602526},"language":"english","review":"the other half life\n","timestamp_created":1608626343,"timestamp_updated":1608626343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82870668","author":{"steamid":"76561198253425494","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":346,"last_played":1606677341},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun DLC sidir fakat hiç half-life oynamamış biri bile alıp oynayabilir.

However, barring a few kind of neat weapons and some annoying rope climbing sequences,, that's basically what this is - a little more Half-Life. Like Gordon Freeman, Adrian Shepard has no personality whatsoever, and there's even less of an attempt to give all this context. Basically, if you haven't played Half-Life, you probably won't understand most of what's going on. This is somewhat excusable in that this was clearly marketed as an expansion to Half-Life, but still. It's just more of the same. Which means the endgame spike in difficulty will infuriate you as much as that game's did. But you'll still be impressed by some of the scenarios it tosses at you, and the resources you're given to fight your way out. And the squad system, while rudimentary, is indeed a leap forward.\n\nAlas, it's clear no real effort was made to optimize this for newer systems. Make sure you change your mouse settings to accept raw mouse feedback immediately, or you won't be able to turn at all. More crucially, make sure you're not standing still when a descending elevator stops in Vicarious Reality, or you'll be frozen in place and have to load an old save. Those are the two major bugs I encountered, but the forums hint at many more, and it's a bit disheartening that Valve's signature series didn't get more care and attention (Half-Life: Source doesn't count).\n\nArguably for Half-Life completionists only, or those curious to really get into the lore.","timestamp_created":1608432215,"timestamp_updated":1608432215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82729087","author":{"steamid":"76561199076577889","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":327,"last_played":1614997633},"language":"english","review":"They actually put new stuff in","timestamp_created":1608429934,"timestamp_updated":1608429934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82689006","author":{"steamid":"76561198109854616","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1624980276},"language":"english","review":"Much shorter than the original Half Life, but I would argue a lot more fun.

Но для этой проблемы есть выход можно найти в руководствах.\nНо впрочем советую поиграть.","timestamp_created":1608140056,"timestamp_updated":1608140056,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82508333","author":{"steamid":"76561198821421457","num_games_owned":266,"num_reviews":116,"playtime_forever":469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":469,"last_played":1608110595},"language":"polish","review":"Half-Life: Opposing Force jest pierwszym dodatkiem do wydanego w 1998r. Half-Life'a. Nie był on robiony przez Valve, jednak jakość tego dodatku jest równie wysoka co podstawki. Wprowadza bardzo dużo nowości, a jego przejście zajęło mi prawie tyle co przejście podstawki (niecałe 8 godz.).\n+Tak samo jak w podstawce, wciągający gameplay\n+Nowa fabuła, rozgrywająca się w tym samym czasie co przygody Gordona Freemana. Naszym protagonistą jest Adrian Shepherd, jeden z żołnieży, którzy nas tak nękali w podstawce.\n+Nowe poziomy, równie przyjemne do przechodzenia co te z podstawki\n+Cała masa nowych broni\n+Równie dużo nowych przeciwników, w tym nowi bossowie. Pojawia się zupełnie nowy szczep obcych zwany Rasą X, który jest niezwykle groźny\n+Inne urozmaicenia w gameplay-u w postaci podciągania się na linach, Barnacle Grapple'a (którym możemy się przyciągać do niektórych powierzchni) i kierowaniu oddziałem komandosów\n+Nowa ścieżka dźwiękowa, która jest całkiem niezła\n+Całkiem długi czas rozgrywki\n-AI naszych wojskowych towarzyszy jest tak samo głupie jak naukowców i ochroniarzy z podstawki. W podstawce nie uznałem tego za minus, gdyż najczęściej nie potrzebujemy niczyjej pomocy. Tutaj jednak razem z naszym oddziałem wpakujemy się w wiele strzelanin w których ich pomoc bywa bardzo przydatna, nasi towarzysze mogą się jednak po drodze zablokować zostawiając nas sam na sam z wrogim oddziałem kosmitów :p\n-Ten sam irytujący system przesuwania przedmiotów, co w HL1","timestamp_created":1608137865,"timestamp_updated":1614525319,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559050261974334717","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82500300","author":{"steamid":"76561198420717071","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2339,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2339,"last_played":1608083571},"language":"spanish","review":"buen juego","timestamp_created":1608129293,"timestamp_updated":1608129293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82482686","author":{"steamid":"76561198285662142","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":158,"last_played":1628606326},"language":"english","review":"best half life spin-off out there","timestamp_created":1608107350,"timestamp_updated":1608107350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82468213","author":{"steamid":"76561199063274198","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":392,"last_played":1608082380},"language":"english","review":"Just Beat it a couple of minutes ago and its pretty great!
