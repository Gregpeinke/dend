The multiplayer aspect of the game really challenges players to work as a team to survive waves of zombies. There are six classes to choose from (each with their own perks) that can be leveled up by completing objectives such as getting X number of headshots for the sharpshooter class. And unlike other zombies games where you mindlessly fire in all directions, you would have to work strategically with your team to defeat different types of zombies that spawn each wave. The game has 5 different difficulties, each getting exponentially harder. Zombies deals more damage, has more health, and you will receive less money to buy weapons and ammo the higher the difficulty.  \n\nWhat makes this game worth buying, in my opinion, is the amount of replay value the game offers. I've logged over 300 hours playing this game, and I've never got tired of playing KF. The game is incredibly fun, especially if you manage to join a game with a group of friends. Tripwire hosts seasonal events where they release new content (such as unlockable characters, new weapons, and maps) that make players like me wanting more. The game can be difficult for beginners, but like all games, takes time to master. And when you start getting the hang of it all, you can always turn up the difficulty for a new challenge.","timestamp_created":1405314018,"timestamp_updated":1405314018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11226741","author":{"steamid":"76561198123187902","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":35851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14043,"last_played":1435863357},"language":"english","review":"Killing floor is one of those rare gems where you can just sit around with a bunch of random people and enjoy some HORDE MODE-esque gaming.

So you are hosting a Party and you invite your friends over. Your Friends invite other friends and they happend to invite this Weird guy with ripped muscles and a Glowing tatoo in his chest. You just ignore him for awhile untill you realized he invited some other friends too. Some lame pale weirdo, A guy that dresses up as a spider, a guy with a sword on his arm, A slutty chick, An Arsonist, A Fatso that keeps eating all the food, A skinny chic who has emotional problems, and a guy who loves watching chainsaw massacre too much. You ignore them for a while as they aren't casusing any problems. Then some one decided to bring in truck load of Kegs to the party and then it started to get wild. They all started wrecking the place. Chainsaw guy started sawing my furniture in two, Emotional wreck started believing she was a famous Opera singer, Sluty started going wild on the guys, Spider guy does what ever a spider does, Pale dude decided to squeal at paintings for some reason, Blade man started pretending he was a samurai and asked for chalanges, Fatso just kept eating everyting and my cleaning stuff. Arsonist was starting a bon fire in my bedroom, and Ripped Hulk Glowy was wrecking my Fine China. So I try to calm the situation down and when I tried to make a move to stop the booze. Then they turned into a jungle. They nearly knocked down the 2nd story and wrecking the place like a contained tornado. Then I decided to call the Cops and have them arrested. So a Sheriff by the name Sheriff Wade comes in gets everyting under control. He says these party wreckers will be doing their time and just as he said that the Party Wreckers looked really happy. Never seen anyone that happy to go to Jail before. So I asked how the damages will be repaired and he says the insurance should fix you up when they arrive and he hauled them off in the prison truck moved on. If you want a wild party then ask these to come over.
