The combat consists of you standing in front of the enemy and holding the trigger and then turning to the next and repeating. There is some long-range shooting too. One third of the game is just driving, which feels the same at all times and the game is overall too short. I though that was the end of a section, but it was the end of the game after only 10 hours.\n\nI was really surprised to see this had a better metascore than Portal 2; smh.","timestamp_created":1495384719,"timestamp_updated":1495384719,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.351413041353225708","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31883491","author":{"steamid":"76561198102855435","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":67,"last_played":1608827935},"language":"english","review":"I mean do I even need to make a positive review here","timestamp_created":1495375359,"timestamp_updated":1495375359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31882255","author":{"steamid":"76561198218089005","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1072,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1573935624},"language":"english","review":"I was iffy at first, but no this game is worth it by far.

Half Life 2 es sencillamente una obra maestra, rebosa maestria. El gunplay esta genial, la banda sonora, la historia, el diseño de niveles, el gameplay de por si. Es que lo juego ahora y lo comparo con los juegos de hoy y solo deja ver como la industria a dado un paso atras en la actualidad. Half Life 2 sabe contarte una historia sin dejar de ser un videojuego, me explico:\nHalf Life 2 carece de cinematicas, 0. No eres ningun espectador, eres el protagonista. El cual presencia todos esos hechos que suceden durante la aventura. Todo muy bien conectado con el gameplay, en ningun momento sientes que \"te quiten el control\", en ningun momento te cortan el rollo. En ese sentido es para quitarse el sombrero, un trabajo ejemplar. Porque despues tienes los juegos de hoy y no dejan de ser \"matar enemigos hasta llegar a la siguiente cinematica\", las cuales es lo unico que te cuenta la historia sin esa chispa de lo que es realmente un videojuego. Los de Valve lo saben, From Software tambien con su gran saga Dark Souls. El saber contarte una historia como lo que es, un videojuego.\n\nGraficamente a pesar de sus añitos, ha envejecido de lujo, ni si quiera me da la sensacion de jugar a un juego con muchos años a sus espaldas. Y el diseño de niveles, el juego no va solo de recorrer un mapa lineal y disparar a todo enemigo, hay buenos puzzles, hay exploracion (si, a pesar de ser lineal tienes que averiguar por donde ir, explorar y seguir la aventura, y ojo nunca te va a llevar de la mano, no hay mapa, ni brujula que te marque el camino ni niguna ayudita, AMEN por eso), esta todo bien colocado y es mas, te ofrece distintas formas de resolver los momentos, eleccion del jugador, ¿que quieres ser tradicional y matar a balazo limpio? Puedes. ¿Quieres usar el arma de gravedad unicamente? Tambien, puedes incluso coger objetos del entorno y usarlos como escudo, o lanzarles objetos a los enemigos y ya ni digamos si coges unas cuchillas y mutilas a diestro y siniestro). Y bastantes detalles tiene, se nota que es un proyecto hecho con muchisimo cariño.\n\nY creo que poco mas puedo decir, es una maravilla, una obra de arte que todo videojugador que se precie debe jugar si o si, de esos juegos que perduraran como de los mejores juegos de la historia. Ojala pronto Valve nos sorprenda con un tercer capitulo, pero es indiscutible que Valve se haya marcado un juego con una calidad que ya quisieran el resto de desarrolladoras si quiera acercarse un poco, y eso que no he hablado de Portal 2 aun.\n\nHaz un favor a tu espiritu videojuguil y COMPRA este juego, disfrutalo y saborealo bien.","timestamp_created":1495336991,"timestamp_updated":1495336991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.59891897439956665","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31873894","author":{"steamid":"76561198162525898","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":651,"last_played":1627760966},"language":"spanish","review":"se parece al half life 3 pero con menos graficos\n:D","timestamp_created":1495336006,"timestamp_updated":1495336006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556804895401000977","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31872304","author":{"steamid":"76561198084870457","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":100,"last_played":1507257072},"language":"russian","review":"Good.","timestamp_created":1495328256,"timestamp_updated":1495328256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31868268","author":{"steamid":"76561198138105719","num_games_owned":396,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":72,"last_played":1547797187},"language":"english","review":"Can't wait for the sequel!","timestamp_created":1495311066,"timestamp_updated":1495311066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31866607","author":{"steamid":"76561198304294046","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":531,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":310,"last_played":1576354450},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life 2, этого достаточно.","timestamp_created":1495305564,"timestamp_updated":1495305564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31864314","author":{"steamid":"76561198070521109","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3586,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3559,"last_played":1495152556},"language":"turkish","review":"Ne zaman aldığımı bile hatırlamadığım, half life 1'i ise internet kafelerde sürüne sürüne oynadığım oyunun müthişli devamı.","timestamp_created":1495298034,"timestamp_updated":1495298034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31863135","author":{"steamid":"76561198252388396","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":649,"last_played":1503511232},"language":"russian","review":"игра очень классная, советую!","timestamp_created":1495294567,"timestamp_updated":1495294567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550163328647613525","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31862068","author":{"steamid":"76561198340580645","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1495028321},"language":"english","review":"An old classic which will always be epic.","timestamp_created":1495291419,"timestamp_updated":1495291419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31857201","author":{"steamid":"76561197998138416","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":2362,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2242,"last_played":1584452359},"language":"turkish","review":"Her yıl seri olarak (HL2, Episode 1, Episode 2) başlayıp bitirdiğim tek oyun.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Gordon’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Half Life 2 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Gordon’s existential catchphrase \"Crowbar” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Gabin’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\n\nAnd yes, by the way, I DO have a Half Life 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

Я как любил брутального очкастого, не пролившим ниодного слова физика, по имени Гордон, так и ненавидел Брина с его желания\n\n[u]Сюжет[/u]\n\nГлавного Героя опять пробуждает загадочный G-Man, говоря о том, что его будут ждать \"Великие дела\". В итоге, Гордон очнулся в поезде без оружия, и без своего \"Защитного энергокостюма\", который не раз спасал ГГ в первой части. После того, как мы выйдем из поезда, мы узнаем, что находимся в City-17, в котором правительство решило замутить тоталитарный режим. Этим всем правит некий \"Уоллес Брин\", или же просто \"Доктор Брин\" (Бывший руководитель чёрной мезы). Он в свою очередь находиться под контроллем \"Совета Альянса\", тоталитарной империей. Дело всё в том, что Альянс захватил контроль над землёй всего за 7 часов. Что как бы намекает на убогость армии человеков. И в итоге нужно как-то от этого избавляться, поэтому появились \"Опозиционеры\" (Само-собой), и Гордону придётся приподать уроки дружбы \"Сильному\" Альянсу. Рассказывать много не буду. Этого я думаю будет достаточно для описания сюжета.\n\n[u]Теперь про геймплей[/u]\n\nШутер от первого лица с реалистичной физикой.

Хотя в некоторых аспектах может победить и HL2.\nТак же хочу отметить оптимизацию. Она действительно годная.\nОссобенностью игры является \"Гравити Пушка\" С помощью неё можно брать/толкать и кидать тяжёлые, или острые предметы. Она в игре занимает далеко не последнее место. \nИз минусов могу отметить только баги, но с ними можно смириться.\n\n[u] Итог:9/10\t[/u] за баги.\n\nНа этом всё. Советую купить игру.

que puedo decir de este juego que no se haya dicho, es un juego casi perfecto ,desde su gamplay, Soundtrack, gráficos, etc...\nEmpecemos diciendo lo Bueno y lo Malo:\nLO BUENO\n+Los gráficos son muy buenos para tener 13 años en el mercado\n+La historia es muy interesante y se cuenta atreves de gameplay no atreves de cinemáticas ni textos \n+Los personajes son muy carismáticos (hasta los personajes ambulantes) \n+El Soundtrack es muy bueno (aunque me di cuenta tarde)\n+La historia tiene momentos muy intensos y otros muy filosóficos ya que su narrativa es excelente\n+Las armas son muy buenas y hay una gran variedad desde escopetas o rifles de asalto hasta la GLORIOSA Gravity Gun y todas tiene un sonido único\n+No hay vida regenerativa lo cual le da algo de reto\nLO MALO\n-Aun no sale Half-Life 3\n-La dificultad no es muy alta\n-Algunas veces me daban bajones de FPS de 60 o 70 hasta 10 y aunque pasaba a veces si molestaba un poco \n-También había niveles enteros en donde no cargaban las texturas y se veía horrible\nCONCLUSION\nEs un buen título que aunque tiene sus fallas yo lo recomiendo muchísimo 9/10\n\n","timestamp_created":1494821147,"timestamp_updated":1494821147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31761399","author":{"steamid":"76561198110133894","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":166,"playtime_forever":1453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":524,"last_played":1566189786},"language":"english","review":"mess

I just want some more of half life man, as do all of the fans. \nIt is just criminal to end the 2nd episode in the biggest twist in the game and not follow it up. \n\nAnyway, steam people, if you guys are reading this, i just want to thank all of you for making my life so much better. Please keep making games just like before. Don't change the \"single player narrative-driven\" approach to games. I think we all need a little bit of old-school hardcore gaming in our lives just like in the earlier steam games.\n\nThank you, Steam.","timestamp_created":1494601579,"timestamp_updated":1494601579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31703427","author":{"steamid":"76561198142423255","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":163,"last_played":1492923284},"language":"schinese","review":"半条命，永恒的经典\n在那个时代，能做到这样的游戏画质已经算是很高级别的了\n剧情不错，有中文配音，但用中文配音，玩起来有点别扭，不过还是值得点赞的，因为国外很少游戏有中文配音的XD\n","timestamp_created":1494601137,"timestamp_updated":1494601137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31700100","author":{"steamid":"76561198319512267","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3769,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2407,"last_played":1550998783},"language":"russian","review":"Так как игра с зомби и шутер да ещё и с сюжетом эта игра заслуживает продолжение 3 часть будет ещё надеюсь на это лучше!","timestamp_created":1494589741,"timestamp_updated":1522987065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477031797170639038","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31698816","author":{"steamid":"76561198374764410","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":732,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":732,"last_played":1494560034},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game!","timestamp_created":1494583995,"timestamp_updated":1494583995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31696410","author":{"steamid":"76561198011285078","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":697,"last_played":1649576684},"language":"russian","review":"Идеальна.","timestamp_created":1494570105,"timestamp_updated":1494570105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31692245","author":{"steamid":"76561198081931712","num_games_owned":433,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":3084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2984,"last_played":1517163027},"language":"russian","review":"НОРМ ИРА","timestamp_created":1494545923,"timestamp_updated":1494545923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561752974987030029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31691843","author":{"steamid":"76561198121814390","num_games_owned":737,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":830,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":830,"last_played":1433966429},"language":"french","review":"Cette histoires est MEGA epic !
