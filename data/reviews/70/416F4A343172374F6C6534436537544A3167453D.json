I love everything about this game. The story is told very well without cutscenes, the weapons are unique, the gameplay is really fun, the enemies require different weapons to kill different ones, making almost every weapon you have useful unlike most FPS games, and the multiplayer is fun. Sure, towards the end of the game, there is some annoying platforming on Xen, and that section in Gonarch's Lair is so confusing, but that cannot take away from the entire experience at all. I think everyone should play this game (unless they mind old games).","timestamp_created":1572821434,"timestamp_updated":1575823692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56443231","author":{"steamid":"76561198230657464","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":683,"last_played":1587151644},"language":"english","review":"gud gaem","timestamp_created":1572821316,"timestamp_updated":1572821316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56442417","author":{"steamid":"76561198049001305","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":35754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29082,"last_played":1655456645},"language":"english","review":"SO, first of all, buy this game. Secondly, if you're using a widescreen monitor (16:9, etc) do yourself a favour and increase the FOV by typing \"default_fov [any value that doesn't suck]\" into the console, unless you're into horse blinders. The console can be brought up/down by pressing the § key or ~ or this or that or tilde or Tilda or Matilda or whatever -- you'll figure it out! It may also be wise to eliminate mouse acceleration by enabling raw input in the mouse settings menu.\n\n\nTo more conveniently play installed mods: \nStep 1. Go here: \\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Half-Life\\valve\\resource\nStep 2. Open GameMenu.res with notepad or something similar (you may have to run the game once in order for this file to be generated)\nStep 3. Press ctrl + f, then search for and delete the line that reads \"nosteam 1\"\n\nDoing this will add the \"Change Game\" option to the main menu, which lets you select and play newly installed Half-Life mods without first having to restart Steam in order for them to be listed in your Steam library. Not only is this more convenient, but time spent playing mods that are selected via this menu will also count toward your total hours played for Half-Life and keep all of your Half-Life screenshots in one place. Cool, right?\n\n\nHalf-Life, released in November of 1998, is no doubt one of the most influential first-person shooters of all time, and I'm no doubt the billionth person to tell you that. Half-Life runs on the Gold Source engine, which is a fork of id Software's Quake 1 (idtech 2) engine. Half-Life's engine is a big part of what makes it so good, in my opinion. In large part because the movement just feels fantastic. Unlike in Half-Life 2 (which also has great movement though), the Shift key doesn't make you sprint, but walk. Sprint/run is always on by default, you never tire, and you move at a rather brisk pace. You move about as quickly as you do in other first-person shooters of the mid- to late 90's, but don't let that fool you into thinking that Half-Life plays like a \"trve oldskool FPS\". What I'm saying is not that Half-Life isn't oldschool, but that its release marked a shift in the way that first-person shooters would come to be developed, for better or for worse. Half-Life plays very differently in many ways to the first-person shooters that preceeded it. While there is no 2- 3- or even 4-weapon carry-limit as you often see in many modern first-person shooters, and you can carry all of the game's weapons on your person at the same time, and as already mentioned, movement is rather fast, etc etc, you are however dealing with combat that is very cover-focused, as the game's most threatening foes rely heavily on hitscanning attacks. There is nothing inherently un-oldschool about hitscanning enemies, it's just that they make up the majority of Half-Life's tougher combat encounters and you're never really going to be circle-strafing and dodging incoming projectiles like you would expect to do in first-person shooters preceeding Half-Life that are also touted as oldschool FPS classics. Uuhhh, you will be dodging smg nades though, or at least be trying to, trust me. Half-Life also doesn't have secrets in the oldschool FPS sense, and the game's maps aren't all disparate or somewhat disparate levels, but flow together more seamlessly into large chapters with a pacing that is more varied than what you'd see in many other first-person shooters from this era. Half-Life is not oldschool in the same sense that for example Doom or Quake are. Uhm, I guess Blood kind of did the whole--ANYWAY, while Half-Life was by no means the first FPS to include NPC's or scripted set pieces, it is arguably the FPS most responsible for leading the genre in a more scripted, linear, and story-focused direction, which in the Half-Life series' case culminated with Half-Life 2: Episode 2 in 2007. This is one of the main ways in which Half-Life would go on to influence the genre, which I'm not saying is all a bad thing -- who knows if we would have had Bioshock if it weren't for Half-Life? What I know for certain, is that Half-Life's got mods. Ah, the mods. There is no shortage of fantastic Half-Life mods. I've heard that there was a little mod that could, called Counter-Strike, which went on to become one of the most influential multiplayer games of all time.\n\n\nMore on the movement:\nLetting go of the forward key and holding down either the right or left directional key, while smoothly moving your mouse in the same direction, will allow you to curve your forward midair trajectory either left or right -- this is called air strafing. You may freely alternate between left- and right-hand air strafes, but this can be a little tricky at first. Interestingly, air strafing also increases your forward momentum and you can garner immense speed by chaining together well-timed jumps and air strafes (bunny hopping). \n\nAir strafing is a movement quirk carried over from Quake's adorable and quirky game engine, where it works differently in several ways, but the main gist of it is the same there as it is in Half-Life; hold directional key, move mouse in the same direction, gaming bliss ensues. This movement goodness was subsequently carried over into the Source Engine and tons of other games. While the ways in which different games with air strafing handle momentum acceleration varies, the aforementioned \"main gist\" of it all remains intact 'til this day, and can even be seen in more recent games like Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends. The bhop, KZ climb, and surf movement communities were born out of Half-Life and GoldSrc. idtech 2 laid the groundwork for these things, and with GoldSrc and Half-Life they came to fruition thanks to passionate communities. Shoutout to Momentum Mod.\n\nThere's A LOT more to Half-Life's movement than that, but I have to stop myself before I write an entire speedrunning tutorial or I go off about how amazing Team Fortress 2's rocket jumping mechanics are. Basically, movement in Half-Life's engine and its derivative, Source, is tight, deep, and satisfying. Like your mum.\n\n\nI may be sooomewhat biased by the fact that Half-Life is literally one of the first games I ever played and nostalgia is crack cocaine, even if my only experience with Half-Life in my diaper-wearing years was with Half-Life Uplink, which is effectively the game's \"demo\", sort of, and also well worth playing by the way -- but to me, Half-Life oozes charm. It's a cozy game. The believable but blocky enviroments, the heavily exaggerated reverberation effects, the \"ARGH! NO! STOP!\" of the scientists, the ka-pow of the shotgun -- it all makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.\n\nIn Half-Life you play as 27-year old theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman, who works at the Black Mesa Research Facility, located somewhere in the New Mexico desert. The game opens with you arriving late for work in the now very iconic tram ride intro sequence, as Kelly Bailey's fantastically ominous ambient music plays in the background. \n\nAs you breathe the air and take in the game's atmosphere, laden with hi-tech industrial theming, it becomes abundantly clear that the goings-on at Black Mesa must be of unfathomable magnitude and utmost importance. The intro sets the tone for the game INCREDIBLY well. I cannot say enough positive things about this intro. It's a little long, yes, but it's communicative and just wow.\n\nWhen you start the game, from the moment the game's title on a black background fades away and allows you to see, and until the game's end, you experience the game world entirely through the eyes of Gordon Freeman. From the moment the proverbial and literal ride begins, you're there every step of the way, with Gordon, through thick and thin, through the scorching desert, through once sterile offices where now lie the decaying corpses of your former colleagues, through test labs home to questionable ethics -- it's all unraveled to the player from Gordon's perspective, and it's so damn compelling.","timestamp_created":1572820451,"timestamp_updated":1572820451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":139,"votes_funny":14,"weighted_vote_score":"0.910115897655487061","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56439966","author":{"steamid":"76561198359339915","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1626382519},"language":"english","review":"Random scientist wields a gun for the first time.\nManages to take down an entire military force.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1572817914,"timestamp_updated":1572817914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":110,"votes_funny":103,"weighted_vote_score":"0.891999959945678711","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56439611","author":{"steamid":"76561198320081530","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3881,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3505,"last_played":1603135257},"language":"english","review":"Well its half life what did you expect.","timestamp_created":1572817571,"timestamp_updated":1572817571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56437854","author":{"steamid":"76561198366689868","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":303,"last_played":1624311990},"language":"spanish","review":"nice game","timestamp_created":1572815892,"timestamp_updated":1572815892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56437713","author":{"steamid":"76561198443690235","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":29044,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18155,"last_played":1578701554},"language":"turkish","review":"21 sene oldu hala Türkçe dil desteği gelmedi onun haricinde güzel oyun.","timestamp_created":1572815772,"timestamp_updated":1572815772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56435185","author":{"steamid":"76561198130369650","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":1547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":251,"last_played":1639988926},"language":"polish","review":"fucking good","timestamp_created":1572813664,"timestamp_updated":1572813664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56435173","author":{"steamid":"76561198231314284","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":837,"last_played":1593219425},"language":"english","review":"yeah","timestamp_created":1572813657,"timestamp_updated":1572813657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56434304","author":{"steamid":"76561198419014147","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3068,"last_played":1655832047},"language":"russian","review":"Half-life - это феномен из мира шутеров и игр в целом.Халф-лайф первая привнесла сюжет в повествование игры.
