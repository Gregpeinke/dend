It's one of the most frustrating experience i've ever had while playing a video game. The game does a terrible job in delivering health packs and that coupled with the god awful amount of action going on means you're dying all the time. Along with that, the terrible AI (marines which are supposed to protect you, actually shoot you at times), frequent glitches (I got stuck on the elevator floors due to which i had to revert to previous save) and frequent crashes make the already bad experience even worse. \n\nThe only and LITERALLY the only thing which this game does good are the new BADASS weapons (really-really loved the fuck off to the xen gun), but thats about it in my opinion. Blueshift was a way better expansion to be honest.","timestamp_created":1583865334,"timestamp_updated":1625081838,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610484182834625244","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64823800","author":{"steamid":"76561197995160077","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1583870145},"language":"english","review":"you can kill your teammates without gettin banned 10/10","timestamp_created":1583863958,"timestamp_updated":1583863958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64822097","author":{"steamid":"76561197989807143","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1049,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1044,"last_played":1583861805},"language":"english","review":"its fun and adicting","timestamp_created":1583861524,"timestamp_updated":1583861524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64787579","author":{"steamid":"76561198400958660","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":535,"last_played":1549369931},"language":"schinese","review":"不输原作的游戏质量，极具创意的新武器和队友，以及Race-X种族也很有意思。可惜V社官方不承认Gearbox的剧情","timestamp_created":1583802643,"timestamp_updated":1583802643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64752721","author":{"steamid":"76561198844642663","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":463,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":258,"last_played":1585414752},"language":"russian","review":"???","timestamp_created":1583744867,"timestamp_updated":1583744867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64742906","author":{"steamid":"76561198079222744","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":429,"last_played":1583723981},"language":"english","review":"Phenomenal.

You get to do a few extra things in this game, such as climb and swing from ropes, get some new weapons, and you'll listen into HECU radios that will inform you about your mission and the progress of the alien invasion.\n\nThe visuals seem to run off the same engine as the original Half-Life (not surprising) as well as many of the audio tracks and sound effects are very nostalgic.\n\nI like how Valve was able to give us a different viewpoint of the alien invasion from Half-Life, but change it up from the original game. I think this game does a good job of portraying what the HECU would've been doing during the alien invasion at Black Mesa and they did it pretty well. The only underwhelming thing I think this game suffers from is the final boss, which isn't very difficult once you get the rhythm down (like most games). Anyway, I would recommend this game to not only complete your Valve collection, but to also enjoy Half-Life in a new viewpoint.","timestamp_created":1583084418,"timestamp_updated":1583084418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64367389","author":{"steamid":"76561198825067362","num_games_owned":507,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":448,"last_played":1641290480},"language":"polish","review":"dobry dodatek nie za krótki  nowi przeciwnicy i bronie po prostu świetna gra","timestamp_created":1583082159,"timestamp_updated":1583082159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64366988","author":{"steamid":"76561198983798028","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1583342791},"language":"english","review":"Its good and very green.","timestamp_created":1583081623,"timestamp_updated":1583172265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64366621","author":{"steamid":"76561198193084490","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":321,"last_played":1583080850},"language":"english","review":"if you've played half life 1 first, this will be an amazing playthrough","timestamp_created":1583081190,"timestamp_updated":1583081190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64365592","author":{"steamid":"76561198086628375","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11864,"playtime_last_two_weeks":273,"playtime_at_review":8415,"last_played":1660005548},"language":"english","review":"Opposing Force is an interesting story that runs in parallel with that of Half-Life.

One aspect of Op For that I really appreciated was that my expectations of the game's objectives were subverted considerably in a way that makes the HECU almost sympathetic. \nGameplay is very much familiar with only the new methods of getting around levels - namely rope climbing and using the Barnacles to pull you across - being the newest learning curve but both are pretty straightforward. The new weapons are pretty good and as with Half-Life titles, you have to be strategic with the weapons you use as ammo is pretty scarce though you can use the Displacer Cannon to transport to Xen to find new ammo for most weapon types though you need a large quantity of depleted uranium ammo in the first place to make the transport. Building a squad in the game with other HECU marines is a really nice feature (revolutionary when Op For was first released) where you can order more heavily armed marines with the SAW to cover you while the medics could help give a health boost out on the field and engineers can cut through doors. Sometimes they're not essential but there are occasions where it is not possible to progress throughout the game without their help so it is in your best interests to keep safeguard your squad.\nIn terms of the new Race X aliens, you often have to take a stance using cover and strafing much more than other Half-Life titles as the Shock Troopers have significant offensive strength and the Pit Drones have strength in numbers whilst the Voltigores are ammo sponges that can be deadly in close quarters, where you will often find them.\nAs much as I enjoyed Blue Shift, Op For is by far the better game to me, also helped by the latter taking a couple of hours longer to complete in addition to the new content available whilst the former is more about creating exposition that sets up Half-Life 2. The biggest criticism I have of Op For is an unresolved bug where you become stuck in position, most frequently so when you travel down an elevator, only being able to look around and forcing you to reload from a point before you got in the elevator. The only resolution I've found is to keep jumping in the elevator until it stops moving so you don't get stuck.\n","timestamp_created":1583071993,"timestamp_updated":1583071993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64358041","author":{"steamid":"76561198038269046","num_games_owned":2559,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":244,"last_played":1583071183},"language":"french","review":"Les graphismes et la difficulté sont d'époque mais ça continue de faire le taf!","timestamp_created":1583071225,"timestamp_updated":1583071225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64290646","author":{"steamid":"76561198133816287","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":547,"last_played":1660391313},"language":"polish","review":"Klasyk!
