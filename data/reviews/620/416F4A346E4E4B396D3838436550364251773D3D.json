Fenomen Portala 1 i 2 jest doskonale wszystkim znany, a Valve po raz kolejny pokazało klasę w wydawanych przez siebie grach. Wielu z Was śmieszy zapewne, że tak późno piszę recenzję do gry, która zdążyła się już pokryć sporą warstwą kurzu. Ano tak wyszło, gra jest dla mnie nowa, przechodzę ją dopiero pierwszy raz. Czemu? Otóż miałem inne tytuły na tapecie, odstraszał mnie zaś logiczny tryb gry. Szczerze, nie lubię gier zbyt logicznych, w których trzeba zadręczać szare komórki. Dlatego tak długo mi zeszło, a za grę sięgnąłem po prostu z nudów.\n\nOpisywać Portala nie zamierzam. Nie ma sensu powtarzać to, co inni napisali już w \"zamierzchłych\" czasach. Wystarczy, że napomknę że gra mi się dość podobała. Czemu dość? No cóż, przysłowiowej dupy nie urywa. Owszem, gra się miło, szczególnie że po zaliczeniu pierwszej bardzo infantylnej i krótkiej części, gra przeszła dość spory lifting. Nadal jednak razi mnie niesamowicie uproszczona grafika. I nie mam na myśli słabą jakość, zdaję sobie sprawę że gra ma już swoje latka. Nie. To co mnie razi, to uboga i powtarzalna szata graficzna. Przyznam, że zamiast nudnych do bólu pomieszczeń i bliźniaczo do siebie podobnych, wolałbym poszaleć po jakiś wieżowcach, studniach, kanałach i nad rozmaitymi naturalnymi przepaściami. A tymczasem mamy białe ściany, ciemne ściany, woda - na palcach jednej ręki można policzyć rodzaje tekstur w Portalu.\n\nTak wiem, tu nie grafika jest ważna, ale same zagadki. I kolejna rzecz, brak stopniowania poziomu trudności. Gra jest niebywale łatwa, a niektóre pomieszczenia tak przewidywalne, że praktycznie Portal przechodzi się niemal sam. Może jednak zmienię zdanie, gdy grę przejdę w całości, wraz z misjami kooperacyjnymi. Póki co, jak wspomniałem - gra ciekawa i potrafi wciągnąć, ale jak dla mnie aż tak wielkim hitem nie będzie. Wolę jednak rozwalać niemiluchów, niż skakać przez niebieskie i pomarańczowe dziury. Niemniej polecam miłośnikom łamigłówek, chociaż łba to sobie tutaj zbytnio nie połamiecie. No, chyba że ktoś ma naprawdę toporne myślenie, ale to już pozostawiam pod indywidualny osąd.","timestamp_created":1439762353,"timestamp_updated":1439762353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545189499855041504","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17572665","author":{"steamid":"76561198095913507","num_games_owned":574,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1607,"last_played":1611929520},"language":"english","review":"A sequel from 2011 to the [i]Portal[/i] (2007) phenomena it expands on its predecessor in every way.

Al finale mi sono sentito soddisfatto perché avevo finito tutte le sfide solo con pazienza e ingegno. Posso dire che Portal è il rompicapo per eccellenza, devi uscire da una stanza, basta, nient'altro, l'obbiettivo e sempre lo stesso, hai in mano una pistola per portali e devi farne uso. \nPortal 2 è un Portal più ricco, più florido dal punto di vista grafico e narrativo. Poi alla fine è sempre uguale: distruggere l'intelligenza artificiale malvagia. Portal 2 ha una storia più complessa del primo, più emozionante e intricata. In più si può giocare in cooperativa (divertente con gli amici) e si possono creare le proprie sfide e poi provarle per vedere se funzionano.\nE' uscito fuori un gioco eccezionale, un must buy per tutti. Dopo averci giocato capirete che il mondo funziona in portali blu e arancioni.","timestamp_created":1439751092,"timestamp_updated":1439751092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526895999908447266","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17570958","author":{"steamid":"76561198170005286","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1592180087},"language":"english","review":"The cake is still a lie.","timestamp_created":1439749420,"timestamp_updated":1439749420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17570468","author":{"steamid":"76561198089158460","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":2695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1401,"last_played":1465938178},"language":"english","review":"Best puzzle game! \n11/10","timestamp_created":1439747512,"timestamp_updated":1439747512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533468544483184814","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17567720","author":{"steamid":"76561198069723983","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1528,"last_played":1611894897},"language":"english","review":"Just- buy this  game.
