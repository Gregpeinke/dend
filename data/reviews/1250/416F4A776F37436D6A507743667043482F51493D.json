While there are meta picks regarding stun values and weight economy that really skew and limit high level play, its rarely the case that a weapon flat out is restricted from working.\n\n   - In the sequel, its common for multiple weapons of the same make to have wildly different basic function, and its common for specific damage types to be non-viable against common threats. (For example, two different glock 18's have entirely different damage multipliers based on which class is intended to buy it.)\n\n   - In KF1, the weapon might weigh and cost more then its worth, but its behavior will be consistent with other similar weapons, and it will still work and feel right. You won't pick up a identical weapon and wonder why it doesn't damage stalkers.\n\nBecause of this, the games tactical roles are generally accomplished in a easily felt and consistent way. Naturally there are a few famous weaknesses (Fleshpounds+explosives, skrakes+stunlocks, sirens+a few meters distance,) but other then this, things are **Consistent** and satisfying once you can get past the shooting being an antique here.\n\n+ Its inexpensive and there will be very few important DLC's (3 \"Support the modders\" DLC packs totaling to approximately $10 on sale, and a *large* number of skins that you don't need for the full experience.)","timestamp_created":1634429886,"timestamp_updated":1634429936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101168027","author":{"steamid":"76561199079492480","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1635402683},"language":"english","review":"I

Lo que le hace falta es un poco de mantenimiento y quitar el limite de fps de la gpu ya que este juego solo aprovecha el 40% de la GPU lo cual limita los fps pudiendo alcanzar mas. Diria que el juego actualmente esta capado ya que antes con GPU antiguas alcanzaba 80 fps de forma estable. Algo que ahora depende del numero de zeds en el campo lo que en una oleada grande da como consecuencia 30 fps y con un uso de 40% que no pasa de esa cantidad. Lo curioso es que si jugamos la KF2 con DX11 el uso de la GPU es de 100% y los fps 110. Mi GPU es una \"RX-570 MKII 8GB\". Lo que me deja claro que KF1 esta actualmente capado en FPS. El porque? No lo se pero recuerdo que en su tiempo se jugaba en GPU antiguas a mas FPS de forma estable. Fuera de eso es un juegazo insuperable y prefiero mil veces este que su ultima version que deja mucho que desear. Aqui un resumen de lo que hablo:\n\nKilling Floor: Se enfocaron en crear un juego de survival horror muy bizarro lo que no deja claro si los zeds son demonios o zombies pero que generan tension y presion en el jugador ya que sientes que estuvieras en una ciudad infernal con un claro aspecto a algo demoniaco.\n\nKilling Floor 2: Aquí es donde lo terrorífico y bizarro se va por el drenaje. El juego solo parece un competitivo de matar monstruos con calidad HD para ver quien mata mas zeds. Es decir KF2 no es un survival horror sino un juego de competir a ver quien mata mas zeds. Ya que los zeds y los boss pierden la tematica de horror y estilo bizarro que esta versión KF1 nos habia acostumbrado a disfrutar.\n\nKF1 a pesar de tener un motor DX9 que esta capado a aprovechar el 100% de las GPU modernas. Nos ofrece un diseño terrorífico, demoníaco y bizarro. Algo que KF2 dejo de lado para ofrecer algo que no sé ni como llamar. Ya que en vez de presionar al usuario y poner los pelos de punta te anima a pasear tranquilamente por un mapa que en ocasiones no tiene pinta de ser un mapa de horror.\n\n100% Recomendado si buscas un juego de horror como Silent Hill pero en modo survival horror, Actualmente el juego carece de jugadores aunque en las tardes suele haber mas gente jugando.\n\nMás allá de los años que tiene este titulo (13 años al momento de la publicación de esta reseña) es innegable su capacidad de retener a los amantes de los shooters en primera persona. Es un inmortal que goza con más popularidad que su hermano menor Killing Floor 2 y por buenas razones.\n\n1) Es mucho más Difícil debido a sus controles algo toscos (es decir duros) Cuesta acostumbrarse\n\n2) Es complicado sobrevivir en single a menos que lleves un tiempo practicando y sepas anticiparte a cada cosa.\nCada perk y cada mapa tiene su estrategia y aprenderla es la clave\nCaso contrario no pasaras de la oleada 5 ni en HARD.\nNo digamos ya jugando en grupo pues ahí deberás multiplicar la complejidad y hacer caso a los que saben. O muy seguramente te den un kick de una.\n\n3) Los zeds no perdonan ni dan chances. No puedo explicarlo mejor. Si se te acercan demasiado... En fin. ESPECIALMENTE con LA SIREN (Es condenada la detesto jaja)\n\nEs un juego para pasarla lindo con los amigos y renegar cuando pierdan o alguno haga enojar a los subjefes provocando la muerte de la escuadra sin querer queriendo\n\nTambién podes contar con ayuda de la comunidad. Que es muy activa con jugadores fieles y realmente PROS pero por otro lado están los que te insultan por casi cualquier cosa incluso a los novatos que están aprendiendo.\n\nHay fanáticos de KF muy pasados de rosca. Toxicos pero nivel Chernobyl.\nA killing Floor le doy un 10 por todo lo alto. Sobretodo por los jugadores que la tienen clarisima.\nEs un juego hecho a la vieja escuela donde tenias que ser muy habilidoso o morir en el intento; ahí esta su magia.\nTítulo en el que podrás perder mil veces pero siempre tenes ganas de volver a darle RETRY","timestamp_created":1633828609,"timestamp_updated":1653273632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100806047","author":{"steamid":"76561198310615550","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":121,"playtime_forever":116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":116,"last_played":1633786277},"language":"russian","review":"Брал её чтобы поиграть с другом вдвоем, думал создам сервер да, приглашу его, и начнем творить мясо.

Поиграл я её же впервые в году 2019-20 где-то, с тем-же старшим братом, запустили пиратку и давай на KF-MountainPass убивать клотов и другую нечесть. Потом брату надоело и мне пришлось играть в соло, ух сколько эмоций давало столкновение с патриархом когда этот хуеглот выходил из инвиза перед твоим лицом... Все ещё помню как играл на KF-Manor и засел в углу второго этажа дома с АА-12 параллельно заварив все двери, что-бы легко было понять где он, как он появился весь магазин ушел в патриарха. Посоветую ли я эту игру на 2022? Трудно сказать если честно, она может принести вам кучу эмоций если играете её с друзьями на постоянной основе, да даже с рандомами если сервер полный. Однако в игре онлайн елё набирает 300 людей, что огорчает, ну это и понятно все играют во вторую часть. Из минусов можно выделить уж слишком долгую прокачку перков, ну серьезно убить 5500 сталкеров на коммандосе? это шутка какая-то? я еле технаря до 4 апнул и снайпера на 6, хотя сложная прокачка даёт больше мотивации прокачивать перк, ведь за него тебе дают прикольные плюшки. Анимации от первого и третьего лица плохие, озвучка английская и русская омерзительна, нет не подумайте я ничего не имею против bri'ish people . Из плюсов можно выделить прекрасный саундтрек, не слишком плохую графику для 2009 (хотя в том же ХЛ2 лично я считаю графика лучше), атмосфера просто на максимум выкручена (очень жалко что эти обезьяны её угробили в КФ2 своими чёртовыми шапками, золотыми орудиями и т.д), некоторые карты выглядят очень даже, я бы сказал красиво, особенно: KF-WestLondon, KF-Waterworks, KF-Manor и кучу других.\nСоветую ли я эту игру?

With game franchises I tend to enjoy the older games as well as enjoy difficult games like Hotline Miami 1/2.\n\nThis game may have been comparatively great in 2009, but the game has aged like milk and other than its wonderful, grungy horror aesthetic, KF2 is the better game. Yes, KF2 has a bunch of problems, but it's still miles better than this. Yes, I understand that I am \"new\" to the game and not great at it, but I don't want to grind for 15 more hours until i can level 6 one perk in hopes that this game suddenly becomes good.\n\n-The game is slow as shit. You can't sprint and unless you are a Berserker you are basically a snail.\n-Siren screams fucking blind you even when you are so far away that they don't do any damage to you. Bloats also cover your screen with puke for a stupidly long time.\n-Clots can grab you which is totally fair and an intentional mechanic that I have no issue with. HOWEVER, if you get surrounds by Crawlers (which are harder to hit) you're fucked, you are hitstunned and you cannot escape with WASD or jumping, they just drag you into the torrent ad infinitum (which is NOT intended). Keep in mind your aim is shaking like you're using a vibrator so you can't fucking hit them with anything but a flamethrower.\n-The easiest gamemode, Beginner, is so easy it's insulting. The next difficulty, Normal, is a massive difficulty spike. You go from being able to beat the game half-asleep to fucking sweating with one difficulty bump-up.\n-Fleshpounds are amongst the most bullshit enemies that I have ever encountered. Even the fucking teleporting grabbers in Hotline Miami 2 that can grab you through doors are more consistent that these things. Fleshpounds can take you from full health and full armor to death in under two seconds (on NORMAL). You'd think \"Oh, so they must be inherently hard, right?\" NOPE, if you are a Berserker you can literally exploit their AI so that they never rage and then you have to basically poke them for a minute straight while walking backwards and it's incredibly wasy. Really engaging gameplay. Oh, and you have to attack them slowly, or else they rage and kill you nearly instantly.\n-There is one boss, and he's fucking obnoxious. There's no healthbar, so you basically have no feedback on how much you are actually doing to him. His attacks include: 1. Appearing in front of you and smacking you for like 20% of your health 2. A rocket that takes like 50% of your health 3. A minigun that you can only avoid by humping a wall that takes like 70-100% of your health on NORMAL.\n-Perks are blatantly unbalanced. Berserker is obviously meta because he can kill the Fleshpound effectively. The Support is also apparently meta because while the AA12 is great in KF2, in KF1 it is apparently so broken that people off-perk it just because you're borderline braindead not to use it. Sharpshooter is objectively the best perk round 1 because of the massive pistol damage increase. Everything else is weak in comparison.\n-Very few weapons, many of the best ones are DLC.\n\nAll-in-all, this game is only worth playing if you bought KF2 deluxe and you want a trip down memory lane or your current computer is too weak (i.e. you are on a laptop on vacation in the UK and your good PC is in the US). Skip this game and play either Left 4 Dead 2, KF2, or Payday 2/The Heist if you want a co-op horde shooter. Don't waste money on this outdated game.","timestamp_created":1633149964,"timestamp_updated":1633149964,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.431654691696166992","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100336834","author":{"steamid":"76561198091407117","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":22878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13556,"last_played":1657403892},"language":"brazilian","review":"Excelente
