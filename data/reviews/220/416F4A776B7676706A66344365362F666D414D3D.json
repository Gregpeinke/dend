(about 1 hour or a little more a day, didn't play everyday.)\n- Have looked in to lore and icebergs and history of this game.\n- I play other games by the publishers.\nCons:\n-Had to watch a walkthrough for a few little bits (got stuck, couldn't find where to go).\n-Did not play Half Life 1 completely (working on it)\n-Not super good at phrasing things. Like if I can't think of a word or.. well here's an example of me not knowing how to phrase the rest of this.\n\nAnyways,\nThis game (Half Life 2) is one of the best, dare I say THE BEST game I have ever played. At first, at least to me, I thought it was a stupid first person shooter that is like all the rest, no no, this game is not that, this is a game that I believe even to be ahead of it's time now. The story, the action, the graphics! Would you believe me (if you didn't know this already) if I told you that this game is from 2004? Well, probably or probably not seeing as how you have either played this or not even touched the trailer for it. Either way, this is a must have or must play. Congrats if you get it for free (as a gift). I would definitely play it again, of course after I play all the spin offs and sequels and maybe some fan games. If your kids however want to play this game, there are some curse words, one line from Barney being the f word (only one time in the whole game though). I mean, yeah, there's blood, but it's honestly not that bad. There are sad moments, funny moments, happy moments, weird moments (Grigori). I don't want to spoil the game any, but if I were you, throw the can at the guard (you'll know when you get there). \n\nSo here's the scoop. Are the graphics and sound any good? Yeah, definitely not like the movies though. Good story? Best story in my opinion, not just COD online. Speaking of online, is there ANY online gameplay besides with mods? No, not that I can find at least. Any lastly, melon? Yes, melon.\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\nBUY IT ON SALE, IT'S THE GREATEST DEAL YOU'LL GET.

It trusts you to figure out where to go next, and it feels entirely natural. Rarely, it fails, and you have to enter the mindset of \"where do the developers want me to go,\" but usually the path forward is clear. The number of times I saw something and thought \"Could I go there? Wait, do the developers want me to go there?\" was enormous. I've rarely seen a game that makes you feel clever for following the intended path.\n\nThe music is great, and the atmosphere is top notch. The alien systems of the Combine are always neat to see. The Overwatch voice is one of my favorite pieces of worldbuilding in the whole game.\n\nRavenholm is better than 80% of all horror games.\n\nThe pacing of this game is at top speed at all times, and it never gives you a moment to really breathe and explore the impact you're having on this world on the characters around you. The characters don't feel real, in an odd way. \"Oh hey, Gordon Freeman, savior of Black Mesa, has returned from the dead after 15 years, halfway across the planet, and he hasn't aged a day. That's neat!\"\n\nYou're constantly rushing around and doing things, but you rarely get to see the consequences of your actions beyond corpses. After Nova Prospekt, the game leaps forward a week and says \"Surprise, the uprising's started. Go grab a gun and keep shooting.\" The reactions of the resistance fighters are the closest you get to seeing how others feel about you, and their voice lines are limited.\n\nI actually really enjoyed Dr. Breen's speeches. They're really well-written. At the end, when you confront him in person, he either becomes or is revealed to be a supervillain. Maybe the speeches were always a facade, but I felt a bit let down by it.\n\nThose are minor gripes, and the core experience is excellent. The story and characters aren't really the focus of the game, after all- the protagonist never says a word. Maybe judging it for things it doesn't try to be is unfair. \n\nI fully recommend this game to anyone looking for worldbuilding, action, or adventure.

And in all honesty, I still don't fully know what this game is about. But It's just so incredible how a game this old can still be so good. Half Life 2, a game from 2004, is better than some triple A titles we see today. When I saw the glass break on a window for the first time in this game, I thought, didn't \"Cyberpunk even mess that up?\" It's so simple yet so important to the experience.\n\nAnother major thing that caught my eye was the creative direction this game takes. It's one of those games where you say to people \"No game can do it like _____ did it.\" And I think that's what makes it unique. Take this for example: In the game instead of cutscenes there is just dialogue and people moving about, It really makes you feel like you ARE Gordon Freeman and that you're experincing the same things he is. After playing this I actually got a dislike towards cutscenes. There were times I said to myself \"I wish this part was more like Half Life\" when im playing a completely different game. It really gives a new feel to the game.\n\nLastly, It's one of those games that you get good at after a while. In the beginning I was struggling with the controls and having to swap between 6 different weapon slots. But once I rebinded those bad boys and got a feel for the game, I was a new man. I was running and jumping like no ones business.
