I still haven't finished this one.)\nBut I played Black Mesa first, and the gameplay in HL:S is so much more balanced and fun. The graphics, obviously, have suffered over the years. But if you like shooters and feeling like you accomplish something when you play games, or even love a fucking weird ass narrative told without the protagonist ever speaking, this game for LITERALLY EVERYONE YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO FIT THE REQUIREMENTS.\nUnless you're a chicken, who's more scared of stuff than me.

Gordan Freeman must fight his way out of the Black Mesa facility after a terrible experiment release creatures from another dimension into our dimension.  The Government sends troops to silent the experiment and all survivors within the facility.

Its smart and flat-out INTERESTING, something you can really sink your teeth into. Seriously enthralling. Its always got you asking; \"why\", \"how\", \"WTF!?!\" , you never get bored advancing through events or dialogue. You spend the game fighting your way through the Black Mesa research facility discovering what happened in the catastrophic event. Taking the role of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist turned legendary hero. A man who witnesses soo much shit and accomplishes every impossible task set forth, and never has a fkn word to say. Like a boss. The silent hero of silent heroes.   He really is a legend in the game world. The story is well enough to pick up the game, but the mechanics and platforming are pretty fkn awesome too. You will actually spend a good chunk of game platforming and solving small 'puzzles', so it's not just a shooter. The game is pretty outdated, and this source version doesnt do much to revive the out of date engine. However there is a mod called Black Mesa that uses the HL2 engine and is exactly the same story and levels with just updated scenery and voice acting(same script). So you dont have to play Half-Life(original) till you get into the Xen/Alien chapters(my least favorite).

This monument of the videogame medium as a whole was VALVe Software's very first product; one that was by no means easy to produce, but was eternally rewarding. Half Life is still being played today and enjoyed by many people, and deservedly so. For it is one of those titles in videogame history that is recognized by many; even those who might have very little experience with the franchise or its modded stand-alone offsprings.\n\nHalf Life puts the player in the shoes and HEV mark IV Protective System of everyone's favorite mute, crowbar-wielding, monster-slaying, marine-fighting theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman. The plot takes a humble beginning, as Gordon arrives to work--late--and prepares for what seems like a regular day at the Black Mesa Research Facility in the underground desert landscape of New Mexico. Perhaps a regular day, if not for the \"deviation from standard analysis procedure.\" The player is let loose to briefly explore parts of the facility, allowing for a brief settlement before the experiment you are taking part of goes horribly wrong and all of a sudden that elevator you rode is out of order, that corridor you walked through is now covered in blood. That security  guard you talked to is trying to revive a scientist you had just run into 5 minutes ago, and that other scientist you talked to has turned into some weird mutant that is now walking towards you, though no longer with any interests of making small talk. Everything that the player had seen and gotten used to is now part of a horrific thrill ride; one that is action packed and will only get better from there.\n\nThe game's story telling is absolutely fanstastic. It delivers a truly immersive experience by never leaving the first person perspective of the player and Dr. Freeman. It sacrifices cutscenes and cinematic mumbo-jumbo for first-hand experiences and uninterrupted gameplay. Said gameplay is very satisfying. There is a very good mix of firefights of varying intensity combined with puzzles and first person platforming. The puzzles can be a tad difficult at times, but just the right kind of difficulty to encourage perseverance and reward the player for their astuteness. Firefights are also quite fun; you start out making your way through waves of hostile inter-dimensional beings and later on fight none other than the few, the proud, the Marines, who pose quite an intimidating threat. The Marines really shine in the AI department, they're aggressive but smart enough to know when to retrieve. They have a sense of personal preservation unlike anything I have ever seen in any other videogame. They will try their hardest to kill Gordon, using any tools at their disposal, but they don't want to die, and will thus will make effective use of cover and defensive tactics. \n\nI would highly recommend purchasing the Source version of Half Life due to some added features such as much better particle effects, improved lighting and water effects, as well as the intergrated ragdoll physics. Those not interested in such added details could easily overlook the Source version and buy vanilla Half Life, seeing as how it is the same price on Steam as the Source version, but I would highly recommend getting this version for those who haven't experienced Half Life and are looking to get into it.\n\nYou musn't dare call yourself a fan of Half Life or VALVe if you haven't played this game. Experience the original tale of a theoretical physicist trying to escape the Black Mesa Research Facility, perfectly remastered into VALVe's state of the art Source engine. It's a game you will not regreat putting your time and money into","timestamp_created":1353176388,"timestamp_updated":1419992406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555555522441864014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4205552","author":{"steamid":"76561198033835837","num_games_owned":1865,"num_reviews":322,"playtime_forever":580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":580,"last_played":1350370800},"language":"english","review":"I finally got around to playing the original Half-Life, wanting to expand my knowledge on the universe that Valve had created.\n\nThis is possibly the worst Valve game I have yet played. It has aged poorly. I guess if I had the fortune of playing it upon release I would appreciate it more, but I just can't understand how it managed to garner so much praise back in 1998. Perhaps there were some major changes that affected gameplay when they released the Source version in 2005?\n\nThe AI is completely broken. You can edge around corners and slowly pick off immobile enemies by shooting their feet. If they can't see you their AI won't kick in. Pretty terrible mechanics. Apparently the AI was taken from Half-Life 2 when HL: Source was released. It doesn't show it.\n\nThe controls are way too twitchy. It's almost impossible to succesfully climb down a ladder without dying the first time. You often go sliding off edges as if Gordon's feet are made of ice. It was certainly a frustrating experience.\n\nThere is also absolutely no story or character development. None. You are Gordon Freeman, a scientist. You open a portal to another dimension. You close the portal. The end. Everyone you meet along the way is disposable and has no distinguishing features or names.\n\nThere is no explanation for any of what is happening, there is no lead up to Half-Life 2. The reasons for the military presence are not explained, neither is the fact that they are replaced with Combine forces in the sequel, however many years later.\n\nThe only connection between Half-Life and Half-Life 2 is Gordon Freeman and the G-Man. That's it. The only recurring enemies are the headcrabs and Vortigaunt, the latter of which are apparently on your side for some reason. Who knows how they ended up on Earth if the portal was closed.\n\nThis was an amazingly empty experience, void of any story or sense of progression. I understand that was Valve's and, especially, Gabe Newell's intentions, but it just doesn't sit right with me.\n\nI know my opinion will go against the grain and, while I did enjoy the game overall and appreciate how it is placed within the Half-Life universe, I still can not overlook the many smaller flaws that become overbearing during gameplay. I have to wonder if these issues exist in the original Half-Life game or if they are exclusive to the Source version.","timestamp_created":1352897032,"timestamp_updated":1385436844,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.421294063329696655","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6576349","author":{"steamid":"76561198069490265","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1466428544},"language":"russian","review":"Таже старая добрая half-life, только с физикой и с кучей исправленных ошибок.","timestamp_created":1352621534,"timestamp_updated":1550241684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528732419013977051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4701242","author":{"steamid":"76561198040912589","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":762,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1495048620},"language":"english","review":"Moin","timestamp_created":1351896961,"timestamp_updated":1351896961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/tHV4boCesP3EQ=="}
