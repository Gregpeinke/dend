All in all, it's not a great story with complex political stuff or such. But the story will make you feel you are the mighty Gordon Freeman, that the one people talk in this game is YOU, not a character in a fictional world. And I think Valve should have a credit for making the player feels like they are the main character. I have never feel this important in a game, feeling like it's my world, where I have part in it, to protect it. It's not perfect of course, as it's not the end of the adventure.\n\nGraphic: 8.5/10\nOutdated is the first word comes to mind of course, remembering this game is 10 years old. Sure, close ups are really really bad, but the panorama this game has still manage to catch my breath at times. There are times where I stand at a high place, and stop for a while, only to admire how beauty the view is. Valve has really made a beautiful world in this game. As for enemies, friends, and other creatures in this game, I'll just say they did great job not to make it look very outdated.\n\nSound: 9/10\nIn an action game, we don't usually listen to music in game, as we are distracted by the fast enemies coming and be killed, not for this one. At least for me, the music is really great, fit with the atmosphere, and still keep our focus in the game. At times the music will make us feel vulnerable, at other times it makes us powerful. For sound effect and other stuff, it's at least very believeable, quite close to the real sound though there're times where it sound a little different. I really like the gun's sound though.\n\nLevel design: 10/10\nYou know what will come, but you'll still be surprised when it comes. That's the easy version of level design in Half-Life 2. Valve who's made their name famous from Half-Life, took their recipe of level design further and perfected it, then implement it in Half-Life 2. The one word t describe is fun. It's just fun defending yourslf from enemies, and never it is a boredom. There's surprises in the way.\nOh believe me, there're a LOT of surprises, and Valve sure love their zombies\n\nTechnical: 8/10\nIt may be my computer, but it took about 5-10 seconds to load between levels\n\nFinal verdict: 9/10\nA masterpiece \nLots of fun\nA believeable world\nStory that's just.... play it yourself\nAnd a genius level design","timestamp_created":1424011022,"timestamp_updated":1424011022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14482279","author":{"steamid":"76561198157755791","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":741,"last_played":1584126278},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever\n","timestamp_created":1424009736,"timestamp_updated":1424009736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14481938","author":{"steamid":"76561198122633460","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1991,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1153,"last_played":1651797615},"language":"english","review":"i saw in a certain gaming magazine that this game was rated themsecond best sci-fi game of all time. i, though, would rate it the finest sci-fi game i have ever played in my entire life!","timestamp_created":1424008429,"timestamp_updated":1424008429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14480655","author":{"steamid":"76561197980693171","num_games_owned":323,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":4206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3669,"last_played":1573978588},"language":"russian","review":"Я наиграл больше 68 часов, я прошёл эту игру 7 раз, может и больше!\nВот и плюсы и минусы:\n+Игра шикарна\n+Игра шикарна\n+Игра шикарна\n+Игра шикарна\n+Игра шикарна\nМинусы:\nА вот и нет минусов, как по мне\nА, да, даже можно \"убить\" G-man'a!

It still sits on the shelf above my computer, complete with the box, manual and all 11 floppy disks, as a tribute to how great this game is. So, Half life 2, where to begin?\n\nWhen this game came out in 1988, it made a huge impact on the game industry, because at the time the idea of creating a first person shooter was absurd. Even the original half life wasn't in first person, and that came out on the vic-20. Now, before I say anything else, let me just get this out of the way. This game is old and it shows. Although the developers have done a fantastic job of making it run nice and smooth on modern computers, completely eliminating the constant disk swapping present in the original version, there are still many things that might make the younger gamers hesitant about purchasing this. But enough about that, let's get to the game itself.\n\nThis game practically invented the first person shooter genre. Now, anyone familiar with BASIC programming and the commodore 64 can see where I'm going when I say the commodore 64 was a slow system. Like, really slow. Every time you move, the graphics on screen have to be redrawn, which usually takes a second or two. The game is drastically simplified in that the game, instead of featuring open, free roaming environments, works on a grid based, tile-walk system, similar to pokemon or the old bard's tale games. Over the course of the game, you level up, and can choose to increase either your health, stamina or magika, which really allows the player to take the time to craft the kind of characters they want.\n\nNow on to combat. There are three guns in the game, the pistol, the shotgun, and the SMG. It's up to you to discover their individual strengths and weaknesses in order to get through the loading screens in one piece. Just remember: Ammo is a precious resource, and must be used only when you truly need it.\n\nConcerning the story, it is definately one of the most finely crafted tales ever woven. Beautiful writing. Unfortunately though, you'll still have to download the paragraph book from the half life website, because when the game was first released, they didn't have the data storage to include all that text in the game. \n\nIn conclusion: This game is still a classic, and holds up even today. It is truly sad that the new generations will turn the other cheek at this game and walk away, but in my humble and biased opinion, I give it a buy.","timestamp_created":1423977589,"timestamp_updated":1423977589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513907194137573242","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14475552","author":{"steamid":"76561198148155792","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":734,"last_played":1423923711},"language":"english","review":"Phenomonal.

Introduce il source-engine 2.\n\nLa sua piattaforma originaria è il pc.\nIl gameplay e i comandi sono grosso modo uguali a quelli del capitolo precedente, così come l'interfaccia grafica del giocatore. La novità principale è lo sfruttamento della fisica, per cui il gioco è stato lodato e ha segnato una tappa importante nell'ambito. Con il tasto azione (E) si possono raccogliere quasi tutti gli oggetti sparsi per il mondo, li si può lanciare, fare a pezzi, recuperarne i frammenti. Ad un certo punto del gioco si entrerà in possesso di un'arma che permetterà un uso ancora più massiccio delle interazioni fisiche con l'ambiente circostante. Per il resto le armi sono più o meno le stesse del primo Half Life, anche se, naturalmente, ricalibrate in modo totalmente differente.\nIl gioco è grosso modo un lungo film interattivo senza interruzioni o cutscene, in cui il giocatore ha la possibilità di interagire a proprio piacimento e prendersi i suoi tempi. In questo, si evolve rielaborando la stessa coinvolgente narrazione del suo capitolo originale; laddove il primo aveva dei toni di realismo immersivo e survival, qui viene fatto spazio ad una cinematografia di nuova generazione, come se fossimo i protagonisti di un lungometraggio hollywoodiano. Niente a che vedere, comunque, con un'avventura grafica o un RPG alla giapponese ricolmi di sequenze statiche. L'interazione è una costante, e lo spettatore potrà vivere la storia a modo suo. Tanti sono stati i giochi che hanno attinto alla narrazione elaborata dai creatori di Half Life e Half Life 2, tant'è che ora un grandissimo numero di videogiochi in prima persona ne segue le medesime regole registiche di fondo.\n\nIl gioco è ambientato tempo dopo le vicende di Half Life 1. Non è necessario giocare al gioco precedente, data la semplicità del retroscena, anche se ovviamente è consigliato. Rispetto al più vago predecessore, inserito in un mondo contemporaneo senza tempo, qui il mondo ha un'impronta prettamente fantascientifica. Lo stile base è quello di un realismo patinato, un po' come i blockbuster action hollywoodiani, appunto. La regia la fa da padrona, focalizzando il giocatore su segmenti ben precisi del flusso di gioco. La sensazione che si vuol far respirare è quella di un mondo molto amplio, a tratti quasi free roaming, benchè, ovviamente, nella realtà dei fatti il percorso sia lineare e diviso in gigantesche aree distinte, in modo analogo ad Half Life 1, in cui però l'ambiente era uno solo.\nPersonalmente, ho però trovato molto confusionaria la sceneggiatura, e molto poco convincente il fattore di immedesimazione. Il giocatore viene buttato a capofitto in un mondo che non conosce, esattamente come il protagonista, Gordon Freeman, e in questo si dovrebbe creare un punto di contatto tra le due entità. Il problema è che ci troviamo costretti a dover eseguire degli ordini e delle indicazioni che non capiamo appieno, che magari non condividiamo, ma che dobbiamo eseguire per forza perché il gioco prevede che sia così, senza porci delle domande. Domande inevitabili, perché tutto il gioco è una continua ricerca a scoprire l'ambientazione, i fili della trama, le intenzioni dei personaggi che ci circondano. Tutto molto nebuloso, poichè mai reso in modo esplicito. Nella maggior parte dei giochi è difficile dissentire da ciò che il gioco desidera che facciamo, poichè ridotto ai minimi termini: se qualcuno ci fa del male lo uccidiamo; se c'è un percorso ad ostacoli lo terminiamo; se ci offrono una ricompensa tentiamo di accaparrarcela. In Half Life 2 non è tanto diverso, a conti fatti, ma il protagonista viene trattato come una vera e propria marionetta, e coinvolto in delle vicende oscure e indefinite che si presume a priori debba condividere, ma che nemmeno conosce. Questo nemmeno favorisce la componente thriller, poichè ai dubbi non vengono date risposte esaurienti. Molti dei retroscena dell'ambientazione sono raccontati da frasi casuali o dettagli che si possono tranquillamente non sentire o non cogliere, durante il nostro tragitto. Di conseguenza si potrà finire il gioco senza aver capito appieno ciò che stavamo facendo, il che non è mai gradevole per un giocatore, che vorrebbe avere anzi il controllo.\nForse il problema più grosso sta proprio nel fatto di aver voluto appiccicare una sceneggiatura cinematografica in un contesto in cui il protagonista è muto e privato della personalità (per farla coincidere con quella del giocatore). Scelta da me il più delle volte gradita, ma in questo particolare caso, la completa ed ingiustificata condiscendenza di Gordon Freeman a situazioni anche piuttosto compromettenti, non può essere condivisa dal giocatore tanto quanto da Gordon Freeman stesso se fosse stato un personaggio reale e non un meccanismo al servizio della storia, salvo appunto avendogli dato la possibilità di esprimere la propria opinione e interagire con tutti coloro che gli danno indicazioni.\n\nAnche per ciò che riguarda il gameplay, la mia sensazione è stata quella di una mancanza rispetto al primo Half Life. L'aspetto survival è stato quasi cancellato (ad eccezione forse dell'area di Ravenholm, uno dei punti che ho preferito nel gioco), per lasciare spazio ad una distesissima rilassatezza che rende Half Life 2 un gioco di sfogo e di svago. Non si presentano mai momenti realmente difficili, e quelli più impegnativi sono enfatizzati dall'abitudine alla completa rilassatezza di tutto il gioco. L'estenuante politica al risparmio del proiettile del primo gioco è completamente assente e, anche sprecando proiettili senza ritegno, è possibile trovare scappatoie per distruggere ogni avversario alla stregua di veri e propri Terminator assassini senza sprecare una singola pallottola (la gravity gun).\nOltre a questo, alcune aree sono effettivamente piuttosto monotone ed estremamente lunghe, con un game design ripetitivo che, per quanto possa essere stimolante, alla lunga diventa noioso.\n\nIl doppiaggio italiano, a differenza del primo capitolo, è realizzato presso gli studi pseudo-amatoriali di Bologna ed è oltremodo scabroso. La qual cosa arreca un danno considerevole nella friuzione del gioco da parte di chi non sa l'inglese. Leggere i sottotitoli infatti è estremamente fastidioso e stancante, specialmente data la distribuzione di cumuli di frasi anche estremamente lunghi, il che rende ancora più difficile seguire la storia già di per sè raccontata in modo molto caoticamente implicito e \"aneddotico\", rovinando la parte che dovrebbe essere lasciata all'immaginazione.\n\nChi idolatra il gioco è stato senza dubbio ammaliato dall'affascinante regia di Half Life 2, dalla sua atmosfera e la sua ambientazione. Elementi che meritano di essere largamente approvati. Meno efficaci, appunto, narrazione e sceneggiatura, fattori da non trascurare nel giudizio globale dell'opera. Le meccaniche di gameplay sono piuttosto rilassanti, e di certo il gioco non si presta a chi pretende di avere l'adrenalina a 1000.\nLa durata è sulle 20 ore; tutto sommato un gioco piuttosto lungo per essere uno sparatutto di nuova generazione.","timestamp_created":1423605964,"timestamp_updated":1423605994,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14423607","author":{"steamid":"76561197968090386","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3103,"last_played":1499526221},"language":"english","review":"I RETIRED before they could come out with the third one...
