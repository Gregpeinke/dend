The game was SO far ahead of anything in it's time and it remains one of the only games that ACTUALLY feels timeless all things considered. The springboard that was the Source engine was the beating heart of many beloved games, and it completely consumed 90's and 2000's kids with games like Garry's Mod and dozens of both fan-made mods and triple A giants utilizing the engine. Even when you remove Legacy, Half Life 2 is without a doubt in my opinion, the single greatest Single Player First Person Shooter of all time. Everything that Half Life 1 did, Half Life 2 did again but better. The game looks stylistically timeless, which is crazy because the game is pretty realistic in terms of graphics. In terms of gameplay, Half Life 2 again pursues Half Life 1's goal of total immersion in the world, and Half Life 2 has some of the best world building on display within its story. The world of City 17 feels so alive and vast, with the Combine's oppressive force constantly on display which was even more apparent when we visited City 17 again in Half Life Alyx. The human race is in an extremely rough place, yet at the same time you can feel the beating heart of the resistance brooding below the surface of the City, which is exemplified in the character of Alyx Vance, who adopts Gordon into the resistance, and its from this point that Half Life 2 embarks on an amazing one man quest to lead the resistance and topple the combine. Half Life 2's unbroken journey from City 17, to the Canals, to Black Mesa East, to Ravenholm, to Highway 17, to Nova Prospekt, and then to City 17 again is beautiful and does nothing but good things for the player's connection to the world as we see all of Gordon's adventures to build his alliance and rescue Eli Vance. And at the same time, the PLAYER is the one doing it. Building up your arsenal, meeting rebels along the way, spreading the word of the one free man. It's the heart of humanity on full display and its cool to see that spirit of rebellion hasn't abandoned humanity in its most desperate hour. The Combine's forces slowly being toppled as you work your way through every single iconic Half Life 2 chapter that is equal bits immersive and equal bits a joy to traverse and fight in. I mean this IS Valve we are talking about. Its basically a bunch of literal geniuses that love video games making the FPS to end all FPS's. I suppose I shouldn't be shocked. Not to mention the story, the G-Man, the characters, the G-Man, the gun play, the G-Man, the level design, the fluidity of moment, the incredible set pieces and iconic moments, the G-Man, the G-Man, the G-Man. Not to mention all of Half Life 2's bonus episodes leading to Half Life Alyx and now the future of the Half Life series. \n\nThere's no better time to experience Half Life for the first time, and if you didn't start with Half Life 1, this game is every bit as good as its first installment, maybe even a little bit better.","timestamp_created":1616174044,"timestamp_updated":1616174044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88716004","author":{"steamid":"76561199127424616","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":766,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1616429416},"language":"hungarian","review":"Bátran ajánlom mindenkinek alapmű!!","timestamp_created":1616172770,"timestamp_updated":1616172770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88715434","author":{"steamid":"76561198137326002","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1933,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1737,"last_played":1648977317},"language":"english","review":"its fun","timestamp_created":1616172049,"timestamp_updated":1616172049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88715289","author":{"steamid":"76561198414962599","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1657703923},"language":"hungarian","review":"BEST","timestamp_created":1616171862,"timestamp_updated":1616171862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88713799","author":{"steamid":"76561198866590323","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1666,"last_played":1645539681},"language":"english","review":"It is a classic PC shooter game even for nowadays.
