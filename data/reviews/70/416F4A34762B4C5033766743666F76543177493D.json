One day, when Gordon arrives at the installation, an experiment is scheduled. Assisted by his colleagues, Gordon joins the experiment.\n\nThe world is seen from the protagonist's own viewpoint.\nDuring play, the protagonist makes a continuous journey through contiguous environments, which drives the story onwards. The protagonist may be moved to travel in all directions, on foot, through liquids, or by vehicles. The protagonist may also wear and carry items, mostly firearms, protection, and tools.\nThe environments are interactive, and have hazards that must be overcome. The protagonist may fail, but progress is kept safe and allows continuation.\n\nThe protagonist may engage with various actors, who may interact with the environment and with each other, by making use of ingenious dialogue, or by talking to, or mentioning the protagonist. This interaction between these characters is immersive.\nThe protagonist controls direct, immediate, and precise, which is practical for aiming, navigating, and avoiding hazards.\nHalf-Life is inspiring, and can be played with others and modified.

I loved how it encouraged thought and using the environment in new and interesting ways in order to get past the forces in your path. I loved the story despite the missing portion of the Black Mesa incident having never played the original game.\n\nAbout three days ago I sold an item on the marketplace for about $10.00 and I decided that I would pick up this game which has been a gap in my experience with the series, and shooters as a whole. I did not, and never will, regret that decision.\n\nHalf-Life still holds up despite its date of release in 1998, but not in a graphical or bugwise sense. It brings to the table that wonderful thought-provoking gameplay that encompasses everything from strategic planning and resource management, to quick well-honed reflexes and snap decisions. The troubles you face while battling through Black Mesa rarely give way to brute force, but instead to cunning, rational reasoning, and even some of the most outrageous and ridiculous \"Hail Mary\"s I have ever had the pleasure of conceiving.\n\nIf you can manage to get over occasional confusing level design and the [spoiler] frustrating, boring, and slow-paced Xen levels, [/spoiler] I'm sure anyone with the desire to spend 10-15 hours on this game (or more for replays) will have an excellent time.\n\nFor the best experience, play blindly, with no walkthroughs, on hard mode. It will get frustrating, sure, but remember there is always a solution. Finding these solutions is a source of immense satisfaction, fulfillment, and excitement.

Half life is a story game where Gordon Freeman works at Black mesa and fucks up and causes a Resonance Cascade. You cannot forget the world of half life, the enemies, the allies, the maps, and last but not least, the guns. You can run Half life on everything most likely, just ask your mom to buy you something that a homeless guy offered you for 300 bucks and you could probably run this game. While Half life is probably older than you and me, it still holds up as an amazing game and if you haven't played it, please check it out. The world building in this game is insane and has a great story if you pay close attention. The guns in this game are fantastic to use and there are 14 different weapons to use. The allies in enemies are unforgetable with the Scientists, the Security Guards, The Imposing force/MECU Soldiers, Creatures from Xen, and even the Black ops soldiers. The game can be hard and it's very unforgiving and you have to stay on your toes throughout the whole experience. The gunplay feels amazing and still holds up to this day. Though, all amazing games have flaws. The Xen part of this game is extremely long and boring and the graphics suck balls. The overall graphics of this game are shit but still good for its time. A few parts in this game like on a rail can seem extremely boring and tedious. And sometimes the game breaks and does random shit.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is currently a 79/100 but for its time a def 95/100. If you cannot bear the graphics I recommend playing Black mesa.","timestamp_created":1618258281,"timestamp_updated":1625199852,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90205684","author":{"steamid":"76561198262653761","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1010,"last_played":1618253463},"language":"russian","review":"Хоть устарелый, но хороший шутер\nГлавное в шутере по моему мнению разнообразность чтобы не надоело играть в этой игре ты устаешь от разнообразности,так это не просто шутер,а шутер с хорошими хоть и не сложными головоломками","timestamp_created":1618255595,"timestamp_updated":1618255595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90203544","author":{"steamid":"76561199160528211","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":683,"last_played":1618252634},"language":"german","review":"eines der besten Spiele, auch heute noch!","timestamp_created":1618252816,"timestamp_updated":1618252816,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90198716","author":{"steamid":"76561198024753734","num_games_owned":1433,"num_reviews":215,"playtime_forever":909,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":410,"last_played":1641579233},"language":"english","review":"One of the greatest and most influential FPS games of all time. When it first came out Half-Life revolutionized the FPS genre. And still to this day, you can feel it's effects on many FPS games. Before Half-Life there was DOOM, Wolfenstein. These games were just about running and gunning. Half-Life changed that formula. You can see that in the opening section in the game. Half-Life slowed down the gameplay and added more elements. In Half-Life, you have to be tactical. You can't rush into every enemy otherwise you'll be dead before you know it. You have to use every tool in your arsenal to get out of tricky situations. Half-Life was a huge deal back then and now years later playing it feels really good. The soundtrack is good, weapons sounds are great and gunplay is amazing. Level design is superb. There are platforming sections, stealth sections, creepy sections, we have lots of variety. The story is well written, characters are memorable. Mysterious G-Man, security guard Barney, protagonist Gordon Freeman, everyone has a charm to them. Enemy design is great. Headcrabs, houndeyes, every alien has a distinct feature and distinct behaviour. This game was ahead of its time, and it shows. It really is a masterpiece and better than most of the FPS games come out nowadays. If you are a FPS game fan and haven't played it, you definitely should play it. Half-Life is and always will be every FPS lover's favourite game.","timestamp_created":1618246714,"timestamp_updated":1618246714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513513505458831787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90193934","author":{"steamid":"76561199108020750","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":896,"last_played":1649436804},"language":"english","review":"This happened to my buddy Eric","timestamp_created":1618240716,"timestamp_updated":1618240716,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90193821","author":{"steamid":"76561198127901492","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":38,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1477341495},"language":"english","review":"Play it in VR","timestamp_created":1618240580,"timestamp_updated":1618240580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90192324","author":{"steamid":"76561199077864578","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1041,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":359,"last_played":1639317122},"language":"russian","review":"надесь что valve всё же сделают одыкватно half-life source но всеровно пять звёзд нет не пять а 7 звёзд\nмалодцы valve\n","timestamp_created":1618238698,"timestamp_updated":1618238698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90190392","author":{"steamid":"76561198828453175","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1632794263},"language":"russian","review":"good","timestamp_created":1618236194,"timestamp_updated":1618236194,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90190055","author":{"steamid":"76561198422488431","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":1102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1102,"last_played":1610440160},"language":"turkish","review":"Efsane efsanelerden.

I can't overstate how much of a godsend this is, especially considering how other games from around that same time can't even be played nowadays without older operating systems or even older hardware in some cases. Hell, even games that came out way after Half-Life still sometimes have issues with modern hardware. Crysis can't even run on Windows 10 systems without workarounds, yet Half-Life just runs out of the box.
