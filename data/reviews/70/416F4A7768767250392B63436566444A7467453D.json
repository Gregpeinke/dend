Nothing else compared at the time; the engine was well optimized and cutting edge, the level design was brilliant, the gameplay was fluid and fast paced. Overall, I think it still holds up well today.\n\nThe gameplay is very linear and mostly revolves around platforming and shooting, with some boss type encounters. The pacing is quiet good, mixing things up and offering new types of interesting environments and enemies consistently, with the exception of the lingering tram section perhaps.\n\nUnfortunately, the part of the game that feels most dated is combat. Unlike doom 2016 for example, where each enemy requires a slightly different approach and weapon type, in Half life you sort of just throw whatever you've got at whatever is standing infront of you. Enemy behaviour is largely mindless and harder difficulty levels turn them into bullet sponges. During a recent playthrough, I was surprised to find the game offering a much stronger focus on demolition style combat than I remember, with a bounty of grenades, rockets, mines etc always at your disposal. Speaking of grenades, the physics is notably outdated and frustrating, until you learn how to use them properly (try moving forwards or backwards while throwing). The guns are a mixed bag, compared to counterstrike the more conventional pistols and automatic weapons are a bit underwhelming, especially the sound effects. However, the shotgun is good fun and so are the more experimental weapon types found in the game. It's worth noting there are plenty of MODS out there to change the game up, although I haven't experimented with them myself.\n\nOverall, despite the negatives, this game is still good fun and obviously exceptional value for money. The pacing and variety of the levels is a key reason the game is able to consistently hold the players interest until the end.","timestamp_created":1546405090,"timestamp_updated":1546405303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497500568628311157","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48026778","author":{"steamid":"76561198127006323","num_games_owned":387,"num_reviews":110,"playtime_forever":78,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":78,"last_played":1598439524},"language":"english","review":"hard to navigate through dont know where im going half the time\nspooky","timestamp_created":1546386148,"timestamp_updated":1546386148,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474452555179595947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48026648","author":{"steamid":"76561198155007194","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1092,"last_played":1590783010},"language":"spanish","review":"Historia.- Es la verdura\nGameplay.- Es la verdura\nGraficos.- Horribles, na no cierto, son la verdura para su tiempo claro\nSoundtrack.- Medio\n\n9/10\n","timestamp_created":1546385765,"timestamp_updated":1546385765,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48026367","author":{"steamid":"76561198044803964","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":97,"playtime_forever":620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":412,"last_played":1585720409},"language":"english","review":"Gud","timestamp_created":1546385107,"timestamp_updated":1546385107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48026305","author":{"steamid":"76561198150582640","num_games_owned":321,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":784,"last_played":1546828874},"language":"english","review":"its good, some levels can be a grind, but its good.

It's truly amazing how such an old FPS can offer more entertainment than one of the new Call of Duty installments. I love Half Life. Everything about it is something the community loves. It is a fan favorite which changed the FPS genre to what we know now. However, is the game worth the ammount it currently sells for? Find out here:\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay is really fun and motivating. That same motivation is something you don't expirience as much in the newer FPSs which makes Half Life even better! The horror elements thrown in actually made me feel concerned for Gordon Freeman throughout the game. Some parts have the perfect ammount of horror in them yet some parts feel pretty empty making them a bit dull. Some parts get really tense, especially in the chapter 'Surface Tension' and 'Interlopers'. There is nothing to change here at least in my opinion.\n\nDIFFICULTY\nThe game contains the perfect difficulty level. It is not to easy and, you can trust me, it's not forgiving either. The problem with modern action games is that I find them too straightfoward and way too easy, like they were meant for the younger audiences. I like to take on challenges and this game certianly does not dissapoint. Some parts get even too hard like the already previously mentioned 'Surface Tension' and 'Interlopers', or maybe I'm just a pleb. The American goverment did not hold back on the strenght of their soldiers. They really do exceed expectaions of difficulty with their high health and tough weapons.\n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe environments and scenery are amazing. The graphics themselves are really easy to get used to which makes the age of the game irrelevant. IMO every part of the game belongs where it is. The Xen parts are beautiful because it looks convincingly like a border between different dimensions. The space around Xen is astonishing. It is something worth staying for and enjoying.\n\nSTORY\nAs for the story it is really self explanatory.  SPOILERS: You step into the eyes of Gordon Freeman, a scientist (NOTE: He is not really a scientist but I call him that!) who works for Black Mesa. In a failed experiment a rift opens and the alien and human dimensions are connected. As the aliens infest the facility Gordon faces many obstacles including the most annoying one being the appearence of the American army whose objective is to terminate alien life and any other life involved with the incident, including yours. At the end a fellow scientist helps you breach into Xen, the alien world, where Gordon has a task to find and kill the source of the rifts which is the Nihilanth. SPOILER END. I like the story of the first game event though the story is more simpler, but it still does the job .\n\nCONTROLS\nThe controls are the typical FPS controls we all know and love, but there is one problem. The way your character slides. It is the single most annoying feature of the entire game. It makes it feel uncontrolable and literally rage-enducing at parts. Parkouring is practically impossible when it comes to really thight jumps. You just slide off unless you hold shift and control after making the jump, just like minecraft. This is probabbly the only feature that I don't particularly like. I know this is less of a problem to other people, but I'm used to having my character stop after letting go of the 'W' key. Maybe it's just me, but I think this is a problem, but there's no point in complaining since it's not getting fixed considering this is a 21 year old classic now.\n\nPRICE\nThe normal price is 8,19 euro or dollars. Is it worth that though? I would say probably not. The game is amazing and i totally recommend buying it and supporting the developers, but I would personally wait for a sale. On a sale it costs less than 2 euro/dollars which is totally worth it. If you encounter a sale and see this game I encourage you to pick it up if you like great Sci-Fi/Action games!","timestamp_created":1546359444,"timestamp_updated":1619734338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48014433","author":{"steamid":"76561198343062502","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":805,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":392,"last_played":1649759310},"language":"english","review":"This game is absolutely amazing!

November 1998 von Valve auf den Markt gebracht wurde. Die gleichnamigen Entwickler haben hier einen wahrhaft unglaublichen Klassiker erschaffen, doch, ist es auch dem \"Klassiker\"-Titel gerecht? Das Spiel kostet im Vollpreis 8,19€.\n\nVorab möchte ich dem Spiel schon mal einen Pluspunkt geben, weil es trotz des Alters von nun 20 Jahren immer noch funktioniert, ohne eine Mod installieren zu müssen.\n\n[b] Umfang [/b]\nDas Spiel bietet eine mehr oder weniger umfangreiche Story, in der man durch einen Unfall die Welt, bzw. sogar das Universum retten muss. Dabei bekämpft man unterschiedliche Monster und später sogar noch das Militär, welches sich ursprünglich als Hilfe erweisen sollte. \n\nZwischendurch muss man auch mal einen Miniboss töten oder kleinere Rätsel lösen. Die Rätsel sind meistens nicht sehr schwierig, sind aber eine gute Abwechslung zum Kämpfen.\n\nDas Kämpfen und Abmetzeln der Monster und des Militärs macht unheimlich viel Spaß und manchmal ist auch ein wenig Geschick gefragt. Durch die Wahl der drei unterschiedlichen Schwierigkeitsstufen kann man sogar wählen, wie schwer oder wie leicht man es haben will. Ich habe das Spiel auf der Schwierigkeitsstufe \"normal\" gespielt und muss sagen, dass es wirklich gut darauf angepasst war.\n\nDie Größe der unterschiedlichen Welten war natürlich minimiert, da Half-Life keineswegs ein Open-World-Spiel ist. Es sind vielmehr einzelne Level, die man mit seinem Können meistern muss.\n\nIch habe für Half-Life gute 10 Stunden gebraucht, um es durchzuspielen. Andere sind vielleicht noch langsamer, die meisten schaffen es denke ich aber schneller. Die Länge ist ganz OK, zudem man sich auch noch im Multiplayer-Modus oder im Trainingsraum vergnügen kann.\n\n[b] Grafik [/b]\nDas Spiel ist aus den relativ späten 90ern und deshalb kann man grafisch nichts außergewöhnliches erwarten. Trotz des Alters ist die Grafik erstaunlich gut. Die Umgebung ist wirklich schön auf das eigene Level angepasst und die Effekte, seien es die Partikel bei den Monstern oder Blutflecken, sehen wirklich nicht schlecht aus. \n\nDie Gestaltung der Monster ist auch sehr schön und ich war vor allem beeindruckt, als sogar der Getränkeautomat funktionierte (nur leider konnte man daraus nichts trinken)\n\nDas Interface war schön geordnet und minimalistisch gehalten und der Schadenssensor war auch so gut wie immer richtig.\n\n[b] Spielspaß [/b]\nHalf-Life hat mich in den ersten 30 Minuten nicht wirklich gefesselt, aber als man richtig in die Story reinkram, hatte ich so eine Art Verlangen, das Spiel immer weiterzuspielen. Es hat wirklich unheimlich viel Spaß gemacht. Die Kämpfe, vor allem gegen das Militär, waren spannend und nicht immer einfach, was natürlich gut gemeint ist. Ein Spiel ist auch langweilig, wenn es zu einfach ist.\n\nEs war außerdem sehr lustig, als ich mich manchmal erschrocken habe, weil ein Alien mich von hinten ansprang und sich die Leute im TS kaputtgelacht haben. Dabei hab ich nicht mal geschrien, aber es war trotzdem sehr sehr lustig.\n\nDie Rätsel in dem Spiel sind, wie schon oben geschrieben, mehr oder weniger leicht, werten aber den Spaßfaktor durch die Abwechslung auf. \n\nWas meiner Meinung nach ein wenig den Spaß nimmt, ist die Steuerung. Klar kann man bei einem Spiel aus den 90ern keine Top-Steuerung erwarten, aber manchmal war es schon nervig, als z.B. der \"Supersprung\" in der letzten Welt nicht immer funktionierte und buggte.\n\n[b] Musik [/b]\nWahrscheinlich ist vielen, die CS:GO oder allgemein CS spielen, aufgefallen, dass einige Musikstücke aus Half-Life in den besagten Spielen vorkommen. Ich persönlich liebe diese Musik. Es ist nur schade, dass die Musik nicht dauerhaft lief, was aber durch die große Anzahl an SFX überblendet wurde.\n\n[b] Sound [/b]\nWie gerade eben schon angesprochen gab es eine Vielzahl an SFX, die vor allem auch in Garry's Mod und anderen Valve-Spielen vorkommen. Ich finde es auch sehr toll, dass auf eine große Zahl von Umgebungsgeräuschen geachtet wurde, um das Spiel so authentisch wie möglich zu machen.\n\nAber ich muss auch hier ein paar Abstriche bei den Dialogen machen. Die Stimmen hatten oft ein teilweise sogar grobes Rauschen im Hintergrund. Ich denke schon, dass es 1998 bessere Mikrofone gab, mit denen das hätte verhindert werden können. Ich will hier aber gar nicht groß rumnörgeln, denn die Dialoge waren trotzdem verständlich. Sollte ich mich bezüglich der Mikrofontechnologie irren, so gebt mir bitte bescheid! :D\n\n[b] Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis [/b]\nMan bekommt für 8,19€ im VP eine ca. 10-stündige Story, die in mehreren Schwierigkeitsstufen gespielt werden kann. Zudem gibt es einen Multiplayer-Modus und einen Trainingsraum. Im großen Ganzen ist das Spiel die 8,19€ wert.\n\n[b] Fazit [/b]\nHalf-Life ist es auf jeden Fall wert den \"Klassiker\"-Titel zu tragen. Ein Muss für jeden, der alte Spiele liebt. Meiner Meinung nach sollte jeder Half-Life einmal gespielt oder wenigstens gesehen haben.\n\n[b] Fazitfazit [/b]\nUmfang: 8/10\nGrafik: 9/10\nSpielspaß: 8/10\nMusik: 10/10\nSound: 7/10\nPreis-Leistung: 9,5/10\n+1 Bonus\n\nEndwertung: 89/100\n\n[code]Danke fürs Lesen!

Everything started with this game, I played this game after 20 years of its initial release. I was never into the half-life band wagon, since i started my gaming venture roughly 11 years after this games release. I always wondered what is all the fuss about. Being played now I can safely say that \"Well how did I missed it for this long time\".\nAs you might have assumed already the game holds up pretty well (for the most part at least). The game has popularized many of the troupes that are can be seen even today like the in engine cut scenes where you have the full control of your character.\nThe experience with the game started very sorely to say the least. The very first scene where Gordon is in the tram and the voice that tell the all the usual things about safety and the tram moves slowly to the destination was not as punching as I thought. It was touted as one of the most famous opening scenes in the whole gaming history. But for me it was just another opening scene with ugly textures and blocky character models. I was just disappointed but kept up with it. Well the best decision made in a long while. After an hour or so into the game something just clicked with me (the story of course). I was going through all the rooms, listening to all the characters, killing all the Headcrabs, zombies, bullsquids, barnacle tongues and vortigaunts, squashing all the boxes, ignoring all the ugly textures and blocky character models. I was hooked. I have to say, if you are like me means started gaming in the call of duty era then you might be as spoiled as me by the constant spoon feeding of the objectives, map markers and radars you’ll find this game too confusing as there are no radars or mini maps or not even the objectives. I looked up some guides online and just kept going, till the very end\nThe gameplay is very standard you move from point a to b by solving some environment puzzles and killing enemies. There are wide verities of enemies to kill. All kind of aliens and then the zombies and the marines. The game has all the standard weapons like knife, pistols, shotgun, sub machines guns and few types of explosives. There are some unusual one like the gauss gun and gluon gun etc. The official expansion opposing force added some more weapons to the mix.\nBut there are some things that I didn’t like about the game. Mainly the movement. In felt like the whole black mesa facility floors were covered in grease. You can’t move accurately. It always felt off like I am skiing. It was the main gripe for me during the puzzles where you need to jump from one moving ledge to other and little bit of over movement will drop you to your death. The second thing that I hated are the puzzles itself they were not well explained and felt tedious. I found myself constantly searching for the guides. \nThe game has a fairly good checkpoint system and I never found myself repeating more than 5 mins of the game because I died or messed up.\nThe 2 official expansion packs the “opposing force” and “blue shift” are really good as well they add another 10 or so hours to the game, and if you are like me and want to squeeze every bit of the story from the half-life then these expansions are really worth it. Over all if you call yourself a gamer and never played this game then you are lying to yourself. Listen to me you never played this game (that’s extremely unlikely, but still) just get it and the expansions as well. I just hope that valve get its act together and start producing these masterpieces again. \n","timestamp_created":1546094522,"timestamp_updated":1546094522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47925021","author":{"steamid":"76561198356554500","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":101,"last_played":1604720643},"language":"schinese","review":"尽管这游戏和我差不多大，但它还是一款无比的巨作，买就是了","timestamp_created":1546089054,"timestamp_updated":1546089054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47922066","author":{"steamid":"76561198446173804","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2948,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2109,"last_played":1615654275},"language":"turkish","review":"Good","timestamp_created":1546081596,"timestamp_updated":1546081596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47921648","author":{"steamid":"76561198287826884","num_games_owned":512,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1583,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1583,"last_played":1654267246},"language":"koreana","review":".","timestamp_created":1546080479,"timestamp_updated":1653827452,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47921419","author":{"steamid":"76561198839048224","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":70,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41,"last_played":1548609424},"language":"russian","review":"Лучший шутер в который я играл!","timestamp_created":1546079865,"timestamp_updated":1546079865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47920573","author":{"steamid":"76561198401718597","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":16,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16,"last_played":1546077555},"language":"koreana","review":"트레이닝 룸 과녁 맞히기에서 7번째꺼 부술 수가 없어요","timestamp_created":1546077364,"timestamp_updated":1546759801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47916559","author":{"steamid":"76561198307867131","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":609,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":609,"last_played":1549427875},"language":"brazilian","review":"mto nice","timestamp_created":1546063233,"timestamp_updated":1546063233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47914438","author":{"steamid":"76561198306295737","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2408,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1077,"last_played":1638161319},"language":"english","review":"Fun Game","timestamp_created":1546055192,"timestamp_updated":1614203574,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47914253","author":{"steamid":"76561198880642085","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1390,"last_played":1627809116},"language":"english","review":"I Love The Game!
