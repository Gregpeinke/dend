Overall, this game is MUCH better then Portal 1 because of the longer Chapters, more Charecter Interaction, making a not as boring Testing expierence. I reccomend this game for people who like First- Person Shooters, (Although you dont actually shoot Bullets, just Portals, Obviously) and for Poeple who like Comedy and Adventure.","timestamp_created":1436709986,"timestamp_updated":1436709986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17009631","author":{"steamid":"76561198031964569","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":5361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4107,"last_played":1618157158},"language":"english","review":"Just buy it!\nDo it!\nDo it NAOW!!!!!","timestamp_created":1436708034,"timestamp_updated":1454712799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17009093","author":{"steamid":"76561198206575005","num_games_owned":862,"num_reviews":156,"playtime_forever":878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":671,"last_played":1598049846},"language":"english","review":"this game is really fun.

2 — игра на один раз. Зато какой! Отточив перья и логику на первой части, Valve выпустила образцовый сиквел, к которому почти не придраться. Локации масштабнее и разнообразнее, графика — техничнее, повествование — глубже. Основа основ — по-прежнему пушка, создающая два взаимосвязанных портала, правда, механика стала гораздо сложнее.\n\nРаньше мы просто дырявили поверхности, дабы миновать зону обстрела или притащить ящик в нужную точку. Теперь в уравнение добавлена целая охапка параметров. Лазерные лучи и кубические линзы, их преломляющие. Световые мостики для перемещения по воздуху или, если поставить их «ребром», защиты от охранных турелей. Пластина, подбрасывающая объекты. Гравитационные тоннели, которые подхватывают и медленно уносят все, что в них попадает. Три типа гелевой краски: синяя усиливает прыжок, оранжевая здорово ускоряет разбег, белая делает любую плоскость пригодной для открытия портала. (В раннем прототипе был четвертый оттенок, позволявший ходить по стенам и потолкам; его списали в утиль, когда тестеров начало подташнивать.)\n\nИзменений — куча, только Valve не спешит вываливать их разом. Из главы в главу дизайнеры потихоньку переписывают правила, приучая мыслить новыми категориями. Уровни рассчитаны идеально: в меру хитрые, чтобы бросить вызов и растормошить серые клеточки, но без уклона в садизм. В худшем случае вы потратите 15-20 минут на поиски решения, стукнете кулаком о стол и почувствуете себя дураком — ибо ответ лежал перед глазами. В лучшем — порадуетесь, как быстро вы разгрызли еще один кусочек гранита.
