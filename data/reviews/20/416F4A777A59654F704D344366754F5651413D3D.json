I personally find this Team Fortress instalment one of the best, including Team Fortress 2. However, the burning question is this game worth it? Well, let's put it like this; if you are into fast-paced FPS games like Fortress Forever, sure! However, before you play this game, I would recomend trying out Fortress Forever before trying Classic out. If you like the feel of Fortress Forever, you'll like Team Fortress Classic. It's a bit more difficult to figure out at first than TF2, but you'll eventualy get used to it. Overall, this is the best FPS out there.","timestamp_created":1446346503,"timestamp_updated":1446346503,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18790355","author":{"steamid":"76561198116171063","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":257,"last_played":1473245552},"language":"english","review":"this game is very good but i wish that this game had bots that would make it even cooler but anyway this game is better than tf2","timestamp_created":1446293615,"timestamp_updated":1446293615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18785500","author":{"steamid":"76561198115292730","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1446275427},"language":"english","review":"10 minutes in; this game is already classic.","timestamp_created":1446275449,"timestamp_updated":1446275449,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18768363","author":{"steamid":"76561198070570027","num_games_owned":720,"num_reviews":195,"playtime_forever":39,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30,"last_played":1462125809},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1446220124,"timestamp_updated":1446220124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18720972","author":{"steamid":"76561198069044769","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":39,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1391723806},"language":"english","review":"they should add hats","timestamp_created":1445998719,"timestamp_updated":1445998719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499992012977600098","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18668715","author":{"steamid":"76561198060985294","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1523533391},"language":"english","review":"its fine","timestamp_created":1445736861,"timestamp_updated":1445736861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18649524","author":{"steamid":"76561197994476864","num_games_owned":717,"num_reviews":345,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1410309980},"language":"german","review":"Don't like it","timestamp_created":1445651632,"timestamp_updated":1445651632,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491803258657455444","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18624679","author":{"steamid":"76561198071985557","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":770,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":498,"last_played":1522091856},"language":"russian","review":"В начале я познакомился с TF2, она мне неочень то и понравилась из-за мультяшной графы.\nНо я в неё начал играть и потом она прижилась.Ведь там много различных классов персонажей с разными способностями и кучей плюх.\nЯ заинтересовался: ведь если есть 2-ая часть, то есть и 1-ая.\nТоже самое было и с DOTA2, но сейчас не о ней...\nЯ посмотрел на ютубе про неё видео, и она мне сильно напомнила cs 1.6.\nЯ зашёл в стим и увидел эту игру за 129 (на тот момент) рублей.\nЯ быстро взял деньги, кинул на стим и купил эту игру, и когда я её запустил, я охренел...\nТакое месиво на серверах и куча всего разного.\nТе же, что и во 2--ой части персонажи, только с другим оружием и видом.\nРазнообразные карты...

Your best bet is playing it casually on weekends. You used to be able to have a decent time playing bots. But something went wrong. The bots most servers use have the difficulty ramped up way too high. The bots tend to mimic veteran players. They 1 shot you with grenades, and do the same thing to your sentry guns and dispensers. They can kill them in like 2-3 seconds when seeing a few pixels of the sentry guns. Most real players aren't even that sweaty. These are now bots from hell and i think its driving players away rather than making them wait in a lobby until it fills. If they adjusted the bot difficulty down to easy,lobbies would probably fill up faster or would even be tolerable playing solo. Most servers are like this and empty during weekdays not all. \nI will leave my old review below since it still kind of applies on weekends:\nold review:\nLag? Not a problem. You and your enemies have higher health than your modern day twitch shooter. Also the netcode is amazing! You would probably have a smooth gameplay if you entered a lobby with 150+ ping anyways, so don't let your ping scare you. You will engage in actual gun battles, not a \"who saw who first.\" Don't like being a slayer? no problem! you can sometimes run past enemeis throwing yourself at the objective with almost no penalty. You can use mic or text chat. There are a lot of buttons, but don't let this overwelm you! You mostly will just jump, shoot and throw a grenade. Pure FPS fun without all of the b.s. Highly reccomend it to anyone in the NTSC/EU regions (US/Canada/Mexico/UK etc. and my game time lol this is from steam using this steam account.
