The original Portal was a blast but IMO, was too short and has lost its' playability for the most part unless you like speedrunning. Portal 2 has a solid length storyline and it is amazing, perfect dark humor throughout and lots of new mechanics like the portal gel changes the gameplay up a bit. There isn't a single thing wrong with this game, single player is amazing and to add to that, a cooperative mode with a different but general storyline makes playing with your friends a blast. Add in the use made portal levels you can go through and you've got an amazing game that will rarely lose its' replay value...now go buy it.","timestamp_created":1466915683,"timestamp_updated":1466915683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23814342","author":{"steamid":"76561198191110677","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":2559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1189,"last_played":1632490973},"language":"english","review":"Fry your brain solo or with friends!\nHell yeah!\n10/10","timestamp_created":1466913803,"timestamp_updated":1528010302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23814211","author":{"steamid":"76561198095186528","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":1497249747},"language":"schinese","review":"可以的","timestamp_created":1466913382,"timestamp_updated":1466913382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23814154","author":{"steamid":"76561198239540734","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":572,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":437,"last_played":1501311188},"language":"english","review":"This game is worth it for the voice acting alone.

De hecho, Portal 2 es mucho más que un videojuego. Debo reconocer que, durante mucho tiempo, me mostré reacio a jugarlo. No me parecía un juego de mi estilo, me parecía aburrido y demasiado austero. Estaba equivocado.\n\nSi bien es cierto que Portal 2 tiene una estética muy minimalista, también hay que decir que su ambientación es sensacional y encaja perfectamente con la historia que se cuenta. Sí, Portal 2 tiene historia. Una historia muy sencilla pero tremendamente bien contada, llena de misterios y curiosidades. Realmente me sorprendió encontrarme con un argumento tan bien hilado en un juego de este tipo. Por cierto, hay sorpresa para los fans de Half-Life...\n\nAdemás, gráficamente es una auténtica pasada. La limpieza de los entornos y el diseño de los mismos resulta muy gratificante. Eso por no hablar del diseño de los personajes...\n\nPerdón, aún no he explicado de qué trata Portal 2 y en que basa su jugabilidad, ¿verdad?\n\nPortal 2 es un videojuego basado en puzles, o que es lo mismo, un juego que pone a prueba nuestra habilidad mental a base de ciertas ''reglas'' y ''conceptos'' que se entrelazan para formar ''pruebas mentales''. Portal 2 se basa en una jugabilidad muy sencilla pero la exprime al máximo. En el juego deberemos superar una serie de puzles que se resuelven mediante las habilidades básicas de nuestro personaje (correr, saltar, agacharse) y también mediante un artefacto conocido como ''Pistola de portales''. Esta herramienta nos permite fabricar portales en ciertas superficies. En el juego hay dos tipos de portales: los azules y los naranjas. Al entrar por el portal azul saldrás por el naranja y viceversa. El objetivo de cada nivel es llegar a la puerta de salida usando estas habilidades.\n\nCon estas sencillas premisas nos veremos obilgados a resolver intrincados puzles que se complicarán al avanzar en la aventura, añadiendo poco a poco nuevas mecánicas, nuevos artefactos y enemigos. Hay que decir también que el juego hace un uso magistral de las físicas, que en la mayoría de ocasiones serán la solución a nuestro problema.\n\nConcretamente las pruebas ''Reencuentro nº5'' y ''El hormigueo nº11'' me resultaron muy enrevesadas, por lo que después de muchos intentos opté por consultar una guía. Algo totalmente comprensible, ya que el juego no escatima en dificultad.\n\nPero como ya he dicho antes, el juego no es únicamente una sucesión de ''pruebas'' que debemos superar. El juego tiene una historia. Resulta que somos una chica que desempeña su labor como sujeto de pruebas para una gran corporación científica. Durante nuestra hibernación, surgirá un problema inesperado y nos despertaremos rodeados por un panorama desolador: todos los demás sujetos de pruebas han muerto y han pasado muchísimos años desde que despertamos por última vez. La base de operaciones donde nos encontramos sufre de graves daños técnicos y un robot acude a nuestro rescate, Weathley. Este simpático robot, que tiene mucho más papel del que parece, nos guiará a través de las instalaciones y nos ayudará a resolver nuestros primeros puzles, necesarios para alcanzar la salida. No tarda en aparecer el némesis de nuestra protagonista: GlaDOS, una I.A. psicópata obsesionada con la venganza. Todo ello aderezado con un hilarante sentido del humor que nos arranca una sonrisa cada vez que Weathley o GlaDOS deciden intervenir con uno de sus monólogos.\n\nEstos dos robots son la cereza sobre el pastel. Sus personalidades son increíblemente opuestas y tienen una química impresionante. Weathley el metepatas, con sus chistes malos y extravagancias y GlaDOS la psicópata, con sus maquinaciones y sarcasmos.\n\nEn definitiva, es original y muy interesante.

has a delicious cake.\n\n作为Valve的经典FPS之一，Portal与HL以及CS的风格截然相反：\n没有紧张的对战，没有战术的考验。\n玩家所感受到的只有清新的画面，充满未来感的机械，考验智商的机关，可爱的小炮塔，疯长了数万年的植物，拥有智慧的机器人，粘糊糊的凝胶以及虽已荒芜却仍然散发着科技魅力的光圈科技。\n\n啊对，还有那个傲娇的GLaDOS（G姐我老婆）以及有着成熟男声的白痴惠特利。\n这就是传送门的全部。\n——但事实上不仅如此——\n长达十余个小时的剧情和合作剧情带来的不仅仅是游戏的体验，给予我们留下更多的是疑惑与问题。\n雪儿沉睡了多久？\n鼠人到底怎样了？\n光圈人疯狂的追求科技真的必要吗？\n以无数员工的生命为代价来试验传送门（二代光圈）是否合理呢？\n雪儿到底是不是GLaDOS的女儿呢？\n这些未解的东西也许要留在我们不一定看到，也不一定会有的Portal 3里才能了解吧。\n（但愿G胖会数3）\n——Still Alive——\nThis was a triumph.\n胜利在望　　\nI'm making a note here: \n我要记下这一笔： 　　\nHUGE SUCCESS. \n巨大的成功！ 　　\nIt's hard to overstate my satisfaction. \n我此刻的欣喜之情，难以言表

crying over every mistake. \n不必为每一个过去的牺牲和失败沮丧 　　\nYou just keep on trying till you run out of cake. \n只要你坚持尝试，直到用完了奖励的蛋糕 　　\nAnd the Science gets done. \n而科研自然已经接近完成 　　\nAnd you make a neat gun. \n而你做出了一把整洁的枪 　　\nFor the people who are still alive. \n为了所有还幸存的家伙 　　\nI'm not even angry. \n我甚至不怨恨你 　　\nI'm being so sincere right now. \n我现在心如明镜　　\nEven though you broke my heart.\n即使你曾伤透我心 　　\nAnd killed me. \n杀死了我 　　\nAnd tore me to pieces. \n又将我碾为碎片 　　\nAnd threw every piece into a fire. \n将我熔于火海 　　\nAs they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you! \n烈焰焚身之时，我略为神伤因我曾是为你喝彩之人 　　\nNow these points of data make a beautiful line. \n现在数据点已经绘出美丽的曲线 　　\nAnd we're out of beta. \n我们即将完成最后测试 　　\nWe're releasing on time. \n还能赶上按时发布 　　\nSo I'm GLaD. I got burned. \n我是如此幸福，即使我被烈火焚身 　　\nThink of all the things we learned for the people who are still alive. \n因为我已经有所心得，为了那些幸存的家伙 　\nGo ahead and leave me. \n勇往直前， 不要因我留步 　　\nI think I prefer to stay in side. \n我想我还是适合留在这里 　　\nMaybe you'll find someone else to help you. \n或许你会找到别的什么家伙来帮助你 　　\nMaybe Black Mesa. \n或许就在黑山基地 　　\nTHAT WAS A JOKE. \n这是开玩笑而已 　　\nHa ha, fat chance. \n哈哈，别做梦啦 　　\nAnyway， this cake is great. \n不管怎么说，蛋糕是最棒的 　　\nIt's so delicious and moist. \n它是如此美味而滑口 　　\nLook at me still talking when there's Science to do. \n瞧瞧我，明明还有科研，却还在对你夸夸其谈 \nWhen I look out there， it makes me GLaD I'm not you. \n当我朝外面看的时候，我真庆幸不是你 　　\nI've experiments to run. \n我还有实验要做 　　\nThere is research to be done. \n我还有研究要补 　　\nOn the people who are still alive. \n在那些幸存者身上 　　\nAnd believe me I am still alive. \n相信我， 我还活着 　　\nI'm doing Science and I'm still alive. \n我在继续科研，我还活着 　　\nI feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive. \n我感觉好极了， 我还活着 　　\nWhile you're dying I'll be still alive. \n在你垂死之刻，我仍活着 　　\nAnd

The sequal starts off with Chell waking up in what appears to be an ordinary motel room except it is as much of a prison as her old holding cell when the doors and windows are locked shut. Chell was then being given exercise orders by the A.I. announcer in the room after learning that she was in suspended animation for 50 days. The confindment of the room was getting to Chell as much as her ordeal with Glados. Before she could try to manage an escape, Chell black out and reawoken again only to discover that she was in suspended animation for an unknown number of years due to the evidents of the decayed motel room. She hears a knock at the door of what appears to be the voice of a human, only to learn that it's a small A.I. who is trying to release her from confindment. Turns out that the motel room is a fake and Chell is still a prisoner of Aperture Laboritories. Her only oppurtunity to escape from the facility is with the help of Wheatley the A.I. who released her from her faux motel room. As they make their way to the exit of the facility, Chell notices how bad the structure of Aperture has gotten when nature is trying to retake its place and varius test chambers are disfunctional. The place has become comparible to Black Mesa, but luckily Chell doesn't have to worry about any Xem aliens. Upon arrival to an escape pod, it seem that Chell and Wheatley are bound for route to the surface. But when Wheatley tried to activate the escape pod, he accidently reactivated Glados who's memory banks of her last recorded moments were restored. Chell soon becomes a test rat for Glados's variety of tests and traps. Will Chell ever see the light of day again? The graphics are slightly up a notch and the additional test chamber obstacles and objects not present from the last game are great additions to provide in the game. The thing I love most about the game is that you finally learn the history of Aperture Labs and the Co-Op mode is a great idea for those who like getting a friend to play. With all that is offered to the game as I noted prior, any first person gamer or Valve fan will gladly accepted Portal 2 as a great addition to their Half-Life & Counter Strike games. A sequal that is fun from beginning to end.","timestamp_created":1466840916,"timestamp_updated":1466840916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23782363","author":{"steamid":"76561198052603954","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1469281549},"language":"koreana","review":"1인칭 시점으로 포탈건을 이용해 공간을 넘나들어서 퍼즐 풀어가는 재미가 쏠쏠한 게임.\n안해보신 분들 포탈1 포함해서 꼭 해보시길. 후회 안합니다.","timestamp_created":1466839371,"timestamp_updated":1467093822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23782156","author":{"steamid":"76561198116835020","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":3895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2442,"last_played":1601086441},"language":"english","review":"Portal 3?
