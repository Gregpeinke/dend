But is it \"HL\" for its historic novelty alone, or does it still hold up today as a game worth ur time? Plenty of older \"masterpieces\" I'd tried, turned out to not have aged very gracefully at all.\n\nBefore I jump in further, I want to clarify: It's not my nostalgia goggles speaking; I wasn't even born when this game was released and I started gaming much much l8r (less than a decade ago), well past the age of games like this.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nIs the combat good? In principle.... n-noo? But it works. Whether it be thru level design or pacing or just careful attention to the design of the encounters themselves, it's stupid fun.\n\n To elaborate, pretty early on the game introduces an enemy type (that quickly becomes the staple) that does hitscan damage, almost always outnumbers the player, and takes a ridiculous amount of damage to go down without so much as flinching. In theory, this should just be an irritating fuckfest like COD4(MW), and my arsenal isn't too exotic either (actually their same weapons). Functionally tho, this plays more like a movement shooter (or some odd, super fun hybrid), the likes of DOOM Eternal (funnily enough), and not one encounter I've had has resembled COD4.\n\nThe game still has an impressive enemy variety with most of them being distinctly mechanically different.\n\n[h1]Black Mesa[/h1]\nThis is an (Action-)Adventure game in the truest sense. Progressing thru the facility, completing mundane jobs in extraordinary circumstances, expanding ur arsenal, and coming across new threats, all capture that elusive sense of journey and adventure excellently.\n\nThe level and mission design here is phenomenal. The set pieces boast more player freedom and interactivity than most games do today, whilst the level design heavily leverages curiosity by employing secrets the player is meant and encouraged (thru, once again, subtle navigational clues embedded within the environment) to find. Everywhere one can expect to be a secret (underneath a dark staircase, thru a 'sus' looking door, behind the waterfall, etc.) the player will usually find one. The rewards are often not more than some extra ammo or armour, but it's an acknowledgement of the interest the players take in the game world.\n\nMoreover, the level progression itself is fairly secret-y?-esque? Instead of the traditional linear corridor to setpiece/cutscene level design, the level progression here turns out to be just one of the many possible pursuits forward (the rest being secrets and the like), which also surprisingly never leads me to be stuck or get frustrated. \n\nNo obj. markers, mini-maps, glowing interactable objects, contract-like quest systems, obviously coloured climbing elements, tutorials, pop-ups, corridor linearity to levels, and yet each time I felt like I was wasting my time going down a pointless tangent leading me to the dead end, the game threw an organic interaction or secret or, heck, the objective at me. This might have been Valve's first commercial project, but I've rarely seen level design this consistently good more than 2 decades l8r.\n\nEach mission (of the ones I've played so far) is paced very well, with ample downtime, set pieces, new elements and environments, and variation to prevent it from getting stale or predictable. Furthermore, about halfway thru the game, the devs just decided (seemingly) to make a second game and attach it to the end of this one. A host of new weapons, new environments, new enemies are just casually dropped on the player. Different missions also bring in entirely different mechanics ([spoiler] rail cart, conveyor belts and acid vats, etc. [/spoiler]) and just as easily throw them out afterwards (tho not quite as game-changing as TF2, they still change mix things up enough).\n\nThe game's visuals, despite their age, still weave together an incredible ambience and sense of immersion, tho the Mesa part of Black Mesa is still a little hard to swallow. Inside the facility, however, the low poly count and dated visuals quickly fade as a detractor and are much easier to digest.  \n\n[h1]Attention to Detail[/h1]\nThe introductory train ride may not work as well today, with its countable polygon dioramas, but the pre-fuck-up lab, with its player freedom and attention to detail, still astonishes me. So many little details have been catered for, and many elements of the game one would presume to be scripted, have an impressive level of dynamism to them.\n\nThe dialogue is also surprisingly realistic and genuine. In most instances, the game doesn't use more than a few short lines to make NPCs instantly likable ([spoiler]such as the guard u see at the start of the on the rail mission... or whatev it's called[/spoiler]). The grounded nature of the dialogue in this game is something most games continue to relentlessly fuck up even today (Horizon:FW).\n\nAs a testament to the attention to detail, here's an example. Right at the start (of the game) if u try and walk into the occupied bathroom stall door, the scientists will uhh... [spoiler]politely clear his throat[/spoiler]. \n\n[h1]Jank[/h1]\nSo there's a fair bit of it. It's a game from 1998 and it shows, especially in this regard. Angled surfaces, sometimes shoddy aim-assist, jumps not registering, awkward collisions, other utter bullshit, it's got the whole package and it bloody well makes use of it. But as much as it can make me pull my hair out at times, it has surprisingly not soured the overall experience for me. Ofc I would love if I didn't have to contend with the bullshit, but for a game as old as this, I mean I can't really get myself to complain.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nUsually, I have a nice little wrap-it-up sorta note here, but I don't really know wut more to say. I could go on gushing about this game, but the bottom line is I haven't come across Xen yet; wut I have come across. however, easily makes this a masterpiece.\n\nSooo yeah, u should play it.","timestamp_created":1648643694,"timestamp_updated":1648643959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113063909","author":{"steamid":"76561199184140851","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":157,"last_played":1657272490},"language":"russian","review":"Там бегать можно","timestamp_created":1648639406,"timestamp_updated":1648639450,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473684221506118774","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113059174","author":{"steamid":"76561199061657798","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":851,"last_played":1648799041},"language":"english","review":"How can you live with half of your life","timestamp_created":1648628808,"timestamp_updated":1648628808,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113057719","author":{"steamid":"76561199225039498","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":309,"last_played":1653066008},"language":"russian","review":"легенда","timestamp_created":1648625296,"timestamp_updated":1648625296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113057183","author":{"steamid":"76561198872114706","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":324,"last_played":1650132050},"language":"english","review":"Fun game.
