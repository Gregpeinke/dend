And that's not to say the sequel is bad, it's not, both of them are fantastic games.\n\nStill, I don't know if it's worth buying the first game anymore. There's a 'Left 4 Dead 1 coop' mutation for L4D2 that literally just makes the game play just like the first one. On top of this, all of the campaigns have been officially ported over by Valve themselves, so... I guess if you REALLY BADLY want that PURITY of Left 4 Dead 1, you might consider buying this, but otherwise just grab the second game.\n\nThat said, they changed some things with weapons around in the second game, most notably I don't think you actually have to count your shotgun rounds off if you're using the XM1014, because the reload is always the same speed. And the addition of 'more guns' is nice, but again, you only need the five or so weapons that L4D1 offers. You have your M16, your XM1014, Uzi, pump shotgun. That's really all you need. Anything more just 'bloats' the game, in a way.\n\nSometimes, less is more.\n\nEither way, I can't possibly not recommend this game, because, come on, it's Left 4 Dead, the sceond game releasing didn't MAGICALLY warp time and space and cause the first game to be bad.","timestamp_created":1474256550,"timestamp_updated":1474256550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480460137128829956","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25582047","author":{"steamid":"76561198182121091","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":63578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":756,"playtime_at_review":1071,"last_played":1660540145},"language":"english","review":"I really like it best game ever!!","timestamp_created":1474256453,"timestamp_updated":1474256453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25580749","author":{"steamid":"76561198018134975","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":745,"last_played":1472093593},"language":"brazilian","review":"Ótimo jogo!

Hours on end going through each campaign, each difficulty, each character (everyone had their own favourite at heart though). I didn't think anyone would be looking for a review on a game which had came out in 2008. The game logic itself is simple. You can kill zombies, zombies can kill you. Francis, Bill, Zoey and Louis are the 4 unfortunate characters, of which 1 of these 4 you can play as. Are trying to make their way out of the pre-1950's city of Fairfield and into safety. While navigating your way (pretty easily) through city rooftops, chaotic streets, eerie sewers, collapsed train lines, and eventually a dilapidated hospital. In which you encounter the end of the first campaign. \n\nThe journey there should prepare you for what seems to be a reoccuring fashion in Left 4 Dead. I don't see this trend as boring, or mind numbing; but a change of scenery to the carnage that ensues as 3 bots and a trigger happy teen eliminate endless wave after wave of the undead. It posses some what of a challenge, but nothing that would leave you stuck on the same most recent save for days on end. \n\nIf i was to recommend this to someone, it would be a young cousin or a friends' little brother. I enjoy L4D & L4D2 even now as an 18 Year old. But games that bring as much happyness as this has done for me should be enojyed at a young age.

I've bought both games, and have played both games, and left 4 dead 2 is just so much better. Don't even consider getting this one unless you are getting Left 4 dead 2 as well. I'm not saying this game is bad, because it's not all I'm saying is that Left 4 Dead 2 is better.","timestamp_created":1471714684,"timestamp_updated":1471714684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480769246816635132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25034498","author":{"steamid":"76561198315110941","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1979,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1489,"last_played":1524678918},"language":"danish","review":"Super fedt spil virker til min ældra PC og den trækker det uden problemer","timestamp_created":1471706378,"timestamp_updated":1471706378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25031751","author":{"steamid":"76561197989399821","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":416,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":387,"last_played":1553102742},"language":"french","review":"Jeu toujours aussi excellent, avec un énorme potentiel de rejouabilité, tant en solo qu'en multijoueur.

Playing the game now it's clear it's aging. It's a great game that's just been made shallow by other newer co op experiences. Still a great time with friends, but I emphasize WITH FRIENDS. Pairing up with other players randomly will only result in an awful experience where no one seems to know how to work together or even know what their objective is. Save yourself the frustration and only play with friends.","timestamp_created":1471574321,"timestamp_updated":1471574321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25001557","author":{"steamid":"76561198271090535","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":669,"last_played":1560409922},"language":"spanish","review":"muy bueno como me envicio con este juego muy bueno","timestamp_created":1471559963,"timestamp_updated":1471559963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24998669","author":{"steamid":"76561198118897447","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":339,"last_played":1582860827},"language":"spanish","review":"me gusta","timestamp_created":1471549157,"timestamp_updated":1471549157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24983802","author":{"steamid":"76561198129155357","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":938,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":813,"last_played":1485659034},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy bueno y recomendable.","timestamp_created":1471481245,"timestamp_updated":1471481245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24966346","author":{"steamid":"76561198059441876","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":79,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":79,"last_played":1471394744},"language":"german","review":"Totally not what I've expected. *thumbdown*","timestamp_created":1471404212,"timestamp_updated":1471404212,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.407880216836929321","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24958705","author":{"steamid":"76561198269382940","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":657,"last_played":1533684682},"language":"brazilian","review":"Otimo jogo para jogar com amigos","timestamp_created":1471372241,"timestamp_updated":1471372241,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24957210","author":{"steamid":"76561198093554024","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1249,"last_played":1527226340},"language":"japanese","review":"オープニングいい雰囲気\n１の内容が丸ごと2に入っているので１を買う必要は無い\n荒いグラや１しかないＭＯＤをどうしても遊びたいなら話は別","timestamp_created":1471366977,"timestamp_updated":1471366977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490945667028427124","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43sqTytYCepGaXw=="}
