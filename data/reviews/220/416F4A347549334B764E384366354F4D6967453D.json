Its unfortunate that the team stopped making games and are only in it for the now a days for an example CS:GO with its skins and what not. But to the review and why i recommend any to buy this, has a fenomenal story line which you will like, i can almost gaurentee you will like this game.

Overall: I'd reccomend. But personally wasn't THAT much into it. It might be because I JUST got into the half life series and haven't been caught up in nostalgia. Don't get me wrong I loved it... but there were a few things that really made it not enjoyable.\n\nPros:\nGreat & Interesting Story\n  I really do love what's going on with game. Like I said, I JUST got into this series so I don't know anything about it or it's \n  major cliffhanger. But so far really enjoyable.\nLoveable Characters\n  Loveable (MAIN) Characters... the other npc's have the same like 3 voice actors haha which is funny and not really a \n  complaint. But the Squad Members aren't so loveable... and can go to hell. lol\nFun gameplay (only shooting and puzzles.. the driving really was horrific and too long)\n  I enjoy how to game controls (somtimes) and how free moving it is. Shooting is nice and easy. The puzzles are fun and \n  rewarding when completed. Feels like you're actually doing something.\nSoundtrack is decent\n  Sometimes it's fun to shoot up stuff with the correct music, and I feel like they did well with this one.\n\nCons:\nDriving in the Boat and Car (mainly the car)\n  In a huge portion of the game you have to drive through lands of open nothingness, and you realize that theres really no \n  point to the part other than a way for them to explain how you get from once place to another.. it takes too long and is \n  hard to control, as well has a terrible close up first person point of view.\n\"Squad Following\"\n  This has to be the most annoying and frustrating part about this game. In the third act there's a part where a squad will \n  follow you. AND BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING... I KNOW YOU CAN MAKE THEM STOP. But Jesus Christ... it doesn't work. \n  When you are in a tight corner or take a wrong turn. BOOM. they'll be right there waiting for you, making it IMPOSSIBLE \n  to move anywhere. While you repeatedly hear \"sorry doc\" \"my bad\" \"pardon me\". It's annoying as anything and ruined a \n  lot of the expirence for me.\n\nBut other than that, I enjoyed this game and would reccomend it to others. At least give it a try. Everyone else loves this game to death, so why wouldn't you? (That's supposed to be rhetorical... but if not, it's cause those ****ing squads) lol","timestamp_created":1510117824,"timestamp_updated":1510117824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492537319660186768","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36366658","author":{"steamid":"76561198124398279","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":332,"last_played":1483214514},"language":"english","review":"I loved this game... but I could care less if there was a Third Chapter, this game is golden though","timestamp_created":1510109110,"timestamp_updated":1510109110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474761217832565308","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36365774","author":{"steamid":"76561198163725472","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15,"last_played":1656435308},"language":"english","review":"Good shit","timestamp_created":1510104895,"timestamp_updated":1510104895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50982964038848877","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36355000","author":{"steamid":"76561197979568263","num_games_owned":476,"num_reviews":266,"playtime_forever":831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":831,"last_played":1475769783},"language":"english","review":"Gabe's masterpiece.

Repeat attempts may be necessary to trigger the Bus Depart Cutscene quicker.\n\nOnce the Bus Depart Trigger is hit, cross the road, avoiding any more car props. Failure to avoid these props will result in immediate death as they have rather large kill boxes around them. Move onto d1_main_street_02.\n\nFrom the start of d1_main_street_02, start your set up by standing next to the arbritary railing in the middle of the path and looking back towards \"Welcome to [INSERT TOWN NAME HERE] sign, lining it up at the top right corner of the sign. \n\nStart a crouching accelerated back hop, the set up will path you through the 3 bollards where you will trigger a crazed_ice_addict NPC who will attmpet to ask you for $2 for the bus. By hitting this trigger with enough speed you bypass the need to fight off the addict with your crowbar. This skip saves about 5 seconds in a run.\n\nAt the top of d1_hill_01 make a quicksave then continue the crouching accelerated backhop down d1_hill_01, making sure that you have at least 1800 Hammer Units of speed before the hill's decent to land in d1_local_pool_01 that is past all 7 side streets. If you drop below 1200 speed, hit your quickload key and start again as failure to do so will result infalling short of the local_pool and taking lethal fall damage. The back up strat is to just bhop blindly down the hill and hope that no cars come out of the side streets.\n\nOnce in d1_local_pool_01, grab a pool_noodle from the drowning_toddler NPC and prop climb out of the deep end and start another crouching accelerated side/backhop towards the fence located at the d1_footy_oval_01. Locate the beach_ball prop located in the corner and prop climb again, making sure not to get caught on the barbed-wire fencing. (Doing this skips the d1_local_pool_02 exit trigger which inturn bypasses the trigger to load NPCs and Props in d1_footy_oval_01)\n\nOnce over the fence, line yourself up between the two uprights and start an accelerated backhop, hitting the angled mound at the opposite end of the field will launch you into the air and allow you to land on the sloped roof of d2_local_IGA_01. Crouch at the top of the roof and uncrouch before you hit the ground to negate fall damage.\n\nGo inside the building and turn left, remember to wall ride while bhopping to get to the Milo faster. Reverse your movements while wallriding still and make it to the Cash Register. Using the Milo_Can prop, bash any customerm NPCS over the head to trigger their departure quicker. Interact with the cashier NPC. You cant skip this part as it softlocks the game if you fail to hit the payment trigger.\n\nOnce back outside of d2_local_IGA_01, use the pedestrian crossing to reach d2_local_IGA_02. From this point its all about your accelerated backhopping skills up the hill. Avoid any pedestrians and cars from the side streets until you reach the top of d2_hill_01. \n\nOnce at the top of d2_hill_01, transition into an accelerated sidehop so that you can see the 3 bollards and path past them. As you enter d2_main_street_01, conserve your speed past them and cross the street where you triggered the bus cutscene in d1_main_street_01. \n\nKeeping your speed, manoeuvre down d2_back_streets_01 until you reach d2_drive_way_01. Once underneith the carport, jump onto the bonnet of the car that you would normally have used to drive down to d2_local_IGA_01 and schrodinger's jump over your gate. This saves like 1 second. \n\nOnce over the fence, sprint to the door and open it and sprint again to the freezer. Open up the freezer and grab ice_cream_tub and go to the cupboard and grab deep_bowl. Equip your crowbar and use it to pry open the tin lid off the Milo, and smack the foil covering until it breaks. This is marginally faster than grabbing the desert_spoon form the cutlery draw first because the desert_spoon takes 4 extra frames to pry open the lid and 20 more frames to puncture the foil covering. Using desert_spoon, dig out half of the ice_cream_tub into deep_bowl and tip the milo_tin upside down over the ice_cream_bowl. \n\nCongratulations, you beat the game. If you were quick enough you can get back in time to watch the 6am news and enjoy the rest of the day speedrunning d1_canals_07 to d1_canals_11 endlessly.\n\n","timestamp_created":1509687454,"timestamp_updated":1509687454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36234004","author":{"steamid":"76561198176494265","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":58,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46,"last_played":1540339489},"language":"english","review":"so lets just get this straight bo2 is a great cod nothing wrong with it but if you wanna keep playing, stick to console the servers are dead most people i have ever seen on was 2k so if you still wanna get it i reccommend only getting it to play zombies","timestamp_created":1509686790,"timestamp_updated":1509686790,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.371084332466125488","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36232971","author":{"steamid":"76561198212177917","num_games_owned":637,"num_reviews":627,"playtime_forever":1070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1069,"last_played":1648797267},"language":"russian","review":"HAPPY BIRTHDAY GABE NEWELL !!!
