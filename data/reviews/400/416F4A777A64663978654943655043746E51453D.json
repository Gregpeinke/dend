El apartado gráfico es perfecto para el juego del que se trata, tanto la estética, como los gráficos, como la animación. El control es sencillo y bastante intuitivo, así como la presentación (al menos en principio) del entorno de juego.\n\nEl juego es más que recomendable, los puzzles son súper entretenidos y GLaDOS es un NPC de lo más carismático. Si hay que destacar algún aspecto negativo es su brevedad: si uno está concentrado y totalmente inmerso en el juego, es bastante fácil terminarlo en menos de 3 horas; es cierto que el juego se puede explotar más allá del modo principal, pero aún así se hace un tanto flojo en contenido.\n\nLe doy un 7/10, aunque le daría fácilmente un 8 si fuese un pelín más largo. Comentar también que la banda sonora es genial (sobre todo la canción final del juego).","timestamp_created":1522774709,"timestamp_updated":1522774709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41252431","author":{"steamid":"76561198210794065","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2402,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1191,"last_played":1656715999},"language":"spanish","review":"Portal\n\nPortal es facilmente uno de los mejores juegos de puzzles que jugue y un juego que defintivamente le recomiendo a todos.\n\nEste juego no te cuenta su historia, te la muestra. A lo que me refiero con esto es que Portal te mete en su mundo como un sujeto de pruebas pasando de camara de pruebas a camara de pruebas resolviendo puzzles y aunque inicialmente parezca que todo va bien lentamente empezas a descubrir un lado mas oscuro de Aperture science (las instalaciones en las transcurre el juego). A travez de tu recorrido por el juego, te acompaña la voz de Glados, que es una Inteligencia Artificial que te guia por tus pruebas. Glados tambien el elemento principal del humor del juego ya que toda la comedia del mismo se basa en la inocencia de Glados y el hecho de que muchas cosas que a un ser humano le parecerian logicas o ilogicas carecen de los mismos para Glados.\n\nLos puzzles de portal tambien son excelentes y se basan en la mecanica de los portales que te permite crear un portal azul y uno naranja, todo lo que entra por el azul sale por el naranja y viceversa. Esto abre lugar a un monton de submecanicas y puzzles muy creativos. Aun con todo lo bueno Portal tampoco es perfecto, es claro que este juego no tuvo mucho presupuesto ya que el menu principal, parte del hud y varios assets estan claramente copiados de half-life 2 y el jefe final pudo haber sido un poco mas creativo y desafiante.\n\nAun con algunos problemas Portal es definitivamente un juego que vale la pena jugar.\n\n8.5/10","timestamp_created":1522772991,"timestamp_updated":1522846193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41252357","author":{"steamid":"76561198378759580","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":138,"last_played":1521972588},"language":"russian","review":"Игра для своих лет очень хороша .
