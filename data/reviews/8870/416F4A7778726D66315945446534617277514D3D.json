Mais l'esprit y reste le même, et je dit bravo aux développeurs pour avoir réussi a recréé un chef-d'oeuvre semblable au 1er opus. Car oui, cet épisode est une réussite autant sur le gameplay totalement jouissif et fluide, que sur la narration et le scénario de grande qualité.\n\nLe fait que Booker parle, réagisse a son entourage, facilite l'immersion. On se sent aussi perdu que lui. De plus, le personnage d'Elizabeth est la pour vous donner la réplique, vous aider dans vos combat sans vous gêner. Elle est pour moi la principale réussite du jeu, il suffit de l'observer de temps en temps : son attitude, ses expressions et son caractère la rende étrangement \"humaine\", on s'y attache.\n\nLe gameplay est un peu plus orienté action que les deux précédents. J'entend par la que l'exploration est moins importante et je n'ai pas retrouvé les sursauts et les petits moments de stress des deux précédents. Le personnage est beaucoup plus mobile et le système de combat est plus proche d'un fps classique que les deux précédents volets. C'est ce qui m'a déçu dans ce jeu mais qui peu plaire a d'autres.\n\nEnsuite l'histoire. J'ai attendu de finir le jeu pour le noter, car sans avoir vu la fin j'aurai surement mit 17 ou 18.\nMais ce final monumentale, ce suspens qui nous tient en haleine jusqu'au bout.. C'est du génie.

全是剧透[/b]\n最喜欢的演出部分是英雄之厅的斯莱德的游戏部分，整个厅堂以博物馆和戏剧的形式展现了一个战争英雄的丰功伟业[spoiler] 虽然这份伟业并不人道且应当令人唾弃 [/spoiler]，但主角一直是错误的。直到英雄之厅战斗的最后，这场戏剧真正的主角才得以现身，以一种悲哀的方式，结束他“戏剧”的一生。\n\n本以为能够见证伊丽莎白最终获得属于自己的自由，但在故事的中期她就有了不一样的想法：放弃属于自己的自由和幸福，选择舍己为人，反而去为更多的他人自由和幸福做斗争。她善良勇敢，就算她的一生几乎都是被设计的；她体贴大方，就算命运对她是那么残酷。即使在为他人而奋斗的过程中伤害了自己最亲的人，她也没有停止脚步；即使在这一过程中变得孤身一人，她也没有放弃，而是选择让内心背负起自己所作所为而犯下的罪孽。最初的最初，鸟儿突破囚笼翱翔于天际，最后的最后，玫瑰渐渐凋零葬身于深海。我相信最后一次前往极乐城是她自己的决定，是她对自己的唯一释怀方式。\n\n但我无法释怀，因为我未曾见到伊丽莎白与至亲重逢时的笑颜、泪水与拥抱。她绝对值得这些属于她个人的幸福，但我未能有幸见到。","timestamp_created":1656495566,"timestamp_updated":1656495566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117843771","author":{"steamid":"76561198040182182","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":247,"last_played":1658596257},"language":"schinese","review":"此生必玩","timestamp_created":1656486794,"timestamp_updated":1656486794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117835408","author":{"steamid":"76561199037401606","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":827,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":825,"last_played":1656473560},"language":"brazilian","review":"TOP!","timestamp_created":1656473420,"timestamp_updated":1656473420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117830808","author":{"steamid":"76561199192668806","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30,"last_played":1658844757},"language":"schinese","review":"画面很美","timestamp_created":1656466860,"timestamp_updated":1656466860,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117829907","author":{"steamid":"76561198085538019","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":579,"last_played":1656819621},"language":"schinese","review":"伊丽莎白我的宝贝","timestamp_created":1656465548,"timestamp_updated":1656465548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117828134","author":{"steamid":"76561198089092563","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":855,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":291,"last_played":1658105047},"language":"english","review":"","timestamp_created":1656462932,"timestamp_updated":1656462932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117826625","author":{"steamid":"76561198053421760","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":738,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":738,"last_played":1640823411},"language":"english","review":"After finally replaying the Bioshock series after playing the original Bioshock as a kid, I have to say that Bioshock infinite was probably my favorite. I felt connected to the characters and the whole plot of the story is amazing. I was worried I was not going to like it because of all the reviews saying the original Bioshock is better, but man let me tell you it did not let me down. You really do not have to have played the other Bioschocks to understand the game, unless you want to understand the references.
