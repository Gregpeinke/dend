Je viens de profiter des Soldes Steam pour l'acquérir à moins de 8€. C'est effectivement un chef d'oeuvre de game design et l'environnement, tiré des influences Steampunk (aucun rapport avec Steam, excepté la vapeur !) et aux mondes de Miazaki dans Le chateau dans le Ciel, par ex., en fait un très beau jeau, doté d'une histoire complexe, avec une héroïne attachante, pleine de légèreté.\nOn notera aussi les concepts de religion où la dualité terre / ciel est très présente, avec tous les artifices de la croyance et de ses dogmes. Néanmoins, BI reste un FPS presque \"coopératif\" tant Elizabeth vous est d'une aide précieuse, et dont les combats sont très soignés graphiquement comme en action. Je ne puis que recommander, forcément.\nTesté avec Core i5 / GTX 660 / W8.1 / 16GB de RAM. Tout en \"ultra\" :)\n\nAprès avoir joué maintes et maintes heures à Bioshock Infinite, il est temps de tirer les conclusions qui s'imposent : c'est MA-GNI-FIQUE. Certains pourraient s'attarder sur les textures parfois cracra mais le reste (et quel reste !) est absolument génial. Les toniques, les combinaisons d'attaques, updates et l'Histoire en font un jeu qui ne doit surtout pas être pris comme un simple jeu. L'histoire est telle que après l'avoir terminé, je me suis senti \"vidé\". \nBI est tout à fait le genre de jeu qui vous attache aux héros d'une manière que lorsque l'histoire se conclut, que ce soit dans BI ou dans Burial at Sea, Ep. 2, vous vous sentez mélancolique, de part les évènements passés mais par le manque qui vous dit \"quand ré-endosserai-je ces rôles ?\"\nCelui d'Élizabeth est tout bonnement bluffant et la dualité Booker/Elizabeth est redoutable.\nJe n'avais plus connu ça depuis HL² et ses épisodes !\n\nEn bref, du tout bon et je ne peux en dire plus sans spoiler l'Histoire avec un grand \"H\" !","timestamp_created":1385902962,"timestamp_updated":1402263040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540999650955200195","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7862823","author":{"steamid":"76561198006865038","num_games_owned":371,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":607,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":607,"last_played":1386430556},"language":"german","review":"Geile Welt.","timestamp_created":1385902950,"timestamp_updated":1385902950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7862622","author":{"steamid":"76561198025877604","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":768,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":767,"last_played":1391287220},"language":"german","review":"Absolut geniale Story im Main sowie auch in den Addons !","timestamp_created":1385902064,"timestamp_updated":1385902064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7862502","author":{"steamid":"76561198047742403","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":283,"last_played":1413659802},"language":"brazilian","review":"UM PUTA DE UM JOGO! o cenário é 1000%,jogabilidade 1000%...\nsem palavras pra descrever esse jogo,certamente e justamente indicado para GOTY de 2013,não tem como o jogo sair de estar concorrendo a jogo do ano é impossivel!","timestamp_created":1385901542,"timestamp_updated":1385901542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7862071","author":{"steamid":"76561198081176400","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":244,"last_played":1486242758},"language":"german","review":"Geiles Game... muss man ja sagen.

Everything is a step down from the original: Story, gameplay, setting. Everything.\n\nGameplay is Call of Duty tier: kill hordes of mundane enemies over and over completely lacking any thought or satisfaction in the deed.  Guns are terrible. Seriously, there is not one gun in the game I do not reflect back upon with utter distain. In the original Bioshock weapon and plasmid upgrades were bought through separate resource pools. But in this game, EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING, is bought through the same pool. This means you don't have any room to experiment with the \"Vigor's\" (which are just cut & pastes from the older game), and have to invest in solid shoot'em'up tactics because when you get right down to it, Vigor's are just something to call this game a \"Shock\" game and not a \"Call of Dutes\" game. You can only carry two guns at once, and there is easily 10+ shit tier guns polluting the gun pool with their ammo. Which means in certain engagements, your main upgraded guns will likely run out of ammo and you'll be forced to use terrible re-skins in their place. Shooting guns is sticky, slow, tedious and all around not fun.\n\nStory takes a dive 1/4th into the game and from there on its a run and gun shoot'em up, all the way to the end with its exceptionally ill thought out ending (which doesn't resolve anything), but makes scrubs who don't want to feel stupid for not getting the ending shower it in praise for \"depth\", when in actuality it's simple, dull & poorly thought out. Ken Levine Scrapped the real Bioshock Infinite when he ran out of time wasting it on MP no one wanted, and was forced to put this shit out on the market. Literally, nothing promised in the original hype was delivered. Everything was recycled from the REAL Bioshock Infinite to create a presentable new game, and it certainly shows. Especially in character dialogue.\n\nSetting is un-imaginative and in comparison with Rapture, Columbia doesn't hold any water (no pun intended). In Rapture, the city felt like a living enemy. The ocean and crumbling city always loomed with you, and you were always aware that you were in a tin-can with a sheet of flexi-glass between you and death. In Columbia, you can just jump off the side and insta respawn with no consequences Super Meat Boy style. Enemies lack explanation or purpose in the world of Columbia, (take the fireman & patriot) & those that do are incredibly un-original or just half-assed (crow racist people, Handy-Man).\n\nIf you buy this game, I have no sympathy for you. Enjoy your middle of the game shit tier boss battle with Ghost lady 3 times over, while trying to justify your purchase by telling people like me \"it was 2deep4u\".","timestamp_created":1385852225,"timestamp_updated":1386179525,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":33,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.417174488306045532","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7853108","author":{"steamid":"76561198015261304","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1297,"last_played":1585402428},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite's ability to juggle several storylines at once makes it one hell of an emotional rollercoaster. You'll hear and see details in the game world that will throw all rational expectations out the window. Of course, by the time you reach the climaxes, you'll know to expect the opposite of what you'd think... or do you? Should you?\n\nElizabeth, the fearless Disney princess shows how to make a sidekick useful. She helps you get through the outdrawn combat periods by throwing you health kits and salt bottles, and gives you money she finds when you're walking about. Not that it matters though, since the huge waves of enemies will give you a hard challenge no matter how much you've invested in your guns. \n\nThe chemical-induced superpowers, the characteristic of Bioshock, don't seem to play a big role in this game. Sure, they are shown front and center, but outside of the scripted events some of them are presented in, they're pretty much avoidable. I didn't even get all the different Salts because I didn't have to rely on them.\n\nDespite all of these flaws, I had an incredible experience from just following the story, and I would recommend it to even those who haven't touched the first two games.","timestamp_created":1385851858,"timestamp_updated":1387147284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7853067","author":{"steamid":"76561198041958915","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":799,"last_played":1454960965},"language":"english","review":"An absolutley AMAZING game!
