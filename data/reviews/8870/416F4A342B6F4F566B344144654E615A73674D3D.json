Ну начну разбор по порядку.\n Игра началась неплохо. Шторм, маяк, какой-то лифт, бам - я в воздушном городе. Всё очень ярко, и игра выглядит приятно. \n Следующим плюсом могу конечно же подчеркнуть Элизабет - центрального персонажа всей истории в принципе. Почти всю игру мы с ней бегаем, слушаем, защищаем, спасаем. Могу уверенео сказать что всю игру она тащит только на себе. Тот случай когда персонаж не просто NPC, а живой. У неё очень хорошие анимации лица, приятная моделька, интересный характер. \n ВСЯ игра была играбельна по большей части из-за Элизабет.  В середине игры я примерно опредеделился с оценкой, - 5, то ли 4/10. \n Честно говоря я слабо понимал весь этот мир игры, сюжет.. Я бы свёл всё до \"Спасаю девку, пытаюсь улететь с ней, но попадаю в приключения, а потом и вовсе мы решаем убить антагониста, но оказывается что...\". И вот на этом моменте, после концовки я и задумался, что черт возьми концовка то неплохая! \n Как итог, имеем:\n Хорошая графика, Элизабет, и необычная интересная концовка. \nИз минусов:\n • Тупой ИИ - враги в игре это просто скучные и очень тупые овощи. Они просто появляются, и толпой идут на тебя. \n • Легко - играя на последней сложности, минимум первую половину игры я вообще не умирал. И то, половина моих смертей от механического халка - единственный нпс с которым интересно сражаться =).\n • Ретро-сказочный сеттинг - мне не особо интересный.\n • Ещё минусом я подчеркну вторую с конца локацию, на которую я перешёл почти без патронов, думая что на изи их закуплю(так как до этого в игре на каждом метре магазы стоят). В итоге я захожу на очень душную локу, и без блять патронов. Там в принципе сюжетно неприятная глава, поэтому да... Но я затерпел👍\n • Ну и отсутствие механики ношения с собой аптечек, или хотя бы навыка на хилл. И к слову, перебор с количеством навыков. Лол, из 10 что ли, я использовал только 2, потому что остальные максимально юзлесс, да и буквально лень было переключать их, так как переключение скиллов я бы не назвал удобным. Денег кста в игре хватает только чтобы примерно 2 навыка и грейдить~.\n\nКароче залутать на скидке и пройти в какой-нибудь скучноватый период бытия -

playing the entire Bioshock collection, I felt that Infinite is worst of the trilogy with a gameplay that is a dumbed down, simple shooter, set in a pretentious open world full of useless clutter. Though the game world is admittedly beautiful to look at, there is nothing to interact with and no reason to explore as the game is as simple as getting from point A to point B with shooting battles in between against stupid AI in ridiculous numbers showing you how easy it is to mass slaughter an entire army with just two guns. A lone splicer (enemy) from Bioshock 1 or 2 is much more threatening than 10 soldiers in this game.\n\nThe gunplay feels good but is just too simple without any special mechanics besides shooting and casting vigors which you won't do since it's much easier to just shoot heads.\nThe game is too linear. There is no point in exploring as the world is empty. There are no loots aside from healing items which heals as you pick them. \nThe characters are quite well written and full of personality.\nThe game probably has one of the best and most useful AI companion in any game.\nThe story is quite stupid delving too deep into supernatural to justify a huge dumb twist with utter disregard for plot holes.\nIt's a shame that in its DLC, it tried to tie itself with the world (Rapture) of Bioshock 1 and 2 that has much better lore, gameplay, and story. Admittedly though, the DLC is much better than the entire game because of Rapture and it's splicers.","timestamp_created":1649947311,"timestamp_updated":1649947605,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515698134899139404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113834554","author":{"steamid":"76561199088599212","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1649934321},"language":"schinese","review":"我不想看见不动的2k了，我只是想玩游戏，为什么进不去啊","timestamp_created":1649934600,"timestamp_updated":1649934600,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504132270812988281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113834295","author":{"steamid":"76561199066294563","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":646,"last_played":1649861917},"language":"schinese","review":"最惊艳的开头和结尾，最后的剧情实在太震撼。","timestamp_created":1649934112,"timestamp_updated":1649934112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504132270812988281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113831754","author":{"steamid":"76561198167471696","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1359,"last_played":1497857328},"language":"spanish","review":"Ta muy buena la historia y los personajes 👍","timestamp_created":1649929154,"timestamp_updated":1649929154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113825835","author":{"steamid":"76561198164587916","num_games_owned":521,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1469,"last_played":1649915369},"language":"english","review":"would you kindly?","timestamp_created":1649916794,"timestamp_updated":1649916794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113823080","author":{"steamid":"76561198237883542","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":376,"last_played":1649908963},"language":"english","review":"While I don't feel like the gameplay has aged super well, it's still fine and the story is too good to pass up.","timestamp_created":1649910489,"timestamp_updated":1649910489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+oOVk4ADeNaZsgM="}
