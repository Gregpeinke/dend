O que era pra ser uma experiência simples, porém, divertida, se tornou algo grandioso, extremamente divertido e com uma trama muito empolgante! Puzzles, diálogos e personagens carismáticos eram elevados a décima potência no quesito qualidade, e sinceramente, acho que só jogando pra entender como Portal é um excelente jogo!\n\nO que já era inovador, divertido, empolgante e carismático do primeiro jogo, aumentou monstruosamente no segundo! Portal 2 é maior, melhor e MUITO mais divertido do que o primeiro, e o melhor de tudo é que não é uma simples DLC com coisisinhas simples a mais e sim, uma sequência absurdamente bem feita e tão empolgante quanto half-life, e isso não é exagero!\n\nA partir de agora vou colocar spoilers nessa análise! =}\n\nNo primeiro Portal tinhamos 19 fases bem legais e os diálogos da antagonista nos empolgavam e davam muito carisma para a trama, que por sinal era extremamente bem conduzida e surpreendente pra um jogo com uma premissa tão simples! (Apesar de simples, inovadora!) Puzzles que variavam de fáceis, médios e difíceis e um final muito bom! Portal 2 além de começar de um jeito alucinante, já mostra a melhora nos gráficos e até nos diálogos que já eram muito bons, nos fazendo rir e ficarmos tensos logo de cara! Destruições e apresentações surgem e nós começamos o jogo...\n\nGLaDOS retorna e dessa vez mais ameaçadora, mas contamos com a ajuda de um robozinho que fala mais que a boca e que nos faz rir a cada bobagem! Preparem-se para muitos PLOT Twists bem significativos, muitos diálogos envolventes, momentos de humor seguidos se tensão extrema e muito mais... Tudo que vimos no primeiro portal está aqui 10 vezes melhor e com dezenas de coisas novas/originais. Portal 1 era só a cereja do bolo, e Portal 2 é o bolo completo e vem com a espátula de brinde!\n\nQuando comecei a jogar Portal 2, fui seguindo e me divertindo fazendo os puzzles e tal, quando cheguei em um avançado e pensei que ja estava no final do jogo, assim como foi em Portal 1, mas de repente ocorre algo que não vou revelar e uma fuga alucinante acontece, tendo tensão, destruição e muita adrenalina! Aquela parte toda que pensei que já estava no fim do game é na verdade o início!!! Isso foi surpreendente pra mim!!\n\nRecomendadíssimo!!\n\nPrós:\n-Gráficos bons e leves\n-Maior e melhor que o primeiro, e olha que o primeiro é sensacional!\n-Conquistas e cartas\n-Diálogos e personagens carismáticos\n-Modo coop!\n-Dificildade sempre moderada\n-Cenários muito bem feitos\n-Puzzles muito divertidos\n-Trama fantástica\n-Final surpreendente!\n\nContras:\n-Final excelente mas é interpretativo, e ao meu ver, aquilo é um gancho para uma continuação, mas cadê???????????????????\n\nNota 10/10!","timestamp_created":1449496683,"timestamp_updated":1449578761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556139171123504639","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19546886","author":{"steamid":"76561198156414706","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":9597,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3199,"last_played":1649331080},"language":"polish","review":"Radze KUP!","timestamp_created":1449495432,"timestamp_updated":1449495432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19545808","author":{"steamid":"76561198074355609","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1532540805},"language":"english","review":"GLADDoS is my waifu!!\n\nThe reason I like this game so much is because how badly I want all of this to be possible in real life!!","timestamp_created":1449490448,"timestamp_updated":1449490448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19545758","author":{"steamid":"76561198200119165","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1479,"last_played":1527010073},"language":"english","review":"SO!
