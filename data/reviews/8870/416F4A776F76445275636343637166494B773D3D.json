Und bei all dem Lob von allen Seiten hier als Abwechslung etwas was mir an dem Spiel überhaupt NICHT gefallen hat:\n\nWas mich sehr früh SEHR STARK gestört hat, waren die unzähligen Dinge die man STÄNDIG einsammeln kann. ÜBERALL und zwar wirklich an den unmöglichsten Stellen und nach jedem Meter und in JEDER Ecke gibt es irgendwas, das man einsammeln kann. Mein persönliches Highlight war eine brennende Frauenleiche, die Munition, Zaubersalze und eine Banane bei sich trug. What the fuck?!! Die gefühlt Hälfte des Spiels habe ich mit Einsammeln von Kram verschwendet. Wenn man später mit Elisabeth unterwegs ist, findet sie auch noch zusätzlich alle zwei Minuten eine Münze die sie einem zuwirft. Und als ob das nicht genug wäre, wird die fantastische Grafik dadurch geschändet, dass in jedem Raum mindest ein Verkaufsautomat steht wo man sich wieder aufpeppen kann. Völlig unnötig. Wie ein Penner geht man an jede Mülltonne ran, weil sich in fast jeder Tonne ein Vermögen verbirgt - also fast wie im echten Leben! Man muss sich einen Kinobesuch vorstellen bei dem ständig um einen herum zahllose Handys ihre Töne ans Ohr schlagen - so ablenkend kamen mir diese Sammelobjhekte vor, als ob man versuchen würde das Spiel absichtlich in die Länge ziehen zu wollen.\nTeilweise habe ich versucht mich auf das Level zu konzentrieren und bin absichtlich an allem vorbeigerannt, was man aber leider nicht ganz ignorieren kann, denn schnell geht einem die Munition aus - also muss man wieder in die nächste Bäckerei laufen um Kisten voller Munition hinter den Tresen zu finden! \n\nAber die Grafik ist soo schön!

The main reason being I loved guarding and protecting the little sisters, for some reason it made me delighted. Bioshock Infinite does pull some of the same heartstrings as Bioshock 2 to me, where as you have a supporting character and the game was made for you to basically love the supporting character to the point that you aren't playing just to beat the game, you are playing because you want what she wants as well. And you'll do whatever it takes to help her. This game puts the Bioshock series into a mind blowing experience that will confuse you in the beginning but the more you play, the more it all starts to make sense, and at a certain point, you are exposed to the truth that all three games are linked.

It’s ability to build upon and create a likeable and believable universe is astounding. Infinite isn’t like its predecessors, rather it is more of an Action Shooter than a Stealth Shooter. The player of this game when playing isn’t restricted as much and you don’t have to do any menial scrounging of supplies off of the ground and in objects. Scrounging is always advantageous but in this game it isn’t emphasized as much as it was in Bioshock and Bioshock 2. \n\nGameplay: Gameplay is unfortunately brought down by the fact that it often feels like a run of the mill shooter. I often found myself using at most two vigors that were available rather than using all of them in certain situations as the two vigors did all that I needed in the game. I also was irritated by the fact that you are unable to carry more than two weapons at a time unlike the original Bioshock in which the player would collect weapons and store ammo for each switching to whichever was the best tool for the job at the time. I often found myself using most of the weapons because each felt that it had an impact even if it didn’t have all the upgrades that you can add to the weapons in the game. Movement is fluid and the objectives are often easy to follow because of the player being funneled in one direction throughout the game. The gameplay isn’t revolutionary, it isn’t even evolutionary, but it is enjoyable to play even with the lack thereof. \n\nStory: Here is a moot point about the game. The story, from my perspective, was endearing and harshe at the right moments. It drew me in and I often found myself playing for a couple hours because of how likeable the story was; that could be a problem for some because the previous games in the series were all well told through narration of other characters and the person you played felt like yourself allowing for the games to be more immersive. In Bioshock Infinite you play the role of a defined character, Booker Dewitt, who has background and isn’t your usual masked and silent protagonist. If Booker wants to say something he will and you will hear it. Booker and Elizabeths interactions, I feel, add to the game in a manner that was appealing. The story progresses in a believable and cohesive manner, even for a game with strange concepts, and ends leaving the player to think about what just really happened. Games that make you think about what you just went through at the end are my favorite types of games. \n\nSoundtrack: The game’s soundtrack is enjoyable and has quite a few memorable tracks but felt too far in the background. I don’t tweak with most of the volume settings when I first playthrough a game, as to make the game as close to what the designers wanted it to look, feel, and sound like, but the soundtrack just felt behind the scenes and not really an emphasis in the game. I have listened to a couple tracks that were enjoyable from the game and there are a few gems in it, but more often than not you will hear the chords of combat and the grinding of strings when combat ends and that is about it. Cinematics have their own music that blends and adds to the experience but I felt that the soundtrack should have been more in the foreground than the background in the game. \n\nPros\n- Enjoyable story\n- Linear shooter done right\n- A polished game that looks remarkable\n- Made me think at both the end of the main game and the DLC expansion.\n\nCons\n- Isn’t Evolutionary or Revolutionary in any manner\n- Doesn’t have much of the gameplay from its predecessors\n\nThe game is a well rounded shooter and has a great story to go along with it. If you have around ten hours to blow this game will be memorable experience.\n\nI would give the game a 7/10","timestamp_created":1406526485,"timestamp_updated":1408403518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11444072","author":{"steamid":"76561198084242031","num_games_owned":531,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":2864,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":391,"last_played":1556563051},"language":"english","review":"This game is amazing and everything i was hoping from it!

Si butterebbo sicuramente giù da soli xD (e per pazzi intendi i buon vecchi riconbinanti)\n\n-Armi: mi sono molto piaciute le nuove armi introdotte e rimodificate alcune di quelle vecchie in meglio.\n\n-Continuiamo a parlare con i plasmidi...alcuni nuovi, altri riperfezionati dai vecchi...E su questa cosa vorrei aprire una parentesi ...onestamente definirei il modo di assunzione dei plasmidi come un contro, perchè a me non è andato tanto giù il fatto che si assumi l'eve in un modo pietoso...IN BOTTIGLIETTE!!!!\n\n-Tralasciando questa sclerata vorrei concludere subito di parlare del gioco normale (perchè per il resto è fantastico in tutto e per tutto e quotandolo 8.5-9/10) e iniziare a parlare dei tanto discussi DLC Burial at Sea....(i futuri ragionamenti potrebbero contenere spoiler...se lo leggi e ti sfavi perchè sai cose che non volevi sapere allora perchè ca..o lo leggi?)\n\n+Burial at Sea Part 1:................................................una cag..a totale...il mio gatto non avrebbe saputo fare di peggio dopo un'indigestione di 1 settimana, ma tornando al gioco...Si ok! Ti vengono spiegate delle cose riguardo alla fine del gioco normale o comunque riguardo ai personaggi del gioco, ma per il resto equivale a fare qualche missione in più... Non ci sono novità se non nella trama e nell'aggiunta di un'arma che sembra un'antenna di Sky portatile per tostare il pane...Solo per il DLC Part 1 Voto 2-2.5/10\n\n+Burial at Sea Part 2:Per me è veramente difficile parlare di questo DLC...All'inizio mi ha veramente colpito il fatto di usare durante il gioco solo Elizabeth, però allo stesso tempo con il proseguire mi ha fatto sfavare riguardo a certe cose...\n-1In questa parte Elizabet può usare armi per combattere ed in più ha una fottuta e fighissima balestra con 3 tipi di dardi...La mia domanda è: Per quale ca..o di motivo non combatti anche nel gioco normale?? Una soluzione mi è poi saltata in mente...Lei non è l'Elizabeth che noi abbiamo conosciuto nel gioco...\n-2 Il fatto di \"dover\" giocare in modalità stealth, perchè i cattivi sono molto forti e ti possono tranquillamente togliere la vita in qualche petosecondo è stata una cosa buona, però strutturata poi nel gameplay in maniera orrenda; in alcuni casi se passi davanti ai nemici essi non ti cagano, e quindi diventano facili prede...\n-3 Stile di combattimento riguardante alle armi...Posso capire che sei una ragazza fragile Elizabeth, ma mi spieghi per quale assurdo motivo non puoi portare più di 4 munizioni per il fucile a canne mozze??? (2 caricate e 4 di scorta) Oppure dei dardi per balestra, 4 di un tipo e 2-3 di quell'altro...O meglio ancora come nella parte 1 la riaggiunta dell'arma che sembra un tostapane...\n-4 Stile di combattimento riguardante i plasmidi: ebbene si ragazzi, avete letto bene anche prima riguardo al fatto di usare solo Elizabeth, con i plasmidi; a mio parere penso sia stata la vera cagata del DLC (si ok è un'innovazione, ma è pur sempre una cagata)...\n-5 La trama invece nulla da ridire...mi ha veramente colpito dritto al cuore a partire da tutta la storia del primo Bioshock a questo capitolo finale...\n\nIn conclusione queste due parti sono da comprare se volete averle e volete giocarle voi a tutti i costi (consiglio spassionato, comprate il season pass in sconto), mentre se volete risparmiare qualche soldo e preferite guardarvi il gameplay su you tube, fate pure, tanto in qualità di gioco non ci perdete nulla... Part 2 Voto 5.5-6/10 solo per la trama e in aggiunta un 2-3/10 per il gioco","timestamp_created":1406422548,"timestamp_updated":1406422548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528991103172302246","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11426827","author":{"steamid":"76561198001877987","num_games_owned":985,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1282,"last_played":1413231804},"language":"english","review":"One of the best single player games I've played.
