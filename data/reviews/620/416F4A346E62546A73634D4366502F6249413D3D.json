The game opens with Chell back in Apature Science after being freed by a bumbling core named Wheatly. After accidentally rebooting GLaDOS, Chell is back with the Portal Gun and going through another round of tests until Wheatly comes in to save her again. Will they be able to stop GLaDOS again? Or is there another core that is more destructive then her? The gameplay is like before, lots of puzzle solving while relying on your Portal Gun to help out, the puzzles are more challenging this time. While ya havethe portal gun and the companion cube, you also have Gels that come in handy. The Blue Gel lets you jump higher, the Orange Gel makes you run faster, and the White Gel makes you put portals anywhere. There are also light bridges, lasers and tunnes that help out with the puzzles, while ocasionaly outsmarting Turrets. Instaed of one character talking to you, you have 2 that do most of the talking in this game. GLaDOS is still the GLaDOS we know and love while Wheatly is the hilarious clumsy Core who clearly states that he's not a moron. There's also a 2 player Co-op mode where 2 robots from Apature take in on GLaDOS's tests, I've only played the PS3 version of this and it's fun toplay when you have a buddy helping out. So if you liked the first game, then your goingto love the sequel, full of surprises, complicated puzzles, and whitty dailouge. The game is a fitting ending to Portal that it makes you wonder how can they top it off with a Portal 3?
