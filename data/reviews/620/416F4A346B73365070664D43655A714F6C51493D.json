Es macht viel Spaß es zu spielen. Man kann Mods von der Werkstatt (Workshop) herunterladen. Dadurch hat man immer etwas neues zum ausprobieren. Es gibt auch von der Community erstellte Mods für dieses Spiel. Dazu muss man einfach im Geschäft (Shop) etwas runter scrollen und sieht über \"Ähnliche Produkte\" die \"Von der Community erstellte Mods Für dieses Spiel\". Also hat man nochmal mehr zum ausprobieren.\n\nIn diesem Spiel macht man Portale wie der Name schon sagt. Die Hauptaufgabe ist es zu überleben und bis zum Ende zu kommen. Man muss viele Puzzle lösen um dies zu schaffen. Dies macht man mit Portalen, um an unerreichbare Orte zu kommen. Man muss aber manchmal auch etwas überlegen, wie man es machen muss. Es ist also ein schönes Denkspiel.\n\nPortal 2 ist die Fortsetzung von Portal. Die Geschichte wird also mit Portal 2 fortgesetzt. Portal 2 hat aber viel mehr Inhalt als Portal und eine bessere Grafik. Ich habe Portal noch nie gespielt, aber mich darüber informiert. Deswegen weiß ich das.\n\nIch hoffe das ich dir mit meiner Beurteilung helfen konnte, einen Einblick in dieses coole Spiel zu bekommen. Ich kann es dir wirklich empfehlen. Es läuft sogar unter Linux und läuft auch auf nicht so guten Computern (Habe es mit CPU: Intel Core i3-3110M mit 2,40 GHz und Grafikchip: Intel HD Graphics 4000 gespielt).","timestamp_created":1594722168,"timestamp_updated":1594722168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501742184162139893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72666726","author":{"steamid":"76561199055024739","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":444,"last_played":1599646152},"language":"spanish","review":"Clásico, concepto to guapo","timestamp_created":1594722053,"timestamp_updated":1594722053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72666538","author":{"steamid":"76561198950651834","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":890,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":699,"last_played":1619103083},"language":"english","review":"(Y)","timestamp_created":1594721761,"timestamp_updated":1594721761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72666148","author":{"steamid":"76561198980012425","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":593,"last_played":1638006315},"language":"russian","review":"Очень классный сюжет!

The story is more in depth, the game is longer, and the puzzles are amazing. Some puzzles will really leave you scratching your head, but the game does a good job of teaching you mechanics and how you can mess with them to solve a puzzle. After a while you'll just find the solutions coming naturally, especially through multiple playthroughs. This is shown even more through the co-op, with GLaDOS's voice lines tearing you and your teamate apart, and the tests being both creative and fun.

Et franchement, je crois que j'aurais pas pu faire mieux pour débuter. Moi qui adore les puzzles, les robots et la science fiction, c'était, et ça a toujours été la grande joie, de A à Z.\n\nJ'ai fini le jeu en 9h. En deux sessions de 4h30 chacune, qui m'ont tellement stimulé que j'en ai eu un mal de crâne monstrueux pour chacune. J'ai tellement adoré, que j'ai recommencé et fini le jeu une deuxième fois le lendemain, ce qui m'a pris deux fois moins de temps (et n'ai eu donc qu'une migraine). J'ai recommencé, encore et encore, pour explorer tous les recoins du jeu ou essayer de le speedruner. Ce bijou est à la hauteur de ce que tout le monde en dit.\n\nEt puis j'ai découvert le workshop. Une dinguerie au concentré d'intelligence et de créativité de la part des fans du jeu. Des centaines de map qui ont tout le génie du level design de la campagne, même plus des fois - avec de temps en temps des nouvelles mécaniques et environnements uniques en leur genre, ou tirant parti de mécaniques existantes d'une façon dont on n'aurait pas pensé. C'est le deuxième effet Kiss Cool d'un jeu avec une telle notoriété : une communauté si immense derrière qu'on peut indéfiniment profiter de l'interminable liste de leurs contributions. Je dois bien avoir passé les trois quarts de mon temps de jeu là dessus - et avec le système de notation, vous êtes presque certain que chaque nouveau niveau que vous découvrez va vous plaire.\n\nAujourd'hui, il m'arrive de revenir sur le jeu à l'occasion de vacances ou d'évenements. Je me prépare ma soirée avec une sélection de niveaux custom en avance, puis je me lance quand tout est téléchargé - je ne suis jamais déçu.","timestamp_created":1594710429,"timestamp_updated":1594710429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72659779","author":{"steamid":"76561199069975343","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":4766,"playtime_last_two_weeks":91,"playtime_at_review":310,"last_played":1660290956},"language":"russian","review":"КРУТО!","timestamp_created":1594709389,"timestamp_updated":1594709389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72659707","author":{"steamid":"76561198994939887","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1644157931},"language":"russian","review":"Классная

I will say that Portal 2 is one of the few sequels I would argue is even better than the original. Portal was an excellent puzzle game, and the plot was simple but filled with excellent humor. Portal 2 goes even further and enhances so many aspects of the game, including the plot. Also, one of the main characters is voiced by comedian Stephen Merchant, who does a phenomenal job! If you're looking for an entertaining and relaxing game filled with humor and simple yet challenging puzzles, this is a great choice.","timestamp_created":1594679519,"timestamp_updated":1594679519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72643181","author":{"steamid":"76561198314341185","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3739,"last_played":1595015778},"language":"english","review":"it can be challenging at times so it requires you to think, but it's not impossible and can become easy enough when you realise what you're supposed to do","timestamp_created":1594678781,"timestamp_updated":1594678781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72643015","author":{"steamid":"76561198369734318","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":3684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3684,"last_played":1594586987},"language":"english","review":"Giant shmentai monster R*ped me 0/10","timestamp_created":1594678522,"timestamp_updated":1594678522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72642985","author":{"steamid":"76561199044542936","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":737,"last_played":1594232259},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1594678473,"timestamp_updated":1594678473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ks6PpfMCeZqOlQI="}
