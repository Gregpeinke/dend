I am such a huge COD, Battlefield, and CSGO fan, but I bought this game, and I have totally forgot about the other games.\n\nPros: \n-Stunning graphics that will even look amazing on a lower end computer\n-Gameplay is very smooth\n-Controlls easy to get used to\n-Great price for the game especially when it's on sale\n-Great amount of detail put into making the characters of the story more enjoyable, relateable, and likeable\n-Your choices can effect the game later, which every FPS/Adventure game should have\n-Story is so good when you look on YouTube you will try your hardest to avoid spoilers and end game explained\n\nCons:\n-Not alot of guns to choose from;\nPistol\nCarbine\nMachine gun/SMG\nRPG\nMinigun(hard to get)\nSniper\nShotgun\n\n-Recoil on most guns are insane! I find my self missing the majority of my shots even when burst firing!\n-You can only carry 2 weapons in your arsenal \n-Run out of health and shield extremely fast when fighting on medium level difficulty\n-No minimap to tell where the enimies are coming from, I get scared to death when I see a mini boss pop out behind me when the mood, music, and scenario makes it seem like enemies will spawn on sides or in front of character.\n-(Spoiler alert) NO SEX SCENES! Sorry, but I feel like I need a sexual moment or two in every game.Like Mass Effect.\n\nOverall \nI would absolutely recoomend this to each and every one of my firends! This game has breath taking scenes, amazing character plots, and plot twists, without completely obliterating the story! The game makes you think before you do, and think outside the box. Every once and a while, you may even get killed while looking at your surroundings, totally oblivious you are being shot at (also because on no mini map) -WARING- I HIGHLY reccomend you taking your time to look at your surroundings and listening to character dialog, I turely feel bad for those who don't pay attention. :( \n\nTips: Watch out for the false shephard, he's closer than you think ;)","timestamp_created":1438421171,"timestamp_updated":1438421171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17330035","author":{"steamid":"76561198179311679","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":282,"last_played":1438901611},"language":"russian","review":"Нмана так","timestamp_created":1438420214,"timestamp_updated":1438420214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17329954","author":{"steamid":"76561198025773618","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2937,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2855,"last_played":1424887985},"language":"russian","review":"Лучший сюжет в играх за последние несколько лет, незабываемые атмосфера и арт, а также чуть-чуть однообразного геймплея, который сильно ухудшился по сравнению с 1-ой частью (небольшой открытый мир со своей экосистемой против арен, с которых тебя не выпустят, пока все враги не испустят дух).\nТакже есть 3 крупных DLC для игры.

Without giving away any spoilers, it felt like the game wanted an excuse to add black NPCs to fight along with the (mostly) white enemies the player had been fighting up to this point. The player then fights a mix of two different antagonistic groups through the rest of the game, one of which is populated by mostly black NPCs. It's uncomfortable, to put it incredibly lightly, and sucked a lot of fun out of the game for me. Especially because the in game justification for the switch is clunky and confusing from storytelling standpoint, there seems to be no other reason than the writers wanted an excuse to add in a forced \"gray morality\" plot point. (What did you think they were going to do with the guns in the first place, Booker? Shoot seagulls out of the sky or something?)\nThat being said, I did enjoy the game. The story sectioins that were NOT filled with gunning down revolutionaries were interesting, and even though I'd had the major twist spoiled for me ages ago I still enjoyed the big reveal scene. I've never made it through the original Bioshock, baby to jumpscares as I am, and Infinite was a nice alternative. So if you're looking for something like that, I'd recommend it, just be warned about that middle chunk of gameplay.","timestamp_created":1438190920,"timestamp_updated":1438190920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17284151","author":{"steamid":"76561198044889490","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":4593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4287,"last_played":1438185670},"language":"russian","review":"\"Heads or Tailes?\"\n\nЭто игра - шедевр, который должен пройти каждый.\nОна - как хорошая книга, к которой хочется возвращаться раз за разом.\n\nКрасивый, прекрасный мир, который завораживает раз за разом и который не приедаеться.\nГеймплей мало изменился с прошлых частей, но это минусом назвать никак нельзя, ведь совершенство не требует изменений).\nМузыкальное сопровождение на высоте, даже не хочеться его Вам описывать, чтобы не портить впечатление.\nИдеальный захватывающий сюжет, который оставляет яркий след в памати на очень долгое время.\nХаризматичные и  запоминающие, которые могут преследовать особо впечатлительных во снах.\n\nЭто не просто игра - это произведение искусства.\n\nP.S.\n\nДополнения обязательны к прохождению, они связывают между собой BioShock и BioShock Infinite. \nОт неожиданных поворотов сюжета можно уронить челюсть на пол).\nВторой эпизод вносит приятное разнообразие в геймплей добавление стелса.\n","timestamp_created":1438188064,"timestamp_updated":1438188064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17282553","author":{"steamid":"76561197969385823","num_games_owned":570,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1065,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1065,"last_played":1438354965},"language":"english","review":"No no no no no.

Ведь, что главное в игре? Естественно сюжет и погружение. Согласитесь, Зеленая миля со своими убожескими спец.эффектами просто рвет в пух и прах любой блокбастер с кучей взрывов и экшена. Рвет с помощью сюжета. Ради этого и прикупил данную игру. Играл в первую часть, изучал Восторг, не замысловатый сюжет, но атмосфера это сглаживала в разы. Столько восторженых воплей прочитал об Infinite, метакритик оценил выше 90, все хвалят и хвалят, это то и подкупило. \nНачало конечно кашерное, утопический город в небесах, с жителями и вождем, похожим на секту, угнетение цветного населения, агнец, которого никто не видел, но все знают о нем - бодро. Но далее, сюжет как-будто перестали писать. Начинается симулятор: локация-перестрелка-поиск припасов. Все. В сюжет добавляют какие-то абстарктные повороты и идеотию. Я ценитель фильмов Мартина Скорсезе, но если вы хотели повторить это в игре, то хотя бы внесите немного ключевых моментов. \nВНИМАНИЕ! СПОЙЛЕР! Пройдя игру, первым делом полез на ютуб, удостовериться, правильно ли понял концовку. Оказывается да. Но я так и не понял, зачем агнец убивает Комстока? Если это такой же отец ее, то она меняет утопический город, родителя который все для нее делает и обожествляет на алкаша и любителя азартных игр, который ее же и продал за долги? Где логика? Смысл? А да, его здесь и нет! Как нет и того, за что этой игре дали 90+ критики.\nИМХО - уверен на 140% школьники визжащие от восторга данной игры, даже не пытались понять сюжет, а тупо стреляли и крушили как они любят в тупарылых играх серии Call of Duty, успевая на ходу краснеть от взгляда Элизабет. А потом хором поставить лайк в steam. \nИтог - зря потраченные деньги и 15 часов личного свободного времени. \n5/10 агнцев за эту муть.","timestamp_created":1438152229,"timestamp_updated":1438152229,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17275691","author":{"steamid":"76561197983112150","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":639,"last_played":1387564855},"language":"english","review":"A Fps game borrowing from its predecessor bioshock with beutiful art direction and intersting world to get linearly flung trough.  \n\nWith Forced narrative and forced game tacked on.
