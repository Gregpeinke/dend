Она еще круче.

Or do you...?\n\nPortal came out in late 2007 featuring an incredibly awesome ending song you've got to hear. The game begins with you (The female protagonist only known as Chell.) awakening from your slumber pod in a confined room. After some brief learning of the controls you are introduced to a strange voice known as GlaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) that leads you through a series of tests with the promise of cake at the end. As you progress through the series of tests you come to realize things are not as what they seem. Oh and you get an amazing gun you can use to create portals (One blue, one orange.) that you can traverse in addition to carrying objects through.\n\nThe entire game focuses around puzzle solving, using the Portal Gun to access an otherwise impossible area or jump in one at the bottom of a pit and fling yourself out of the other at a high velocity. From moving \"cubes\" from one area to activate a switch to supplying power to another switch via an electric ball soaring through the air. Portal takes a good amount of problem-solving but won't really leave you scratching your head for long to figure out how to reach an out-of-reach platform.\n\nIn general the game is somewhat short, taking about 3-4 hours, maybe less for some. Using the Portal Gun can be pretty fun from launching yourself across a pool of acid to sneaking up behind a turret. Or even placing a portal above a pool of acid and slapping another right beneath the turret watching it plummet down below. All the while GLaDOS will comment (and eventually mock) on your progress until the final showdown. I don't want to spoil anything so I will leave it there.\n\nControls can be a little awkward if you are using a controller (Yes, the game does support gamepads.) as there are no controls for sensitive sticks. Personally I found myself slowly sliding to the left with my 360 controller ever so slowly and the same effect with the camera. It could just be my controller but options to adjust the dead zone on a gamepad would be nice. Trying to grab an object can be a little annoying sometimes as it won't immediately register unless you're at the right angle.\n\nMusic and sound wise the game is great. Nothing truly memorable (Except the final ending song, \"Still Alive\".) but it can set the mood quite nicely. Graphics are a bit dated but that's to be expected for something dating back from 2007. Speaking of graphics at startup I did run into a slight issue, The game started in full screen 1280x720 according to my monitor but the screen remained blank. After some searching around it turns out to get it to work you neeed to add \"-windowed\" to the properties string in Steam. After that you can go into the settings and tweak it as much as you like and switch back to full screen. Just a tip in the event you find your screen blank but the music plays.\n\nPortal does end in sort of a cliff hanger but fortunately Portal 2 is out which continues the story. If you're new to the Portal games I strongly recommend starting with the first game before trying the second. I got both on sale during the Steam Winter Sale so if you have the chance be sure to get both of them. The first does have map challenges and achievements I have yet to try after beating the story so there is bound to be a lot of replay value for your buck.","timestamp_created":1423989831,"timestamp_updated":1423989831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14477812","author":{"steamid":"76561198116300102","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1484486312},"language":"tchinese","review":"Menu text don't show up in linux mint 17.

Esse gênero nunca foi bem explorado pelos desenvolvedores, então, a Valve resolveu mudar isso radicalmente. Você é Chell, um mulher muda, e você está nas instalações do laboratório Aperture Science. Lá, você conhece GLaDOS, uma inteligência artificial sádica e sem dúvidas nenhuma, a personagem mais marcante dos dois jogos da série. GLaDOS coloca você nos mais variados locais de teste, e, para te dar um ajudinha, te dá uma Portal Gun. Nesses ambientes de testes, você começa a perceber o sadismo de GLaDOS, e se dá conta que ela pode estar tentando te matar. E aí, começa a sua jornada em busca de se livrar dessa IA tão carismática. Os gráficos de Portal são muito bons, como era de se esperar da Source Engine, e a sua física e fantástica, beirando os níveis da perfeição. A história é empolgante e contagiante, te fazendo ficar preso nas poucas horas que você joga, pois Portal tem uma campanha muito curta, podendeo ser concluído em até uma hora e meia. Conta também com uma jogabilidade muito intuitiva e fácil de ser assimilada. Em uma breve síntese desse jogo fantástico, posso dizer que Portal inovou o gênero puzzle em videogames e se tornou um ícone entre os gamers com seus mais diversos elementos e particularidades. 8,5/10","timestamp_created":1423978312,"timestamp_updated":1423978312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14476024","author":{"steamid":"76561198157671559","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":150,"playtime_forever":155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":108,"last_played":1614321000},"language":"english","review":"This game was really fun, and I really enjoyed it, though I felt like it didn't take that long for me.

I mało kto przypuszczał, że będzie tak dobry. Zwłaszcza tak rewolucyjny dla gier logicznych,  mało kto wierzył w sukces Portala,  a jednak się udało. Cała akcja gry rozpoczyna się w jednej z komur testowych w której nasza bochaterka wychodzi ze stanu hibernacji.  Znajdujemy się w \"Aparature Labolatories\" które znajduje się gdzieś w U. S. A. w stanie Mishigan.   Portal jest grą w której wcielamy się w obiekt testowy który nazywa się Chell.  Wszystkich informacji na temat bochaterki dowiadujemy się właśnie od maszyny która żądzi całym kompleksem a w grze dowiadujemy się że nazywa się GLADoS. Maszyna wykorzystuje nas do testowana komur .  W zamian chce nam dać kawałek ciasta.  Jednak gdy ukończymy wszystkie testy które zleca nam GLADoS to zsmiast nam dać kawałek ciasta to usiłuje nas zabić!

Toto se vztahuje i na druhý díl, který je taktéž skvěle zpracován! Do hry vás vtáhne dějová smyčka (jelikož nejsou ve hře české titulky, tak je to trochu složitější,. Ale nemyslím si, že by to bylo až tak složité,. Jsem průměrný angličtinář a s pochopením jsem neměl moc velký problém,. Jistě, jsou tam slovíčka, které jsem si musel přeložit, ale myslím si, že jsem to zvládl,. :D ), černý humor úmělého počítače (který celou labratoř má na starosti), \"propracované úrovně\" (v uvozovkách je to protože znám druhý díl, na svou dobu, kdy hra vyšla, tak jsou určitě úrovně dobré, ale jelikož jsem hrál nejdříve druhý díl, tak mi jednička přišla nějaká snazší, zasekl jsem se pouze u jedné místnosti, kde jsem opravdu nevěděl),.\n\nMalinko něco o dějové linii,. \nProbudíte se v Aperture Science Enrichment Center (laboratoři),. Chvíli tápete v paměti, kde jste a proč tu jste,. Najednou se ozve nějaký hlas- GLaDOS (již zmíněný \"super počítač\"), který vám vysvětlí proč tu jste, co tu dělate a hlavně co budete dělat,. Jelikož GLaDOS má rád testy, tak vám jich pár připravý,. (-doslova jen pár! Oproti druhému dílu je to opravdu málo!) Testy byste samy nezvládli a proto vám GLaDOS pomůže a dostanete (nevybavuji si název ve hře, ale všem vám znamý název) PortalGun,. Pomocí tohoto přístroje můžete vytvářet dva portály a skrze ně procházet,.\n Za odměnu, že budete dělat testy vám GLaDOS slíbí, že dostanete dort,. Samozřejmě je tu jedno ALE! Když se dostanete nakonec, tak žádný dort nedostanete,. :( [spoiler] A aby toho nebylo málo, tak se vás GLaDOS pokusí zabít,. [/spoiler] \n To se vám samozřejmě nelíbí a tak se snažíte utéct ve zdravý pryč z laboratoře,. Jak to vše dopadne? To abyste věděli, tak si už budete muset zahrát,. :P :D \n\nPortál bych řadil do jedné z těch lepších her,. Pobaví, soundtrack je naproso úžasný a strašně mile mě překvapil, příběh je taktéž lepší- na to, že je to logická hra, je pžíběh opravdu úžasný! (Byť např. na TWD nebo The Wolf among Us to nemá, ale to budou zase nějaké mé komplexy,. :D )\n\n+ GLaDOS- (abych to uvedl na pravou míru- její hlášky! Opravdu jsem se někdy popadal za břicho, protože je to něco úžasného! ) - jedny z nejlepších hlášek, co jsem kdy prostě viděl!\n+ soundtrack - opravdu velké plus za takovýhle úžasný soundtrack! Smekám!\n+ příběh - skvěle zpracovaný příběh! Jak jsem říkal, na to, že tato hra má plnit funkci logickou, tak má naprosto úžasný příběh,-\n+ originalita\n+ hratelnost, jednoduché naučit\n\n- herní doba - myslím, že jsem an to v úvodu nenarážel, byť toto mě velmi mrzelo! Opravdu neskutečně krátká herní doba, hned když jsem to hrál prvně, tak má herní doba trvala asi necelé 2 hodiny, což mě velmi překvapilo a mrzelo,. A jelikož jsem hrál druhý díl, kde to bylo delší, tak mě to velice překvapilo a zklamalo,.\n- opravdu jednoduché místnosti - nevím, zda to má co dočinění s tím, že jsem opět hrál nejdřívě druhý díl a až potom první, ale jakmile jsem přišel do místnosti, tak mi došlo, co musím/měl bych udělat,. To prostě ve dvojce neexistovalo, tam jsem přišel a opravdu velmi dlouho jsem dumal, co musím udělat,.
