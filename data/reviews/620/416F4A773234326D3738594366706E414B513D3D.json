Сюжет игры продолжает сюжет 1 части, только мы оказываемся не на улице, как в окончании portal, а в центре консервации, который придется разрушить и выселить всех людей оттуда из-за недостатка денежных средств. Там мы встречаем модуль, который нам будет помогать в некоторых следующих главах. В принципе мы начинаем играть с того места, откуда мы начинали играть в 1 части, но с тех пор многое изменилось. Конечно если посмотреть на модель лифта, куба, плит и т.д., то можно заметить, что они по графике стали лучше и более реальны. \nЧто можно сказать о самой игре? Сюжет стал длиннее , а его повороты очень неожиданными и запутанными. В испытаниях появляются новые штучки, как лазер, 4 вида геля, панель веры и 2 новых вида куба. Сами испытания стали куда сложнее и интереснее. Из-за всего этого игру пройти тяжелее, чем в 1 части. Но у игры есть слабая сторона. Некоторые испытания очень большие, и я бы даже сказал огромные. Чтобы не облегчать путь игроку, в этих испытаниях нельзя везде ставить порталы. Но чтобы все таки пройти испытание, разработчики игры в некоторых местах делают видные белые стены, из-за чего если немного подумать, можно догадаться, что нужно делать дальше. Если в 1 части испытания не были столь огромными, и нельзя было с такой быстротой найти решение, то во 2 части найти решение можно несколько быстрее, но от этого игра не становится скучной, так как игра сделана так, чтобы получить удовольствия от неё больше, чем от 1 части.","timestamp_created":1403938218,"timestamp_updated":1403938218,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505810797214508057","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10896377","author":{"steamid":"76561198065004734","num_games_owned":956,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":608,"last_played":1573086685},"language":"english","review":"Long story short, it is amazing to see such a great concept pulled off so well.
