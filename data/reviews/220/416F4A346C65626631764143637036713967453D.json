Who fights against the alien Combine with his old friends from Black Mesa Research Facility and also with many others. In Half-Life 2 you have a lot different weapons like object-manipulating gravity gun and also spectacular different areas you explore trough the game.\n\n[h1]My Opinion[/h1]\nNever ending story Half-Life. Best sequel to the one of the best games Half-Life. I enjoyed playing Half Life 2 a lot. It has one of the best stories I have ever played! Also Half-Life 2 has great mechanics with okay looking graphics regardless of the game's age. If you like Puzzle Story based games then Half-Life 2 is for you. Once you have played Half-Life 2 I recommend you to buy the episodic sequels of Half-Life 2 they are Episode One and Episode Two you can buy them from Steam.

Какая же это все таки невероятная игра, особенно с поправкой на время. В такие крутые fps я не играл уже очень и очень давно.\nИгра просто окутывает невероятной атмосферой антиутопии.\n\nФизика окружения не напрягаясь даст фору абсолютному большинству игр, что вышли за все время после халфы.\n\nДизайн локаций, продуманность этих самых локаций, их разнообразие. Каждый новый уровень совершенно не похож на остальные. Причём не только текстурками, но и атмосферой... Да и вообще, кто бы мог подумать, что в 2020 году можно с лёгкостью обойтись без миникарты.\n\nСюжет достаточно лёгкий и ненавязчивый, но каждый персонаж, с первой же минуты знакомства запоминается, располагает к себе, и заставляет сопереживать происходящему.\n\nГеймплей...его разнообразие просто поражает. Мне кажется в игру засунули просто все, что можно было придумать в те года. И при этом игра абсолютно не перегружена.\n\nВ общем, спустя 16 лет после выхода игры, я наконец прочувствовал полностью, что такое half life 2, и за что его так обожают. Ощущения схожи с теми, что я получил при просмотре трилогии Крестного отца. Даже по современным меркам это однозначный 10/10 и первая моя игра в стиме со всеми ачивками (правда их не много, и они достаточно простые, но зато интересные). На очереди эпизоды.\n\nВот сейчас сижу и думаю о том, что действительно, кому если не серии half life совершать революцию в гейминге. Уже в третий раз...жаль что с alyx я познакомлюсь только на ютубе, но может быть, так же через 16 лет буду писать восторженный отзыв, о том, какой же это был шедевр, который навсегда застыл вне времени.
