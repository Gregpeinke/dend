The racial implications alone of there existing a dichotomous Easy to Spot Racists and White Saviors proved that the writers were painfully ignorant about what racism actually looks like in the relevant modern world and even in early 20th century America. The racist caricatures and attempted \"satire\", when satire is supposed to expose the flaws and absurdity of the oppressor, not shove racist caricatures at me until I become uncomfortable became so overbearingly blunt and disgusting that I wasn't even halfway through the game before I uninstalled it. \nHugely disappointing game on its own, even more so when comparing it to other games in the series. Gameplay offered nothing new or innovative that the other's didn't do better, the hand-waving of Vigor users being perfectly fine while splicers invariably develop an addiction was lazy and ignored the basic premise of the entire Rapture narrative, and the visceral satisfaction of decapitating white supremacists wore off fast when I was forced to participate in murdering a Black woman who was portrayed as equally evil to Comstock even though she was not at all on politically or socially or economically equal footing with him and had not systemically enslaved and oppressed people. It's as though it never occurred to the writers that people wouldn't relate to Booker overcoming his white guilt, because clearly all of their players are white men who need to be pandered to. Because slapping a fat Hispanic boy in a sombrero and a poncho and labeling him as part of the Foreign Horde is something Hispanic players encounter on a daily basis and we don't need \"satire\" to tell us how stupid it is when my dad got called a beaner by a customer at work. I regret buying this when it was on sale for $10, it wasn't even worth the spit I wasted cursing this abomination.

Most the enemies pose no challenge, and you are aided during combat with free health, power and ammo through the entire fight when you get low. Even though it was not challenging the game still provides a lot of fun and a rewarding journey, regardless if you played the previous Bioshock games or not.\n\nHighly recommend.","timestamp_created":1387746875,"timestamp_updated":1387746875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8207401","author":{"steamid":"76561198040912202","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1463,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":975,"last_played":1449457179},"language":"english","review":"A little short, but really cool.
