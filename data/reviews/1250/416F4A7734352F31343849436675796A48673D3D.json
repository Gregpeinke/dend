I rate it an 8 out of 10, and you can read a detailed why below.\n\nThe game features two gameplay modes: survival, where wave after wave of not-undead-but-failed-bio-experiments try to murder you while you clean the area, and objective, where you have set goals to complete depending on the level. You have seven different \"classes\" to play as, which affect mostly what kind of weapons you have easier access to and complementary efficiency bonuses, and all of them level up by using the respective weapons.\n\nAs someone that often plays Solo, Killing Floor is a fun game. As far as shooters go it is somewhat tactical, having to know the level you're on pretty well to avoid getting cornered into a situation where the only choice is death, and you always go back for more: either to complete achievments, outdo your former best try or simply because it's fun, Killing Floor's formula is interesting enough to keep you going.\n\nWith friends, however, the game gets significantly better. Although some of the harder abominations become harder to take down, a group of players often has a better chance of survival since someone will often shoot something that was about to get you without you knowing it. It also is significantly more fun to see your friends getting mauled by their blunders than dying yourself, but you should still rescue them whenever you can: ammunition can get scarce in harder difficulties, and all the hands help when firing against a Fleshpound or a Scrake.\n\nAbout the classes, each has their pros and cons. A Commando, for instance, can see the health and even detect invisible enemies up to a certain distance, but it lacks in heavy burst damage to take down some of the bigger ones. A Demolitionist, on the other hand, can kill several smaller enemies in one shot and even take down the bigger threats, but it always has to keep a safe distance to avoid blowing himself up or others in some cases. There's also a Medic class, which has guns wich can shoot healing injections onto teammates: it helps when there's less lag to aim at them, but it's usually better than having to run up to them and using the everyone-has-one syringe and heal them.\n\nDont think you have to have a Medic to win though: everyone can heal themselves with the syringe. Arguably less so when in a group, since the amount you heal yourself is reduced, but everyone can heal each other for the same amount you'd heal yourself playing Solo. And with the added advantage that it has a smaller cooldown to heal another than there is to heal yourself, a cooldown shared between those two actions.\n\nBut wait! There's more! Staple and arguably the most prominent feature of Killing Floor, right after the slow-motion triggers that can help you land the next critical shot in something nasty dangerous, you can weld doors shut! Even though Support Specialist has the best reasons to do it with improved welding stats, you can buy time for you or your teammates by blocking access to a room by welding the door shut. And then what? You escape through another door! You kill the other horde just in time to kill the first one after they break the door open! You set up explosive charges or a kill-corridor and make the Horzine experiments meet their lunched makers! Or you can use the ingame chat shortcuts to insult them while you and your teammates heal, I don't know: it's your choice.\n\nAnd now you're thinking: that's it? Is that all? No, of course not. With Steamworks integration, everyone and their grandmas have access to the hottest and most original levels anyone has ever devised. Granted, some are poorly balanced, either for or against you, and sometimes there're texture issues, or lights that you think should make certain areas more visible, or plain bad levels as can happen rarely, but if you think the already extensive list of official levels is too short for your taste there's little in the way of expanding that list. Heck, you can even make your own level! It's hard work, but everyone that puts their levels online has had that work before you; you can instead play their levels and smile as you have a new location to survive against the ungodly bio-experiments.\n\nSo why did I rate 8 of 10 in the begining of this review if it seems like everything I say is perfect in some way? Well, there are some flaws...\n\nThe game is simple. The rules are defined as clearly as possible: either shoot everything that isn't your friends or the gun dealer in survival or shoot everything that isn't your friend or the gun dealer while trying really hard to complete the goals in objective mode. Both of them end up with you (and your team, which may be only you if you're playing alone,) facing the Big Bad, in this game known as The Patriarch. This is repetitive. The levels are repetitive once you master them in one difficulty but are always frustrated at the higher difficulties, either by the monsters' increased movement speed, health boost or limitations of ammo-to-evilguys ratio getting lower. \n\nMoney has to be better managed in higher difficulties too, and in a group someone dying in a higher wave can have lasting consequences in terms of game wallet when you can no longer afford a bigger gun to kill a bigger monster and your teammates aren't willing to throw you a wad of cash, or a relatively good gun either. This is assuming you are playing in a group: if you're alone, you die and have to start all over again. Class experience saves, of course, but sometimes you just want to redo that one wave where you died because you know you could have made it.\n\nAnd of course, there's the single player issue itself. Soloing in the hardest difficulty is for the masters of the game only, which are likely to have leveled every class to its maximum and know each one's weaknesses and strengths so well that they become automatons bent on ridding the world of Horzine clones before having breakfast, but for mere mortals such as I there is a limit on how far you can reach on your own. You can argue that there's the online scene, but my connection is usually bad with random strangers: sometimes I shoot at things that have died a second earlier by a godly pro's usual headshot. That's why I mentioned that the game is better with friends; usually the connection between you and your friends is good, and makes the experience less frustrating. And if you die with friends you're still friends, if you die with random strangers you are that one guy that couldn't even stay alive on that one wave... or maybe they're nice people and don't care, since everyone's having fun.\n\nSpeaking of the online scene, it's not dead. It's simply very time-zone specific, as far as I've seen, and there's usually someone else playing: either alone and waiting for others to join or half-full and nearly on the last wave, you can almost always get into a game. Unless you have really annoying router issues or someone else joined before you and filled the last spot or you have to download a non-official map directly from the server you're joining instead of steamworks or Tripwire's official game site's forum and whatnot... Also remember that not everyone in the world may speak your language, so preferably don't use a microphone and use the in-game chat commands to give indications like \"Follow me\" or \"Let's get to the trader\" or \"Spare some cash, guys?\". And to say \"Thank you\", of course.\n\nSo there. That's my review, and why I rate this game 8 out of 10. I won't say \"look me up in-game\", but I will say \"have fun playing this gem of a game\", and tell your friends.
