(before steampipe) I would highly recommend doing my above method to play this game for anyone looking to get back into Half-Life DeathMatch, but thinks the graphics could be better. Not many play online so I would recommend a BotMod for it.(Search it up online). The water and skies look amazing, the lighting is good, and  the guns, the models, and the testures, are decent. I have found the recoil is  different (It reminds me of going from CS 1.6 to CS:S) but besides that normal gameplay is very much the same as The GoldSrc version. Please buy the bundle that includes Half-Life:  Source, as it is also great. (This game also gives you more models for GMod 8.2-16)\n","timestamp_created":1482478534,"timestamp_updated":1482478534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28515623","author":{"steamid":"76561198161472741","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":64,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1502827801},"language":"english","review":"the first time playing is 8/11/2016","timestamp_created":1482353364,"timestamp_updated":1482353364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28456746","author":{"steamid":"76561198103824421","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":122,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1482098694},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom zinho, antiguinho, mesma coisa do 1... legal.","timestamp_created":1482098846,"timestamp_updated":1482098846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510835945606231689","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28420665","author":{"steamid":"76561198307849991","num_games_owned":436,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1481962679},"language":"schinese","review":"现在除非买大包入得，单独买不推荐！！！\n原因很简单：玩的人太少，基本鬼服，房间不仅少而且延迟动辄几百ping。。。\n要是能加机器人玩还好，问题是没有啊，单游戏来讲感觉还不错，房间里到处是武器、血包、弹药，玩家开始初始武器只要撬棍和手枪，如果能玩的话应该是很快节奏的枪战乱斗，可惜啊。","timestamp_created":1481963758,"timestamp_updated":1481963758,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528882443904876709","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28414303","author":{"steamid":"76561198338075805","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":20,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1480446287},"language":"russian","review":"Игра шла в купе с другими играми в Valve паке\nИгра меня не зацепила, поиграл один раз, по сути тот же Hl2 DM только с мыльными персонажами и картами \n","timestamp_created":1481930208,"timestamp_updated":1481930208,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28345519","author":{"steamid":"76561198228367768","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":70,"last_played":1653776457},"language":"english","review":"This game fun is really, and I think it should be played more.

Unlike another game I played over the weekend (09/03/16) there were actually people on this game. But there's not very many people playing this game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=757644964\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n[b]Story:[/b] The story is Gordan Freeman has gone batsh*t crazy and fighting against himself. Apparently once upon a time you could change skins, and there was a community for this game. But just like walking through a ghost town, all you see are the houses where people used to live. There are still PLENTY of servers to join, but no one to play with. It's always kinda sad to see this happen to a game.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] As far as I can tell, Half-Life Deathmatch: Source uses the same weapons as Half-Life. Just like Half-Life 2: Deathmatch uses pretty much the same weapons and features of Half-Life 2. The only difference is that as of now there are still people playing Half-Life 2: Deathmatch.\n\nFor those that like handholding and my sarcastic descriptions, here are the weapons you get: The almighty Crowbar, whom I informed everyone that I was a master of crowbar-fu. A pistol, which I had the accuracy of a stormtrooper... was it lag? or am I bad? The world will never know.

The ragdolls are totally terrible, instead of animations - you get a ragdoll with rigid legs and arms. The skin changing is Not working properly, you have to do that through your console with a specific command, because lazy valve couldn't fix this goddEmn menu, it used to work, but now for some reason it doesn't. The players keep jumping around the map like goddEmn airplanes, technically no weapon is fun to shoot with. Custom maps aren't making anything better, they make everything even worse.

I spent years trying to gain a reputation and trying to become the best of the community for absolutely nothing. Now I know, it isn't the game's fault, it's more alike my fault. But please, for the love of God, do not make the same mistake as I did. While it might be based on one of the best FPS Games ever made, do NOT waste your money on this game - I would only recommend buying this either for those who are interested in collecting games or want the content for Garry's Mod. Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is basically a half-as'sed port of Half-Life 1 to the Source Engine but with bugs, glitches, and a almost completely dead community. Valve broke any sort of functionality back in 2013, when they ported the game over to Source SDK 2013. Even before Valve broke the game, the game never felt right in the Source Engine. And whatever you do, do NOT listen to all the Nostalgic Fa'ggots and Half-Life Fanboys who are leaving this game positive reviews. They're only leaving good reviews just because it's a port of a classic game. Valve can literally go out in their backyard and fish out the crustiest pile of dog shieet with a plastic bag and stamp the name \"Half-Life\" on it, and people will still buy it because it's \"Half-Life\". In conclusion: buy the original Half-Life or Half-Life 2 Deathmatch instead for those who really want to experience Half-Life 1 Deathmatch or just Half-Life Deathmatch in the Source Engine.\n\nThere would be no doubt that I would get a refund if I could.

 Deathmatch Source Review[/h1]\n[b]by KTMboyz[/b]\n\n[i]\"...hmm...It's pretty fun.\"[/i]\n\nTo start things off, I have never played Deathmatch Classic, so this is a review for what I think of this game and not as a source port.  Half-Life:  Deathmatch Source is self-explanatory.  It's Half-Life - and its deathmatch - and its on source...  lol.  There is a reason I don't recommend it and thats's because, just like all the other Half-Life multiplayer games; they're dead.  Nobody plays them anymore!  Half-Life 2:  Deathmatch has a few more players but not much.  It's a shame, this game is fun as hell!  It's got fast-paced gameplay and intersting source maps that are Half-Life 2-ish.  Don't pick it up on your own, barely anybody plays it...  If you get it in a bundle or something, then play it, it's a blast!\n\n[h1]9.2/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1468171236,"timestamp_updated":1483748369,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489214330911636353","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24219436","author":{"steamid":"76561198098159487","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":106,"last_played":1502224307},"language":"russian","review":"В игре 1998  года была лучше стабильность и баланс игры","timestamp_created":1468108266,"timestamp_updated":1468108302,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24206041","author":{"steamid":"76561198190281190","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":51,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50,"last_played":1497193236},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1468067403,"timestamp_updated":1468067403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499607890844345093","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24159843","author":{"steamid":"76561198201823458","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":91,"last_played":1483457934},"language":"english","review":"clusterfuck and spawnkill simulator 1642","timestamp_created":1467906754,"timestamp_updated":1467906754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24152249","author":{"steamid":"76561198131284805","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1027,"playtime_last_two_weeks":246,"playtime_at_review":28,"last_played":1660401999},"language":"russian","review":"Игра мертва. 6/10\nу игры есть понтеционал но игроков нет.","timestamp_created":1467879019,"timestamp_updated":1467879019,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456140369176864624","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24146384","author":{"steamid":"76561198232285016","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":327,"last_played":1470674290},"language":"english","review":"I made the biggest mistake of taking this game around the world.","timestamp_created":1467850262,"timestamp_updated":1467850262,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw37Cs4dUCcJ2OXA=="}
