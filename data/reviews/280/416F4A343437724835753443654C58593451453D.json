This automated train is provided for the security and convenience of the Black Mesa Research Facility personnel. The time is 08:47 AM. Current topside temperature is 93 degrees, with an estimated high of one hundred and five. The Black Mesa compound is maintained at a pleasant 68 degrees at all times. This train is inbound from Level 3 Dormitories to Sector C Test Labs and Control Facilities. If your intended destination is a high-security area beyond Sector C, you will need to return to the Central Transit Hub in Area 9 and board a high security train. If you have not yet submitted your identity to the retinal clearance system, you must report to Black Mesa Personnel for processing before you will be permitted into the high security branch of the transit system. Due to the high toxicity of material routinely handled in the Black Mesa compound, no smoking, eating, or drinking are permitted within the Black Mesa Transit System. Please keep your limbs inside the train at all times. Do not attempt to open the doors until the train has come to a complete halt at the station platform. In the event of an emergency, passengers are to remain seated and await further instruction. If it is necessary to exit the train, disabled personnel should be evacuated first. Please stay away from electrified rails, and proceed to an emergency station until assistance arrives. A reminder that the Black Mesa Hazard Course decathlon will commence this evening at nineteen hundred hours in the Level 3 Facility. The semifinals for high-security personnel will be announced in a separate Secure Access transmission. Remember, more lives than your own may depend on your fitness. Do you have a friend or relative who would make a valuable addition to the Black Mesa team? Immediate openings are available in the areas of Materials Handling and Low-Clearance Security. Please contact Black Mesa Personnel for further information. If you have an associate with a background in the areas of theoretical physics, biotechnology or other high tech disciplines, please contact our Civilian Recruitment Division.

The process of finding and fixing bugs is termed \"debugging\" and often uses formal techniques or tools to pinpoint bugs, and since the 1950s, some computer systems have been designed to also deter, detect or auto-correct various computer bugs during operations.\n\nMost bugs arise from mistakes and errors made in either a program's source code or its design, or in components and operating systems used by such programs. A few are caused by compilers producing incorrect code. A program that contains many bugs, and/or bugs that seriously interfere with its functionality, is said to be buggy (defective). Bugs can trigger errors that may have ripple effects. Bugs may have subtle effects or cause the program to crash or freeze the computer. Other bugs qualify as security bugs and might, for example, enable a malicious user to bypass access controls in order to obtain unauthorized privileges.\n\nSome software bugs have been linked to disasters. Bugs in code that controlled the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine were directly responsible for patient deaths in the 1980s. In 1996, the European Space Agency's US$1 billion prototype Ariane 5 rocket had to be destroyed less than a minute after launch due to a bug in the on-board guidance computer program. In June 1994, a Royal Air Force Chinook helicopter crashed into the Mull of Kintyre, killing 29. This was initially dismissed as pilot error, but an investigation by Computer Weekly convinced a House of Lords inquiry that it may have been caused by a software bug in the aircraft's engine-control computer.[1]","timestamp_created":1575860602,"timestamp_updated":1575860602,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59534740","author":{"steamid":"76561198450765866","num_games_owned":563,"num_reviews":282,"playtime_forever":23,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1575858511},"language":"english","review":"While [i]Half-Life[/i] is a well-aged masterpiece, [i]Half-Life: Source[/i] is a useless graphics upgrade meant to steal your money.\n\nHaving recently just finished the original version of this classic, I tried out a few different parts of it in this [i]Source[/i] version to see the difference and... failed to see the reason this exists. Minimal graphic enhancement and small improvements make this a worthless purchase, playing the original is just fine on its own. If I wanted [i]Half-Life[/i] with better looking water, I would've found some free mod to improve this aspect, not bought a useless version of an already stylistically beautiful game. Although the graphics are outdated since it was released two decades ago, it doesn't mean it needed a flimsy graphical upgrade, I'd rather just purchase the upcoming [i]Black Mesa[/i], at least then it would be a real remastering of the visuals. I know this wasn't an option decades ago, but nonetheless, I would've just preferred the original. The graphical upgrade isn't always an upgrade either, faces on models can become abhorrent in this grotesque \"update\", and ruin the charm of the original models, creating an entirely new unintentional horror in a game filled with them.\n\nThe load times are by far the most infuriating part of this whole [i]Source[/i] edition of the game. They are way longer than they should be when running on a modern PC, and it slows down any sort of fluidity gained in between segments. Having a high-end computer and having load times that can take possibly over a minute is beyond ridiculous, and nails the coffin shut on this awful experience.\n\nIf you are trying to decide which version to play this game in, I highly recommend the original. Though slightly graphically inferior, overall it will be more graphically consistent and you won't get a buggy embarrassment like [i]Half-Life: Source[/i].

It actually is just more of a rebuild, nothing is really remastered at all, except for the mountain scene (adds a 3d skybox) and prolly other less significatn areas. [u]Fun fact, my favourite area in Black Mesa is that lil area in the Office Complex with the brown walls and the coffee machine.[/u] So if it's _just_ a straight upgrade to a new engine, then I'm actually fairly impressed with how it looks (and feels). The textures in the world just look better, and the shinyness and 'new' lighting makes everything certainly look smoother. With the water texture and various other small upgrades, it doesn't (intentionally) disrupt the aestheic at all. In my opinion/estimation.\n\nNow the bugs! Hmm, I thought it was minimal, and that everybody was fussing about nothing. I didn't encounter any blocker bugs, but I'm sure there might be one. Hmm.

A buggy catastrophe. I had never played the original Half-Life and figured the source version would be better, but I was very foolish to think this. Many things are now absent from this that were in the original, such as extra dialogue between NPCs you could listen to like the bathroom conversation. NPCs that take damage will continuously play pain sounds until they drive you insane.

Unfortunately, despite its name, this isn't so much a \"Source\" version of Half-Life, but rather just a shinier version of the original iteration. There is no reason to pick this over the original 1998 Half-Life, and let me explain why. \nThe fact that the game is hardly any different-looking to its predecessor is the worst part - textures haven't changed a bit, the voice lines are still fuzzy-sounding and muffled... even some explosions have that icky 2-D look to them. For a \"Source\" game it really is just a slightly enhanced Goldsource game. Even the soundtrack is partially missing because all the loading screens snuff them out before they can even begin, and this game has LOTS of loads. Example: in the chapter \"We've Got Hostiles\" you'll step into a lift that will take you up to a bad-ass fight scene with your first soldier enemies. Well, the music is stopped dead in its tracks when the loading screen hits. Seriously? They couldn't amend that?\nEven with H.D models enabled, the game just isn't different enough. If there's one thing that saves this game (yes, ONE thing) it's the inclusion of rag-doll physics. Smashing your crowbar into an unsuspecting scientist's face and watching them fall to the floor like a bag of sugar never gets old. And that's really it. \nNot to mention, even if you haven't played Half-Life before, and will gladly go for the Source version, the expansion packs were never given the same \"treatment\". On Steam, both Opposing Force and Blue Shift are Goldsource games. So why play this one game on a very wonky (and early) Source engine? \nOh, and you probably saw this coming, but Half-Life: Source is incredibly broken. Fans have speculated that the game was merely an experiment by Valve to see how well Source mods could translate from Goldsource games, and I actually don't doubt this theory. The tongues on the barnacle aliens are basically invisible, the hit-boxes are completely messed up (I dare you to try and shoot down ONE enemy helicopter in this game), the A.I for enemies and companions is all wonkier now and gun \"idle\" animations are tediously repetitive. \nAnd I have no idea what Valve bonehead was in charge of this project, but I'd like to know who thought it was a good idea to put a doorknob sound effect to signify that the floor is about to collapse.  \nOne of the more less-talked-about screw-ups in this game is the dreaded Blast Pit screen on the main menu. If you're unlucky enough to be given this menu when starting up the game, enjoy the sound of constant rapid gunfire as the tentacle monsters try to slam continuously into the invincible security guard on the landing. Have fun, headphone users! You can't make this up. \nSo if I haven't made it clear enough already, MAYBE just stick to the 1998 version. If it's a \"modern\" experience you're after, just go play the fan-made mod Black Mesa. It is a thousand times better than this port, and a million times more respectable.","timestamp_created":1575423580,"timestamp_updated":1630454551,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524471044540405273","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59183553","author":{"steamid":"76561198051664537","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1576289121},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito bom, sou fã de toda a franquia é um jogo que realmente marcou a história dos games","timestamp_created":1575421674,"timestamp_updated":1575421674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59181595","author":{"steamid":"76561198113505666","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":636,"last_played":1578093917},"language":"english","review":"kinda boring at times and i had to force myself to finish but its not bad","timestamp_created":1575419077,"timestamp_updated":1575419077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505277037620544434","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59172990","author":{"steamid":"76561198879071048","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2621,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2355,"last_played":1656305841},"language":"english","review":"it fun to mess around","timestamp_created":1575409039,"timestamp_updated":1575409039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59164652","author":{"steamid":"76561198148336650","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":539,"last_played":1598220220},"language":"english","review":"this game is poop because the L is in it","timestamp_created":1575400499,"timestamp_updated":1575400499,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59163480","author":{"steamid":"76561198179767537","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":346,"last_played":1575399276},"language":"english","review":"Takes me back to good old days.","timestamp_created":1575399315,"timestamp_updated":1575399315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ447rH5u4CeLXY4QE="}
