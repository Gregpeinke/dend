Il y aussi 5 modes de difficulté dont les derniers donneront du fil à retordre aux plus aguerris.\n\n- Gameplay : accrocheur, pleins d'armes pour une grande diversité, le seul reproche est au niveau du corps à corps qui est difficile à prendre en main au début contrairement aux phases de shoot.\n\n- Graphismes : un peu ternes et vieillot c'est vrai mais n'oublions pas que c'est l'Unreal Engine 2 modifié !

You'll find out why at the end of this review.\n\nThere is a large selection of weapons, which is for some ridiculously rare regarding zombie games. However, you will likely never use most of those guns as you will quickly find out which ones are the best and then only use those. There are multiple classes to choose from, and leveling them up gives some motivation to continue, but with the improvements being nearly all percentage boosts, it just seems lazy and kind of pointless. There are multiple difficulty levels, but they feel more like they were designed to be played as your class level increased as opposed to actually wanting a different level of difficulty. Plenty of characters to choose from, but only the paid DLC characters are different in any way other than textures. There are multiple enemy types, but they all seem like lazy grab-bag stereotypes (Fat exploder, invisible, slightly stronger than normal red guy, really big guy.) The only one that seems creative in any way is the siren, which messes up your aim. The modding community is pretty good though, and bad mods can't be counted against the game.\n\nAs you can see, nearly every positive part of the game also has downsides. So how could this be rated positive while there are still negative aspects to cover? Well, the game is fun in multiplayer. Get a few friends together and you can have fun for hours. Even playing with random people isn't that bad.\n\nNow, for the completely negative... The DLC. There is tons of DLC, and nearly all of it is useless. You're probably now thinking \"Well, I just won't buy it.\" The developers thought of that too. When starting a game, a painfully loud advertisement for the new DLC will play. Aside from horrible bussiness tactics, the voice acting is terrible and the wait time for starting a new round is a minute of constant boredom. \n\nI would still recommend getting this game. You will probably want to wait for a sale, and make sure you have friends.","timestamp_created":1393890481,"timestamp_updated":1393890481,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9335463","author":{"steamid":"76561197991001931","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":74652,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34402,"last_played":1652477113},"language":"russian","review":"Достоинства: Отличный магазин, акций, а также синхронизация.\nНедостатки: Если вы любитель графики, она не для вас.\nИграя Killing Floor вы погружаетесь в атмосферу, зайдя на пару минут, вы выйдете максимум только через пару часов, так как если играя один, ты получаешь много положительных эмоций, а если играть с друзьями то в два раза больше!

Each wave is seperated by a brief downtime period during which players use money earned from kills to buy new weapons.\nThere is a boss called the Patriarch who shows up in the final round and can be very difficult to beat on the harder game difficulties.\nThe players character has a number of battle roles called 'perks' (for some inexplicable reason) As the player achieves certain tasks relating to each 'Perk' they will raise that perk in level, as each perk raises in level it will increase the overall strength of your character and eventually (at level 5) will unlock starting bonus's like weapons or armour that you otherwise would not have access to on the first round of play. Players are required to choose a perk before playing a game and also have the option of changing perks after death (During an actual game ie: inbetween rounds while waiting and spectating -like in any other fps ) The choice of perk prior to entering combat will determine which set of specific perk related bonus's you will be using during that game, ie: Commando perk gives you percentage bonus's on using assault and combat rifles whereas a Berserker will get bonus's to melee related combat and movement speed.\nThis is not Call of duty, If you want that game look elsewhere and also have your I.Q checked because you are probably re-tarded.\nAwesome addictive fun with a good gentle learning curve (for those familiar with FPS games)\n.\nHighly recommend it to anyone who enjoys games like Left4Dead or Counterstrike.","timestamp_created":1393643736,"timestamp_updated":1393643930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9298688","author":{"steamid":"76561197972132272","num_games_owned":797,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":19276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18676,"last_played":1547383562},"language":"english","review":"Its ok.","timestamp_created":1393641396,"timestamp_updated":1393641396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9298205","author":{"steamid":"76561198107317573","num_games_owned":503,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":510535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5366,"last_played":1629543817},"language":"english","review":"If you want a AWESOME Co-op Survival Horror then Killing Floor is the perfect game for you.

Its hard to recomend it outright, because its a shitty game. But its one of those shitty games that keeps dragging you back into it.\n\nDo I recomend it? Yeah, I suppose so. Over 1000 hours I'd better recomend it. Is it for everyone? No, its not. Its kinda of a cult hit. Most people will get it when its on sale, play a few games of it, and then never touch it again. Others will play it for a few hours, and come back in a few months. But everyone that you see playing Killing Floor year round (not during the holiday events) is a true Killing Floor player.\n\nSo, pros? Well..\n-Its got a great modding community; the workshop, Tripwire Interactive forums, and many other sites host great mods and maps, which add to the game.\n-Great players; on the whole, most players are pretty good. There are some aimbotters that get away with it, some rude people, trolls, the usual. But most people tend to be pretty good.\n-Modded servers; this is what really gives the game value. Modded servers are the main reason that anyone even plays this game anymore. Without them, this game would be retired.\n-Lots of custom weapons, skins, and specimens; keeps the game interesting.\n\nCons? Yeah, theres a bunch..\n-First of all, this game is ancient. Its a mod for Unreal Tournament 2004, using the Unreal 2 engine. So there are some major engine bugs. \n-Crashes; since its an old game and older engine, the game has trouble handling more than 2gb of ram. On modded servers, often the clients will crash because the engine wasn't meant to handle this. Happens on regular servers too.\n-Server limitations; dedicated servers have some pretty bad limitations on what you can and can't do. There's a general limit to how many files the server can load at one time, if you exceed that, then the server will hang. \n-The server also hangs if a weapon/mutator gets added that isn't compatible with a certain map or game mode, thus rendering the server unusable until the admin fixes it.\n-The voice acting is bad. Like, at first, you're going to think its awful voice acting. 1000 hours later, you want to shoot the voice actors for the obnoxious game speech.\n-The DLC weapons are community weapons, reskinned and sold by TWI. The player skins are nothing to write home about.\n-Frameloss; the game engine can't adequatly handle the game itself, and even in a regular solo game, your FPS can go from 100 to 5. Online games? Ha, good luck. Try turning off ambient lighting.\n\n-Tripwire doesn't actually fix anything. They push out updates every holiday, maybe a new character skin or map, but thats it. They make intentional changes to break mods and just generally do nothing productive. No fixes to the engine, the gameplay, the menu system, nothing.\n\nWhat DOES tripwire do, though? Break things. Break all the things. This past winter event, they broke the workshop, so every time you launched the game, Steam would download your workshop content. Again. And again. And again. I had 75GB of temporary files that kept increasing in size. It took Tripwire a month to push out a fix for it. An ever-growing list of things they broke~\n\nThe only reason this game is still alive is because of the modding community and the admins of modded servers. They are the ONLY reason this game is still alive, still being played. And even still, there is no point to this game. This is just a wave based survival game, with the same specimens coming at you, the same bad guns, and the same awful voice acting, over and over. \n\nKilling Floor is nothing without the mods. Killing Floor would be better without Tripwire Interactive. There needs to be a Killing Floor 2, or a Killing Floor HD Edition, with-AT THE VERY LEAST- a new game engine, maybe something from the same decade the game was made in.","timestamp_created":1393559598,"timestamp_updated":1393559598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.595959603786468506","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9286311","author":{"steamid":"76561197990553186","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":54812,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":42282,"last_played":1492138352},"language":"english","review":"An instant zombie classic. This game brought me together with many friends and introduced me to many other awesome gamers who like to kill zombies. Games can range from short - long, lasting 4 waves - 10 waves, with a Patriarch boss getting his own wave at the end. Similar to L4D, except gameplay is wave based not objective based. However there is an objective play mode with a few maps that are fun as well. \n\nFrom your basic zombie (referred to as ZEDs in this game) to the intimidating Fleshpound and Scrake, there are many different special zombie types who will all try to eat you in different ways.\n\nThere are 7 perk types to play as, from the melee Berserker, to the Medic, to the Sharpshooter, there is likely a class you will really enjoy playing.\n\nPlay solo or with a group up to 6, and on custom servers upwards of 30 players on one server.\n\nMany players have created custom maps or objective modes that are unique and fun to play, aside from the 30~ish regular maps, if you like killing zombies, this game can get addicting. \n\nThere are 5 difficulty levels, and starting out you really should play on 1/5 - Beginner, because as you level your perks (which level to 6 ((higher on custom servers))) you will become stronger with those weapon types and gain necessary benefits to damage and survival that you need to have for higher difficulties.\n\nAfter 700~ hours, I've completed all but a handful of maps on 4/5 diff - Suicidal. It's extremely challenging and 5/5 diff is even more ridiculous. If you're good at FPS you will get the hang of it, but like any game, this one in particular takes time and practice.\n\nA great game to play with friends as well, the more perk types your team can cover the better chances you have of surviving, although it is possible to solo most difficulties with any perk, some are more challenging than others. Each perk has a role that they perform and zombies they should focus on taking out, teamwork is key and if you are a lone wolf you can stick with solo.\n\nStill fun after years of playing it.

Y'know, you've got a bit of dosh left over from that one game you've waited to come on sale for a year. Killing Floor - Get together with some friends or some randoms, kill zombies and maybe even kill the Patriarch. Level up some perks and you will feel such a sense of achievement that you dedicated so much time to this. Now that I have possibly got you interested, I shall add my views on the game...\n\nThe immersion factor is really good as the game has a rather dark basis and uses moderately graphic themes, but DAMN are they amazing!!! Sometimes you will enter a room and find a scientist who has been torn up just inches from an alarm, leaving you to imagine what had happened. Perhaps there will be a soldier, surrounded in shell casings from the gun now lying beside him which he had used to make his valiant last stand this game can tell a whole range of stories without even using words or text. The graphics are stunning and have very low requirements to be played at optimal capacity. There are a great range of enemies and the game spawns them well so you aren't constantly battling the same enemy. There is an excellent variation between classes in order to match everyones play style. Of course the weapons are a key feature in this game and my oh my, what is this, a chainsaw? Don't mind if I do, a crossbow? Well cheers, and a whole lot more, honestly, if you want it, this game probably has it. If it doesn't then it will probably have some well priced DLC to satisfy you... The game features brilliant voice acting and a nice amount of stock playable characters. There are DLC characters aswell, from everything to a Cyborg Chicken to your average Chav, both stock and DLC characters have unique and comedic backstories too. The game makes the apocalypse a gleeful place for all, except the wave upon wave of cretins you bruttally murder by any means. The game makes use of both blatant and subtle comedy, making it hilarious when you are treated to some good old English stereotyping for dialogue. The game supports Steam workshop and also has an active community that submit ideas for DLC's! Forget bang for your buck, this game gives you BOOM! POW! SMACK! all for an amazing price. Is this game worth the money, money, money? HELL YEAH!!! This game gets 11/10 from me and my friends and I hope you have an equally epic experience.
