It felt like it was too short and very small. All of the puzzle areas are either very easy or they are scripted sequences. Of course the other games had these as well, but that's all Blue Shift has; and I don't know, I might just be dumb, but a lot of these scripted scenes felt very obtrusive here. The worst one was having to circle around to where you started in an area and wait for a door to get burned through and kicked down.\n\nThe combat was also nowhere near on par with base Half Life, much less Opposing Forces. Your selection of weapons is pretty limited, you hardly have to fight anything more complex than a soldier, there are no boss encounters, and there's never a point where you have people help you out in a fire fight.\n\nThe story was also pretty disappointing. In the beginning it was just \"escape Black Mesa\", much like Half Life. But unlike Half Life, the story does not evolve as time progresses. Everyone just wants you dead because \"orders\", and you make it out easily in the end. In Half Life, your motivation slowly shifts from \"I have to escape\" to \"I have to end this problem\"; and this is done very naturally through the story.\n\nAll in all, very disappointing and It

Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.\n\nAnyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?","timestamp_created":1638029134,"timestamp_updated":1638029134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104267223","author":{"steamid":"76561198990911549","num_games_owned":554,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":342,"last_played":1637986609},"language":"english","review":"An interesting addition to the Half-Life collection.

think this only has value if you are a fan of Half-Life, this is just more Half-Life 1, its diet coke Half-Life 1, the game has none of the weapons added in Opposing Force, in fact it has 3 less than base Half-Life 1, there are more graphical/sound glitches for some reason, there are far less set pieces and much less interesting ones, and the thing never escalates, im pretty sure i killed like 3 Alien Grunts total in the entire game, i didnt even use the rocket launcher once because it was honestly overkill\n\nSpoilers:\n\n[spoiler]you know what the final fight was? 2 houndeyes and like 5 HECU Marines[/spoiler]\n\nman, this game is EASY, and short, took me less than 3 hours to finish, also padded towards the end\n\nbasically, you buy this to shoot a bit more with HL1 mechanics and to get a little bit more of the story of Half-Life, and to its credit, the game accomplishes that","timestamp_created":1637546518,"timestamp_updated":1637546518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575808346271514893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"103247502","author":{"steamid":"76561199194062048","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":123,"last_played":1640321805},"language":"english","review":"gud","timestamp_created":1637545838,"timestamp_updated":1637545838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw29DVov0CfujtiQM="}
