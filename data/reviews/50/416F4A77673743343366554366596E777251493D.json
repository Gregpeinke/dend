Back then, you actually had to have that orange disk to play regular old Half Life; you know, the one that opened with Sierra's logo in space? Then from there I got hooked on Opposing Force, and then Blue Shift. It wasn't until much later into my early adolescent years that I discovered Counter Strike.\n\nAnyways, these games were always a blast to play. Blowing up aliens, the mercenaries, and the assassins and then watching their gibs fly everywhere was always a hoot for me. I loved the fact that they introduced the \"next stage of mutation\" zombie where they throw their own blood at you. I loved having a heavy crowbar, a regular crowbar, and a knife. Plus, in general, all the newer weapons. This game is addicting and I'll play this game to kill a couple hours before returning to working. 10/10","timestamp_created":1606186501,"timestamp_updated":1606186501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586991846561431885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79734710","author":{"steamid":"76561198982793046","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":404,"last_played":1640052313},"language":"english","review":"It exists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy product","timestamp_created":1606182620,"timestamp_updated":1615238258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79729559","author":{"steamid":"76561199018322513","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1624115695},"language":"english","review":"fix the dang mouse glich","timestamp_created":1606171422,"timestamp_updated":1606171422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79723137","author":{"steamid":"76561198968660353","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":674,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1609877162},"language":"russian","review":"–∏–≥—Ä–∞ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω—è—á–æ–∫,—Å–≤–æ–∏—Ö –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥ —Å—Ç–æ–∏—Ç,–Ω–æ –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ –±—ã –Ω–µ –æ—Ç–¥–∞–ª.","timestamp_created":1606160636,"timestamp_updated":1606160636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541607916355133057","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79722142","author":{"steamid":"76561198202505512","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1606744016},"language":"russian","review":"cool!","timestamp_created":1606159155,"timestamp_updated":1606559888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79717223","author":{"steamid":"76561197996221792","num_games_owned":520,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":284,"last_played":1606151659},"language":"german","review":"great memories.

I took to Reddit to talk about my problem and turns out HL-Source just isn't a good way to experience the HL games. So with a whole free weekend to myself I decided to play-through Opposing Force and Blue Shift and here is what I think...\n\nThe original Half Life felt linear and bland. I found myself running round the same old places, with the same old walls, doing the same button puzzles, killing the same overpowered enemies and it bored me very fast. Opposing Force wastes no time taking me from the surface into sewers and train tracks and awesome places I wish I had seen in Source. It wasted no time throwing me into the action and showing me entirely new and different parts of Mesa. Although, I feel like the shortness of this game prevents it from becoming repetitive in its scenery like Source did and the game plays this to its strength more often than not giving you more powerful weapons so you don't feel weaker than the enemies. That's an area that Opposing Force gets creative in,  its weapons. Opposing Force contains a reasonable amount of weapons and a nice bit more than Source, there's a grappling hook (kinda) for crying out loud! In all seriousness I did very much enjoy my large choice of weaponry and ammo was never really at a shortage allowing me to mess around and take the big guns to every fight. \n\nAll this isn't to say HL-Opposing Force doesn't have its short comings though. For example the story is lacklustre. There's no real character development or even characters that you want to survive enough to fight for it. You play as Shepard, a commander of a small platoon who is taken to the Mesa Facility believing it is nothing more than a training mission or a simple gig and they'll be home in time for dinner. I feel like you can only respect this plot if you know the story of HL1/Source, as if you remember the events of the first game your fighting these guys who basically no nothing more than 'shoot freeman, shoot anything' which just goes to show how dark the lore really is. These soldiers were just as scared and unprepared for the events of the Mesa Incident than you were. They weren't even told what they were going to face and many lost their lives because of it. Apart from this the only real story in the game is the radios jotted round the facility. Most levels and paths will lead you and they just inform you of how your fellow soldiers are doing and where they are. More often or not you have to go and provide backup which sets you in an entirely different place where you have to make progress on trying to escape.\n\nPros: Alright story, Not too long or repetitive, Doesn't feel unfair, little to no bugs and glitches, very fun to play-through \n\nCons: Lacklustre story with unmemorable characters, guns can feel very inaccurate and instead of hitting headshots your shooting the wall. \n\nTo conclude, Half Life Opposing Force is a great, quick little game which delivers great scenery and level design, fills you in on the HL lore and a blast to play-through and a steal for its price. \n\n8.7 definitely would recommend for anyone, HL fan or not...","timestamp_created":1606123849,"timestamp_updated":1606123849,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515723288059234619","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79699977","author":{"steamid":"76561198181500357","num_games_owned":459,"num_reviews":229,"playtime_forever":239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":73,"last_played":1656199784},"language":"english","review":"One of the best expansions ever made.","timestamp_created":1606122193,"timestamp_updated":1606122193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488881319761276245","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79690340","author":{"steamid":"76561198128047322","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1669,"last_played":1589658802},"language":"english","review":"This makes a strong argument for the best Half-Life game (though I have yet to play Alyx).

I think the original Half life aged incredibly well. I finished that game without needing walkthroughs, other than a glitched section with the missile selector and I loved it.\n\nHonestly I was surprised by how well it held up. Pacing, movement, environmental story. It is absolutely a game you can just hop into and enjoy in 2020. \n\nHaving loved Half Life I decided to play Opposing Force since people really seemed to be fond of it. I played and finished Opposing Force on the Hardest difficulty and completed the entire game in just under 4 hours according to Steam. Although I like to explore all parts of the gameworld so if you are going through then I could see it being finished in under 3 hours for the average gamer.\n\nI really have to say, Opposing Force is definitely the worst Half Life game I‚Äôve played and in general one of the worst non-indie games I‚Äôve played.\n\nFirst big issue I have with the game is the pacing and levels. It feels like an Alien tried to recreate Half Life from memory. There isn‚Äôt really the set up of puzzles and other exploration like there was in Half Life, and a lot of the puzzles really amount to using the grappling hook on a super obvious green spot because those are the only things the grappling hook can grab onto. Or flipping a switch, or something very basic. Never really had the Eureka moment when playing.\n\nThere is definitely more combat and less hidden areas. A lot of it really feels like combat and then loads of ammo and healing. It's very stop-start rather than a consistent drip of resources. It just feels very very sloppy. I‚Äôm not saying chapters like ‚ÄúResidue Processing‚Äù were what made Half Life 1 great, but the flow of the game, puzzles, and resource supply were really magical. It was easy to sit down and just play through the game. \n\nCombat in Opposing Force is really bad. Black ops soldiers take multiple alt-fire shotgun blasts to the head at point blank range to go down. Hit Scanners deal tons of damage so you need to be far enough to take advantage of spread or exploit AI. If you run or stand in the open you die in a few seconds so it‚Äôs not really a run and gun, more like use corners to confuse the really bad AI. Some of that is true of Half Life 1 but the level design is so much more complex so a lot of the combat felt more puzzle like and had more options, generally. Half Life combat was never that great, so having a campaign focus on it which removes a lot of the things that supported Half Life combat is pretty bad.\n\nI don‚Äôt think I remember the enemies in Half Life 1 being this spongy or having their AI be this bad. It really just feels awful to be shooting something for like 10 seconds straight just to not kill it. Almost all guns are horribly inaccurate which really makes them mesh together. The shotgun feels weak, the AR feels weak. Everything feels weak and unfun to use except explosives, portal gun, and the sniper rifle. The machine gun is OK, it deals more damage than other guns but is inaccurate and I found it more useful for increasing movement speed backwards than actually shooting people most of the time. It‚Äôs a lot more effective to run past enemies than fight them and actually not that hard to do.\n\n\nThey added a bunch of alien weapons but none of them are really interesting. A projectile gun that doesn‚Äôt need ammo. It‚Äôs like the Hivehand but worse and less cool looking. The spore launcher is a ranged explosive that bounces a bit. I don‚Äôt know why they added it in a game with a rocket launcher and grenade launcher. We don‚Äôt get the extremely distinct and separate feel that we did with the original Half Life. I mean just consider that line up, the Gluon gun was way different from the crossbow, which could be used underwater, which was way different from the MP5. \n\nProbably the only interesting gun they added was the portal gun. It shoots giant powerful blasts and the alternate fire takes you to Zen to gather resources. Each location on the map has different Zen levels associated with the alternate fire which is pretty neat.\n\n\n\n\nThere are these squad mechanics but they are a joke. Squadmates are really more cannon fodder and they can deal friendly fire which killed me a few times. Enemies still seem to focus on you and their following AI is borderline non-functional. You also can‚Äôt seem to carry them across the loading screens almost all the time. Generally I just killed them for ammo if I needed it. But sometimes the game will make you fail the mission for killing them because they were needed for scripted events.\n\n\nThe final boss fight uses Goldsource ladders and ropes. Lol it‚Äôs horrible. I have no idea what they were thinking when they made this. Horrendous design decisions and really just unenjoyable to play. The goldsource is janky when it comes to movements but jumping around in open spaces can be pretty fun. But all the confined spaces and use of ladders is honestly pathetic. It‚Äôs really bad.\n\nAlso the game is extremely buggy. I didn‚Äôt use a walkthrough for this one but I noticed doors grinded and would not open no matter what. I looked up ‚Äúdoor grinding opposing force‚Äù and of course it‚Äôs a thing. Doors just get stuck and prohibit progress. This happened to me 3 times with essential doors. Sometimes launching an explosive or jumping at it while mashing the use key works. \n\nI‚Äôve also had save files corrupt. I‚Äôve gotten stuck between level changes, a LOT. Especially a level change with a lift or vent I got stuck and had to keep loading autosaves to try to prevent it. For the vent ones try to be running at top speed before loading for the lifts try to jump before it hits the ground. I know Gearbox is infamous for making broken games, especially their horrific Halo port, but damn it‚Äôs like no one actually played this game before shipping it. But I guess I was able to finish it without using the console or anything.\n\nThis game does absolutely nothing better than Vanilla Half Life, actually it does everything worse. I would not suggest paying money for it or spending time to play it. It‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt learn anything from the original Half Life release.","timestamp_created":1606068355,"timestamp_updated":1606068355,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79666562","author":{"steamid":"76561198818781172","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1654875970},"language":"english","review":"This game is perfect play now it's worth your five bucks","timestamp_created":1606060883,"timestamp_updated":1606060883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79657529","author":{"steamid":"76561198016142506","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":474,"last_played":1603790789},"language":"english","review":"The game has aged very badly","timestamp_created":1606049148,"timestamp_updated":1606049148,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.439247012138366699","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79639404","author":{"steamid":"76561198013888555","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":785,"last_played":1606093381},"language":"english","review":"","timestamp_created":1606016344,"timestamp_updated":1606016344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79633531","author":{"steamid":"76561198180710238","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":333,"last_played":1598821022},"language":"english","review":"oops, seems like you got caught trying to cover up one of the government's many mistakes by the cover uppers of the cover up","timestamp_created":1606004991,"timestamp_updated":1637874229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79630114","author":{"steamid":"76561198841832092","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":432,"last_played":1605998862},"language":"english","review":"So its good.

It improves and adds onto the story of the original Half-Life and shows us some things that I really wish was in the original game. The addition of the entirety of Race-X is amazing, this is something that is missing from Half-Life and Half-Life Blue Shift that makes them feel incomplete (especially Blue Shift, cause that game missed out everything from Opposing Force and was too short). It makes me wish that they had added some of the different aliens from Race-X into Half-Life 2 as a way to make the universe feel complete, such as how the Vortigaunts and Headcrabs make appearances (would have loved to see some other Xen creatures in that game, along with Race-X). Also there was some kind of camera glitch that made the game a little bit annoying, so that was an unfortunate downside I have to play with.\n\nOn my first play through of the game I had a hard time with it and often had to press our little friend ~ a lot, then type \"God\". This game has a lot of parts where I feel the developers and level design team was drunk and said, \"Let's put 100 enemies in this one area, OH YEAH!!! Give them a weapon that kills them in like 5 shots and make the guns alive so they attack you when you kill the alien you just killed, then put those big guys who do too much damage in an area together, oh yeah and those spies who we only used in 1 area in the original game just place them all over in like every level!\". It was hard, and I've played DOOM games. It feels like at points you really have to fight for your life. Each movement has to be planned 5 steps ahead as to not lose your life, one wrong move and you're out. The new enemies have definitely contributed to the difficulty, with each one barraging you with bullets or fist at a moment.\n\nThe level design and puzzles are great, I found myself stuck at some points of the game. Though I don't contribute my lack of being able to do the puzzles to how hard they were, rather that I am a completely incompetent idiot who has no idea what they're doing. Though I did like exploring all the new areas of the Lamba complex as well as what it was like from the point of view from a soldier, who was the kind of person that you'd be killing in both Half-Life and Blue Shift. Though I did find that the bosses in the game (of which there are two) ranged from being stupidly annoying on your first try (pit worm) and then being too easy that you don't even need to be on God mode to beat. The rest of it felt great, I liked that we got to see what happened during and after certain events of the original game, even some things tying into the events of Blue Shift.\n\nNow I feel that the story of our military badass Shepherd has even yet to begin. As we know from this that he had helped in defusing the bomb, well obviously nothing really happened there because of the Gman, and he of course killed many of the alien invaders and sided with the scientist as he was unaware of the governments evil plans of taking down every last one. I feel that at some point in the future of Half-Life we'll get to see Shepherd again. Maybe the protagonist of Half-Life 3 along with Freeman and Alyx after the loss of Eli and the Gman realizes that they need some help (no, Half-Life: Alyx is not the long awaited Half-Life 3, it's a prequel game that nobody asked for but we got and loved. Although I do want it I also don't want to financially support the newer Valve games because of personal life things involving a terrible employ, sorry I went on a bit of a tangent there). I find that it'll be great if we can see Shepherd return as a primary character for a 3rd installment in the Half-Life series we've all been waiting for.\n\nAs for my overall rating of Half-Life: Opposing Force, I'd say it gets a solid 9.5/10, final quote, \"Just one less enemy makes a happier fan\"","timestamp_created":1605861978,"timestamp_updated":1605861978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79529032","author":{"steamid":"76561198086185573","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":344,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":309,"last_played":1606252321},"language":"english","review":"Gud.","timestamp_created":1605826232,"timestamp_updated":1605826232,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79526396","author":{"steamid":"76561199089467469","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1606797504},"language":"spanish","review":"Te odio G-Man","timestamp_created":1605821484,"timestamp_updated":1606452977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79516055","author":{"steamid":"76561198360568764","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1263,"last_played":1653101881},"language":"english","review":"I can't play it anymore but when I could it was fun.","timestamp_created":1605806132,"timestamp_updated":1605806132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79512840","author":{"steamid":"76561198385461440","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":483,"last_played":1605801001},"language":"english","review":"Very good expansion to the original game.

It's amazing how well tied together this expansion is to the original Half-Life; going into the Lamba core the moment Gordon jumps into the portal to Xen was so cool to see the first time. It's a shame Adrian Shephard didn't actually do anything that affected the story; he would have with him disarming the bomb that destroys Black Mesa towards the end of the game, but it's re-armed by The G-Man mere moments after doing so. Even still, this game is great and if you enjoyed the original game, you'll enjoy seeing it from the view of a member of the Opposing Force.","timestamp_created":1605353795,"timestamp_updated":1605353795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79226383","author":{"steamid":"76561198879903490","num_games_owned":302,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":705,"last_played":1605314540},"language":"latam","review":"Half-Life: Opossing Force es el primer spin-off del legendario Half-Life. Si bien el juego esta desarrollado por Gearbox Software en lugar de Valve, mantiene intacto el esp√≠ritu de la saga. En Opposing Force personificamos a Alan Shephard, un soldado de la unidad HECU (Hazardous Environment Combat Unit) que llega a Black Mesa mientras ocurren los eventos del Half-Life.\nLos gr√°ficos fueron mejorados respecto del juego original, lo que se nota en varios detalles de los enemigos y la decoraci√≥n de los niveles. La banda sonora vuelve a destacarse, con m√∫sica que genera una ambientaci√≥n extraordinaria en ciertas partes del juego. La jugabilidad es id√©ntica a la del primer juego, con el agregado de que hay nuevas armas, algunas de las cuales introducen mec√°nicas nuevas (como colgarse de las paredes o usar portales para viajar a Xen) y nuevos enemigos de la Raza X. Respecto a la historia, si bien Opposing Force tampoco tiene una \"narraci√≥n\" significativa, desde el comienzo del juego nos situamos cronol√≥gicamente respecto del juego original, incluyendo varias referencias a los sucesos del Half-Life y teniendo la posibilidad de recorrer secciones del juego original (incluso con una breve aparici√≥n de Gordon Freeman).\nSi te gusto el Half-Life original, Opossing Force es casi obligatorio, a pesar de tener una duraci√≥n de la mitad del primer juego.\nAl iniciar el juego puede ocurrir que el puntero del mouse se reinicie al centro de la pantalla despu√©s de mover la c√°mara (me ocurri√≥ en Half-Life y en Opossing Force). Eso se puede solucionar desde el men√∫ Opciones, opci√≥n Mouse, y activando la opci√≥n \"Raw mouse input\".","timestamp_created":1605315769,"timestamp_updated":1606768946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79218108","author":{"steamid":"76561198337421094","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":378,"last_played":1605301863},"language":"polish","review":"duzo nowych broni i przeciwnik√≥w, nawet lepsze ni≈º bs","timestamp_created":1605301955,"timestamp_updated":1605301955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79199563","author":{"steamid":"76561198991315282","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":421,"last_played":1605706312},"language":"english","review":"Classic!
