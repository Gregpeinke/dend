It is a lot of things and to get a sense of what Half_life is all about, you really have to play the game for yourself. That being said, it is one of the greatest games I have ever played. There are some points where it is difficult to figure out what to do, but that is part of the fun. If you want a click and shoot game, go play Call of Duty. Half-Life is like one great adventure that you can relive over and over again. It is the first game in what can only be described as an epic. The graphics are a bit dated but don't let that stop you from purchasing the game (besides, it is only 99 cents on sale).

И в честь юбилея серии я решил таки пройти первую часть. Узнать с чего же все начиналось. И могу с уверенностью сказать, что проверку временем игра для меня прошла. Играется очень бодро. Быстрый, в меру сложный шутер от первого лица с добавлением простеньких физических головоломок. Уже в то время в Half-life имелся интригующий сюжет, который хоть и кажется немного простоватым на фоне второй части, но все равно заставлял задумываться  о некоторых вещах. В основном для меня вся интрига держалась на G-manе(историю которого мы похоже так никогда и не узнаем).\nСаундтрек определенно заслуживает внимания. У меня в определенный момент забегали мурашки, когда я услышал мелодию, которая теперь украшает вступительный логотип Valve. Периодически начинает играть динамичное техно. И оно практически так же прекрасно, как и саунд к ремейку Doom.\nВ игре имеется богатый набор противников и орудий их умерщвления. Особенно радуют старые добрые хэдкрабы и ультразвуковые песики.\nНе хочу показаться занудой, но сейчас такого уже действительно не делают. Переплюнуть в ламповости и разнообразии Half-life смогли лишь немногие шутеры (в основном с этой задачей лучше всего справился сиквел). Это очень приятная и с душой сделанная игра. Надеюсь, что Valve когда-нибудь вернется к разработке полноценных игр и мы увидим подобные шедевры еще раз\n10/10","timestamp_created":1518972030,"timestamp_updated":1518972030,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40196345","author":{"steamid":"76561198110121578","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":232,"last_played":1515034360},"language":"koreana","review":"어라?

It's far from being the best game ever made, but for his time, it was pretty good tho.\n\nGraphics 12/20 : With the graphic update it looks ok, it's very good for 1998.\nGameplay 15/20 : Environnement hitbox is a bit random, but there are a lot of cool weapons. Level design is great.\nAI 10/20 : Ennemies are dumb. It helps when you want to finish the game in difficulty level, but I'im pretty sure some games if its era did better.\nSoundtrack 12/20 : Pretty cool, get you in the mood of firing at E.T. and soldiers.\nStoryline 16/20 : It feels very empty in the middle of the game, but the beginning and the end are pretty catchy, you want to know more about half-life's universe.\n\nOverall 14/20 : For 10-15 hours of game, it's worth it, great game, with a cool storyline, really deserves a try !

I thought that the flashlight actually drained from your suit's enery rather than it's own energy which recharges automatically. The reason I thout this was because, during the tutorial, the game said it \"Drains power\" so be sure to turn it off. That, plus the fact that suit energy items were introduced just before and during the flashlight tutorial sewgment lead me to believe it used suit power, so my mistake..........flashlight is still crappy though.\n\n-there's some glitches that I experienced, some more than once. For instance, when transitioning from one level to another, I ended up in this pitch black room with a table and no way of doing anything. no idea why. but I was stuck unil I reloaded and traid again twice before it transitioned me to the next level.\n Another time I got stuck in a pipe while crawling through to another area as soon as the new area loads, cause I was off center while crawling through, again, had to reload just before and do it again three time before it worked right. Did I mention how great quicksave is?\n\nNow for the positives\n+everything else\n\nwell, that was quick.\nReally, despite the negatives I listed, the game is solidly made, with engaging gameplay and story and a variety of enemies and obstacles to face, with plenty of different weapons to face them. It's a very absorbing experience, and I'd strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys old-school shooters and sci-fi games.\n\nMy only other niggle, and this is controversial for me, is that tha game has a tendency of not making pathes and objectives clear. Now I myself didn't need any help beating the game and hardly got stuck for more than a few minutes at any point, but I can see where some people may get turned around, or have no idea how to progress further. Nothing is mapped out for you. There's not objective markers, no HUD map, and no clearly marked interactables. you need to figure out how to progress with what NPCs tell you, and with the knowledge at hand.\n\n On the one hand, this gives a great sense of organic exploration and makes the environments feel more open, but on the other hand, again, I can see where another person might get stuck for a while, not knowing what to do or how to progress.

Life was always a game I heard about that everyone told me was great, but when they told me what it was like it didn't sound special, so years later when I finally got the chance to play it I was expecting a very generic fps with basic level design, I was wrong, and I'm happy I was wrong, I now truly see why this is considered one of the best games ever made, I enjoyed every second of this game, even the parts that frustrated me to no end.\n\nThings I liked about the game\n#1 A.I., the A.I. impressed me the most, enemies werent just the plain generic idiots most games at the time, they would try to get the advantage and position themselves around you, the would go behind cover then throw grenades from an area that wasn't in your view to do major damage or kill you instantly, basically the A.I. is damn good.\n\n#2 No cutscenes, the lack of any cutscenes was great, I really liked that the entire story was told in this way, I really haven't encountered many games that do this but I overall think more should do this as it makes the imersion better.\n\n#3 Level design, the level design was good, it could've been better and its mostly because you spend most of the time in very basic looking labs with the occasional puzzle, but what I did like was that every area was very open, you could explore every inch and find weapons, ammo, health packs, and they could lead to an advantage point above the enemy.\n\n#4 Weapon variety, there were more weapons in the game than I thought I knew there was the pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, and grenades, but finding the energy guns, magnum, and crossbow was not what I thought was in the game, I loved having a wide range of weapons to choose from.\n\n#5 Story, the story was slow at first but as it went on to were the military was trying to take you and every employee out from Black Mesa, to finding out why the G Man was stalking you, the story was overall pretty damn good\n\n#6 Graphics, for a game as old as this one it looks amazing, thats all I have to say about the graphics.\n\n#7 Bosses, I know there wasnt alot of boss fights but for the ones that were there they were tough and and that feeling of pleasure after you kill on is the best thing feeling of all time.\n\n8# Challenge, this game starts off very easy and I loved that with each new chapter it gets tougher and more challenging, I know thats what games are supposed to do, but this was perfectly done, you were always well prepared for whatever was coming your way.\n\n#9 Music, the music was amazing, when you get into a fire fight it kicked it up and pumped you up, and when it wanted to fill you with wonder it was able to make it possible with little effort.\n\nAnd now for the things I didnt like\n\n1# The control, I honestly feel like the control was floaty and slippery, I could just suck at the game, but I honestly died more times from falling off a ledge or over shooting a jump, but to be fair by the end of the game you have basically master the controls and don't notice them any more, they feel natural.\n\nAnd there you have it my thoughts on Half Life, would I recommend this game yes I would, this was better than I thought it would be, it did make me mad and frustrated but never to the point to were I wanted to stop playing, I enjoyed every moment, and wish this was one of the games from my childhood, I would've loved this back then like I do now.","timestamp_created":1518677858,"timestamp_updated":1518678599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40091900","author":{"steamid":"76561198812789959","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":363,"last_played":1518827481},"language":"spanish","review":"Una

1[/h1]\n\nCóż mogę powiedzieć. Legendarny klasyk, który zrewolucjonizował w 1998 gatunek FPS ze względu na prowadzenie narracji. Mam nadzieję że nie muszę nikomu tej gry szczegółowo przedstawiać i każdy wie kto to Gordon Freeman i czym jest jego ulubione narzędzie zagłady.\n\nFabuła w dużym uproszczeniu dzieje się w kompleksie Black Mesa Research Facility, gdzie dochodzi do kaskady rezonansowej, czyli nieudanego eksperymentu na krysztale z obcego wymiaru, który spowodował rozdarcie czasoprzestrzeni i przenikanie naszego świata z innym o nazwie Xen. Gordon Freeman przemierza długie kilometry Black Mesy, aby dostać się do obcego świata, by zwalczyć pewną sympatyczną istotę, która podtrzymuje to połączenie z naszym wymiarem.\n\nBez wątpienia główną zaletą tej gry są jej mroczny, niepokojący klimat oraz różnorodność. Gra wcale nie wygląda mrocznie, ale wciąż czuć niebezpieczeństwo z każdej strony, co jest genialne. Naszymi wrogami jest wiele rodzajów kosmitów ze świata Xen oraz żołnierze, którzy zostali wysłani do BMRF, aby pozbyć się świadków tego okropnego zdarzenia i wymordować kosmitów. Niestety... im nie pykło. Inteligencja żołnierzy jest naprawdę imponująca, a już nawet nie porównam do tego tej głupiej ochrony cywilnej z Half-Life 2, za którym no nie przepadam. Jak na boomerowego shootera mamy również bogaty, bez żadnych ograniczeń w użytkowaniu arsenał składający się z 12 broni, w tym z ikonicznego łomu. Model strzelania jakoś dvpy nie urywa, w Quake 1 był znacznie lepszy, ale nie ma tragedii.\n\nNastępną zaletą niewątpliwie jest długość. Gra jest podzielona 19, tak naprawdę 17 rozdziałów, ponieważ jeden to wprowadzenie, a drugi to creditsy. Mapy może i są już dzisiaj bardzo kanciaste, ale wciąż mają niepowtarzalny zarąbisty design i klimatyczne oświetlenie, którego na próżno dzisiaj szukać w FPS'ach. O ile z rozdziałami dziejącymi się na Ziemi jest wszystko ok, to moment gry kiedy trafiamy na Xen jest kompletnie bez sensu. Dobra pierwszy i drugi rozdział na Xenie jest jeszcze w miarę, ale kiedy zaczyna się Interloper wszystko traci sens. Poziom trudności jest totalnie niezbalansowany i wszędzie latają te debilne controllery, które mega irytują. I od razu mówię żeby nie było że marudzę: Po latach sam Gabe Newell przyznał że te końcowe rozdziały to gigantyczne nieporozumienie i kpina oraz były robione w pośpiechu. Natomiast to co odwalili fani z Xenem w remake'u HL1 - Black Mesa - zasługuje wręcz na jakąś gamingową nagrodę Nobla. Ale o tym nie tutaj.\n\nZ mniejszych rzeczy muzyka, która bardzo pasuje do klimatu gry i sytuacji dziejącej się aktualnie na ekranie. Szkoda tylko, że po zginięciu lub wczytaniu zapisu automatycznie się ona kończy i nic nie słychać. Oraz cieszy mnie to, że to chyba jeden z nielicznych starych FPS'ów od razu przystosowany do dzisiejszych komputerów. Nie trzeba się bawić w żadne nowe silniki itp. Wszystko od razu działa.\n\nPodsumowując Half-Life 1, jest to obowiązek każdego fana boomerowych shooterów. Niestety jednak obawiam się, że jeśli nigdy nie grałeś w takie gry, takie coś może ci się nie spodobać. W takim razie lepiej kup Black Mesę, czyli wcześniej wspomniany remake HL1.
