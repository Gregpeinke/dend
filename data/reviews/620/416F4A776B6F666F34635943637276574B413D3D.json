Das Spiel fürs Köpfchen schlecht hin.\n\nWer Portal schon mochte, wird hier überwältigt sein..\n\nFür alle die Portal nicht kennen: Portal 2 ist ein Spiel, welches viel Grips fordert.\n\n Zu Beginn des Spiels erhalten wir eine so genannte Portal-Gun, mit der wir 2 Portale erzeugen können, welche mit einander verbunden sind. Wenn wir beide erzeugt haben ist es uns möglich, hindurchzuschreiten.\n\nWir befinden uns tief unter der Erde in der Aperture Science Anlage. Dort werden wir von einer Testkammer in die nächste gejagt. In jeder Testkammer ist es unser Ziel, sich den Weg zum Ausgang zu bahnen, doch leider ist dieser meißt nur schwer zu erreichen oder blockiert. Mit unserer Portal-Gun gelangen wir auf erhöhte Plattformen oder auf die andere Seite eines Abgrundes, wo wir ein Knöpfchen betätigen können, der uns zu unserem Ziel ein Stück näher bringt.\n\nNun zum Fazit:\n\nGraphisch gesehen macht Portal 2 immer noch gut was her. Die liebevoll gestalteten Testkammern und andere Orte geben dem Spieler einen Einblick in die Geschichte Portals. Die Kombination von Texturen, Handlung und Musik ist perfekt abgestimmt. \n\nDie Musik düdelt nicht einfach nur im Hintergrund rum. Oftmals ist es auch einfach nur so still, dass man seine eigenen Schritte hören kann. Wenn aber dann mal die Musik einsetzt, dann wird man aufeinmal Hellwach. In gefährlichen \nSituationen greift sie einem fast schon Mental unter die Arme.\n\nDie Story ist im gegensatz zu Portal  (welche mich aufgrund ihrer kurzen Spielzeit sehr demotiviert hat) sehr gut gelungen und in Szene gesetzt. Je nachdem wie gut man ist, kann man die Story innerhalb mehrer Stunden durchspielen. Die hoffnungslosen Fälle unter uns, werden das fantastische Finale warscheinlich nie erreichen.\n\nNeben der ser mitreißenden und interessanten Story gibt es auch noch den COOP-Abschnitt, wo ihr dann zusammen mit einem Freund noch mehr Test-Kammern bewältigen könnt. Auch ist es möglich sich durch den Steam-Workshop Usermaps zu holen, die wirklich jeden Wunsch berücksichtigen kann.\n\nZusammenfassend:\n\nPortal 2 überzeugt in jeder hinsicht. Die 20 € für dieses Spiel sind sehr gut angelegtest Geld und durch den COOP und den Steam-Workshop hat es einen großen Wiederspielwert. Ich empfehle es jedem, der Rätselspiele mag oder einfach im COOP was zu lachen braucht. Ich meine wenn einer Versagt ist es nicht so lustig als wenn 2 Leute versagen!\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1403476412,"timestamp_updated":1403476412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10685894","author":{"steamid":"76561198077390376","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":856,"last_played":1407446161},"language":"english","review":"Fun, Funny and at some points slightly difficult and challenging but a great game nun the less","timestamp_created":1403476322,"timestamp_updated":1403476322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10685718","author":{"steamid":"76561198092329841","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":654,"last_played":1388508273},"language":"spanish","review":"EL MEJOR PUTO JUEGO DE LA HISTORIA.
