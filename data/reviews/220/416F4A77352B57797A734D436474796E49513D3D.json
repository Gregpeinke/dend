Before you spam my inbox with death threats, please hear me out (or read me out).\n     I bought this game expecting a marvelous mixture of physics, shooting, and puzzle solving, but what I got was... not exactly that. I know this game was made in late 2004, but that doesn't excuse the fact that this game looks and feels underwhelming. Valve has made fantastic puzzle and shooting games such as Portal and Counterstrike, but it ended up not mixing so well. But let's start with the good things about the game.\n     Half-Life 2, especially for a game from 2004, still looks good from a graphical standpoint. Nothing looks too revolting and nothing looks dated. It plays it's artstyle safe and doesn't add too much uneccessary detail. The handling is also very satisfactory. I always feel like I'm in control and not restricted. The numerous shoot-outs this game provide are well designed and allow you to learn how to use any new weapons that are given to you. The voice-acting is also marvelous. The cast plays their parts perfectly and nothing sounded unnatural. This game is certainly not perfect, though.\n     Valve thought it was a good idea to mesh too many mechanics into one game. They tried to make this game into a puzzle solving, FPS, physics-them-up, and, sadly, it suffers because of it. Instead of focusing on one or two mechanics and exceling at it, Half-Life 2 feels like a confused, mediocre shooter with a couple physics based puzzles thrown here and there.  The physics in the game are laughably terrible and the shooting feels very unsatisfying. The puzzles are as much as an enigma as Scary Movie is funny; a baby can solve them. The sound effects are also very underwhelming. When I shoot someone I don't hear a rifle going off right next to my ears, I hear bubble-wrap being popped. Sound effects can aid in immersing the player into the game and atmosphere, but whenever I hear a barrel bumping around or the swipe of my crowbar, I just can't get into it as much as I should. The vehicles sections are undoubtably the worst part of the game, bar-none. The controls for the buggy and hover boat are either too stiff or too sensitive. I absolutely detest the things the game expects you to do with them and the length of the sections just makes me want to stop and play something else.\n     The story is also very lackluster. I'm not going to get too into detail for the story for I haven't even played the first game or part two. Characters in the story just appear for a minute then leave, things in the story aren't explained very fluently, and the story important characters are very one-dimensional. Gordan Freeman, unsurprisingly, doesn't have a single dimension.\n     I can safely claim that Gordan Freeman, in my opinion, is the absolute worst video game character I have ever witnessed. Just like Link from the Legend of Zelda series, our protagonist is just a brick. He doesn't say anything and doesn't impact the story a whole lot, things just happen around him. I am aware that Freeman is just a skin the players enter so it can make them feel as if it was them in the universe, but that gimmick is completely nullified whenever characters refer to the player as Gordan, or Dr. Freeman. Why is he a scientist, again? Oh, that doesn't matter. It's not like it'll change anything storywise.\n     All in all, I wouldn't recommend this game. I know that the Half-Life series was a very important moment for Valve and PC gaming, because without it, we wouldn't have Steam or anything like this. If you do want to purchase this game and experience it for yourself, I would advise going into Half-Life 2 with a clear mind; don't expect to be blown away from the things you've heard. I'm not going to give a numbered score, for those who were wondering, because I just don't believe in numbers. I want my words to speak for itself, not to just be contradicted by an unmediated numbering system. Let's just hope I don't end up buried under a fanatic's backyard for writing this.","timestamp_created":1390186871,"timestamp_updated":1390186871,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.428685814142227173","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8777817","author":{"steamid":"76561198115098097","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1390149019},"language":"russian","review":"В это стоит погамать)","timestamp_created":1390182793,"timestamp_updated":1390182793,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8777559","author":{"steamid":"76561198116539822","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11703,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1159,"last_played":1641931126},"language":"russian","review":"Игра с отличным сюжетом и превосходной графикой!

think that Half Life 2 is an immersive, visually stunning, and exicting first person shooter experience. \n\nValve did so many things right with this game, such as the wide variety on weapons with each one being unique in its own way, and I think that upgrading the weapon to a completly different weapon with the same basic idea, but with more power and more traits is a unique, well excuted concept.\n\nThe storyline does take work to follow, but it is still very immersive and very well written.\n\nThe controls are great and easy to learn, feeling very smooth and easy to execute.\n\nThis game has lots of little things that make the overall experience more enjoyable, like the vechials you aquire as you go through the game, which not only make the game faster, but fun to move around, and gives you the sense of freedom, and it is fun to gun down your enemies in the process.\n\nAlso I like how there are no real cutscenes throughout the game, but there is still a story, and when a crucial plot element is in progress, you get to freely move around and experience the part from all angles, something that I don't believe that  many other games do.\n\nAnd to put it bluntly, the game is fun as hell.\n\nI would without a doubt reccomend this game, and is worth the nine doller price.","timestamp_created":1390099769,"timestamp_updated":1390099769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8761590","author":{"steamid":"76561198077345431","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9003,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1866,"last_played":1617132913},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente

Instead of being some elite marine, Gordon Freeman is nothing but a scientist forced to fight for suvival.  And the game plays like that.  Without your Biohazard suit you feel about as useful as any of the other Citizens in the world.\n\nEach level is unique and brings around its own gameplay challenges and puzzles.  Do you stop at that house with the smoke comming from it, or continue without stopping?  It's your choice, you are not expected to defeat every single enemy you come across, you can just simply run away.  Not always though.\n\nThe enemy AI is efficient, even if it may cheat somewhat.  They will advance and use cover, use flanking techniques and move as a squad.  It is let down how it seems to know exactly where you are, even after losing line of sight.  Or perhaps the AI is more intelligent than I'm giving it credit for and can hear my footsteps?  Gordon does sound flat footed at times.\n\nThe physics engine is still absolutely amazing and well oiled. Need to get over a ledge, but it's too tall?  Good job there is a see-saw next to it, just load the other end with all those bricks lying around to counter balance your weight.  Can't get that draw bridge down, because you are on the wrong side?  No problem, knock it over with that crane.  Ran out of ammo?  Well luckly there is a toilet bowl here and the gravity gun is fully charged.\n\nIf there is only one thing to gipe about and I do have only the one.  It's the companion AI.  Wait, just here me out.  It starts out fine, with Alyx, just the one.  She get's in your way a bit now and then.  Nothing too annoying, even though she sticks to you like glue and will follow you down every small dead end ally or single exit room.  She will apologize for being in your way, then move away a bit a moment later.  OK, not too much of a problem.  Then you get 4 companions.  All do the same, all stick to you like glue when going down dead end ally ways and block the exit.  The companions can apologise as much about being in the way they as they can, but it will get infuriating at times.  I was evantually glad when a strider wiped them out in a later mission, with no site of reinforcements.\n\nVoice acting is tremendous and you also form bonds with the main characters.  Helped along with the facials expressions the engine is capable of.  I don't remember seeing another video game where so much detail can be put through via facial expressions to show the emotions of each character.\n\nIn closing, Half-Life 2 is a brilliant FPS which hits the right notes in almost every area.  While not a technically impressive as some games released today, the game mechanics are solid and provides an interesting universe and characters to explore.  If you have nether played it, buy it now.  There is no reason to wait for it to go on sale either.","timestamp_created":1390040271,"timestamp_updated":1390040271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626680433750152588","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8750110","author":{"steamid":"76561198114578858","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":74,"playtime_at_review":1729,"last_played":1660611057},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 2 is regarded as one of the best First Person Shooters of all time, and I most certaintly agree.
