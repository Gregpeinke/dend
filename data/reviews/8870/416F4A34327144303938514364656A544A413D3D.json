I'm not sure I understand where all the fan worship of Bioshock generally comes from - the story-telling is, in the main, as subtle as a sledgehammer. The first one annoyed me a lot with it's anvillicious treatment of objectivism, and this one has many elements that are delivered with an almost audible clunking sound.\n\nBut, gameplay wise it's pretty satisfying although not really anything particular innovative. Set-piece battles are suitably thrilling, although the trivial cost of death takes away what would otherwise be pretty heart-stopping awesomeness.\n\nThematics wise, much like with the original Bioshock, it's tremendously good. I was immensely happy when I heard an early 1900s version of 'Tainted Love' being played, and the whole aesthetic is just lovely.\n\nAs to the ending, well - it was okay too. Again, a bit clunky and a bit obvious, but I don't know how much of *that* was the number of people I heard saying 'OMG such a pretentious ending!' well in advance of my playing it.\n\nOverall - B minus. Wouldn't play again, but didn't resent the time I poured into it the first time.","timestamp_created":1395612929,"timestamp_updated":1395612929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9612557","author":{"steamid":"76561198105969035","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":8170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1510327244},"language":"english","review":"THE BEST STORYLINE EVER AND ONE OF THE BEST GRAPHICAL GAMES :D MA FAVOURITE SERIES :D","timestamp_created":1395612755,"timestamp_updated":1395612755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9612553","author":{"steamid":"76561198049507402","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":975,"last_played":1395964898},"language":"english","review":"It's amazing.","timestamp_created":1395612743,"timestamp_updated":1395612743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9612447","author":{"steamid":"76561197984542984","num_games_owned":863,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":176,"last_played":1413508819},"language":"english","review":"Got this game because of the sale having it be $7.50.

Es un pasillo enorme de 9 horas en el que somos asesinos en potencia. Tras estas 9 horas somos conscientes que toda decisión que tomemos (creo que hay 2) da igual porque todo esté scriptado. Los personajes nos hablan... una vez. Luego forman parte del decorado. Somos urracas que vamos codiciosas a todo lo que brilla. El final es muy brusco, parece que estamos viendo un capítulo de perdidos con esos fundidos negros. Hay personajes totalmente desaprovechados (Songbird... por dios. Pobrecico. Yo creo que le podían haber dado más cancha). No hay un enemigo que asuste como en los anteriores bioshock. Los matas con la boina. Las magias son meramente adorno. Y alguna hasta inutil.\nPero a pesar de todo ello estamos ante una ambientación y un detalle espectacular. Una representación de la sociedad y una vuelta de tuerca muy buena. Unos gráficos vivos. Nos hace parecer que estamos en un mundo vivo (aunque luego nos llevemos el chasco y nos demos cuenta de que no está tan vivo). Una trama que está hilada de tal forma que cuando lo acabamos atamos todos los puntos.\nNo existe dedo a la mitad o sí y no. Me parece un juego para jugarlo, pero no para adorarlo.","timestamp_created":1395593602,"timestamp_updated":1395593602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9608951","author":{"steamid":"76561197962286394","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":83,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":83,"last_played":1395593392},"language":"english","review":"Bad","timestamp_created":1395593441,"timestamp_updated":1395593441,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9608874","author":{"steamid":"76561198006475754","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1113,"last_played":1580503022},"language":"english","review":"This is a game I waited a long time to play.\nI'll start with the good;\nThe graphics are super scalable.\nThe story, while very linear is well written and fun thus far.\nThe combat is much the same as it was in bioshock.\nThe envoroments are a gorgous americana steampunk utopia.\nYou fight the KKK.\n\nMy complaints;\nThe woman is delegated to beaing the healer.\n\nSo i'm only about 2 hours into the game, but i would highly reccomend that you play it.\n\n5 hour errata:\nComplaints got bigger;\nRepetivly having to reload last checkpoint due to NPCs not triggering as dead after death.\nMain Character (mid-thirtys white dude with brown hair) has unexplored potential to be less cardboard\nElizabeth (female npc co-host) contiunues to fall into trope after trope making what could have been an actual interesting npc and side character into a cardboard cut-out of every other female character we've seen in video games for the past 10+ years","timestamp_created":1395593072,"timestamp_updated":1395695543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9608859","author":{"steamid":"76561198045914347","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":728,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":728,"last_played":1387753597},"language":"english","review":"the graphics in this game are amazing! and the enviorment around you is beautiful especially all the clouds and buildings. the gameplay is so good with all the spells and the variety of guns. the story is good and dosent make you bored when you first meet elizabeth you think it'l be a lame escort quest. but it's the exact opposite of that elizabeth helps you in combat by throwing health packs at you or vigors and she tells you where there's money i give this game a 9/10.","timestamp_created":1395592958,"timestamp_updated":1395592958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9608858","author":{"steamid":"76561198045201137","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":658,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":524,"last_played":1395272760},"language":"german","review":"Mir fällt es generell schwer, Hypes nachzuvollziehen. Aber nachdem ich Bioshock (1) zockte und total begeistert war, holte ich mir auch Bioshock Infinite. Ein großer Fehler. Ich war schon von Anfang an von Infinite abgeneigt, da es einfach viele Punkte hat, die mich stören. Zum einen, dass man nur 2 Waffen tragen kann. Ich weiß, das ist heute in Shootern standard, dennoch störend. Zum anderen die unglaubliche lieblose Gestaltung der Welt. Die Animationen wirken wie hingeklatscht. Detailliebe ist leider nicht zu erkennen. Das Gameplay zieht sich wie ein zähes Kaugummi, da man praktisch die ganze Zeit hin und her rennt und dabei Horden von Gegnern ausschalten muss. Um das mal deutlich zu machen: Man rennt von Punkt A nach B, von B zu C, dann zu Punkt D und wieder zurück zu Punkt B. Schon im ersten Teil gab es sowas. Allerdings auch nur 1 Mal. Hier ist das dauerhaft so. Es nervt. Im Gegensatz zu Rapture ist Columbia eine ziemlich schwache Illusion von Stadt. Ich habe mich niemals als Teil von Columbia gefühlt, was vorallem an der mangelnden Interaktion mit dem Spieler liegt. Passanten, die es auch nur anfangs gibt, glotzen einen einfach nur an, wenn man vor ihnen steht, oder man wird direkt ignoriert. Die einzige Interaktion mit dem Spieler besteht aus \"Da ist er!\" mit anschließendem Geballer. Außer Gegner gibt es im späteren Verlauf auch niemanden und man fragt sich, wo die ganzen Passanten hin sind. Schade ist auch, dass man immer nur Horden von Gegnern antrifft. Ich weiß nicht, was das soll. Es ist einfach nur nervig, Gegnern zu begegnen. Leider gibt es auch fast keine Abwechslung. Man schießt immer auf die selben Gegner. Es gibt so gut wie keine Variationen. Abgesehen davon, dass diese verschiedene Waffen tragen, unterscheiden sie sich gar nicht. So schiebt sich Infinite selbst in die MMS Schiene, was ziemlich traurig ist. Bis auf die Grundidee, also den Kontrast zwischen Rapture und Columbia, fällt es mir schwer, etwas Positives über Infinite zu sagen.\nGanz klar: KEINE Kaufempfehlung.","timestamp_created":1395592958,"timestamp_updated":1398934885,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.443161636590957642","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9608837","author":{"steamid":"76561198121918454","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":544,"last_played":1535149354},"language":"russian","review":"Игра \"BioShok Infinite\", купленная по акции, почему-то не запускается.
