Fantastic, fast paced battles, unique war atmosphere, gorgeous sci-fi world, interesting story telling, various levels' scenarios, awesome music and inspiring humor are some of its highlights. Unfortunately there are also some things that didn't age well. Outdated collisions system can be annoying at navigation, especially when you walk in tight spaces and even worse when you team up with your allies. Driving sequences are a little bit clunky too. Nevertheless, even after so many years, \"Half Life 2\" is fun to play for most gamers and must play for the genre lovers.\n\n\nManometer: 8/10[/b]\n\n\nThe good\n- Gorgeous graphics for back then with immersive atmospheric lighting. Visually it is fully playable even for today standards.\n- Awesome sci-fi world, designed with great imagination. From countryside, to city roads and interiors there are lot of different places to visit through your journey.\n- Fantastic pace, enjoyable battles. Excluding some short parts, the rest of the game is played at fast forward. It makes you always feel alive and alerted without tiring you.\n- Each level has a unique scenario to offer so it never gets boring. You will drive vehicles, go on an expedition teaming up with allies, destroy enemy helicopters, defense an area and more.\n- Great atmosphere. Throughout the whole game you feel like you are inside a war zone. Gunshots, explosions, drones flying, people running and much more are happening around you simultaneously,\n- Good amount of weapons. Some of them have special abilities and give extra depth to the gameplay.\n- Amazing physics for back then. Many things inside the world are destructive. Most of them interact well each other when you throw or shoot them.\n- The main story is simplistic but the overall setup is amazing, unique and supports perfectly the action part of the game.\n- Great direction. The choice of telling the story with in-game mechanics instead of using prerendered cut scenes is ahead of its time. Giving you the ability to walk around or rotate the camera during dialogues and key events makes the game even more immersive.\n- Well designed enemies. There is no huge variation here but some of them are really unique. Enemies like Headcrab and Strider are absolutely unforgettable.\n- Stunning music. Especially during big battles some fast paced tracks pick up the tempo even more creating an insane atmosphere.\n- Good, convincing voice acting performances.\n- Decent AI for its age. Enemies react cleverly enough to your actions, although maybe they had to cover themselves a little bit more.\n- Excellent level design to guide the player. Although usually you will be inside a labyrinth, you will always magically find your way out. Marks, lighting, enemies spawn and more are placed wisely to guide you.\n- There are some puzzle-like situations that are simplistic and easy to solve but also fun enough and give you a nice break between battles.\n- Interesting characters. They are neither special nor too deep, but they are cool personalities with well written dialogues.\n- It is a much more survival experience than you initially think. Yes, you shoot and kill a lot but it gives you limited resources. You are always in a mood to search for more and not waste too much of them. \n- It has a unique, discreet sense of humor that manages to balance the drama without ruining the war atmosphere.\n- It is cheap and it is one of the most classical shooters of all time.\n\nThe bad\n- Outdated collisions system. Navigation can be problematic in many different ways but it becomes extremely annoying when you have to walk on narrow tubes and ledges or when you have to jump on a small object. Most of the times it is not clear where you 're standing with a result of falling or dying. Climbing on stairs is a bit problematic too.\n- The missions that you have to team up with others inside tight spaces and corridors are extremely clunky. Most of the times your teammates will block you way, while some others they will refuse to follow you. By far the most annoying levels that almost ruined the whole game for me.\n- Driving missions have good pace but control mechanics are a little bit outdated and problematic. Probably they were great for back then, but now they feel somewhat odd.\n- I felt that one or two missions were a lot longer than I expected. After a certain point they just started to feel to me a bit tiring and repetitive.\n- Too many loading screens. There is one of them literally in every three minutes.
