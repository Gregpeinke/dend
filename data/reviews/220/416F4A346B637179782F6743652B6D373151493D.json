Я: 20 часов только сюжета. [/i]\n\n[b] Спойлеров нет [/b]\n[h1] Что за игра - Half Life 2? [/h1]\nС момента выхода первой части прошло 6 лет (1998), Valve выпускает продолжение - Half Life 2 (2004). Да, на данный момент ЭТОЙ ИГРЕ почти 17 лет. Какая ещё игра сможет так долго оставаться актуальной (как технически, так и с интересным сюжетом)? Думаю, нет такой.\nИгра рассказывает о продолжении похождений [i]молчаливого Гордона Фримена[/i]. Действия игры происходят после событий первой части, однако проходя игру, можно легко изучить основные моменты из прошлой части, даже если вы её не проходили. Игра разделена на главы, главы - на локации, переходы между которыми происходят с помощью подгрузок. Игрок в любое время может развернуться и отправиться обратно в предыдущую локацию, однако после начала новой главы, так сделать уже будет невозможно. Игра впервые использовала новый движок от самой Valve - [i]Source,[/i] на котором позже будут создаваться все игры компании. Вместе с этим пришла в серию и невероятная физика (на основе Havok), что сделало игру только привлекательней.\n\n[h1] Графика и физика игры [/h1]\nКак было сказано ранее, игра использует новый продвинутый движок вкупе с невероятной для того времени физикой; всё это создало невероятно красивую и более приближенную к реальности картинку с физичным и \"живым\" миром. В игре почти [i] каждый объект можно двигать, [/i] начиная от баночки из-под газировки, заканчивая целым центром управления. У всех предметов есть свой вес - пластиковый контейнер, естественно, будет весить намного меньше, чем, к примеру, металлический ящик. Поэтому, главному герою не все предметы возможно поднять \"голыми руками\". Приблизительно в середине игры, игроку станет доступен [i] Гравитационная пушка, [/i] с помощью которой поднять можно будет уже почти всё движимое. \nИгра использует [i] Ragdoll - [/i] простую физику тел, схожую с физикой тряпичной куклы, однако в мире HF2 тела двигаются более чем натурально и реалистично.\n\n[h1] Персонажи (спойлеров также нет) [/h1]\nОсновными персонажами игры, помимо главного героя Гордона, являются G-Man, появляющийся пару раз за всю игру, но он, как по мне, самый загадочный персонаж игры; Аликс - главный друг за всю игру; Джудит Моссман - находится сразу \"на обоих сторонах\", помогая и Сопротивлению и Альянсу; Др. Брин - главный антагонист за всю игру. [i] Помимо них, присутствует огромное количество других менее значимых персонажей. [/i]\n[b] Персонажи более чем интересны, за ними интересно наблюдать и к концу игры ты явно привязываешься к ним. [/b]\n\n[h1] Итоги [/h1]\nHalf-Life 2 - несомненно легендарный проект, который я рекомендую к прохождению. Игра за всё время стала такой же легендой, как например, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (Rockstar Games), The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim (Bethesda Game Studios) или Minecraft (Mojang). Игра даже сейчас выглядит и играется очень приятно; в графическом плане так и вовсе, опережая многие другие игры на годы вперед.\n\n[h1] Оценка: [/h1]\n[b] Сюжет и повествование - 10/10 [/b] \n[b] Графика - 8/10 [/b] \n[b] Физика и качество анимации - 8/10 [/b] \n[b] Оптимизация игры - 9/10 [/b] \n[b] Соотношение цена/качество - 10/10 [/b]  \n[u] [b] Итоговая оценка - 9/10 [/b]

And all this with the help of its own Source engine, which is almost perfectly optimized and with it you can make unsurpassedly beautiful games.\nThe only downside - the range of drawing, and then this disadvantage is manifested only in open spaces (for example, in the section \"Water barrier\").\nAnd of the pros - Fantastic work with lighting, fire here in my opinion is the best of all the games in which I played and water is the same as fire.\n-Physics, gameplay and mechanics:\nProbably these are the most important aspects in this game, because there are physical puzzles (compared to the first part, but they became too obvious in the passage), also if we touched the first part I want to say that compared to the first part of the second became much easier to pass (I understood that they wanted to compensate with the number of enemies, but it didn't work out).\nAbout the mechanics of shooting, it is average by today's standards .. probably even below average (of course, compared to the first part of the shooting has improved). The most infuriating - random scatter and a little less - the accuracy of the sight.\nBut Half-Life wouldn't be Half-Life if it didn't have a gravity gun, so think for yourself, if Half-Life didn't have a gravity gun, what kind of game would it be? In my opinion, Half-Life would be a simple first-person shooter, because with the help of a gravity gun you can take dozens or even hundreds of funny screenshots (as in my case)), and seriously, with the help of a gravity gun Half -Life shows itself not as a first-person shooter with puzzles, but you can even say a full-fledged sandbox (if you play, you will understand what \"sandbox\" I'm talking about).\nPhysics in Half-Life 2 do not be afraid to say the standard of all games, for example: you can break a box and every part of this box that you see - you can move, you can also move every weapon and if you break the glass, the glass will break only in the place where you hit him and parting completely with cracks.\n-Conclusion:\nSo! The game is also relevant for 2021, because where else can you find a game that has mixed levels with different elements: horror, puzzles, etc., with a good atmosphere, physics, soundtrack (from Kelly Bailey) and good graphics?","timestamp_created":1617381398,"timestamp_updated":1617381440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89573637","author":{"steamid":"76561198884807247","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1360,"last_played":1651404579},"language":"polish","review":"zajebista gierka jak komuś się nudzi B)","timestamp_created":1617380897,"timestamp_updated":1617380897,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89572141","author":{"steamid":"76561198101593612","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":921,"last_played":1618927832},"language":"spanish","review":"juegazo, pancho, tenes que jugarlo","timestamp_created":1617379381,"timestamp_updated":1617379381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89571672","author":{"steamid":"76561198141005029","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1060,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":363,"last_played":1647531967},"language":"danish","review":"This shit is horrifying, if you're not as much of a pussy as I am, you will love this masterpiece of a game.
