The change in attitude from neutral to hostile adds a great touch to the game play.  Game mechanics are fun and interesting.  Anachronisms really make the game very interesting, unique and fun to play.  Characters are well developed and add to the storyline.\n\nThe extra DLCs are absolutely worth picking up.  Episode 1 is no where near as good as Infinite but Episode 2 is really on par with Infinite.  I found Episode 1 to be fairly buggy and fairly short but still worth the time.  Play style of Episode 2 is extremely different and really adds a nice touch to the play style.  Also very entertaining to replay and change your game style from defensive to offensive.","timestamp_created":1403460651,"timestamp_updated":1403460651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10675175","author":{"steamid":"76561198004037506","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2953,"last_played":1398658896},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is a frustrating game, in a very interesting way. It's absolutely beautiful, exciting, fresh and tense... but it's still mainly a shooter with a story wrapped around it. In terms of gameplay, this is a ten out of ten, no doubt: the controls and scenarios are perfect, and you WILL get absorbed in the story after you've found Elizabeth. \n\nThe frustrating part is that, well, you need to like first person shooters to get anything out of it. The more story-focused gamers among us might tire of the fighting and get frustrated, leaving them unhappy with the game.\n\nI'd recommend anyone giving it a shot, but I won't begrudge more peaceful players for their disdain.","timestamp_created":1403460419,"timestamp_updated":1403460419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10675071","author":{"steamid":"76561197971398729","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1874,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1764,"last_played":1551653057},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic!

IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THE FIRST BIOSHOCK IT ISN'T REQUIRED BUT YOU WILL GET SO MUCH MORE OUT OF IT IF YOU HAVE! \n\nSeriously. Especially if you've played the first Bioshock. Just do it. You will thank yourself later. This game is an absolute delight and the story to it will have you confused at times but it all comes together. It will make you look back on the events that have happened and all of a sudden it just clicks. The story and characters are just amazing. The talk about making Elizabeth a central character that you care about and all that I thought in the beginning was going to be a bunch of typical developer speak as well but honestly.... I really started to care about Elizabeth. They style they went with, the voice work put into her, and especially the animation just make her not just a believable character but a believable person. \n\nRegardless of the story stuff holy crap the game is so much fun when everything is opened up and going on. The open areas where you can jump on the rails and everything is absolutely thrilling!\n\nI also highly recommend the DLC Burial at Sea 1 and 2. They add so much more to it and they really tie up what's going on in a nice bow.","timestamp_created":1403459236,"timestamp_updated":1403459236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10674181","author":{"steamid":"76561198048901268","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":938,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":655,"last_played":1436840814},"language":"english","review":"This game is fun for anyone who likes a deep storyline and fps games.
