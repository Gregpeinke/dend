I played the first one on xbox and although this one is very different because of advancement of graphics as well a different angle the game took. As oppossed to the original this game is very bright and doesnt try to be scary at all. Also the story of this game is mind blowing and paired with a very fun gameplay (The use of Salts is awesome) makes this game a really great buy. If its on sale I recommend jumping on it.","timestamp_created":1387856310,"timestamp_updated":1387856310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8241672","author":{"steamid":"76561197991523078","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":173,"last_played":1406088583},"language":"english","review":"One of the worst endings to a video game I've seen in a long time, I don't understand how everyone views this game as anything other than abyssmal","timestamp_created":1387855948,"timestamp_updated":1387855948,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523061215877532959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8241519","author":{"steamid":"76561198046856705","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1597823002},"language":"english","review":"this game is amazing! great graphics and really cool gameplay and a pretty interesting story as well","timestamp_created":1387855329,"timestamp_updated":1387855329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8241327","author":{"steamid":"76561198016303956","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":865,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":854,"last_played":1389406328},"language":"english","review":"I can't even joke about this game.\n\nThere are very few games I would praise as being masterpieces, since I'm not easy with praise. This game is what I consider one of the best games of our time. Flawlessly presently, masterfully written, a great experience throughout. This is the game that other games want to be. The story, be it not flawless, is engauging and intense. The one thing I have to give boundless praise is that though the game plays very cinematically (having \"movie\" moments that define the stages of the plot) It does not take away from the gameplay experience like most video games that try to be movies tend to do. No, this does it like no other. The gameplay is so fluid, engauging and filled to the brim with sheer brilliance that you don't even mind that you're playing through a linear story progression. You just live it.\nThe characters are one thing. Elizabeth is the shining star in this game. She just acts so much like a human being, and the other thing I love is that she's anything but cliche. Most female characters go these two ways; one, they become helpless and always need to be saved, and two, they try to be \"badass\" and just become a female version of male brutes in the vague act of trying to seem independent and counter the damsel sterotype. Elizabeth is a human being. She feels, talks and acts like a human being. I couldn't ask for a better character.\nAll in all, This game is near flawless. Besides some nitpicks, this game was insanely fun and satisfying. A engauging story, flawless gameplay, perfected presentation. Buy this game, you will not be dissapointed.\n9.9/10","timestamp_created":1387854575,"timestamp_updated":1387854575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8241269","author":{"steamid":"76561198117336714","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":62,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37,"last_played":1390665756},"language":"spanish","review":"Puro arte","timestamp_created":1387854352,"timestamp_updated":1387854352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8241092","author":{"steamid":"76561198067291648","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":67,"last_played":1581946789},"language":"german","review":"Geiles Spiel","timestamp_created":1387853674,"timestamp_updated":1387853674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8240844","author":{"steamid":"76561198063279617","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":573,"last_played":1412416189},"language":"english","review":"ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED IM MY LIFE.\n\nBioshock infinite is one of the best games of this year and possibly of all time.\n\nalthough its a little bit short and the ending may not be that great its still a powerfull and amazing game \n\nanybody that can afford it should get it right away","timestamp_created":1387852916,"timestamp_updated":1387852916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8240610","author":{"steamid":"76561198031160440","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1224,"last_played":1552492929},"language":"english","review":"it is every bit as good as people make it out to be","timestamp_created":1387852174,"timestamp_updated":1387852174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8239844","author":{"steamid":"76561197991774083","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1452963510},"language":"french","review":"La meilleure expérience vidéoludique que j'ai pu avoir jusqu'à maintenant.","timestamp_created":1387849576,"timestamp_updated":1387849576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8239708","author":{"steamid":"76561198034987353","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1037,"last_played":1509907135},"language":"english","review":"Dammit...

It's one of those rare games that hooks you from the very beginning, and goes all the way in creating an immersive setting and narrative. Needless to say that these are the central elements of this game. The flying city of Columbia is visually stunning, and the storyline is intense and intriguing. Prepare to have your jaw dropped every once in a while, due to an ingenius plot twist (and prepare to be mind-blown in the end!). As in every Bioshock, Infinite will provide you with brainfood in terms of an in-dept analysis of political ideals and the place of science in society. However, the storyline is more focused on the protagonists, compared to the previous games. Speaking of which, the main characters are wonderfully 'real', and you will develop a sense of care for them.  \nSurprisingly, I found the combat less interesting. Yes, it's fast-paced. Yes, it has all the features that made old-school shooters great. But I can't help but considering the battles an unnecessary obligation. But don't be disappointed; you'll have a lot of heartpounding shoot-outs, worthy of rememberance. It's just that looking around looking for bits and pieces of the multi-layered story is what makes this game really great.\n\nIn short: a masterpiece, in every sense of the word.

Story comes first and foremost and the overall polish shines through. The setting and characters are so well thought out and memorable it's no wonder Infinite has been four years in the making.\n\nIt's a first person shooter for people who favor story and immersion over expanse and exploration. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty to explore in Infinite but this game is far more similar to Half-Life 2 than FarCry 3. But if you liked the original Bioshock, you won't be disappointed here. In fact, you might find this game to be superior in overall story as drift further into the game and build a relationship with Elizabeth. There is so much packed into this game it warrants a second play through, for sure.\n\nElizabeth isn't your regular damsel in distress. She may be a virgin lamb, so to speak, but she learns over time that she is much, much more. Entangled in this grandiose dystopian story as much as the city itself, Elizabeth is a shining example of fantastic storytelling and craftsmanship. She has a life and you feel her emotions and her struggles. You see her change over time due to the cruelty of Columbia. Truly fantastic.\n\nThe possibilities in combat are nearly limitless. With well over a dozen weapons, variants, and upgrades to them (plus your Vigors) the combat is really about how you want it. Some people complain about the rail system being just a loop around the battlefield, but it's still pretty dang cool if you ask me. Adding another level of combat, movement, and exploration. Other games lack these innovations, but Infinite does not.\n\nThe themes of religion, race supremacy, lust, greed, are in full effect here and honestly, that's what made the original Bioshock so appealing. Others have said the violence is over the top at times, with the Sky-Hook kills, and I too found it shocking at first. But over time the violence felt right at home with all the jingoist and xenophobic policies flying around.

With the addicting fight mechanics and complex and incredibly well-done storyline, this game is a must for anyone, even if you haven't played the other games. I cannot speak to the dlc yet, as I do not have the cash to get it, but as for the core game, it was bloody amazing and ridiculously fun to go through.\nThe combat is super easy to get the hang of (at least for me, and I had difficulty with the original fighting mechanics). I found myself leaping off and on the rails to dodge enemy attacks and shoot their backs while crying \"Haha, suckers! Take that!\" (until, of course, they leapt on the rails after me.) With health and ammo flying your way as well, it makes combat a bit easier, while still providing quite a challenge. There were times where I was near death and kept waiting for some health, only to realize that she couldn't find any. With the enemies closing in, I did the only thing I could do. Make a tactical retreat. (THEN she threw health at me.)\nThat aside, if you love storylines, you'll love this one. I wasn't expecting it. I had an idea about some parts of the story and managed to be right, while the larger plot points threw me for a loop. It was brilliant. I can't say much more than that.\nSo would I recommend this game? Yes. Without a doubt. I would recommend it to anyone, even if said person doesn't like video games. \"Just look at this one,\" I'd say, gleefully, hope in my eyes, \"because this one isn't like other games. It's one of the best out there.\"\nGo get this game, then. What are you still here for?
