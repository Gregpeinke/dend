I was too young to appreciate this gem back then (plus I got noobishly stuck on the 2nd chapter), but I decided to come back to it after 20(!) years. It was one of the best decisions I've made. This game not only holds up to modern day standards. It has an atmosphere that is simply irreplicable. \nNice visuals, great story, groundbreaking physics engine for its time and most importantly tons of fun!

I think Half-Life 2 is better than this, but by a much larger margin than how other people think about these two games.\n\nOf my experience with this game, three quarters of it was very fun. Shooting aliens, walking fast, picking up new guns, killing an entire military force, it was slightly harder than Half-Life 2 but I didn't care. In a way it kind of made it more fun. Then the last quarter of my experience with this game was filled with the most frustrating crap any game has thrown at me. This is the most frustrated I have ever been with a game in my short life. I did beat it twice, and my second playthrough was much better than my first, but holy god my first playthrough was hell. Many of the countless deaths I had were my fault, but there were some that were not. Why do the HECU's grenades sometimes decide to explode quicker than other times? Why is it that when you're anywhere within an explosion's radius, it does three quarters of your health of damage at the very least. Why is fall damage so damn sensitive? Why do grenades explode instantly whenever you throw them against a wall in front of you? Why do they sometimes instantly explode on nothing?\n\nSome negatives I have that aren't related to dying: what's with the end of the game having so many vortigaunts? It's not like they're the most interesting enemy in the world...\n\nBut I still loved this game. I'm sure that the more I play it, the more I'll like it. That's how it went for me in Half-Life 2. Speaking of Half-Life 2, this does actually do some things better. More enemy variety, weapon variety, you actually get ammo for the magnum and crossbow, I like the sounds and visuals in Xen, the game was still as enjoyable, even if I was about to destroy my computer at a few select parts.

Ailelerine çocuklarını fellik fellik aratmıştır. Şakası bir yana ciddi anlamda başlayalım.\n\nHalf Life, bir gizli araştırma üssünde meydana gelen bir kaza sonucu ortaya çıkanları anlatan, bunları kahramanı Gordon Freeman’ın gözünden anlatan 1998 yapımı bir FPS oyunudur. Kısaca bahsetmek gerekirse, spoiler vermemeye çalışarak, araştırma üssüne bir taş benzeri bir madde ulaşmıştır, maddenin uzaydan geldiği varsayılmaktadır ve M.I.T’den mezun olan Gordon Freeman’ın ekibi olan olağandışı maddeler ekibine üzerinde deney yapılması adına verilmiştir. Ardından yapılan deneyde bir aksaklık olur ve macera başlar. Bundan sonrasını anlatacağım merak edenler için. Altta bir link verip oraya yazmayı planlıyorum. Oyunun altında oldukça ve oldukça sağlam bir hikaye var.\n\nBiraz da oyunun tarihinden bahsedelim. Valve’in çıkış oyunudur Half-Life. Gabe Newell ve bir kaç arkadaşı eski Microsoft çalışanıdır. Windows 95 ve 98’de çok büyük katkıları olduğu söylenir Gabe’in. Microsoft ekibinden daha önce ayrılan bir ekip id software’i kurmuştur. Çıkarttıkları oyunlar ile iyi bir başarıya imza atmıştır. Bunu gören Gabe, id Software’dan olan arkadaşları ile iletişime geçer ve Microsoft’dan ayrılır. Ardından Quake’in oyun motorunu düzenleyerek ilk Half Life’ı yaparlar. GoldSrc adlı oyun motoru ile Half Life sunulur. Half Life FPS tarihindeki ilk hikayeli oyun olma tahtına da sahiptir. Ondan önceki oyunlar sadece vur ve ilerle mantığında idi. Valve, Half Life ile yepyeni bir FPS devri başlatmış ve çok çok büyük bir başarıya imza atmıştır. Ardından kendi source motorları ile tekrar ele almışlardır.(1.6 sürümü source ile yapılmıştır.)\n\nOyunun havası oldukça kasvetli. Her an her yerden saldırabilecek düşmanlar, her tarafta onun dışındaki cesetler, çok az canlı insan, havalandırmalarda geçen yollar,kısıtlı cephane.. Oyun atmosfer olarak size o an oradaki insanın psikolojisi nasıl olursa aynen onu yaşatmakta. Karakter Gordon Freeman ise soğukkanlı ve kolayca bağ kurulabilecek bir karakter. Kısacası oyunu oynamaya başladığınızda kendinizi oyunun içerisinde hissedeceksiniz.\n\nSingle Player’dan sonra efsanevi multiplayer’ına geçersek, Multiplayer’ı da Single Player’ı kadar efsanedir. Oynanabilirliğin çok yüksek olması ve kısa sürede adapte olabilmek oyunu daha da çok oynanabilir yapmıştır. Hala daha oynayanı vardır.Çünkü onun deneyimini ne battlefield’dan ne call of duty’den yada başka bir fps’den alabilirsiniz. Bambaşkadır.\n\nOyun kısmından çıkarsak, Valve geliştirdiği bu motorun üzerine bir çok oyun daha oluşturmuştur. Şüphesiz bunların en meşhuru Counter Strike’dır. Ardından Ricochet, Team Fortress, Deathmatch Classic gibi oyunlarını da eklemiştir. Bir kaçını yeni versiyonları ile günümüzde görmekteyiz.\n\nHalf Life’ın başarısının hemen ardından Valve, Orada olanları farklı gözlerden anlatan Half Life Opposing Force, Half Life Blue Shift, Half Life Decay oyunlarını da çıkartmıştır.\n\nArtıları ve eksileri ile özet geçersek\n+Mükemmel bir senaryo\n+Oynanabilirliğin çok yüksek olması\n+Harika atmosfer\n-Oyunun artık eskimiş olması (Aslında bu bir eksi değil, oyunun yeni source ile yapılmış hali olan Black Mesa Source’u oynayabilirsiniz.\n\nDaha önce oynamadım, oynamak istiyorum diyenlere şiddetle tavsiyemdir.

Some haven't aged well; others have had their ideas done better by later games. Many of gaming's most influential games simply aren't that good by today's standards. Unfortunately, Half Life 1 is one of those games.\n\nHalf Life can mostly be broken up into two kinds of gameplay sections. The first kind of gameplay section is made up of environmental puzzle solving with some light horror elements. These sections are quite good. You walk around the mostly empty halls of the facility, solving environmental puzzles while keeping an eye out for vortigaunts and zombies hidden around corners, in cupboards, behind debris, and etc. The levels are well designed, the puzzles cleverly use real-world rules and solutions (such as live wires electrifying puddles of water), and the occasional jump scare from a vortigaunt or zombie keeps you on your toes.\n\nThe second kind of gameplay section is more typically FPS fare - fast-paced action segments in which you square off against special ops forces with guns, turrets, grenades, and etc. This is where the game really stumbles. The movement feels slidey and imprecise. Enemies almost always have hitscan weapons with large magazines, which means sticking your head out from cover to fire back almost always results in unavoidable damage. Your arsenal of weapons is reasonably large but feels small, as several guns are outright better than others in fulfilling the same role. Worst of all, enemies feel far too spongey; a point-blank shotgun blast to the chest will regularly fail to kill even standard grunt enemies.\n\nTaken all together, these grievances result in FPS action sections which just feel bad to play. As I played through these sections, the thought most often at the front of my mind was \"I can't wait for this to end so I can go back to a section of environmental puzzle solving.\" Unfortunately, as the game progresses, the FPS action sections get longer and more frequent, and the enjoyable parts of the game, the environmental puzzle sections, get fewer and farther between. Towards the end of my play time with Half Life, I was thoroughly fed up with it and just wanted it to be over.\n\nHalf Life was probably a great game when it came out, and it certainly had an influence on its genre going forward. However, over the two decades since its release, significant portions of the game have not aged very well, and no longer provide a satisfying experience when compared to today's standards. Though the environmental puzzle solving sections are still pretty good, the FPS action sections simply do not provide satisfying gunfights anymore.","timestamp_created":1557508831,"timestamp_updated":1557509033,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.441176474094390869","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50575572","author":{"steamid":"76561198440570149","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1038,"last_played":1522062625},"language":"english","review":"GG GOOD GAME","timestamp_created":1557506378,"timestamp_updated":1557506378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50571729","author":{"steamid":"76561198121327883","num_games_owned":509,"num_reviews":117,"playtime_forever":628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":628,"last_played":1454001493},"language":"russian","review":"А ЭТА БОМБ АБЗОР НА ИГРУ 20 С ХУЕМ ЛЕТНЕЙ ДАВНОСТИ ТАК КАК ТРЕТЬЯ ЧАСТЬ ВЫХОДИТ В ЭПИК ГЕЙ СТОР А НЕ В МОЮ ЛЮБИМУЮ ПЯТЁРОЧКУ.

Why? Because it was a game-changer. And also no Half-Life = no Steam on which you're reading this.\n\nPrior to Half-Life, those of us who were lucky or privileged enough to own a decent PC back in the 90's had Doom and then a proper 3-D First-Person Shooter in the form of Quake a few years later. Both of which are classic games in their own right but they were mainly aim and blast FPS with not much in the way of 'feel', depth, structure or narrative. They were created for basic quick-fire fun and not much else and no, that's not a critism. \n\nHalf-Life then comes along with a main protagonist by the name of Gordon Freeman and a brilliant setting in the way of a secret military installation called Black Mesa. (Area 51 entering mainstream pop culture in the 90's thanks mainly to the X-Files and Independence Day). Both of those things are then bound together with what was then, an EPIC sized map! What I loved and still love about this game is that it had attitude. And it happily let the player know this right from the very start with the 'then' stunning real-time rendered intro sequence. Unlike the fashion at the time, no pre-rendered CGI cut-scenes were to be seen here. The monorail intro seems to go on forever and all the while you can look around and see the many base workers going about their business. It's obviously a very proud Valve showing off their baby and what could be achieved with care and the technology at the time.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the map was MASSIVE and what's more there were no loading screens whatsoever. An occasional 'loading' indication flashing up which lasts less than a second was all the user was ever presented with. This was totally unheard of back then. Dev's who I worked with at the time were blown away by this and wondering how they'd made a map so big with no loading screens. The lack of loading screens were vital in keeping the 'flow' of the game running smoothly and added to Black Mesa feeling like a an actual immersive 'world' in the truest sense of the word.\n\nTwenty-one years later and this game STILL holds up. It's beautiful, it's absorbing and it's challenging. I recommend any newcomers who are new to this game/franchise, to pick this up. Not just for a nostalgia trip but because it's a major piece of history that everyone who's truly into games should own. \n\nI myself may pick up the Black Mesa modern remake soon too... \n","timestamp_created":1557188582,"timestamp_updated":1557188582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50301206111907959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50516033","author":{"steamid":"76561198410116908","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":61,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1579711737},"language":"english","review":"This game still amazes me for its ingenuity and a inspiration for everyone.Without Half-Life,Valve would be nothing today","timestamp_created":1557167711,"timestamp_updated":1557167711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50301206111907959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50512124","author":{"steamid":"76561198285756967","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26,"last_played":1645274959},"language":"english","review":"Best Half-Life, no question","timestamp_created":1557151365,"timestamp_updated":1557151365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50511130","author":{"steamid":"76561198293096469","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":433,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":433,"last_played":1495457853},"language":"english","review":"Very unhappy for that this game.","timestamp_created":1557146778,"timestamp_updated":1557146778,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.346954524517059326","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50510718","author":{"steamid":"76561198062861198","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":720,"last_played":1556823788},"language":"russian","review":"!!!","timestamp_created":1557144768,"timestamp_updated":1557144768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50505145","author":{"steamid":"76561198146651675","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3047,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1025,"last_played":1648706822},"language":"english","review":"Good game, very replayable","timestamp_created":1557108875,"timestamp_updated":1644890030,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52702707052230835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50503084","author":{"steamid":"76561198861995349","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1636,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":679,"last_played":1651453086},"language":"english","review":"Great game i really enjoyed it\n","timestamp_created":1557096431,"timestamp_updated":1557096431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50502551","author":{"steamid":"76561198128346302","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":81,"playtime_forever":477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":477,"last_played":1527690599},"language":"schinese","review":"經典","timestamp_created":1557093765,"timestamp_updated":1557093765,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50499996","author":{"steamid":"76561198328155202","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1302,"last_played":1609358455},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1557083421,"timestamp_updated":1557083421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50493426","author":{"steamid":"76561198027174894","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1162,"last_played":1513101889},"language":"english","review":"I’ll be honest, this game does not hold up.
