While some games seem to be over as soon as you finish the playthrough, Portal 2 gives you Co-Op mode after you finish the singleplayer story (in which you play with a friend or a stranger.)

Игра была официально анонсирована Valve 5 марта 2010 года. Изначально её выпуск планировался осенью того же года, однако после нескольких переносов датой выхода Portal 2 было назначено 18 апреля 2011 года. В России игра вышла 21 апреля 2011 и распространяется компанией «Бука».\n\nПродолжение развивает игровой процесс первой игры, состоящий из головоломок, построенных на использовании специального устройства для создания порталов — разрывов в пространстве — позволяющих игроку мгновенно перемещаться из одного места в другое. Среди множества нововведений геймплея в Portal 2 присутствует кооперативный режим для прохождения двумя игроками. Действие игры происходит спустя некоторое время после событий Portal в разрушенной и заброшенной Лаборатории исследования природы порталов (Aperture Science) и фокусируется на дальнейшем противостоянии всё той же главной героини, подопытной девушки Челл, и маниакального суперкомпьютера GLaDOS. В кооперативном режиме присутствует отдельная сюжетная линия.\n\nСравнивая Portal и его продолжение, Valve подчёркивает, что первая часть была лишь экспериментом, в то время как Portal 2 является уже полноценной игрой с совершенно новыми элементами геймплея и гораздо большей продолжительностью (игровой процесс рассчитан примерно на 6 часов в одиночном режиме и столько же в кооперативном). Более того, на конференции GDC 2010 директор Valve Гейб Ньюэлл заявил, что Portal 2 — это лучшая игра за всю историю существования компании.","timestamp_created":1451406121,"timestamp_updated":1451406121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20072717","author":{"steamid":"76561198149078925","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1522,"last_played":1637698909},"language":"english","review":"I love this GAME!!!!!
