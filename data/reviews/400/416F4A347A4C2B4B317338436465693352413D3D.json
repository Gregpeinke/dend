Portal is completely dedicated to solving problems by using two portals to move objects or the protagonist through the various puzzles.\n\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n[b]Story:[/b] Portal takes place exclusively in the Apature Science Laboratories Enrichment Center. The Silent Protagonist [i]Bby the name of “Chell”)[/i] awakens in a small room, she is instructed by the Artificial Intelligence known as “GlaDOS” to complete the various test chambers and then Chell will be rewarded with cake.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517834046\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] The gameplay introduced by Portal was probably one of the most innovative and unique concepts introduced by valve, and easily one of the best games released in 2007.\nAs you progress through the game, you are introduced slowly to new concepts and new tricks that you can implement. You start the game with the extremely primitive concept of “put the block on the button”, but after completing a sequence of Test Chambers and obtaining the “Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device” or just “portal gun”, the puzzles get really crazy.\n\n[b]Achievements:[/b] There are 15 achievements in Portal, five achievements are normally unlocked on your first play through, another five achievements are very well explained and relatively easy to obtain [i](Generally by knowing the best location to get them, or preforming specific tricks, or completing some advanced maps)[/i].\nThe last set of achievements is the toughest, earning gold medals on all portal challenges, Detaching all security cameras from the walls, and Finding all the hidden Transmissions. [i](Unless you're going to put an ungodly amount of time into portal, you'll probably need to read guides.)[/i]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517834071\n\n[b]Price:[/b] Portal is priced at $9.99, the value system I use is “Price divided by GameTime = Value”. Generally playing through the Portal story once will be about 6 hours, give or take a few hours depending on puzzle solving skill. This game has enough content to keep the player busy for 9 hours, but most people won't take advantage of all the features, so the price is a bit high. I suggest going for a bundle deal like the Orange Box [i](Especially if you're interested in the Half-Life 2 games)[/i], or waiting for a steam sale before purchasing.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] Story: Excellent, some of the finest content Valve has ever released. Gameplay: Memorable, enjoyable, and addicting. Achievements: a nice blend of difficulty, but not an easy 100% completion game. Price: A bit higher then what I'd prefer, but on the enjoyable factor, Portal is definitely worth it.\nI have a personal bias for this game, because the first product I bought on Steam was the Orange Box, so this is among the first games I've ever played on Steam! I easily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzle games, but this game can appeal to just about anyone, hardcore and softcore alike.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517834102\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update September 13, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/620] Portal 2[/url]","timestamp_created":1442172078,"timestamp_updated":1442172078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544953107833862305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18018660","author":{"steamid":"76561198127489765","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1390,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":316,"last_played":1653933974},"language":"english","review":"This Game Is Amazing.

Portal est un jeu à la première personne dans lequel vous devrez résoudre une multitude d'énigme à l'aide du Portal Gun, mais ce n'est pas pour autemps un fps (First Person SHOUTER) car vous n'aurez par à proprement parler d'ennemie mis à part les tourrelles automatique. Si vous êtes fan d'énigme ce jeu est pour vous car il peut-être parfois cruellement facile comme cruellement complexe ! Si vous êtes du genre à foncer sans regarder autour de vous et sans annaliser correctement le niveau vous risquerez de vous griller les neurones alors que la réponse est au dessu de votre tête ! Ce jeu est aussi complexe du côté où il prend en compte la gravité et l'accélation l'ors d'une chute. Mais attention car comme expliquer plus haut vous possèdez le Portal Gun (ou générateur de portail) qui vous permettera de créer donc des portails certe mais qui sera votre seul moyen pour résoudre les énigmes !! Portal à beau être sorti en 2007 il possède de beaux graphisme et quelque possibilité unique en son genre comme la gravité particulièrement réelle ou encore la logique des portails qui prennent en compte votre vitesse ET votre sens de gravité !
