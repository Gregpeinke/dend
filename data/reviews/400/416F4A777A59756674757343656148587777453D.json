Portal mechanics were interesting, the puzzles were generally simple though I had a few head scratching moments.  Can't recommend this enough, I fully understand why people like it so much.  Looking forward to playing Portal 2 after I go through the bonus maps.\n\nAlso, the ending was priceless.\n\nA couple of details for those few newcomers like myself:  Graphics hold up reasonably well, I dug the look of Aperture Labs.  Ran mostly solid around 220-250ish fps on a 2060 with a couple of random drops into the high 70's for unknown reasons.  My only complaint is the lack of crouch toggle.  Given the length, I don't think this is worth more then about 10 dollars.  I picked up Portal 1 and 2 for less than $2 total.

The boss is super fun at the end, I’d say better than Portal 2. The challenge in this game is advanced maps and challenges. The advanced maps make you use your brain and reflexes more. The challenges just make you focus on time, how many times you've used your portal gun, and how many steps you take. Great game, buy it as soon as you can. You won’t regret it!","timestamp_created":1560906467,"timestamp_updated":1560974073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51296793","author":{"steamid":"76561198174877509","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":236,"last_played":1585189345},"language":"spanish","review":"★★★★★ ★★★★★ (10/10) - SIN SPOILERS -\n\nPero de vez en cuando, aparece un juego que es tan bueno que TODO NAVEGANTE DE ESTA PLATAFORMA debería jugarlo, incluso si no les gustan los juegos de ese género. Portal es uno de esos juegos.\n\nPortal es un juego de rompecabezas en primera persona. Fue un gran juego cuando salió, es un gran juego incluso ahora. Incluso si no juegas juegos de rompecabezas, deberías intentarlo. Los rompecabezas no son demasiado difíciles. El juego introduce lentamente a un nuevo mecánico para que sea realmente fácil de entender. ¡Y resolver los puzzles es muy satisfactorio!\n\nTiene una historia que podría ser más profunda, solo esperare a que VALVE al fin se decida en continuar esta pequeña franquicia.","timestamp_created":1560893218,"timestamp_updated":1567045715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzYuftusCeaHXwwE="}
