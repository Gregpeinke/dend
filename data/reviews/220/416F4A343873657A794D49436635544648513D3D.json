Premetto che non sono nè uno scrittore nè un giornalista: cerco solo di essere d'aiuto e perdonatemi se vedete errori o cose scritte male.\nNon vi spaventate se nella descrizione vedete strane date: Half Life, 1998; Half Life 2, 2004.. Anche se datati, questi due prodotti sono più che validi, soprattutto il secondo.\nHalf Life 2 è uno sparatutto in prima persona prodotto da Valve che utilizza il SOURCE Engine come motore grafico: questo lo rende molto fluido e adatto a qualsiasi modello o tipo di computer. Valve, famosa per titoli quali Counter Strike, Portal e il più recente DOTA 2, dopo aver riscontrato un notevole successo con Half Life, ha deciso di produrre un seguito, migliorandolo e portandolo a livelli inimmaginabili per quegli anni.\nHalf Life 2 presenta una trama coinvolgente e intrigante, che ti costringerà a non staccarti dalla sedia e a dover rigiocarlo più e più volte, magari per rivivere alcune emozioni. Ogni personaggio è uno più carismatico dell'altro e li amerete tutti quanti.\nCon un doppiaggio eccezionale e una colonna sonora da Oscar, la qualità audio è fantastica.\nCon un gameplay fluido, comodo e semplice per voi sarà difficile trovarvi in difficoltà con i tasti.\nLe ambientazioni futuristiche di City 17, i pesaggi sconfinati della costa e la spaventosa Ravenholm vi faranno apprezzare il lavoro che è stato svolto dagli sviluppatori.\nChe dire di più? Questo è un eccezionale gioco che ogni persona dovrebbe provare almeno una volta.

The basic game mechanics are so outdated and unimmersive it's difficult to take it seriously. Small things like meleeing enemies with the crowbar and mounting turrets as well as primitive controls and movement make it seem really amateur for the standards of today. The one thing that makes this game stand out is the level design. The levels aren't only long and adventurous but they manage to cram in so much variety with so few tools and gimmicks. The use of the physics engine as well as the famous gravity gun is particularly commendable. However, the shooting has no weighty feel to it, and weapons don't have any recoil. Enemies take damage with no seeming impact until they die. The characters are almost non-existent because the game's lack of cutscenes prevents any real development in the story. At every point when you play Half-Life 2, you feel like you're using compiled C code rather than playing a video game. It just feels like software that's made for a specific purpose. Although the voice acting, lip-syncing and attention to detail in the environments are all top notch, the main gameplay of Half-Life 2 is just plain bland and boring despite the varied levels. It's definitely an overrated game.","timestamp_created":1385482226,"timestamp_updated":1385482226,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.335189282894134521","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7767931","author":{"steamid":"76561198076925377","num_games_owned":397,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1078,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":463,"last_played":1485046032},"language":"spanish","review":"Una aventura muy buena.

They know what captures your imagination and how to fulfill it. The Citadel is the perfect example of this. When you emerge into City 17 you see a giant alien skyscrapper in the distance.

You are progressing through a convincingly distopian world where you are the hero. The characters you interact with show true emotion and you want to help them.\n\nAs if all this wasn't good enough, Valve created a port of Half Life 2 for the Oculus Rift earlier this year. Playing Half Life in the Oculus is an experience to not be forgotten. You get a whole new understanding of the craftmanship that went into each model design. You see the whirring gears in the flying cameras!\n\nThis game is a masterpiece and a landmark in video game history. If for some reason you haven't played it, buy it.

Fue premiado como juego de la década en los VGA Awards. El premio lo recibió Gabe Newell, fundador de Valve.\n\nEl juego transcurre 20 años después del incidente de Black Mesa del Half Life ( El juego que recuerdo con mayor cariño de los que he jugado). Gordon Freeman despierta de su hibernación en Ciudad 17 donde forma parte de la resistencia para enfrentarse al imperio Combine e intentar derrotarlo. En el juego Gordon conoce a Alyx Vance quien forma parte de la resistencia. El juego es uno de los pioneros en introducir un compañero de juego.\n\nHalf Life 2 presenta diferentes enemigos. Los Headcrabs siguen produciendo esa sensación de rechazo característica cuando atacan. La acción es vertiginosa pero tiene pausas, no como juegos del tipo Call of Duty donde uno se la pasa disparando sin respirar. \n\nLa narrativa se implementa a lo largo del videojuego, no es contada con grabadores o notas, no es necesario, la experiencia es brillante. El motor Source permite buen manejo de físicas y la introducción de un arma nueva. El cañón de gravedad. La tecnología permite además espacios abiertos en el exterior además de los tradicionales pasadizos y espacios internos.  \n\nSu manejo de la narrativa, la física y los puzzles cambiaron la forma en que se desarrollaron los siguientes juegos en primera persona. Fue un punto de inflexión en los juegos de la misma forma que  lo fue el primer Half Life. \n\nEl juego se lanzó para PC bajo windows, requería un procesador de 2 Ghz. 512 MB de ram y una tarjeta gráfica compatible con Direct X 8.1.  Por los pocos recursos que pedía en ese momento la calidad gráfica del juego era muy buena y corria en forma muy fluida. \n\nEste es uno de los juegos que debe ser jugado si uno se toma en serio ser un Gamer, no solo por su calidad sino por formar parte de la historia de los videojuegos.","timestamp_created":1385434600,"timestamp_updated":1385434658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.714935541152954102","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7755746","author":{"steamid":"76561198023054863","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":833,"last_played":1369340454},"language":"english","review":"Epic story line and the puzzle solving is epic.

Great gameplay mechanics and maybe too many physics puzzles involving seesaws.","timestamp_created":1385418068,"timestamp_updated":1385418068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492424249649047852","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7749969","author":{"steamid":"76561198083498356","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3057,"last_played":1557522380},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 2 is without a doubt one of the greatest games I have ever played in my life. I have no problem saying that it is my number one favorite. Even today, the physics engine is extraordinary and is still being used in games today. An entire generation of game making, mod making, and even short films was all born from this one game, and that still blows my mind.\n\nThe story is just as intense as a Hollywood movie. You care about the characters and you really want to help your allies and strike down your enemies. It is an incredibly immersive experience. Story wise, the entire Half-Life franchise (especially this installment) make it the best video game franchise in history. Despite what some people say, this game has aged incredibly well. There will be more games in the future, some incredible and some horrible. Maybe the magic of Half-Life 2 will be matched, but I personally believe it will never be exceeded.\n\nI loved this game in every respect. Gameplay, graphics, and story is all 10/10.","timestamp_created":1385417985,"timestamp_updated":1394302380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7749310","author":{"steamid":"76561197984689127","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1626023306},"language":"french","review":"Pas besoin de commentaires...","timestamp_created":1385416906,"timestamp_updated":1385416906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467912495136260986","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7747319","author":{"steamid":"76561197990644750","num_games_owned":1906,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":2774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2274,"last_played":1619136799},"language":"english","review":"Pick up this review.\n\nGood.

Although it was originally released almost a decade ago, it still stands as one of the greatest PC games of all time. You play as Gordon Freeman, a silent scientist fighting against an extra-dimensional empire that has conquered earth.\n\nGameplay is fun and engaging, and rarely ever feels monotonous. Whenever the game starts to feel boring, it will introduce something totally new, keeping the game from becoming repetitive. You have a variety of different guns and weapons at your disposal, including the powerful Gravity Gun that lets you weaponize the environment. Valve's Source engine was created for this game, and they used it well to create an interactive environment for you to explore. You'll run into the occasional physics puzzle that helps keep the game interesting.\n\nThe story is intriguing and makes you really care about the characters and what is happening. It also doesn't waste too much time forcing exposition down your throat with long cutscenes. Speaking of the cutscenes, there really aren't any. When characters are talking to you, you are free to walk around and interact with things. This may not seem like a big deal, but it really makes the game feel so much more immersive.\n\nThere are a handful of things that I don't particularly like about Half Life 2, but they are fairly nit-picky things that really don't detract too much from the game. For instance, I'm not a huge fan of the lack of ADS, which has since then become a standard for FPS games. However, it isn't a huge deal, and aiming with the crosshairs works fine. Also, the driving parts of the game are a little too long for my taste, but it isn't a huge deal.\n\nOverall, this is a spectacular game, a must-play for any PC gamer.","timestamp_created":1385412063,"timestamp_updated":1385412319,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516245484352111816","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7746148","author":{"steamid":"76561198027918500","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1658597247},"language":"english","review":"Even though the game was released over 9 years ago, it still holds up. Great story, great characters and character animation. Contains differing environments and plenty of weapons and enemies to keep the game fresh throughout. The dated visuals are still very, very charming. Even if you buy it and never play it, you will still spend your money wisely because just having the game in your library is worth the $10.

The graphics are outdated for sure, but they work together in a way that negates any low resolution! I love the story. There is little exposition, and you're really thrown into a world that doesn't give a shit if you pay attention to it or not. \nThere are countless little details you can find with each new playthrough, and they all make the game feel so much more alive! Physics puzzels can get annoying at times, and I don't recommend stacking barrels to ANYONE who wants to retain their sanity, but the atmosphere and story more than make up for it. \n\nThe people ingame feel like real people, even though only about 5-6 of them are really CHARACTERS. The generic people in the world still feel like people, and they say people things, they DO people things! Only a stupid physics puzzle has ever broken my immersion in this game.
