The level design and texture-mapping, for a four year old game, are just as impressive as the character development. I was surprised to see how much work went into the test chambers, and found myself genuinely annoyed by the difficulties I faced trying to solve each one. For a puzzle/adventure game, I would suggest Portal 2 before any other I've played.
