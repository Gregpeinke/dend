Gra, której nie chciałem recenzować. Nie, dlatego że tak gra jest tak zła tylko, dlatego że to jest produkcja, o której mógłbym rozmawiać godzinami. Pierwsza gra, jaką kupiłem na xbox 360, pierwsza gra, jaką kupiłem na steamie, pierwsza gra, którą na xboxie zrobiłem na 100%. Mam po prostu do tej produkcji olbrzymi sentyment i nawet teraz w nią gram, chociaż fabułę i wszystkie zagadki znam praktycznie na pamięć. Mimo tego jest w tej produkcji coś, przez co bardzo przyjemnie mi się do Portala wraca, ale zacznijmy od początku.[/b]\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]FABUŁA[/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\nWcielamy się w Chell, protagonistkę z pierwszej odsłony. Po raz kolejny, próbujemy się uwolnić od sztucznej inteligencji znanej, jako GLADOS, tylko, że tym razem pomaga nam pocieszny kolega znany, jako wheatlej. Osobiście uważam, że fabuła Portala nie jest jej najmocniejszą stroną, ale tutaj mi się bardzo podobała. \n\nPierwsza część według mnie była pod tym względem bardzo bezuczuciowa. Tutaj jest inaczej. Bohaterowie mają niezłe poczucie humoru, a sama fabuła nie jest tak przewidywalna. No dobra w niektórych miejscach jest, ale to bardziej specjalnie twórcy zrobili, żeby pokazać pewne cechy określonej postaci. \n\nOczywiście jak w każdej grze Valve nasz protagonista jest całkowicie niemy (w sumie to niema). Poza tym w tej części dowiadujemy się bardzo dużo o wydarzeniach przed Portalem 1 i nawet wcześniej, dodatkowo w drugiej połowie gry jest kilka nawiązań do half life’a.\n\nNaprawdę nieźle.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]GRAFIKA[/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\nNie mam tutaj za dużo do powiedzenia. Grafika w tej grze jest po prostu piękna i praktycznie się nie zestarzała. Gra ma już 11 lat i wygląda jakby była zrobiona w 2019 / 2020. Jeszcze się nie spotkałem z grą, która się zestarzała tak dobrze (no dobra wyjątkiem jest Dead Space z 2008).\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]ROZGRYWKA[/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\nRozgrywka jest praktycznie taka sama jak w jedynce tylko o wiele bardziej rozbudowana. Wciąż rozwiązujemy zagadki za pomocą dwóch portali, żeby przejść do kolejnego poziomu. Wiele elementów Portala 1 zostały przeniesione do sequela oraz pojawiło się kilka nowych pomysłów. \n\nZacznijmy może od tego, co zostało usunięte (nie jest tego dużo, ale można wspomnieć). Wieżyczki strzelające rakietami, kule energetyczne (te dziadostwa, co jak się w nie wejdzie to umiera, ten, kto grał oryginał to wie) i lawa zostały całkowicie usunięte.\n\nI teraz możemy powiedzieć, co zostało dodane (bo jest tego o wiele wiele więcej). Oto lista (przynajmniej według mnie) najważniejszych rzeczy, jakie zostały dodane: katapulty, laser, kostki odbijające laser, świetlne mosty, chodzące kostki, żele (pomarańczowy, niebieski i biały – co one robią nie będę mówił sami dojdziecie ;) ), tunele powietrzne i oczywiście Wheatlej (o którym, przedtem wspomniałem).\n\nI wiecie, co? Portal 2 ma o wiele ciekawsze i trudniejsze zagadki niż oryginał. W ogóle sequel jest dłuższy. Nie wiem o ile dokładnie, ale jak próbowałem speedrunować obydwie części to Portala 1 przeszedłem w 1,5h, a Portal 2 ponad 3h.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]MULTIPLAYER[/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\nNajważniejszy rzeczą, jaka pojawiła się w Portalu 2 jest dwu osobowy coop. I powiem szczerze ja przy nim bawiłem się naprawdę naprawdę dobrze. Zagadki są jeszcze trudniejsze niż na singlu i przy okazji nie nużą. W multiku też jest kawałek fabuły, ale, akurat to można ominąć, bo nie ma on jakiegoś olbrzymiego wpływu na historię z singla.\n\nPoza tym w portalu 2 zamiast map wyzwaniowych pojawił się kreator map. Ja osobiście nie tęsknie za tamtymi mapami, bo bardziej się męczyłem niż bawiłem przy nich. I o dziwo ten creator jest naprawdę fajny. Posiada dużo opcji, i jakimś cudem można dodać nawet więcej (nie wiem, jak, ale można).\n\nOczywiście można też grać w mapy innych graczy, albo w coopie albo solo i tutaj jedynym problemem według mnie jest skrajna, jakość tych map. Raz trafimy na specjalnie zmodyfiakowaną mapę, przez co twórcy map dodają przedmioty, których nie ma normalnie w grze, albo trafiamy na jakąś trudną, ale przyjemną do grania zagadkę. Niestety 3 mapy później możemy trafić na coś, co wygląda jakby ktoś dopiero się uczył używać kreatora i nie wiadomo, dlaczego to swoje grzebanie udostępnił.\n\n(btw zrobiłem jedną mapę xd. (nie jest jakaś najlepsza, ale jak chcesz to proszę bardzo))\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2496534284\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]PODSUMOWANIE[/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\nI oto cały Portal 2. Znakomity i sequel i znakomita gra. Lepsza od oryginału pod każdym względem. Poza tym to jest jedna z najlepszych gier coopowych, w jakie grałem. Oczywiście jak chcesz zagrać w Portala 1 to nie zakazuję, bo to też jest dobra produkcja, ale tak jak mówiłem sequel jest lepszy pod każdym względem.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]CZY POLECAM[/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\nDefinitywnie tak\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]CENA[/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\nGra jest bardzo tania, a na promocji jeszcze tańsza, więc opłaca się nawet za pełną cenę\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]OCENA\nFabuła 9/10\nGrafika 10/10\nRozgrywka 10/10\nMultiplayer 9/10\nPrzyjemność z grania 99999999+/10 (a tak na serio to 10/10)\nRAZEM: 9,6/10\n[hr][/hr]","timestamp_created":1605614569,"timestamp_updated":1643668275,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79410015","author":{"steamid":"76561198274646399","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1080,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":713,"last_played":1639779129},"language":"russian","review":"10 картошек из 10","timestamp_created":1605614261,"timestamp_updated":1645856244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79409904","author":{"steamid":"76561198134831809","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":13321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":12,"playtime_at_review":11847,"last_played":1660158704},"language":"english","review":"[h1] Portal 2 [/h1]\n[b]General[/b]\nGenre: Puzzle\nPlay time: 8 hours for singleplayer, add bout' 5 hours if you play co-op.\nAchievements: 51\nPlayers: 2 (Co-op)\nFor ages: Almost anyone can enjoy it.\n[b]Modding[/b]\nWorkshop: Maps only.\nSteam Store Mods: Everthing from VR to essentially Portal 3\nAdvanced Modding tools: Yes, but only for windows.\nMap/Character creator: Built-in.\n[b]Recommended Specs[/b]\n〇 Toaster\n〇 Dusty Laptop from your attic\n⬤ Macbook from 5 years ago\n〇 Your work PC\n〇 Fairly recent PC\n〇 Gaming PC\n〇 RTX 3090\n[b]Hat's n' Stuff[/b]\nEarnable items: I think.\nBuyable items: Yes.\nAre they cosmetic: Yes.\n[b]In conclusion[/b]\nPortal 2 is an awesome game that has stood the test of time, and will run on most anything.\nI really recommend you buy it, on-sale or not.
