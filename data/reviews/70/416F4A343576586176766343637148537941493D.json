Сюжет в Half-Life конечно же великолепен, и даже как по мне лучше не побоюсь это сказать, чем во второй Half-Life. Что касается оружия: советую вам играть без HD моделек, т.к они хуже, чем оригинальные, но это всего лишь совет и поэтому никто не запрещает с ними играть. Если вам стало скучно после финала игры, то попробуйте как я пройти по несколько раз на Hard'е, тогда может вам и станет весело) В общем я написал все что хотел, и могу сказать только одно: если вы купили или собираетесь покупать Half-Life: Source то тем кто купил желаю только удачи, ведь в сурс версии она деградированна и испорчена своими текстурами и багами, все это из за стим пайпа, который поломал сурс версию игры, так что играйте в оригинал.)
