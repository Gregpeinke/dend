Unlike other shooter games before it, it told a story with dialogue in integrated cutscenes, and without walls of texts in between stand-alone levels. The game just kind of flows from start to finish seamlessly. I can definitely appreciate it for what it is.\n\nYou follow the story of research assistant/guinea pig Gordon Freeman, as his employer's top secret research facility unintentionally opens up a portal to another dimension, aliens invade, and the government sends in black ops to kill all witnesses and clean up. Everyone but your coworkers are out to get you and you need to help each other to stay alive and figure out what the hell is happening. Pretty cool, I got a lot of HP Lovecraft and John Carpenter's The Thing vibes from this one, and the early game feels almost a little survival horror-y.\n\nThis game has a lot of problems though, that I feel people may unfairly give this game a pass on that they wouldn't let slide with other games, even other older ones. Now, I played on hard mode, full disclosure (as a rule of thumb, if there are 3 or fewer difficulties, I choose the hardest one, and if there are 4 or more, I choose the second highest. It usually keeps games challenging and also keeping the BS factor down), so this may have affected my experience, although rarely was my problem \"there isn't enough health or ammo!\", and only with the black mesa paramilitary ops did they seem to take like 4000 bullets, so I don't think that's the case.\n\nThis game relies HEAVILY on platforming sections, which this game is a prime example of why platforming is GOD AWFUL in the first person and DOES NOT WORK 99% of the time. It's just to difficult to gauge where you are, build and lose momentum, you clip on things you don't mean, a SLIGHT change in elevation in your running start will insta-kill you when you lose all your momentum and miss your mark, the list goes on. This game I had to save scum at every jump. It just got worse and worse as it went on, with the final areas and final boss being unbearable. \n\nThe other mortal FPS sin this game commits is enemies spawning immediately in front of you or right behind you. This is just complete BS and no game should get away with it. It adds to the save scumming when I'm short on HP and die simply cause Gaben thought it'd be funny to throw a lightning casting alien that deals a fifth of a full health bar of damage right behind me as I'm walking through a hallway I just cleared. There's fair challenge, then there's the designer just being an a*shole. \n\nThe third mortal FPS sin this game commits is sections where you must take mandatory damage to proceed. This builds off the previous point of enemies getting in cheap shots and adding to the necessity of save scumming, as there are certain areas where, for example, the vent gives in and you fall to the ground and take maybe 20 or 30 damage. Okay, sure, but what if I just saved a moment before, and only have 20-30 HP? You're f*cked. You have to reload an auto save from 20 minutes ago and get through a few action segments taking minimal damage. It's also BS.\n\nBy the time I was wrapping up with this game, I was just done. If the good aspects of this game were a little better, or if there were fewer problems, I'd have given this an upvote. The price is insane, though, in the game's favor (they practically give this game away on sale, it's like $0.40-$0.80). Honestly, I'd only recommend this game if you've already played Doom 1&2, Duke Nukem 3D, Turok, and Quake 1&2. I preferred all of those games over this one, and honestly, if you're new to the classic FPS scene and HAVE NOT played those games, do yourself a favor and play those first. They're less aggravating, even though they also all have their fair share of the good ol' 90's BS.\n\nBut, even if you have already played all those, play this one on normal mode. The game is more about the adventure, atmosphere, and action set pieces anyway, and not so much on the gunplay or challenge.\n\nEDIT: Also, Gordon throws like a b*tch. A toddler can throw a wiffleball with more distance and intensity than Gordon can throw a 'nade. I know he's got a PhD, but he still needs to hit the gym.","timestamp_created":1563375540,"timestamp_updated":1563416899,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495041966438293457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54144729","author":{"steamid":"76561198060336660","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1107,"last_played":1570970016},"language":"english","review":"I can see why people rate this so highly after playing it.
