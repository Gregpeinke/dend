Die Rätzel werden stetig schwerer und forderder. Die lernkurve geht bis zu einem bestimmten punkt gut mit. Aber irgendwann wird sie einfach zu steil was die herausforderung der einzelnen spielabschnitte zu harten Kopfnüsen werden lasst was dem ganzen aber kein abbruch tut. Man hat einfach immer wieder die motivation hinter die Mechanik des jeweiligen Levelabschnitts zu kommen um weiter voranzuschreiten :) \n\nDer Ganze spass wird nocheinmal gesteigert durch dem Steamworkshop der wirklich alles auf den kopfstellt was harte Rätzel angeht. Es gibt leichte, mittlere, schwere und sehr sehr schwere Rätzel wo man sich doch einfach irgendwann wirklich denkt es gibt keine lösung aber es gibt sie dann doch irgendwie. Das macht dieses spiel so Zeitlos und Inovativ. \nSteamworkshop sei dank wird man immer wieder mit neuem Levelmaterial versorgt.\n\nWer sich eher als Levelerschaffer sieht und anderen mal einen harte Kopfnuss vorsetzten will kann dies mit dem Leveleditor tuen der im Spiel mitgeliefert wird. \n\nAusserdem Kann man mit einem Freund im koop Spielen und auch dafür hat der workshop nachschub damit auch der Koop spass janicht zu kurz kommt\n\nDieses spiel muss man einfach gespielt haben es ist jeden Euro wert....\n\nDa fällt mir ein ich muss ja noch an meinem Level weiterbauen ;)","timestamp_created":1513363894,"timestamp_updated":1513363971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539923965930938721","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38330724","author":{"steamid":"76561198121751647","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":993,"last_played":1594285002},"language":"english","review":"Fun if u play with Felix See","timestamp_created":1513361928,"timestamp_updated":1513361928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38330672","author":{"steamid":"76561198305209372","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1076,"last_played":1590134334},"language":"english","review":"Fun if u play with lee hong tuck","timestamp_created":1513361803,"timestamp_updated":1513361803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38330559","author":{"steamid":"76561198167463067","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":725,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":725,"last_played":1513412198},"language":"russian","review":"Господи, это было потресающе, спасибо валв за этот легендарный шедевр","timestamp_created":1513361483,"timestamp_updated":1513361483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38330327","author":{"steamid":"76561198239766538","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1214,"last_played":1656543443},"language":"turkish","review":"eğer zekanız ileri seviye ise co-op un yaklaşık 15 saatlik story si var amma velakin bizim  gibi salak iseniz yaklaşık 24 saat sürebiliyor kesinlikle almanız gereken bir oyun","timestamp_created":1513360774,"timestamp_updated":1513360774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38329189","author":{"steamid":"76561198116251159","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1626,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1254,"last_played":1640407220},"language":"brazilian","review":"Épico.","timestamp_created":1513357759,"timestamp_updated":1513357759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38328846","author":{"steamid":"76561197967036083","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":588,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":445,"last_played":1428701972},"language":"german","review":"Anspruchsvolle Rätsel mit gewohnter Mechanik und unterhaltsamer Story.

Turret koroları, still alive, want your gone gibi harika müziklere sahip Portal serisi.\n\nOyunun atmosferi çok garip, öyle bir oyun ki bitirdikten sonra garip hissediyorsunuz, oyunun içeriklerini gördüğünüzde mutlu oluyorsunuz ve bitirdğinize üzülüyorsunuz, tesisin altlarında eski ses kayıtlarını dinlerken sanki cidden bir şeyler hissediyorsunuz, insanın içine işleyen bir yapısı var bu oyunun, Valve gerçekten insan üstü bir oyun yapmış.\n\nToparlamak gerekirse, Robotları, bilimsel şeyleri ve akıl oyunlarını seviyorsanız, bu güzel oyunu alın, etkisinden uzun süre çıkamayacaksınız.\n\nZaten oyun indirimlerde her indirimlerde 3 liraya düşüyor.","timestamp_created":1513199557,"timestamp_updated":1513201802,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38288352","author":{"steamid":"76561198055812985","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1525,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":849,"last_played":1633372810},"language":"english","review":"one of the best games i've ever played .\nsome of the test chambers are realy challenging and there is more challenge and fun in co-op missions.\n\ndont miss co-op missions pick your best friend and have fun.\nit took about 7.9 hrs for solo-player and 6.1 hrs for co-op missions to be done.","timestamp_created":1513198959,"timestamp_updated":1542888459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38288059","author":{"steamid":"76561198299870560","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":46,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46,"last_played":1506426763},"language":"english","review":"EASY STUPID GAME WASTE OF TIME","timestamp_created":1513198006,"timestamp_updated":1513198006,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.302367687225341797","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38287813","author":{"steamid":"76561198262160021","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":145,"playtime_forever":904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":547,"last_played":1613391250},"language":"polish","review":"Polecam tą grę główne dlatego że potrafi wciągnąć, i to na długo... bardzo dobrze wykonany edytor poziomów... w sumie nie mam zastrzeżeń dla tego produktu, lecz działka mogły zadawać większe obrażenia...","timestamp_created":1513197059,"timestamp_updated":1513197059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497175127267837524","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38287765","author":{"steamid":"76561198128573874","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":156,"playtime_forever":1791,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":608,"last_played":1527500537},"language":"russian","review":"Что говорить то  ?

This concept is what most gamers like. Puzzle game is a Game where your brain and logical patterns being tested and pushed to the limit, and this game shows the best way to do it. Its a Fun gameplay to say the least, and there's so many things you can do and don't in this game for sure.\n\n[b]First Impression, i expect this game has to be a \"Better Puzzle Than Its Predecessor\" and turns out its totally true[/b]\n\nGame logics, Features and Maps, Story and The Universe evolves around it is definitely one of the best gameplay experience i have ever seen.

Valve keeping it simple while remains valuable to the players and most of the time you dont need to find a clue about what is going on since the game itself would tell you the story in each scene, seconds and seconds to be wasted and Hours to be translated.

There are many new \"Test Features\" as GLaDOS said xD and this elements makes the game more alive and tends to be more interesting than ever before. Music also takes alot of part in this game, BGM was great and i enjoy this as the main pros than the first series.\n\n[b]Overall[/b]\n\nNothing to say.

It is almost the same thing as the other game but it has better textures, history, and it is easier to learn to play and of course the puzzles of this game are more difficult and the cool thing about the game is that it now has a level editor that can make your own puzzles only I think they could put more things because they have few things in the editor. What made the Portal 2 famouswas that now has a new mode that is the \"Co-op\" and in this way you and your friend or other player controls 2 robots of GLaDOS that are called \"Atlas\" and \"P-body\" and has a different story in this game mode. Unfortunately I could not do the \"Co-op\" mode until the end, but the end of the singleplayer is very good besides having added several new cubes and obstacles. I recommend this game if you like puzzles games and if you liked portal 1 you will like this too.\n\nSorry if my English is bad.\n\nComo dá pra ver, esse é o segundo jogo do portal. É quase a mesma coisa do que o outro jogo só que esse tem texturas melhores, historia, e é mais facil de aprender a jogar e é claro que os puzzles desse jogo são mais dificil e o legal do jogo é que agora tem level editor podendo fazer as suas proprias puzzles só eu acho que podiam colocar mais coisas porque tem poucas coisas no editor. E oque deixo o portal 2 famoso foi que agora tem um novo modo que é o \"Co-op\" e nesse modo você  e seu amigo ou outro player controla 2 robos da GLaDOS que são chamados  \"Atlas\" e \"P-body\" e tem uma historia diferente nesse modo de jogo. Infelizmente não consegui fazer o modo \"Co-op\" até o final, mas o final do singleplayer é muito bom alem de terem adicionado varios novos cubos e obstaculos.
