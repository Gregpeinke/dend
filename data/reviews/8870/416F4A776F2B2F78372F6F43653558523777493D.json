Начнём с геймплея: уровни сложности очень несбалансированные. На среднем уровне игра очень лёгкая и скучная из-за отсутствия челленджа, а на высоком уровне игра начинает раздражать, враги превращаются в губки для впитывания урона - в общем, нет золотой середины. Игровой процесс ничем выдающемся не отличается, местами скучный, шутерная механика мне не понравилось, половина плазмидов (способностей) просто бесполезна. В общем, геймплей слабый середняк. Сюжет неплох, но только в одном случае - вы смотрите его на ютубе, иначе это п***@. Почти весь сюжет и лор раскиданы в журналах и записках и не дай бог вам пропустить лишь одну - вы просто потеряете весь смысл. К середине игры я на сюжет давно забил, ибо невозможно постигать его только через записки - самый халтурный способ рассказать историю. Да и даже если вы посмотрите сюжет на ютубе, будет много незакрытых вопросов без ответа и некоторых сюжетных несостыковок. Единственная положительная сторона игры для меня - красивый воздушный город и некоторые интересные герои.

I would also say personal preference aside, this game deserves to be within a top 50 list of best games ever created.\n\nI was immediately pulled in by its cartoony-design, steampunk style and the fact it claimed it was \"story-rich\", and let me tell you, this game is the furthest thing from a mindless fps. With the smartest story I've ever experienced in a video game(which also features a lot of foreshadowing and plot twists), and will most likely remain in that position for a very long time, it's honestly beyond movie-level material- this story, while confusing with how smart it is, is insane. Once you have finished the campaign once, you will want to replay it almost instantly(which is something I have never felt before), just to experience the craziness and brilliance of this game, pick up on all the foreshadowing and meet the characters again- and if you're genius enough or paying insane attention, you might be able to piece together the ending before it happens on the first playthrough. Not once have I been bored during my second playthrough. It will no doubt leave you with millions of questions but in a good way- because the story is so smart and well thought out, it even lead me to wonder how much messy planning it would take to make a story like this work out so well, to which I say extreme props to them, it can't have been easy at all making such a genius game and one that deserves infinite praise, way more than it gets. (Personally took me quite a long time to hear about this.)\n\nI want to talk about Bioshock Infinite's characters early in the review. Booker Dewitt and Elizabeth are two insanely good characters which you can connect with and adore instantly- with Elizabeth being, without a damn doubt, the best female video game character ever created. They handled her perfectly, with an extremely likeable personality and depth that most people are going to love, believe me, you can't play this game without loving Elizabeth- I can't even begin to fathom how anybody could dislike such a perfectly created character- and actually, her presence in this game was a large reason I even wanted to play it because you can tell she's a great addition before even experiencing this; she offers so much more than just a lacking, damsel-in-distress companion, and a large reason why I hold this game so close to my heart. The character development in this game certainly doesn't stop with the two main protagonists- it extends into every other character in the game including Comstock, Daisy Fitzroy, Lutece Twins, etc who are INSANELY IMPORTANT roles in the story. I don't think there was even one character who doesn't offer something important. Basically, this game beyond excelled at its character designs and stories, not one character irritated me.\nAs soon as I first saw the Songbird in this game, I fell in love with it, seriously. Something about its design and overall character; absolute perfection and I very much enjoyed its presence for those reasons- I'm also glad that it made \"Rescuing Elizabeth\" not seem like an easy task.\n\nI wasn't overly sure what to expect when I first began playing, I didn't know what Vigors even were, and it was great to experience being so unaware of how much it actually offers- it surprised me. I didn't expect as much as what this game offers- it out-shined any previous assumptions I had by a long shot. I want to mention the Vigors more though- basically abilities similar to powers in a way, which you will find more of as you play(which were fun to discover to see which the next would offer), giving you many different ways to deal with people and even the machines(with the Possession vigor), and leading you to think more about how to deal with the enemies rather than mindless shooting the entire way through the game- because damn, what an insanely great and fun addition to make this game more unique than an ordinary fps, a little but also huge design and implementation that adds a lot more specialisation to the city of Columbia.\nAs for the enemies in this game, I didn't expect anything less from a game like this. It has its share of common and rare enemies, the hardest and rarest of which being Handymen which definitely didn't offer a relaxing time to deal with- in fact, on Hard and 1999, were really challenging. The main \"Heavy Hitter\" enemies in this game for the most part include Patriots, Crows, Firemen and Handymen. You will have to be smart and think about what Vigors will work best against these specifically.\n\nAs for Bioshock Infinite's difficulty- play on hard. The game explains its difficulty when you're selecting it, recommending hard for those who are experienced with fps games- but most enemies in Easy are defeated in one hit. I never played on Medium, but Hard seemed like the perfect difficulty for this game. After you complete it the first time around, you will unlock the \"1999 Mode\", which is the hardest difficulty and one I'm glad they decided to implement, because \"Hard\" seemed like a title it didn't deserve as it wasn't overly challenging at all except in a couple of places. And of course, you will receive achievements depending on the difficulty level you played it at. 1999 Mode is certainly a challenge, but with enough carefulness you can beat it with pride and limited stress.\n\nAs for the achievements in this game. . . perfect. It has its share of difficult and easy ones, none which were overly easy, still requiring some work to get them, and none downright impossible. Absolutely flawless and everything a completionist could ask for to feel satisfied and proud after completing a game perfectly. I couldn't ask for more.\n\nI haven't played the other Bioshock games before, but clearly you don't have to to enjoy this game to its full extent. I know there are some references to previous games, but I would definitely recommend starting with Bioshock Infinite. Finally, to sum it up, this game will touch you personally and emotionally, you will adore it.\n\n[u] [b] !!!SPOILERS!!! [/b] [/u] ONLY READ IF YOU'VE FINISHED THE GAME - There is a plot twist at the end, which the game foreshadows towards, which reveal that Booker and Elizabeth are actually related.
