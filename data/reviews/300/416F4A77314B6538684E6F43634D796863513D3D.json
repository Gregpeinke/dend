malincuore recensisco negativamente questo gioco per i seguenti motivi:\n1) Logica del danno fatta malissimo\n2) sistema delle classi fatto male es: se tu vuoi andare cecchino devi essere stra rapido a selezionare la classe perchè se arriva uno prima di te tu devi cambiare classe e quindi dire addio al cecchino, in poche parole se non ti muovi a scegliere la classe che vuoi ti ritrovi che sei COSTRETTO a sceglierne un altra.\n3) IL PUNTO PEGGIORE DI STO GIOCO SONO LE ARMI ossia logica del danno di merda come scritto sopra MA SOPRATTUTTO la cosa peggiore è il RINCULO ABNORME DELLE ARMI, completamente ingestibili, es il supporto con HMG che a primo impatto direte \"cazzo che armona che è questa\", già ma non appena provate a sparare SENZA METTENDO IL BIPODE rincullera in una maniera OMFG  che sembra che stai sparando con un cannone o oppure è il soldato che è uno stecchino e quindi spara e vola via lui perche omg è ingestibile cioè al SECONDO COLPO CHE SPARI SENZA BIPODE la visuale è gia in cielo...per fari capire che rinculo ESAGERATO A DIR POCO ha sta arma e quindi per sparare bene sei costretto a 1) SDRAIARTI PER TERRA E METTERE IL BIPODE ALLA CAMPER o 2) TROVARE UN PUNTO ALTO TIPO UN MURETTO SU CUI APPOGIARVI, li allora oneshotta anche a cross the map, la classe assalto invece cioè il thompson e mp40 sei costretto a continuare a premere per sparare senno rincula troppo e i due cecchini oneshottano ache se spari al piede, poi cè la classe con il lanciarazzi ma fa cagare al cazzo...\n4) LO SCATTO è PEGGIO DI QUELLO DI TUTTI I COD PRIMA DI AW, fa 2 M il soldato muore o sbocca peggio di cod veramente, almeno su cod ci sono i perk qui manco quelli....\n5) poi vabbe la gente che ti trovi dipende, ci sono quelli bravi ma ci son anche i BM ma vabbe è normale questi ci son ovunque.\n6) NOIA perchè non sali neanche di livello, non sblocchi niente e non cambia niente.\n\nL unica cosa che forse ci sta di sto gioco sono le mappe che almeno quelle son carine..\n\nche dire io a primo impatto mi sembrava un gioco bello e da provare ma poi ho scoperto che è tutto meno che uno sparattutto per via della logica di merda delle armi....fatto completamente male a parere mio.\nDELUSIONE TOTALE, lo sconsiglio a tutti a malincuore, non fatevi ingannare dal trailer e dalle immagini perchè non è niente di quello che vedete.\n\nper quelli che magari romperanno le palle perchè magari ho fatto errori grammaticali sappiate che qui non mene frega niente perchè ci metterei 1 giorno se dovessi stare attento al minimo errore e non ho voglia.....\n\nSPERO CHE VI SIA UTILE LA MIA RECENSIONE, grazie per la

It may be old yes but you will still find plenty of servers. Unlike the original DoD, it only has multiplayer although you can make a server yourself and I believe with a bit of tinkering adding bots is possible. Unlike BF1 or CoD, its fairly historically accurate, especially the weapons. The Germans have guns like the MP40, STG44 and the Karabiner 98 Kurz. The Americans have the M1 Garand, a Tommy gun and a Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). As it is  WW2, the maps are cities or towns and games can be fast-paced due to rushes and machine-guns. The game isn't much for bolt-action rifles, as the only ones are the Kar98k and the M1 Garand which is semi automatic. And for the playerbase? Well there are heaps of servers, but the key is finding the right time so that the servers are almost full.\n\nTL;DR, this game is an oldie but a goodie, definitely up there in the best WW2 FPS. Unfortunately, due to its age and the fact it's a Valve game, the graphics aren't very good. That can be a good thing for people who don't have very good gaming rigs, and a bad thing because it's 2017.\nMy rating: 9.5/10.

It is a Class-Based FPS MMO World War II Simulator featuring the U.S. VS Wehrmacht.\n\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n-Looks nice for the time it was created.\n-Gameplay is smooth and fun.\n-Can't capture points unless there are two people on it.\n-Only a select few classes so that everybody has a role to play. Assault,Support,Sniper,Rifle-Man,Launcher-Man.\n-Only with certain guns you can aim down the sights. I like this, it proves challenging and teaches you to handle recoil.\n-Killing people is realistic, It doesn't take to long nor is it too easy to kill someone. \n-Shovel\n-I HAVE SOOOOO MUCH FPS MUHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAH\n-You can break a wardrobe with your bare fist.\n-Realistic aiming sights.\n\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n-Sadly, it gets boring after a while. Maybe skins and customization would give this game some life.\n-There are die hard real world veterans and veteran supporters in this game. Don't piss them off.\n-The community is pretty bad.\n-Can't play offline with bots without a mod.\n-Needs more game-modes.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's pretty fun, if want to add some spice to the game, just go to gamebanana and download some mods. I would recommend this realistic team based FPS.\n\n\n\n[i]Day of Defeat: Source Review written by Todosur.
