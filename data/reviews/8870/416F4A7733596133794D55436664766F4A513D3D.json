While I didn't play any of these two, I can definietely say that Bioshock Infinite deserves to be called Game of the Year.\n\nMany FPS games today are basically multiplayer with little to no single player campaign. This is not the case. This is a big, well-made singleplayer adventure set in the floating city of Columbia , in the year 1912. The story is told in a good way with all the cutscenes done in-game.\n\nGraphically, the game is stunning, the environment are beautiful and sometimes artistic and the lighting effects are amazing. The characters have a rather semi-realistic look, nut that doesn't mean the game is not serious. This is what this genre lacks in general: COLORS. It's really nice to see a living, more colorful areas instead of gray or brown. The animations were smooth and nice too.\n\nI really liked the music and all those radios etc. playing in the city. It really makes you feel like you're the part of the world. I really liked the voice acting as well. \n\nWhen it comes to gameplay... I loved it, and I'm not a great fan of first person shooters. You get to use a range of different weapons as well as several powers to use against your enemies. The combat is solid and works well. Aside from weapons and powers you can also use melee attacks with a Sky-Hook that also allows you to cling onto freight hooks and go along rails in the air which is awesome. There're other things to do aside from just going to your goal and killing those who oppose you. All throught the world you'll find audio files of different characters, which add some detail to the story, as well as small old-school videos and telescope to look into. Even upgrades for health, salts and shield are often well-hidden, so the game really wants you to explore more, instead of just going from point A to point B. \n\nThe game took 11 hours to beat for me and I have found majority of collectibles, I still had some left. The game still was a little short in my standards. It was still REALLY worth it, especially for the price since I loved every second of it. I loved the presentation, I loved the gameplay, the powers, the characters. It is clearly a game where developers put EFFORT into it.\n\nI'll probably get the DLC and the previous games in the series because I just want more. \n\nClassic Rating:\nGrapics: 10/10\nSound: 10/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nLongetivity: 8/10\nOverall: 10/10","timestamp_created":1398620666,"timestamp_updated":1398620666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503227174282073975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9953925","author":{"steamid":"76561197979113997","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1405,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1405,"last_played":1398960315},"language":"german","review":"Ein Kunstwerk, eine Ode an das beste was Singleplayerspiele bieten können und jedem Onlinespiel voraushaben - eine mitreißende, unvergessliche und einmalige Story.

Также хочется отметить два сюжетных дополения, Burial at Sea Ep.1 и Ep.2, связывающих первую часть 2007-года и Infinite. Они не уступают по сюжету оригинальной игре, + переносят действие в Восторг, написанный заново на новом движке, и выглядящий восхитительно.

The soundtrack and the voices are excellent as well and you really feel like you get immersed into the Bioshock world (Columbia). It's also quite exciting and the story is captivating and makes you want to explore it further to discover what is going on. I like the shooting and combat which is pretty classic first-person shooter. Some parts of the gameplay reminds me slightly of Borderlands but of course Bioshock is a completely different animal. \n\nUnfortunately there are also some not so great things about it, mainly being that it's very linear and won't allow you to deviate much from the path that needs to be followed to move the story along. In fact it restricts you way too much in my opinion and you will find many many doors that are locked and can't be opened and places that can't be accessed. One example is when you are on a beach at one point and there are people playing in the water. If you try to run out in the water you will be blocked as if there was a wall of glass in front of you. I don't need it to be a sandbox game, but I definitely would have enjoyed it better if the developer had allowed me to roam a bit more freely and investigate the game world more freely. \nAnother thing I don't like much is that many of the characters in the game look exactly the same. It would have been nice if everyone looked different, maybe apart from an acutal twin now and then, instead of using generic characters in so many places (NPCs). Likewise you cannot engage with the majority of the characters in the game. You can step up next to them and listen to what they talk about which is a really nice touch which adds lots of ambiance to the game, but you cannot talk to them or interact with them for the most part. I would have liked to be able to do that to some degree. \n\nAll in all I will definitely recommend the game because it is actually really good entertainment and it's definitely one of the best looking games I have played. \n\nHope this review helped and if I change my mind after finishing the game I will update the review accordingly :-)\n\nHave fun!","timestamp_created":1398392890,"timestamp_updated":1398392890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9923926","author":{"steamid":"76561198011200055","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":377,"last_played":1520505158},"language":"english","review":"Best Single player game I played last year with great game play and story. 10/10\nbest game in the series","timestamp_created":1398385154,"timestamp_updated":1398385154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9923535","author":{"steamid":"76561198122547849","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":847,"last_played":1398383312},"language":"english","review":"awful....i havn't been able to stop the glitching to even play..","timestamp_created":1398382214,"timestamp_updated":1398382214,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9923510","author":{"steamid":"76561198050481889","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":1483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1400,"last_played":1395700582},"language":"spanish","review":"Una gran historia que podría haber sido una pelicula , con los defectos que es un juego muy corto y su dinamica de juego muy primitiva , igual a la del juego clive baker´s :Undyng","timestamp_created":1398382099,"timestamp_updated":1398382099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9923489","author":{"steamid":"76561197970502194","num_games_owned":352,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1095,"last_played":1491718972},"language":"english","review":"PLease note that I'm 12 hours in and purchased for 9.99 during a Steam sale.\n\nI think people have become far too nit-picky about this game. As a 60 dollar purchase maybe I'd read the critiques and given them some thought, but at 10 dollars I can't find a way to see this game as anything less than amazing. \n\nSomewhere I read a review that complained how un-interactive the NPCs are (no dialogue trees, etc.) - I didn't expect this game to function like Skyrim, because Skyrim is a role-playing game. This is an artistic and aesthetically pleasing first-person shooter with an interesting enough story to keep you engaged and really gorgeous graphics.\n\nI also have read references to people hating the ending. Haven't gotten there yet. If I end up hating it, so what? The game is a delight to play. \n\nI'll update this after I finish the game.\n\nUpdate: The game was great. The ending was interesting, although I wouldn't say that the ending improved the game (or hurt it even). Made me think, and probably will replay at least some of it to re-assess some of the sequences. It was fun to play! Also, I didn't ever give much thought to the clothing upgrade system.
