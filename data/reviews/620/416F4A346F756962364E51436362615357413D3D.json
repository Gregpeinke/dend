Grave Ritardo, son riuscito a finire anche la seconda avventura del Brand Portal targata, come per il precedente, Valve. Saranno riusciti a creare davvero una pietra miliare dell'industria videoludica?\n\nCOMPRALO PERCHE:\n-Graficamente il titolo è stato realizzato con il Source Engine prima versione (classico per Valve, visto che è fautore e proprietario di questo Motore) con rifiniture ed aggiunte del caso per svecchiarlo un attimino (visivamente si presente decisamente meno vecchio del primo Portal). Il punto forte di questo motore risiede tutto nella fisica (calcolata davvero con un lavoro certosino) anche se, sopratutto i protagonisti presentano una discreta mole poliganale come anche le texture degli ambienti presenti nei vari livelli (sopratutto in quelli singolo). Altro punto di spicco di questo motore è la leggerezza e la relativa scalabilità che, lo rendono, uno dei motori più giocabili (sopratutto in configurazioni vetuste o non propriamente da gioco). Direzione Artistica dell'opera su ottimi livelli (apprezzabile sopratutto nella tonalità del bianco e nella paletta generale dei colori). Insomma, non il Top grafico (oggi come allora) ma si difenderà sempre bene\n-Comparto Sonoro di ottimo livello (per quanto mi riguarda, leggermente inferiore al predecessore) con un ottimo doppiaggio ricco di carisma(peccato solo inglese), buon utilizzo dei rumori ambientali (utili anche in qualche situazione all'interno del gioco) e delle buone Ost di contorno, incalzanti al punto giusto con lo scorre dell'azione a schermo.\n-Ludicamente il titolo si presenta ne più ne meno, con le stesse meccaniche collaudate del primo Portal con le giuste rifiniture e aggiunte. Saremo ancora una volta muniti di Portal Gun e dovremmo, nel corso della nostra avventura, affrontare i vari rompicapi proposti da GLaDOS con ancora più variabili e difficoltà del precedente titolo. Ho citato la difficoltà....il titolo nel suo complesso non è difficile ma fa quello che ben pochi titoli altri titoli riescono a farti fare....cioè pensare e riflettere sulle varie situazioni proposte all'interno del gioco cercando di risolverle. Per quanto mi riguarda, Valve è riuscita davvero a creare un nuovo genere di Rompicapi (o quantomeno è riuscita ad elevarli all'ennesima potenza)\n-Coop del titolo davvero geniale e piacevolissima da giocare, elevando ancor di più il senso di rompicapo offerto dall'avventura singola.\n-La Storia si presenta ricca di colpi scena, nulla di ecletante ma è un piacere seguirla. Impreziosita da un Cast con carisma davvero eccezionale e profondo a modo suo. Sicuramente un netto passo in avanti rispetto al sequel (anche se, in questo capitolo, si è perso un pò il senso di mistero che pervadeva l'avventura del primo). Comunque Godibile dall'inizio alla fine ed, apprezzabile che ve ne sia una slegata, seppur minimale, anche per la modalità Coop del titolo.\n-Longevità del titolo molto alta. Per un completamento della campagna giocatore singolo vi serviranno non meno di 10/11 ore, tempo simile anche per quanto concerne la campagna coop (che ripeto, totalmente slegata). Ovviamente il fattore tempo può variare in positivo ed in negativo in base alla vostra capacità di risoluzione dei vari quadri proposti. Una volta finiti i livelli proposti predefinitvamente dai ragazzi Valve vi aspetta tutti quelli creati dalla Community (che sono davvero un sacco ed alcuni, anche superiori a quelli realizzati dagli stessi programmatori). Se, catturati dalle meccaniche, questo titolo offre ore ed ore di divertimento assicurato e costruttivo\n\nLASCIALO A STEAM\n-Se ritenete i rompicapo un genere che mal si sposa che i vostri gusti\n\nChe dire, Valve ci è riuscita ancora una volta realizzando un titolo che può essere tranquillamente considerato come pietra miliare del genere Rompicapo (sopratutto grazie ad una gestione della fisica davvero superlativa).\nVale davvero tutti i soldi spesi e lo consiglio davvero alla stragande maggioranza dei videogiocatori e non.\n\nVOTO 95/100","timestamp_created":1464125696,"timestamp_updated":1464125696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.666666686534881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23189847","author":{"steamid":"76561198255624548","num_games_owned":235,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":424,"last_played":1612133657},"language":"turkish","review":"Gayet zevkli ve hoş bir oyun bulmacaları kafanızı kullanmanızı gerektiren cinsten ve çözünce işte bu diyorsunuz...","timestamp_created":1464121865,"timestamp_updated":1464121865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23188843","author":{"steamid":"76561198074236917","num_games_owned":239,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":2240,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1213,"last_played":1570947889},"language":"english","review":"Even more perfect","timestamp_created":1464118603,"timestamp_updated":1464118615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23187817","author":{"steamid":"76561198054575023","num_games_owned":313,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":297,"last_played":1634200572},"language":"english","review":"Spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace!","timestamp_created":1464115310,"timestamp_updated":1464115310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23186385","author":{"steamid":"76561198047761871","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4131,"last_played":1462557888},"language":"french","review":"Le gameplay, l'histoire principal, les personnages et l'humour sont juste cultisime !\nLe multi et la possiblité de jouer aux salles de Test crées par d'autres joueurs allonge considérablement la durée de vie du Jeu !","timestamp_created":1464110561,"timestamp_updated":1464110561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23185005","author":{"steamid":"76561198020872599","num_games_owned":464,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1130,"last_played":1544130940},"language":"spanish","review":"[h1][i]Tan sencillo como increíble.[/i][/h1]\nQuizás increíble sea demasiado, pero digamos que es un muy buen título en todos los conceptos.\n\nHay que destacar que siempre se encuentra rebajado en periodos de ofertas.
