La historia es profunda y los personajes son bastante desarrollados en cada dialogo de la historia. Los graficos son asombrosos, el motor Source es una base importante del juego.

El juego tiene muy buena fisica y ademas de poseer el HDR es posible decir que para el equipo de Valve \"Valio la pena el peso\". La banda sonora es increible, magnifica y perfecta para el ambiente de Half-Life.

Nostalgia pura.\n\nA primeira versão do lendário Half-Life2 que tive o prazer de jogar não foi essa que possuo na steam. Na época eu vivia em outros caminhos. Havia muitas limitações financeiras e eu sequer sabia da existência da steam. Lembro que fiquei maravilhado com o visual. Minha VGA, nesses dias passados, era uma FX 5200, da nvidia. Ela aguentou bem e me proporcionou muitas experiências inesquecíveis. Mesmo jogando com quase tudo na qualidade gráfica mínima, eu vi que este jogo era uma obra de arte áudio visual jamais criada até então, e eu simplesmente queria jogar para sempre.\n\nDividíamos um computador, meu irmão e eu, e nos revezávamos na campanha. Eu jogava algumas partes e ele outras. E assim seguíamos nossa aventura na sombra de Gordon Freeman, deixando um rastro de sangue, morte e destruição por onde passávamos. Bons tempos, claro.\n\nPouco antes havíamos finalizado o Half-Life, que se passa nas instalações da Black Mesa, apresentando toda a história do nosso cientista Freeman. Um jogo incrível que me deixou com gostinho de quero mais. Foi logo após terminar o HL1 que pesquisei e acabei descobrindo que já havia uma sequência pronta. Nem preciso dizer que na época eu surtei. \n\nQuando caminhei pela primeira vez nas ruas da Cidade 17 eu não queria mais ir embora. Era tudo muito lindo. As texturas, a iluminação, as cores, tudo. Todo o cenário era uma obra de arte pintada por um grande mestre esquecido. E lembro que passamos horas olhando os detalhes, meu irmão e eu. E a cada nova campanha, era sempre a mesma coisa. Sempre reservávamos alguns minutos contemplativos para apreciar aquele visual estarrecedor e comentar um para o outro aos sussurros: ‘Uau, que gráfico!’. \n\nA campanha nos levou até as entranhas da história de Gordon Freeman, e essa jornada não foi fácil. Os Combine, criaturas que atuam como força policial e governam o mundo, estavam sempre no nosso encalço ou planejando emboscadas. Para nossa sorte, descobrimos que ainda existe uma força humana de rebeldes que luta contra os Combine, e somando forças a balança do julgamento fica equilibrada. \n\nRevelações. Intrigas. Traições. Tudo acontece quando tem de acontecer. Velhos amigos revivem a lembrança da amizade e novas caras aparecem para roubar a cena. Claro que na nossa aventura não faltaria um pouco de suspense. Garanto que Ravenholm ficará marcado na memória de todos nós. E após juntar toda essa maquinaria de elementos, obviamente teríamos em troca uma puta de uma campanha. \n\n\nPara aqueles que já jogaram o HL a continuação pode parecer um pouco confusa, pois ocorre um salto temporal na história e você precisa aguçar a atenção para captar novos elementos na narrativa. No andar da carruagem vamos absorvendo a realidade ao qual os humanos são submetidos e pouco a pouco as coisas começam a fazer sentido. Logo, você começa a entender que o que você fez na Black Mesa teve consequências seríssimas e chegou a hora do julgamento final.\n\nO Half-Life2 se apresenta na mesma perspectiva em primeira pessoa do seu antecessor. A física inovadora apresentada em HL2 foi um marco extraordinário no mundo dos jogos. E é essa mesma física que vai te ajudar em muitos momentos durante a campanha, seja para resolver puzzles ou para sobreviver à desvantagem numérica nos inúmeros combates.\n\nDurante combate você precisa ser audaz, rápido e impiedoso, pois dependendo do grau de dificuldade, a inteligência artificial não vai pegar leve. Os inimigos se comportam de forma imprevisível, planejando estratégias de flanco e lançamento de granadas para fazer com que você mude de posição, tudo isso ao passo de um tiroteio frenético e uma quantidade de inimigos absurda. Você conta apenas com a ajuda do traje especial científico, que concede alguns atributos importantes, mas que não te torna invencível. Existe também uma boa variedade de armas que podem ser usadas em diferentes inimigos na busca pelo melhor resultado. Isso, claro, você descobrirá sozinho.\n\nA trilha sonora é muito boa, varia entre o frenesi e a melancolia. É uma pena que toque apenas em momentos significativos da campanha. Talvez a ausência de música durante a maior parte do jogo seja uma estratégia para provocar uma imersão mais nua, real, da coisa.\n\nO Half-Life 2 é com certeza um jogo que todo aquele que gosta de tiro em primeira pessoa deve jogar (E até aqueles que não gostam). HL2 consegue abordar temas polêmicos sem fazer drama, basta meio cérebro e você já será capaz de encontrar elementos que batem muito com situações históricas reais. E claro, se você gosta de ficção científica, nem preciso falar mais nada. Apenas compre e divirta-se nesta maravilha clássica milenar que é Half-Life2. Como você já deve imaginar, ao descobrir o fantástico mundo da steam, eu precisava comprar HL2 para minha conta e jogar novamente. Pelo menos uma última vez.\n\nHalf-Life2 - 9/10","timestamp_created":1386859109,"timestamp_updated":1515163916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653061985969543457","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8014909","author":{"steamid":"76561198067708484","num_games_owned":2472,"num_reviews":161,"playtime_forever":252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1436745003},"language":"spanish","review":"Un clasico de valve, lastima nunca va a salir HL 3 :(","timestamp_created":1386851097,"timestamp_updated":1553369221,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485829949378967285","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8014541","author":{"steamid":"76561198113614370","num_games_owned":362,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1585393701},"language":"english","review":"It won game of the decade.
