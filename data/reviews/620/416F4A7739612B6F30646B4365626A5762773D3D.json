INTRODUCTION ✏️ \n\nThis game its an all-time classic when talking about a Cooperative Multiplayer, Portal 2 its a game with hundreds of levels that will make you and you partner (if you're playing coop) squeeze your brains thinking on how to solve the puzzles and quests creating 2 different types of portals, the blue one and the orange one.\n\n✔️ASPECTS I LIKE ABOUT THE GAME✔️\n\n\n⇨ There are so many levels, so you will not have to buy a spere dlc or anything like that in order to have tons of hours of fun with up to one more player.\n\n⇨ The fact that its a cooperative game makes it just way better, you multiplay the fun x10 when you are playing with a frined while in a Skype call or something like that because you laugh of your own and your partner's fails, which will grant you so much fun\n\n⇨ The game is only about 20 bucks and for that price you wont spect much for a game maybe, but this its definitely not that case, you will have so much fun and this might be one of my favourite games for that 20 to 30 dollar price range.\n\n✖️ASPECTS I DONT LIKE ABOUT THE GAME✖️\n\n⇨ Even though ther are a lot of different levels, some of them may in fact feel a little repetitive and may seem pretty similar to another one you just played before.\n\n⇨ If you don't have a friend with this game as well to play with him, i won't recomend you tu buy it, in fact you can get a deal for 2 copies of Portal 2 on Steam for a little cheaper than buying them separately, which will be my best recomendation.\n\n⇨ This game hasn't really recived a solid update since basically its release date, which by the way is all the way back to 2011, so i'd lioke to recive an interesting update that includes maybe more levels or even some new gamemodes.","timestamp_created":1484585063,"timestamp_updated":1488091487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29298711","author":{"steamid":"76561198218707389","num_games_owned":447,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":2268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":123,"last_played":1513779945},"language":"russian","review":"Отличный

Но в одну реку не войти дважды — чертова память цепко держит каждую задачку. Остается слушать божественную арию из финального ролика и уповать на скорую амнезию. Или выход DLC — смотря что произойдет быстрее.","timestamp_created":1484502476,"timestamp_updated":1484502476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.695025801658630371","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29278017","author":{"steamid":"76561198103666068","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":512,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":512,"last_played":1484498931},"language":"schinese","review":"GOOD GAME\n","timestamp_created":1484499253,"timestamp_updated":1484499253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29277978","author":{"steamid":"76561198280113284","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":500,"last_played":1630912096},"language":"tchinese","review":"the multiple playing with friends can not be used since  my friend and I broke  through the third chapter.\n(多人與好友遊玩合作模式自從我和我朋友突破第三章後完全無法使用)","timestamp_created":1484499176,"timestamp_updated":1484499176,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506053268909454346","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29276909","author":{"steamid":"76561198283119017","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1482900844},"language":"schinese","review":"很有意思 适合与基友一起玩  但是画面看起来有点晕 如果不喜欢这类画面还是慎入","timestamp_created":1484496271,"timestamp_updated":1484496271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29275705","author":{"steamid":"76561198122681969","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1055,"last_played":1484490524},"language":"turkish","review":"Kesin alınması gereken oyunlardan biri.
