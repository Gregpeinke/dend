The simplicity of the story and gameplay make this game entertaining for all ages, and it truly stands the test of time. It combines novel ideas with simply delightful levels, dark humor, and an encapsulating atmosphere. It is hard to say anything about Portal that hasn't been said yet, but it really is a wonder of the game industry. The little game that went so far in rebuilding a first person puzzle from the ground up, and it appeals to everybody. It's just so good.\n\nOutside of gameplay, the tone stands out remarkably. I cannot think of another experience that conveyed isolation and loneliness better than Portal can. Playing alone in a dark room, with just the echoes of footsteps and faint tones of music fading in is magical and unforgettable. I highly recommend this game if you have not yet played it, and I also recommend it if you're interested in playing Portal 2.

The puzzles are brilliant, the game has a great dark sense of humor, and the way the atmosphere of the game slowly transitions from these sqeaky clean test chambers to these dark and spooky back areas is simply astounding. One common complaint with the game is that it's too short. However, I think it's length is one of the best things about it. Has anyone stopped to think how impressive it is that a game teaches you everything you need to know about the its mechanics to point where you fully understand all of them in the end, in a game that could take under five hours to beat? I'd recommend this game to anyone and everyone.","timestamp_created":1390664253,"timestamp_updated":1390664253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8841993","author":{"steamid":"76561198075276962","num_games_owned":329,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1446063838},"language":"german","review":"ich liebe das game aberich kann es nicht mehr spielen weil es jetzt wen ich es starte css startet","timestamp_created":1390658623,"timestamp_updated":1390658623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8839649","author":{"steamid":"76561198103041716","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":362,"last_played":1568547080},"language":"turkish","review":"SÜPER Bİ OYUN KESİNLİKLE ALIN :D","timestamp_created":1390643876,"timestamp_updated":1390643876,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8838548","author":{"steamid":"76561198045519412","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1469986732},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game for people who love puzzles.","timestamp_created":1390634202,"timestamp_updated":1390634202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8838516","author":{"steamid":"76561198086444351","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1483949401},"language":"schinese","review":"Great！！！！！！！！！！！！！","timestamp_created":1390633882,"timestamp_updated":1390633882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8837357","author":{"steamid":"76561197970668904","num_games_owned":492,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1322,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1109,"last_played":1392912774},"language":"english","review":"This is an awesome little game which starts off like a simple 3D puzzle game, but grows into something a lot more..

It features intuitive gameplay, pretty graphics, and best of all, a brand new idea. Yeah. You heard me. Something new. It's about time that someone came out with something that's never been done before, and Portal is that game. The fact that it's not a standard fps or puzzle game automatically puts it in my game library. Now before I get on too much of a rant about how few original video games there are coming out, let's get on to the game itself. The graphics, as previously stated, are quite pretty, but nothing special. The gameplay, however, is phenominal! I very much enjoyed the puzzles and the new idea of a gun that shoots portals that you can use. The puzzles were hard, but not so hard that I would RQ or have to look it up. The storyline is an intersting one, but I personally don't feel it's worth mentioning any more than saying that it wasn't crappy. My complaint about this game is the time it takes to beat it. It only took me about 2 hours to beat it, and although I'm typically good at strategy/puzzle games, it still should've taken me longer to complete the main story. I prefer at least 3-4 hours of gameplay on games that aren't puzzle games. If they are puzzle, I EXPECT at least 5 hours because I want the puzzles to challenge me. That being said, the small amount of game time left me feeling empty. This is my only main complaint though, so that allows me to give Portal a 7.5/10. I would love to see more games take an idea, such as portals, that we have known about for years and put that into a game.

Portal is a first-person-puzzler/platformer with an engaging story for only having a single significant voice actor.  Of course Valve are no strangers to crafting stories despite silent protagonists but if you are coming to the series for the first time, it is the slow creep of the story, slight errors and issues that build an atmosphere.  I prefer this to it's sequel which in my opinion was heavy handed and bloated by comparision.  While replaying some chambers for challenges i noticed all kinds of foreshadowing I had missed playing through originally.\n\nThe challenges themselves add a few hours extra playtime and can get you thinking about a single chamber in very different ways when you are trying for least steps or least time.  Although nothing major I was pleasently surprised about how it forced me to think and to get several different playstyles out of the portal gun mechanic.\n\nWithout foaming and declaring this the best game ever, I would say it is definitely worth a few hours of your time.","timestamp_created":1390140263,"timestamp_updated":1390149780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8768749","author":{"steamid":"76561198068021115","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":466,"last_played":1558209010},"language":"french","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1390139475,"timestamp_updated":1390139475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8767782","author":{"steamid":"76561198064444593","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":96,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":96,"last_played":1379138374},"language":"english","review":"Puzzle game.
