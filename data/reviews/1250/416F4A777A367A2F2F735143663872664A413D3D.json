Right from the start this game throws the player into the driver's seat. No need for a drawn out tutorial, an unnecessary single player campaign or overly complicated controls, the player is tossed into the mix with minimal delay and given nothing more than a set of legs to run with, weapons, and monsters that need killing!\n\nThe game is built off of survival multiplayer co-op. There are a number of classes that can be leveled up to improve the stats for the player's weapons, health and armor; consequently, a slight rpg system is implemented. It is the given ability to level up that makes the higher difficulties a thrill and worth the many hours of replay this game offers. The different classes can offer a diverse team build.\n\nThe weapons are numerous and extremely satisfactory! The few equipment option are also well made. All players are given a door welder, one class gets a buff for it, that can be used to seal doors from attacking hordes. To many survival games lack the option to barricade doors. *cough* Aliens: Colonial Marines *cough*\n\nThere are so many levels to choose from -- official and community made. Each map feels unique. Some of the player made maps are given twists, but the basic idea to all the maps is to survive and kill.\n\nOver all, it is the simplicity of this game that makes it so good. Everything is does, it does well! Even now this game is worth well over $20\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=7261764","timestamp_created":1396236125,"timestamp_updated":1396236226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565849781036376953","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9681112","author":{"steamid":"76561198005720144","num_games_owned":624,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":3031,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2543,"last_played":1475294411},"language":"english","review":"ive always wanted to be british while killing zombies","timestamp_created":1396221388,"timestamp_updated":1396221388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549902141094207764","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9679876","author":{"steamid":"76561197968659080","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":41316,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41040,"last_played":1609788839},"language":"english","review":"I really enjoy this game.

Or atleast one of the best. Don't know what a horde mode is? Basically It's a coop throw away mode devs make alot. where a small group of friends( or bastards who joined and have no idea what the word teamwork means) get together and take on waves of monsters. often zombies.To make an entire game that is 90% horde mode is difficult. You would have to make it fun as hell, goofy at times, Intense, a wide variety of foes, and a good balance between teamwork being essential and relying on the behavior of other players who eventually start to act like total trolls. Killing Floor does all of that. let me just say now that, past beginner difficulty, this game is a challenge to say the least. Your experience of the match can vary based on the tweaks made by the server admin. A full on totally customizable sandbox menu lets you change everything like the specimens you face, waves you go through, and of course a wide variety of maps each being even better than the last. Like all horde modes, your experience would be very very dull unless you got to play with fun toys. KF offers a neat \"traders store\" between rounds. Where you can buy guns, armor, ammo, and if you like change your chosen perk. Perks can give you discounts and bonuses on many different things but the big thing is each perk you have offers It's own weaponry. If I have the Berzerker perk I'll mostly only be able to get melee weapons. If I want a shotgun or a m4 or something like that I'll need a specific perk. Choose wisely though because You can only change once between rounds. If you are easily offended by an onslaught of microtransactions and DLC, KF might just piss you off. As one can dissect from the selection of DLC it showcases in game and in the tore page, there is blatant  use of the sort. for example, you start off with about 5 different character skins to choose from. There are litterally atleast 7x more skins available so long as you got the cash. the same can be said about guns. If you can learn to ignore all these, you can still have a more than satisfying experience while not paying a dime over the cost of the game.\n\npros:\n-fun as hell  -intense  -satisfying mechanics and usually good players to play with\n-solo mode  -fully customizable experience\n\ncons:\n- load of DLC and microtransaction.  -maybe a little too hard for some\n-can be hard to get a good game going -visuals often below average being a game from 2009(granted still easy on the eyes)\n-joining a lobby in game can be a chore with a small amount of euros and a damn pistol to use.\n\noverall a refreshing experience that leaves one very satisfied, a game worth the price of admission.

Although there are a ton of guns and plenty of zombies to shoot, it requires a bit more thought and action than just shooting everything that looks remotely like a zombie.\n\nKnowing when and how to run is extremely important, and if you're planning on living, you better be ready to make a run for it, as well as not shoot certain things at certain times... many noobs have gotten killed repeatedly after pissing off a scrake or fleshpound, including me.\n\nYou should also know before buying that there are no crosshairs in game; if you want to know where the hell you're aiming you have to use the sights. Using the sights slows you down greatly. Because of this, the skill of making hip shots can be useful, depending on your class.\n\nSpeaking of classes, the game has seven, each of which ranks up with certain actions/weapons. The game gets much easier as they reach higher ranks.\n\nOne last thing: the beginner difficulty is too easy. Most players could probably survive it while smashing their face on the keyboard and randomly shooting. If you want to stay a noob forever, stay in beginner.
