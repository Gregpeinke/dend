Half-life is over 20 years old, but it is still an excellent game, being better than several more recent games. In the game we control Gordon Freeman, a scientist (who knows how to use weapons), that upon arriving at his workplace, Black Mesa Research Facility, witness an opening of a portal that releases dangerous creatures that will put everyone's life at risk. That's where the game begins. As a great FPS game, we can move around, jump, shoot, crouch, push objects (albeit in a rather strange way) and we can also make actions, such as clicking a button, turning a valve, etc. The ambience of the game is excellent, both the indoor and outdoor areas.  Gordon is speechless during the entire game, however, we will meet other humans, scientists, security guards (who are helping us) and soldiers (who have orders to kill us). The variety of weapons is huge, we have the iconic crowbar, pistols, shotguns, grenades, mines, crossbows, rocket launchers, ray guns and weapons that the creatures use. Talking now about the creatures, the variety is also huge, the famous headcrab, the Vortigaunt, the blind but extremely dangerous Tentacle and many others that we find throughout the game. Each enemy requires a certain strategy, or not, it will depend on you. The game also contains some puzzles, some easier, others more difficult. The only problem I had was sometimes that Gordon just got stuck (it happened about 3 times), and I had to go to another save. Half-life is an old game, but it is still a great game that is very worth playing. The game deserves 9.8 / 10.","timestamp_created":1605967953,"timestamp_updated":1605967953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79606135","author":{"steamid":"76561198292181129","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1651409076},"language":"turkish","review":"sarıyo","timestamp_created":1605966598,"timestamp_updated":1605966598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79604453","author":{"steamid":"76561198430166616","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":606,"last_played":1639937904},"language":"russian","review":"отличная игра, и баги офигенные. 12/10 криков ученого","timestamp_created":1605964331,"timestamp_updated":1605964331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79599854","author":{"steamid":"76561199025161124","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":259,"last_played":1605795548},"language":"english","review":":) a classic","timestamp_created":1605957442,"timestamp_updated":1605957442,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79599377","author":{"steamid":"76561198264918862","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3363,"last_played":1608131920},"language":"english","review":"Peak Game!","timestamp_created":1605956639,"timestamp_updated":1605956639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79597150","author":{"steamid":"76561198430316355","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1658749155},"language":"russian","review":"ну то 1 халфа которая была у меня на диске","timestamp_created":1605952891,"timestamp_updated":1605952891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79589996","author":{"steamid":"76561198132388509","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":994,"last_played":1637043087},"language":"english","review":"HEGH!

know half life 1 is not necessarily favored in its community compared to half life 2. However, that doesn’t mean that this game isn’t plenty of fun. The enemy encounters are varied and fun to strategize, due to the fairly advanced AI for 1998. This doesn’t mean the game is perfect however. Xen can be especially frustrating and drawn out and some escort tasks are a bit, well, troublesome to say the least. While the AIs great for enemies, it falters with NPCs and path finding a bit, causing you to sometimes get stuck when an npc blocks your way. For the ten dollar admission fee however, you’re still getting a great game even if dated in some ways, it’s valves first game and it really shows their talent as a
