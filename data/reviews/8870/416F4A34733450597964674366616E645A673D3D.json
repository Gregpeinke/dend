The story, the art style and the characters manage to charm the player from the first glance and keep them immersed in its universe.\n\n\nYou follow the steps of Booker Dewitt, an american citizen with a mysterious that has been given a task to retrieve a girl that resides in a city in the clouds AKA Columbia. It may have seem as your everyday rescue mission, but the second he arrives to said city things take a little twist and the story will only become more and more complex as you make progress. \n\n\nOne of the things I loved the most is your partner Elizabeth which, unlike many other companions, you don’t feel the burden to protect her all the time or just forget about her in the middle of a battle but will actually step out and help you with health, ammo and salts without having (while this can save you on many tricky situations you can’t by any means abuse that and have her carrying you over), later on she’ll learn to control an ability that allows to pull out certain elements to aid you further in combat. Whenever you’re out of combat and just exploring the corners of Columbia, let it be a side quest, looking for special gear or infusions to upgrade, you’ll notice that she’ll let you know about certain goodies that the player might miss out (lockpicks, a certain clue or money) proving that she’s far superior than most AI companions and personally I think that the developers just made a great job with her; you feel sympathy for her to the point that you form that special bond that not many characters can evoke.\n\n\nThe soundtrack is one of the best I’ve seen in a long time, it combines some past era music with original scores that just blend beautifully in the atmosphere. \n\n\nOne thing that I have seen many people doing is to compare this game to its previous installments, and I consider that if you want to get the best experience of it is to try to avoid that. While they may be in the same universe they are definitely not story related and the gameplay does changes a bit (nothing groundbreaking in my opinion though). \n\n\nSomething that I would like to point out is that this is one of the best optimized games I’ve ever seen, I’ve had the opportunity of playing it in a laptop with the lowest graphics cards, if you can call it that (obviously the settings were in no way maxed butl medium to high) and it ran smoothly for most of the game.","timestamp_created":1479944971,"timestamp_updated":1479944971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580152690410614014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26949796","author":{"steamid":"76561198097821349","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":353,"last_played":1618929269},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito bom ! com uma história muita envolvente ! vale a pena !","timestamp_created":1479944912,"timestamp_updated":1479944912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26949679","author":{"steamid":"76561198086964318","num_games_owned":573,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1783,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1526,"last_played":1519618004},"language":"english","review":"Still one of the very best titles in the last 5-10 years","timestamp_created":1479944889,"timestamp_updated":1479944889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26949417","author":{"steamid":"76561197976840429","num_games_owned":428,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1420254844},"language":"english","review":"Buy this.
