Ты боишься Бога?\n— Нет. Но тебя — боюсь.[/h1]\nОх... сразу предупрежу, что сюжет игры к концу становится очень сложным и запутанным. Я такое люблю, но некоторым может не зайти. Я только что посмотрел финальные титры, и по ощущениям похоже как будто Интерстеллар посмотрел. Тоже идёт упор на разные реальности и относительное течение времени, видимо и названа игра \"infinite\" - \"бесконечность\" как раз из за этого.\nХочу выделить что геймплейно она клёвая, но каких-то особых моментов восторга не вызывала. Скорее эта игра про атмосферу, эстетику воздушных замков, блестящие дома на солнце и загнивающие трущобы, про социальный комментарий к расизму и про потрясающую запутанную историю, а не про интересные геймплейные элементы. Хотя, стрельба аркадная, приятная, механика тоников, дающих супер-силы - тоже неплоха. Лиз, которая по разному ведёт себя с окружением и всячески тебе помогает - вообще украла моё сердечко как персонаж.\n\nВ заключение хочу сказать, что игра мне безумно понравилась и я однозначно рекомендую её к прохождению.
