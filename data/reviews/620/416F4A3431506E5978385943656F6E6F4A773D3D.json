La continuación del exitoso juego experimental ''Portal'' es lo que en su día fue el primero pero con un resultado mucho más complejo y elaborado. El original juego creado por Valve esta vez tiene un modo cooperativo aparte de la campaña, divertidísimo para jugarlo con un amigo y picarse a ver quien encuentra el resultado a un puzzle primero.\n\nPortal 2 sigue siendo tan divertido como en su día lo fue ''Portal'', incluso más ya que en esta ocasión incluye mecánicas jugables nuevas para resolver puzzles los cuales por otra parte son más complejos y difíciles que el primero. Te puedes quedar bastante rato pensativo en un puzzle, pero acaba siendo un reto divertido y hace que no quieras ver un vídeo para pasar cierta parte, lo cual hace el juego más largo y incita a pensar. El juego se desarrolla bastantes años más tarde que el primero, despertamos de un largo sueño y nuestro principal objetivo es escapar de el complejo de pruebas de Aperture Science, lugar en el que transcurrió también el primer ''Portal''. Los gráficos son buenos para el 2011, se nota que utiliza el motor gráfico ''Source'' el cual sigue cumpliendo y actualmente sigue siendo bonito. Utiliza el mismo sistema de físicas que utilizó su predecesor con la novedad de que en esta ocasión también hay físicas para los fluidos. También mantiene el formato de narrar el juego sin ''cutscenes'', pero en esta ocasión hay una ''cutscene'' que aparece al final del juego. Como su predecesor sigue sin agobiar con tutoriales, simplemente en ocasiones puntuales te explica que hace cada tecla, pero lo hace de manera muy discreta sin llegar a ser pesado. En este juego hay más diálogos que en el ''Portal'' original, pero igualmente siguen siendo brillantes y con un gran doblaje al español. Otro punto fuerte de esta segunda parte es el carisma de todos los personajes, todos son muy interesantes y tienen una personalidad muy marcada. La jugabilidad sigue siendo muy original, si bien ya no sorprende tanto como el primero sigue siendo divertidísima y entretenida.\n\nPortal 2 es para mí una obra de arte, un juego muy divertido con una historia excelente y un gran sentido del humor que te hará sacar más de una sonrisa. Un juego de diez, un obligado del gaming de PC y, porque no, también de consola. Espero que disfrutéis esta saga tanto como yo lo hice en su día, ojala me lo pudiera volver a pasar por primera vez xD.","timestamp_created":1402626303,"timestamp_updated":1403197337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10454225","author":{"steamid":"76561198038989648","num_games_owned":399,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":902,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":902,"last_played":1401741013},"language":"russian","review":"Очень классная и атмосферная игрушка, прошел её наверное за часов 7-8 не более. Остальное время наиграли со знакомым проходя совместные миссии, в принципе игра доставила удовольствие, в тоже время как и не большие психи о том как пройти этот гребанный уровень. Сюжет классный, но не много однообразный. После прохождения всех миссий как в сингле так и в мультиплеере есть дополнительные миссии что очень классно. Если то что мне сказали правда, то можно те карты которые люди придумывали сами, это же огромный плюс этой игры. Эту игру можно проходите вечно.","timestamp_created":1402622870,"timestamp_updated":1402622870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.801678121089935303","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10454183","author":{"steamid":"76561198075934585","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1079,"last_played":1504035261},"language":"english","review":"This has to be one of the best puzzle games I have played in a long time.","timestamp_created":1402622484,"timestamp_updated":1402622484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10442040","author":{"steamid":"76561198059954097","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":4017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2986,"last_played":1414768414},"language":"italian","review":"Uno dei migliori giochi mai provati, Portal 2 è sicuramente un Must Have per tutti coloro che adorano i puzzle.\nVi ritroverete nei panni di una giovane donna, imprigionata a fare test su un dispositivo crea-portali, che deve fuggire dal laboratorio.\n\nNel multiplayer invece vi ritroverete affiancati ad un amico per risolvere differenti \"camere\" (così si chiamano) che da soli sarebbero impossibili.\n\nMolto interessante anche l'opportunità di scaricare mappe fatte dalla comunità, sia per single che multiplayer, spesso anche create usando pacchetti di mod per inserire oggetti o texture nuove.\n\nP.S.
