This is the hole game which seems like it will soon get boring after while but because its done so well you can play the game for hours at a time.\n\n[h1]Good Points[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] One of Killing Floors best things is the replay value since you can play for hours at a time. There are a massive amount of maps to choose from, events such as Christmas and Halloween, 100s of Achievements and a massive amount of fun. These things put together makes great replay value.\n\n[*] Guns is a big part in Killing Floor because you will always use them to shoot and kill every specimen you see. Its very satisfying and never gets old, there are loads of weapons to pick from so you cant get bored of them.\n\n[*] The controls are simple in a good way, they are not very hard to get used to and you will know everyone after an hour.\n\n[*] Specimens are really unique and they all have there own special abilities, there are 10 different types of specimens and thats not including the boss at the end. This always keeps the game play going and makes each game feel different.\n\n[*] Killing Floor is a very challenging game to start off with, but as you play you will get better and start playing different difficulty which can be really hard. You will die a lot but that gives you more reason to keep playing because you want to beat the level.\n\n[*] The length of the game depends of how long you want to play it. You can keep playing for a long as you want and most of the time you wont get bored. Some people manage to put 1000s of hours into Killing Floor and still play to this day.\n\n[*] The price it worth it but its always on sale every couple of months so I would recommend waiting a little bit since you can save a bit of dosh.\n\n[*] There are six different classes to choose from such as Sharpshooter to Firebug. There is a class that suits you which you can level up to get better at the class, this helps and keeps you playing.\n\n[*] The Killing Floor community are really nice and will help you get Achievements as well as helping you in any other way they can. The game is over 5 years old and people are still playing in the thousands which is rare for most games.\n[/list]\n[h1]Bad Points[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] As I said about the game being over 5 years old, this means the game may soon die within a year of two. As well and Killing Floor 2 coming out this means it will never be as big as it was. But its still worth the money for now since you will get enjoyment out of the game.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nOverall I think that Killing Floor is a great fun game to play with friends and wont get boring, its considered a classing for PC gamers and is still great fun today. I would recommend this game to anyone who has Steam. I would give Killing Floor 9 out of 10.","timestamp_created":1429626742,"timestamp_updated":1479934061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525403141975402832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15476832","author":{"steamid":"76561198135807789","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2207,"last_played":1581520923},"language":"russian","review":"Шикарная игра!","timestamp_created":1429625825,"timestamp_updated":1429625825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15476041","author":{"steamid":"76561198111825633","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1498248217},"language":"english","review":"Gr8 m8 i r8 8/8 .
