The developers at Valve decided that creating a full extension would take too much time, suggest us to eat the game pieces, making the system episodes, allowing you to produce more games. It's hard to tell if it was the right decision.\n\nThe game continues exactly in the place where we stopped in the finals of the second part. The reactor of the Citadel blown up, but its core is still not stable and eventually detonate undermining the entire city. Gordon and Alyx have to slow down the response of the kernel and try save the residents of the city. And to save ourselves...\n\nThe game comes out two years later, offering us plunge once more into the history of the universe Half-Life. However immersed we are literally down to his knees, after which the game ends quickly, showing us the gripping trailer for the second episode. This part of the series has become more dynamic than its predecessor, but ends so quickly, do not have time to fully enjoy the game. After two years of waiting, we get a little more than a three-hour campaign. Why it seems that we are playing in a full game, but rather a small addition.\n\nThe gameplay has remained virtually the same. Like a dashing start, where we are using the gravity gun throwing soldiers of the Alliance in different directions. In this part fights with zombies and mutants became more. So it was somewhat unusual to play with Alix, which accompanied us almost the entire game. While AI has been improved even more. Our partner shoots, climbing over walls, when the enemies approach too close, you might even strike with his legs or butt. Often comments on different situations and makes the tips in some places.\n\nThere are a couple new enemies. Added HDR, which was later moved to the second part. Plus was improving the artificial intelligence and character animation.\n\nThis episode is like its dynamism, however small the duration of the game and lack of any features, don't allow to put the game a higher score.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n(Русский)\nHalf-Life 2: Episode One - следующая часть популярной серии Half-Life, вышедшая в 2006 году. Разработчики из Valve, решив, что создание полноценного продолжения займёт слишком много времени, предлагают нам кушать игру по кусочкам, сделав систему эпизодов, что позволяет выпускать игры чаще. Трудно сказать, было ли это решение верным.\n\nИгра продолжается ровно в том месте, где мы и остановились в финале второй части. Реактор Цитадели взорван, однако его ядро всё ещё не стабильно и со временем сдетонирует подорвав весь город. Гордону и Аликс предстоит замедлить рекцию ядра и постаратся спасити жителей города. А так же спастись самим...\n\nИгра выходит спустя два года, предлагая нам окунутся ещё раз в историю вселенной Half-Life. Однако окунаемся мы буквально до колен, после чего игра быстро заканчивается, показывая нам смачный трейлер второго эпизода. Данная часть серии стала более динамичней, по сравнению с предшественником, однако заканчивается настолько быстро, что не успеваешь полностью насладится игрой. После двух то лет ожиданий, получаем чуть более чем трехчасовую кампанию. Отчего создается впечатление, что мы играем не в полноценную игру, а скорее в небольшое дополнение.\n\nГеймплей остался практически таким же. Понравилось лихое начало, где мы используя грави-пушку раскидываем солдат Альянса в разные стороны. В этой части схваток с зомби и мутантами стало больше. Так же было несколько необычно играть с Аликс, которая сопровождала нас практически всю игру. При этом AI был улучшен ещё больше. Наша напарница метко стреляет, перелазит через стенки, при подходе врагов слишком близко, может даже ударить с ноги или прикладом. Часто комментирует разные ситуации и делает подсказки в некоторых местах.\n\nПоявились пару новых врагов. Так же добавили технологию HDR, которую впоследствии перенесли и во вторую часть. Плюс были улучшения искуственного интелекта и анимации персонажей.\n\nДанный эпизод понравился своей динамичностью, однако малая продолжительность игры и практически отсутствие каких-либо новвоведений, не дают поставить игре более высокую оценку.\n\nОценка: 8/10","timestamp_created":1470415161,"timestamp_updated":1470415161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24722942","author":{"steamid":"76561198245636438","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1470344578},"language":"brazilian","review":"Continuando o incrível HL2 original, HL2 EO segue a linha de exclusividade.","timestamp_created":1470393309,"timestamp_updated":1470393309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24705449","author":{"steamid":"76561198064122960","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":338,"last_played":1482488139},"language":"czech","review":"Radost pohledět a zahrát !","timestamp_created":1470306070,"timestamp_updated":1470306070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24701749","author":{"steamid":"76561198260530863","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1616645436},"language":"english","review":"Watch out, there is a hunter behind you, no wait, that is is in Episode 2, never mind.","timestamp_created":1470283596,"timestamp_updated":1481583912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24696013","author":{"steamid":"76561198120842855","num_games_owned":301,"num_reviews":160,"playtime_forever":406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":301,"last_played":1657916580},"language":"russian","review":"Я бы так сказал:не самый выдающийся эпизод из всего Half-Life 2.\n\nПрошел я его за то время,которое вы можете увидеть прямо над обзорчиком(и это с учетом того,что я выбивал ачивки,умирал кое-где по 10 раз и прошел игру с одной пулей)\n\nИз Аликс - смелой,даже мужиковатой девушки,которая при помощи своей смекалки и Пса не раз выводила себя,Гордона и других героев игры из плохих ситуаций,сделали обычную игровую женщину,которая постояннно твердит:,,Гордон,помоги мне\",,,Гордон,спаси меня!\",а после ,,О боже,Гордон,ты мой герой\",,,Гордон ты всех нас спас!\" и т.д.\n\nДинамика не потеряла свою динамичность(масло масляное),и это замечательно!\n\nВ целом,не хочу выражаться об этой игре жестко,но это худший эпизод Half-Life 2,что,в принципе,и оправдывает его цену.\n\nОтрицательный отзыв писать не хочу,но мне кажется,лучше было-бы,если-бы Episode One & Episode Two были одним эпизодом.\n\nОценку тоже менять не буду,ведь это - часть Half-Life 2!","timestamp_created":1470254244,"timestamp_updated":1657916712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467224091291427612","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24695782","author":{"steamid":"76561197985270991","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":201,"last_played":1450737843},"language":"german","review":"Ich finde Valve Games sind der Hammer.

It is very difficult to get immersed in what is happening, and the fact that you play Gordon Freeman again (yes, I know he is the [u]main[/u] protagonist of the series, but he is just that - the main one).  I felt that this was the perfect opportunity to play as Alyx, or Barney again.  Someone other than Gordon, indeed, I was more of the mind that this game would have been more interesting if it had changed tact, and the purpose was to find Gordon after the events of Half-Life 2.\n\nEither way, going through the opening chapter of this game was tedius.  Mind-numbingly so.  It was not enjoyable, it was not great storytelling and it definitely did not flow well.  Alyx as an NPC Mary-Sue that offered constant exposition became annoying very very quickly.  This issue with Alyx would only continue as the game progressed.  Too much emphasis was placed on doing things in a buddy-cop fashion, but without the laughs associated with that genre.  \n\nThe game didn't get too much better for a while.  The reliance on the game to pair you up with Alyx had many of the same issues that you got with Half-Life 2 and the squads, they would constantly get in your way.  And Alyx would do that with a repetitive glee that could only be described as malicious.  I also found that this game seemed buggier than Half-Life 2 in that you could get caught on so much more debris.\n\nThe game also has a predisposition to clunky gameplay, revisitng many of the poorer elements used in the series, such as platforming and un-inspired puzzles.  But at least you can still shoot things up with the SMG, Pulse Rifle and Crossbow.  \n\nHowever, the game did start picking up once you got to the final chapter and met up with an old friend again.  I believe that this sequence and the final mini-boss fight at the end were the saving grace of Half-Life 2: Episode One.  They raised the score of the game enough for me to recommend this game.  Unfortunately, though, whilst it tips the scales on the fun side, this game did not enhance the lore of the series.\n\n3/5 - only get if on special.","timestamp_created":1469280425,"timestamp_updated":1469337838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491985738277435303","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24477088","author":{"steamid":"76561198100814766","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1468862071},"language":"russian","review":"Норм","timestamp_created":1469270628,"timestamp_updated":1469270628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24466215","author":{"steamid":"76561198019346075","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":309,"last_played":1484273720},"language":"english","review":"[h1] It's Half-Life[/h1]","timestamp_created":1469218861,"timestamp_updated":1469218861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479797959327697754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24461923","author":{"steamid":"76561198150669447","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":361,"last_played":1541257544},"language":"turkish","review":"İyi Güzelde Benena","timestamp_created":1469203839,"timestamp_updated":1469203839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24451256","author":{"steamid":"76561198125889530","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":108,"playtime_forever":331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":331,"last_played":1448242720},"language":"spanish","review":"Continúa con la gloria del segundo.

It is a bit shorter though, but the experience was as great if not greater. I loved the new HDR feature, the new mechanics of Alyx's combat, animations, how the things worked, the developer's commentary, 10/10 game. I have been once again amazed with the beauty of half life works. I definitely recommend this game. It's really nice! But I recommend playing the half life series all the way from half life 1 up to half life 2 episode 2, that's the best way.\n\nThe gameplay is good, as always, not some simple shooter that you would find in some forsaken company.\n\nThe graphics are too good to be explained with our human dictionary.\n\nThe bugs... well, I have found one bug, although I am not sure if that's even a bug. So basically at the last chapter (Spoiler alert) I was taking the citizens to the trains, everything was good until one of them was stuck somewhere beside the stairs, he could move but he was killed instantly, what I mean is that he could have ran to the trains and would have got me an achievement, but he wasted it and died.\n\nAnyways, the game is just perfect.

It tells the continued story of physicist-gone-action-hero Gordon Freeman as he and action-hero-gone-love-interest Alyx Vance escape from the physically unstable City 17 before it blows up I think.\n\nIn my review of Half-Life 2 I definitely wasn't very nice to the game. I said the game was unfocused and average, with interesting ideas and clever storytelling but drawn-out setpeices and a largely uninteresting plot if you remove all that glittery facial animation. Some of that, I think, is still justified but one thing I forgot to mention was how much I actually really like Half-Life 2.\n\nOne thing the HL franchise enjoys doing is pulling the rug out from under the player and then throwing a bunch of enemies at them. That's pretty cool but it's also sort of troubling, considering that most of Half-Life 2 feels very aimless as if Gordon is just drunkenly stumbling between ambushes and set-peices. Episode 1 seemingly tries to fix that by making whatever the current goal is very obvious, either with some kind of environmental clue or with Alyx directly telling you what the objective is:\n\nEscape the tower\nGet to the train station\n\nThe story is more grounded and because of that the gameplay can throw you into as many accidental circumstances and detours as it wants because you always end up back on track. \n\nI also appreciate how the stakes are a lot higher feeling in this game. It isn't just a vague intergalactic business proposition between Breen and some alien terrorist people, the actual city feels like it's about to blow up and if you keep getting interrupted by the combine than everybody involved will actually die. And it isn't just your life that's at stake here, you spend the entire game fighting alongside Alyx Vance, which sounds like a bad idea but this game manages a sidekick-idea very well.\n\nAnybody who played the first game remembers the third act where you command a squad consisting of that guy who sounds like everyone else and a girl who only occasionally dreams of cheese(?) but nobody WANTS to remember that part because not only is it sandwiched between the two best parts of the game but it also is un-doubtably the worst. The AI blocks the player at every turn and is super reliant on Gordon; they will not go anywhere unless you ask them too and they die as quickly as your enemies do so they may as well not be there--heck the game is more fun when they AREN'T there.\n\nThe squad idea comes back in Episode 1 but not only are they more resistant, they seemingly abandon the whole \"Targeting\" thing--they seem to go wherever they want until you start to progress, and most importantly they stay out of the players way. All of this culminates into Alyx who not only follows the player from the very start but is INVULNERABLE to damage. This could make her too powerful but the devs fix that only giving her a pistol until about halfway through, and even before that she's a very good aim. Most of the opening is spent with the player under a variety of handicaps such as only having a gravity gun or not having a ton of ammo and the devs cleverly use Alyx as your second half, which not only ties their mostly plot-based comradery into the gameplay but also makes you feel like a real team by the end.\n\nUltimately I think Episode 1 expands on HL2 and makes the game better. There's only one new enemy and a smaller arsenal than before but the gameplay is tightened and the story in more investing. I'll be the first to admit that my review of HL2 was a bit hyperbolic but I still recommended that game and I absolutely recommend Episode 1 as well","timestamp_created":1467331697,"timestamp_updated":1467332271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603598713874816895","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23965121","author":{"steamid":"76561198064486593","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1411054349},"language":"english","review":"Short and sweet.","timestamp_created":1467317790,"timestamp_updated":1467317790,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481366485357284546","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23964255","author":{"steamid":"76561198210171197","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":380,"last_played":1555338318},"language":"russian","review":"Скажу как \"эксперт\" Half-Life 2: Episode One немного огорчило меня, в плане ее содержания, я прошел ее всего за 5 часов, хотя Half-Life 2 я прошел за 19, как так?
