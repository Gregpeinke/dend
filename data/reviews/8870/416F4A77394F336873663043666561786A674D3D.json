Про нее и так много кто прокомментировал и есть куча обзоров от разных игровых журналов. Много лет прошло с того момента , когда запустил эту игру.  Играл в пиратскую версию , в то время не подумывал покупать игры в стиме. Поиграть получилось только после сдачи ЕГЭ, было это в июле, 2013 г. Игра поразила своим художественным оформлением, разработчики сие творения словно писали картину, пусть для кого то это мультик. Но ! Прошло 9 лет и данное произведение только выигрывает и проходит проверку временем, поскольку графика целостная и не вырвиглазная, приятная на глаз, художественная композиция на высочайшем уровне, дизайн воздушного города просто изумительный - свой хлеб ели заслужено художники и дизайнеры. В целом, остается актуальной с точки зрения сюжета, игровых механик и музыки. Игровая индустрия хотела, и что самое главное могла нас удивлять столь хорошими проектами (пусть со своими недостатками), которые спустя столько времени будут(для кого то) уступать технически нынешним играм, лично для меня это уступка незначительная.

always a man.  There's always a tower.  There's always a city.  And, there's always another terrible console port.  \n\nFirst off, I really liked the first Bioshock.  I also liked the second Bioshock.  The first Bioshock was good, but the second Bioshock was good and also tremendously and legitimately courageous.  If you doubt that, go read the reviews and witness the butthurt.  Bioshock 2 had a different director and producer, which would be totally obvious if you played it.\n\nThe first Bioshock was kind of harmless and fun.  Sure, it drags Objectivists, a small philosophical group that composes maybe a few hundred people.  But, it's a game and stays that way.  It doesn't actually wade into the philosophical aspects except to say:  well, without a strong state, how do you handle crime.  Not much of a point nowadays.  We in the US have a strong state, and we have rampaging and unrestrained crime.  In the critique, it fails to land a punch.  If you want a critique of objectivism, I can certainly give one, but I won't do that here, because I'm just trying to review Bioshock Infinite.  \n\nAt first, I thought:  man, this is going to be a tough game to review.  But, actually, it's pretty simple.  There are clear good and bad parts.  \n\nFirst, the good.  You expect a good story with good characterization, and you get it.  The acting is good, and the characters are good.  Not great.  But good.  Definitely above average.  Some parts border on great, in fact, but only border.  It's certainly very good.  In a Bioshock game, you also expect good aesthetics.  Well, you get that too.  It harkens back specifically to early 1900 Worlds Fairs and technology expos.  It's a change from Bioshock's Art Deco, goes in a new direction, and is successful. \n\nThere are some terrible design choices that negatively impact enjoyment of the game, and some of these decisions are there specifically to accomodate the consoles from which this game was ported.  For instance, it's a first person shooter that only lets you pick up two weapons at a time.  Thus, you never feel like you have what you need for the situation at hand.  Whereas Bioshock 1 allowed you to collect and upgrade weapons (and they even looked different), and also allowed three kinds of ammo, all of which felt great and played great, all of this has been completely abandoned here.  It's annoying and frustrating.  Second, this game doesn't have a standard FPS save system.  I basically marathoned the game for that reason because I didn't want to repeat segments.  See, this isn't CoD.  You loot things.  You explore things.  You collect things.  And, no one wants to do that stuff over and over again because you might forget what you've looted, explored and collected.  This is a terrible design decision for a game like that.  It's forgivable in games where exploration is moot, but this isn't one of those games.  Both of these design decisions feel lazy, cheap, and apathetic.  They harm the overall experience and are clearly there for reasons that don't apply to PCs.  \n\nSecond, there's a saying that \"JJ Abrahms doesn't care about space.\"  He doesn't.  He has a passion, and space exploration isn't that passion.  Boy, man does this game ram that same passion home brutally and arrogantly.  I'll be blunt:  the first half of the game is about how much Ken Levine really, really, reall hates white people.  Many people will see the first city and be like, \"man, this is pretty nice.\"  Friendly people.  No crime.  Food everywhere (by the way, this game made me so hungry with the food choices in it.)  Looks great.  Well, there's a strong overtone that the city in this game is, like, a personal nightmare for the director.  I didn't really take offense to it.  I just thought it was really funny.  It \"critiques\" America, Christianity, Constitutional Republicanism, and, above all, people of European descent heavily.  All of the groups in our society that you are allowed to attack, it attacks.  And, it does so unfairly and without nuance or context.  It twists history.  It changes rolls.  It has no sense of balance.  It hates atavistically.  It does basically what you would expect it to do.  Now, personally, I rolled my eyes and made an up and down motion with my right hand and moved on.  Yeah, we get it, dude.  This is your passion, just like probably everyone you know.  Can we play the game already? (Again, I found this hyperbolic and, nowadays, generally overdone hatred funny, but this is just a warning that if you get offended easily...actually, if you are capabable of offense at all...this is definitely going to rustle your jimmies.) \n\nOK, let's get back to another cool thing about the game.  There's a really cool gameplay mechnanic here that is special and unique and which I don't want to spoil.  But, it's makes the game a lot more fun than it otherwise would be.  The combat and gameplay feel great.  Because of the saving issues, I put it on Medium even though I'm normally a hard kind of guy, just to get through the story at a brisk pace.  I still found the combat lots of fun and a good challenge, especially since my goal became \"don't die at all\".  \n\nThis is, ultimately, a fun game with a good story.  Yes, the story eventually becomes kind of dumb, but that's ok.  It's not perfect, but it is good.  I recommend playing it despite the obvious frustrations and annoyances.  It's not as good as Bioshock 1 or 2, but it's still a good game and lots of fun.","timestamp_created":1638102848,"timestamp_updated":1638102848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473372787237167358","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104528388","author":{"steamid":"76561198899060401","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1638367028},"language":"english","review":"A game truly ahead of time","timestamp_created":1638101786,"timestamp_updated":1638101786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626666665077209473","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104527061","author":{"steamid":"76561198998652200","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1652603523},"language":"english","review":"nice\n","timestamp_created":1638101272,"timestamp_updated":1638101272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104526473","author":{"steamid":"76561199041230227","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":413,"last_played":1638485878},"language":"koreana","review":"키야 스토리며 조작이며 굿이다 굿 멋지다야","timestamp_created":1638101024,"timestamp_updated":1638101024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104525198","author":{"steamid":"76561198324173697","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1084,"last_played":1638098153},"language":"tchinese","review":"優秀的劇情","timestamp_created":1638100524,"timestamp_updated":1638100524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104524595","author":{"steamid":"76561199108244366","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":420,"last_played":1639940054},"language":"schinese","review":"伊丽莎白真·女神！","timestamp_created":1638100291,"timestamp_updated":1638100291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104520960","author":{"steamid":"76561198146881003","num_games_owned":565,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1565,"last_played":1638282748},"language":"schinese","review":"艺术性满分，爽快感不如前两作、85/100","timestamp_created":1638098786,"timestamp_updated":1638098786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104519932","author":{"steamid":"76561198123456422","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":494,"last_played":1656905682},"language":"english","review":"great game","timestamp_created":1638098370,"timestamp_updated":1638098370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104518894","author":{"steamid":"76561198348815723","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":91,"playtime_forever":424,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":424,"last_played":1638097371},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра,мне понравилась,  но не скажу, что я в восторге.

Здесь вы будете затрагивать такие темы, как расизм, религия, лжепророки, гендерные роли, и даже моменты, которые будут проверять вашу собственную мораль. Есть что сказать. История и мир оживают точно так же, как и подводный город Rapture. Хотя Колумбия не так ослепительна, как путешествие в подводный мир, у нее все равно есть пульс. Вы найдете воксфоны, разбросанные повсюду. Они, как и оригинальные аудиодневники биошока, добавляют гораздо больше к рассказу. Они добавляют к истории, миру и атмосфере. Игнорировать их - значит пропустить значительную часть игры. Те, кому очень любопытно узнать о мире, в котором они играют, наверняка захотят взять их в руки.\n\nМир Колумбии шире и открытее, чем клаустрофобный и замкнутый городишка Rapture, в перестрелках задействовано больше врагов, чем в оригинальном Bioshock. Проблема в том, что это обесценивает сам бой. В оригинальном Bioshock врагов было чего опасаться. Даже самые простые из них могут навредить вам, если вы не будете готовы. В Infinite большинство врагов - это просто безликие стражи, в которых вам просто нужно стрелять, чтобы перейти к другим частям истории. Большинство боев просто повторяются, и хотя игра позволяет вам использовать различные методы, такие как силы и небесные крюки, для победы над врагами, в редких случаях вам это нужно. Большую часть игры вы сильно подавлены, даже если вы не улучшаете свои силы или оружие.\n\nBioshock Infinite - не идеальная игра, но отличная. Тематически амбициозная игра с хорошо рассказанной историей, Bioshock Infinite обязательно порадует фанатов, которые полюбили оригинал еще в 2007 году. Это игра, которая не только хороша с точки зрения игрового процесса, но и с точки зрения повествования. Если вам понравилось исследовать мир Восторга в 2007 году, то вам понравится путешествовать по стране Колумбии здесь.\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1638064315,"timestamp_updated":1638064315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.70948946475982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104456251","author":{"steamid":"76561198443458931","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":430,"last_played":1638067688},"language":"brazilian","review":"mr. dewitt did it again\n","timestamp_created":1638064092,"timestamp_updated":1638064092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104455510","author":{"steamid":"76561198001071919","num_games_owned":678,"num_reviews":164,"playtime_forever":834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":834,"last_played":1638063276},"language":"english","review":"I really didn't enjoy much about this game.

As you can see i have about an hour and a half played so far. through that entire time it was me trying to stomach the downright horrendous movement, the abysmal combat and the hilariously terrible optimization. the movement was clunky, it felt like i was a crippled rat stuck in a maze. Running around and traversing the city was at the best time boring and the worst slow and hindering, you coud not jump over hardly any obstacles and it felt pointless, it almost felt like they might as well have put me on rails as it would have worked smoother. touching on the optimization, my system is by no means top of the line or too old, i have a gtx 1050ti thats still rotting away in my system due to the inflation of gpus, 24 gb of ram, a ryzen 5 3600 with sme phenomenal cooling. this thing ran like i had either tried to use a early 2000s hp laptop or my hardware was so incredibly advnaced that the game just couldnt get itself together. regardless reciving frame drops is unacceptable and ruined my experiance from the literal start. what broke my heart the most was the beautiful world that was right there ready to be explored but it was just too bothersome to persist through. as far as the gameplay and combat goes it gets even worse. i played the game on the hardest difficulty because why not, and i had to double check a couple times that i wasnt in story mode, its piss easy. combined with the AI being a joke even for 2013 i couldnt take it very seriously, connecting back to why it being an on rails shooter wouldnt actually be much worse then it is now. the gunplay was cringe and felt so underwhelming it was like i was shooting nerf darts with tacks taped onto the ends. with all this said, i do indeed value a good narrative, so much so i would power through and push it all aside to finish the game and enjoy the writing, if it wasnt for the fact that the story failed to catch me in anyway. with all these obstacles i wasnt going to wait around for the story to get good a couple hours later. \n\nim actually let down, i enjoyed the other entries in the series and just took a long time getting around to play this and now i am so sad, im distraught. i dont know how to go on with my life, it feels like my childhood memories are nothing but a glimpse in another distant universe. im just kidding i refunded this moved on with my day.","timestamp_created":1638061721,"timestamp_updated":1638061721,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.435416311025619507","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104451940","author":{"steamid":"76561198798241548","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1038,"last_played":1637806972},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente.
