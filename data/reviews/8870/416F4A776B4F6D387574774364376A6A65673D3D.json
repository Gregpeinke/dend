The gameplay is relaxed and exhilarating all at the same time. Crafted to perfectly fit any FPS gamer's like in a game. \n\nThe story... I cant even begin to explain. It goes deep into detail and really causes you to ask questions which later get answered. Though it is hard to pick up on the real plot, you have another one to entertain you in the midst of it. Saving Elizabeth. It is like a touching romance story without the romance, but guns instead. If you are clever enough to pick up on the real story you may find yourself shedding a few tears at the end. Not just because of the story ending but also because the game is over. It certainly lasts but I wish it could keep going on forever. \n\nIf you play a lot of FPS games, you likely already own this legendary title. But If you don't I highly recommend you pick it up as soon as possible. It is the perfect game for its genre while also taking common scenarios and throwing a whole new level of originality to it.","timestamp_created":1497442584,"timestamp_updated":1511627169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32407177","author":{"steamid":"76561198130038734","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":861,"last_played":1512230805},"language":"turkish","review":"Böyle hikayeye can kurban","timestamp_created":1497434506,"timestamp_updated":1497434506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512195110321044922","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32401913","author":{"steamid":"76561198253535520","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1062,"last_played":1533163095},"language":"spanish","review":"No lo he acabado y es el mejor FPS que se ha creado.

Even in 2020, the models and textures appear high-quality. Admittedly, newer games are more photorealistic, but BioShock Infinite more than makes up for it with its art style.\n+ The voice acting. It's awesome! Courtnee Draper as Elizabeth is utter perfection.\n+ The gameplay's fun. Unlike BioShock 1/2, Booker can only carry two weapons and two vigours at a time, so you've got to strategize what to keep and what to replace, especially since some kinds of ammunitions are scarce in some levels.\n+ Fantastic story. It's less about social ideologies than the first two installments, but still deeply philosophical, especially towards the end.\n+ The level design is great. Personally I prefered the retrofuturistic Rapture over the Progressive Era Columbia, but that still makes it one of the best original settings I've ever seen.\n+ What impressed me quite a lot was that Elizabeth's clothes picked up wear and tear along the way. The only game I can think of (off the top of my head) that also did this is Tomb Raider. It adds a lot to immersion and realism; I hadn't expected that.\n\nNEUTRALs:\n~ My first playthrough took me about twelve hours, I think. The second only ten, years later. I didn't skip stuff in either playthroughs and always tried to explore the areas, so I would be surprised if you could break the 15h mark. \n~ There is no manual save feature, only autosave. It bothered me a lot during my first playthrough, and didn't bother me at all during my second. \n\ntl;dr\nGreat story-focused FPS with RPG elements. Wonderful characters, great story, fantastic setting. Has philosphical and SciFi elements.\n\nDLCs:\nPersonally, I find the DLCs outrageously expensive. Now, in November 2020, the Season Pass was finally 75% off, lowering the price to 5€ (likely same in $), which sounds good to me. \n~ Burial at Sea Episode 1 was somewhat mediocre. It took me about 2h to finish it while exploring every nook and cranny, which isn't all that long. Rapture is admittedly beautiful, but the story lacked the flair of the basegame and felt like a bit of a rush job. Gameplay-wise it's pretty much the same as the original: Booker with his guns and plasmids, while Elizabeth unlocks doors and occasionally throws you med kits, ammo or Eve. It's not a bad DLC, but I don't feel like it added much to BioShock Infinite. \n+ Burial at Sea Episode 2 is exactly what a DLC should be. The 4h of playtime aren't exactly long but definitely sufficient to tell a wonderfully tragic and bittersweet from Elizabeth's perspective, set mostly in Rapture with a short detour to Columbia. Elizabeth plays differently compared to Booker, much more focused on stealth and sneak attacks, and the available weapons and plasmids reflect this. The story is wonderful, completing the circle from BioShock Infinite's ending to the original BioShock's beginning; it's astounding how big a role Elizabeth plays in the backgrounds.","timestamp_created":1497185954,"timestamp_updated":1606578760,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32336220","author":{"steamid":"76561198332174460","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":766,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":766,"last_played":1497157557},"language":"schinese","review":"花了12个小时通关，走走看看，结局让人震撼，虽然第一人称射击这个设定略显不足，但丝毫掩盖不了它的光辉，同时将E称作史上最给力的AI队友毫不为过。初次通关一头雾水，上网查了下人物之间的关系以及背后的历史背景，又是一个轮回与救赎的故事，很庆幸能玩到这款游戏，神作二字当之无愧。强烈建议入手，拿起武器在哥伦比亚的天空之城上演新一轮的暴力美学吧！","timestamp_created":1497165393,"timestamp_updated":1497165393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32335951","author":{"steamid":"76561198111762725","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1851,"last_played":1528608763},"language":"spanish","review":"chido","timestamp_created":1497164157,"timestamp_updated":1542920962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32335696","author":{"steamid":"76561198156004005","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":1307,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1276,"last_played":1499098184},"language":"turkish","review":"Eğlenceli oyun","timestamp_created":1497163094,"timestamp_updated":1646763963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32333437","author":{"steamid":"76561198115787722","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1375,"last_played":1498468112},"language":"english","review":"Damn good game.","timestamp_created":1497152925,"timestamp_updated":1497152925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32328500","author":{"steamid":"76561198383466474","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":797,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":521,"last_played":1497129317},"language":"english","review":"There is so much I want to say, so this may be long which means no one will read it; but no spoilers, I promise. I really wanted this game but hesistated on getting it for a few reasons, so my only regret was not getting it sooner. It really is the best story I have ever seen in a game (granted I havent been playing long)!! We all know it is gorgeous and so fun to just wonder around for a while. Then all hell brakes loose and it becomea really fun. My biggest hesitation was - many people said the combate wasn't great (which is really important to me) but I found no issue with the combat system. My only issue was not having an inventory so if you need vigor for powers or health you better find some (ill go over why this is a big deal when we talk about the girl). The artestry in this game is oustanding, it does start out  a beautiful world but changes as you go through the game which is a nice touch. They really put a lot of thought into every part of this game including the character and even people in the background. The best part (as everyone else has always said) is Elizabeth. I wont remember everything she does but ill try.... She throws you ammo, health, vigor, money when you need it the most. She picks locks and reminds you when you've missed lock picks lying around, and of course she opens tears to other worlds which comes in handy. There is a nice navigation system - just press N then an arrow tells you which way to go. The powers are really cool and i love that the imagery each time you get a new one, its really cool. I can't image anone playing this and not liking it. I wish I could talk about the story but I won't. All I will say is it was so good the second it ended I started playing again, i only stopped to write this review while it was all fresh. I read mix reviews about the ending but I think they did a great job, it was so unquie. Its like those movies you want to watch again. While playing this again I realize there is soo many liittle things I missed, like the stuff people would say that made no sense but now it totally does. Ok, I am done.

Zerado no Hard. Enredo sensacional, absurdamente sensacional, como já é de costume na série. Temas como viagens no tempo e multiversos são abordados (daí vem uma das possíveis interpretações do nome do jogo). A história vai fazendo mais sentido aos poucos, mas somente no último capítulo tudo é explicado e se encaixa. O tombo da cadeira é grande! Jogar o game mais uma vez (no modo desbloqueado “1999” e sem comprar itens nas máquinas de venda) vale a pena, por causa do desafio e também para rever a história e pescar os detalhes dela.\nA dinâmica deste game mudou bastante em relação aos outros dois da saga. A progressão é infelizmente muito linear e conforme se avança no jogo isso se torna mais claro. O jogo alterna entre momentos de história (diálogo, interação, etc.), exploração / busca por itens e combates muito rápidos contra muitos inimigos em áreas geralmente bem grandes. \nO imenso carisma de Elizabeth e sua IA são dignas de prêmio, assim como a relação que vai sendo construída entre ela e o protagonista Booker DeWitt. Os cenários são muito bonitos, mas menos variados que nos anteriores. Os gráficos são lindos demais, não à toa o jogo ganhou a respectiva premiação no Game Awards de 2013. \nInfelizmente algumas características do gameplay que estavam presentes nos games anteriores foram ou totalmente retiradas ou “enfraquecidas” em Infinite, a saber: menor número de “plasmids” (aqui, “vigor”) em toda a série, além da relevância dos upgrades ser menor, a ponto de não dar a sensação de que um vigor “quase novo” foi obtido (como ocorria em Bioshock 2), mas apenas adicionando alguns efeitos (como em Bioshock 1); as “gene tonics” foram retiradas, substituídas em tese pelos Gears; retirada dos tipos diferentes de munições para uma mesma arma, mas manutenção de seu sistema de upgrades; mecânica de hackeamento substituída por um vigor e assim sendo, exclusão dos mini-games de hackeamento.\nConcluindo, se você jogou os BioShock 1 e 2 e gostou, vai gostar desse também. Recomendo comprar a versão com Season Pass e estender muito a longevidade do game através do Clash of Clouds e o Burial at Sea.

I got all three as part of a package sale and if you're curious, I'd certainly recommend it at the price I receieved (less than $15 total). \n\nIn my opinion, this game was definitely the weakest in the franchise. From both a gameplay and narrative perspective, I found it lacking, in particular compared to the first game.\n\nIn general, it feels like a lot of the game mechanics have been toned down. As others have noted, Vigors feel like a lesser version of plasmids. Bizarrely, you can only carry two weapons at once rather than the wheel that was present for both weapons and plasmids in the first two games. That represents a problem in the late game on harder difficulties, where you can find yourself without a heavy weapon to take down some of the higher HP enemies. But this feels like artificial difficulty as they're easy enough if you have an RPG or Volley gun, just tough if you're with a pistol and carbine. \n\nI didn't really buy the story. I \"get\" it, just didn't feel like it was particularly well done or thought out. Though I haven't played the DLCs, I have read about them and I understand some of the bigger picture stuff. Still feels like very lazy writing to me. Certainly no character approaches the feel of an Andrew Ryan or Atlas from the first game, but that's arguably true of Bioshock 2 as well. Without giving much away, this just felt gimmicky to me and not to the standard of Bioshock 1 at all. \n\nMost egregiously, the level design is pretty poor, once again in comparison to the first game. What secrets there are don't feel cleverly done, just kind of tedious. I had like 30 ununsed lockpicks at the end of teh game after unlocking every door and safe. Just very bizarre. \n\nIn conclusion, I did complete the game because I had some inertia, but I don't think I'd recommend a friend buy this one. For a shooter the bioshock franchise has never been great, but mixing in a strong story, level design, RPG elements etc. made it very very enjoyable. But I think this game marks the worst in each of those categories in the series with the exception of graphics, which are admittedly extremely good. \n\nSo if you want a pretty shooter and this is your first entry to the series, by all means go ahead especially on sale. If you've played the first two, just know this one isn't as good.\n","timestamp_created":1496701470,"timestamp_updated":1496701470,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523503899574279785","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32208579","author":{"steamid":"76561198355249254","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1160,"last_played":1503250003},"language":"spanish","review":"Increible, una historia y jugabilidad muy entretenidas que te hacen querer seguir jugando, increible tercer entrega de la saga, reivindicaron lo que no lograron con el 2.

Los dlcs son buenos los de Rapture, el otro es un modo arcade un tanto aburrido., pero son muy cortos, no te gastes mucho diner en ellos.","timestamp_created":1496611810,"timestamp_updated":1496611810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.659618079662322998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32185429","author":{"steamid":"76561198073036645","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1045,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":980,"last_played":1590219001},"language":"russian","review":"История которая не забудется.","timestamp_created":1496611416,"timestamp_updated":1496611416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":477,"votes_funny":67,"weighted_vote_score":"0.786490440368652344","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32185223","author":{"steamid":"76561198253325768","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1767,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":982,"last_played":1623021102},"language":"french","review":"Chef d'Oeuvre ! 10/10","timestamp_created":1496610720,"timestamp_updated":1511437892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkOm8utwCd7jjeg=="}
