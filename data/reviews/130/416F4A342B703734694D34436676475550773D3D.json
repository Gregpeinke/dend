Basically, in Blue Shift, your goal is to escape. Barry meets up with various scientists until he finds Dr. Rosenberg who tasks him with setting up a teleportation machine to escape outside of main Black Mesa compound, other scientists are with Rosenberg as well. The story is rather short, about 2 hours to beat if you bum rush it and play on easy, which is what I did. But it was still fun as it expands on the Half Life universe and you get to hear other characters talk about Freeman and even Shepard, the guy from Opposing Force.\n\nGraphically and technically, Blue Shift has not aged well. The textures are pretty terrible and Barry slides like crazy after letting go of \"w\". It's kind of annoying. I can't blame the devs for the textures though, the game is rather old. But the wasd controls are so clunky. At least the level designs were still great.\n\nPretty good game, super short story though. And I wasn't as invested as I could have been.\n\n8.3/10","timestamp_created":1440542050,"timestamp_updated":1440542050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531347930431365967","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17714142","author":{"steamid":"76561197980230187","num_games_owned":3393,"num_reviews":79,"playtime_forever":374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":374,"last_played":1440515788},"language":"german","review":"Ist gut wie alle Half Life Spiele","timestamp_created":1440532506,"timestamp_updated":1440532506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17704895","author":{"steamid":"76561198240140584","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":42,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":42,"last_played":1439909703},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая Игра","timestamp_created":1440485417,"timestamp_updated":1440485417,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17695757","author":{"steamid":"76561198145130329","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":213,"last_played":1440431301},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life: Blue Shift,одно из дополнений к Half-Life  1998 года выпуска.Сюжет повествует нам, историю от лица всеми любимом Барни Колхауни.Лично мне очень понравилось играть за брутального охранника Барни.В игре практически нет минусов кроме одного.Cлишкомr короткий сюжет!Я пробежал игру за один вечер.Но это не главное.Я очень рад что окунулся в исторю моего любимого персонажа Half-Life!Всем рекомендую игру к ознакомление.Игра оправдала мои ожидания.","timestamp_created":1440432979,"timestamp_updated":1440433066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17684269","author":{"steamid":"76561198073533870","num_games_owned":660,"num_reviews":178,"playtime_forever":142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":142,"last_played":1440364089},"language":"english","review":"The Game is kinda short. u can make it in 2 hours the first time.

Like Opposing Force, you won't be playing as Gordon Freeman in this one. Instead, you'll be seeing the Black Mesa Incident from the point of view of Barney Calhoun, a security guard who you may already know if you played Half-Life 2 first.\n\nThe thing to know about Blue Shift is that aside from having its own campaign, it adds absolutely nothing. No new weapons, in fact less than either of the previous iterations. No new enemies, again less than Opposing Force. You don't even get a new boss fight. On top of all that, it's short, only three hours (or less).\n\nThe one thing Blue Shift adds is the High Definition pack, which overhauls (some) models and textures and can be applied to both Half-Life and Opposing Force. It does a decent job of bringing Half-Life's looks up to standards (for 2001), but some dislike the changes it makes to certain things unnecessarily. Some say it changes the feel of Half-Life. I wouldn't go that far, although there was literally no reason to change the MP5 to an M16. Some might like it, some might not.\n\nSeems like I'm pretty hard on Blue Shift, and it's true, when it was released a lot of people hated it. Having said all that, Blue Shift isn't bad, per se. It's basically just more Half-Life. One thing, I don't know if this was just me, but one of the interesting things about Blue Shift is that while Hard Mode in Half-Life meant that you were never going to have enough health, Blue Shift's hard mode seems to extend that to ammo. That means that until you start fighting marines later in the game, it almost feels like a survival horror game. This is very enjoyable, and adds a difference of feel from Shephard or Freeman as playable characters.\n\nBlue Shift isn't bad, it just isn't much.

A NEGATIVE Half-Life game review? Best to downvote it and not read it. As long as something has Half-Life in the title it can't POSSIBLY be shit! No. Boring at best and flat out bad at worst Blue Shift has the honor of being Half-Life's red headed step child (No offense to red headed step children.). Many will assume that because it's related to Half-Life it's good or that because it's a expansion much like Opposing Force which is considered to be one of the best expansions ever made. Opposing Force was pretty damn good as far as expansions go so this being the Yang to Opposing Forces Yin is disappointing. \n\nIf Half-Life were The Terminator and Opposing Force was Terminator 2 then Blue Shift would best be decribed as Terminator 3. Blue Shift came 4 years after Half-Life and 3 years after Opposing Force. Very little has been done and a lot has been taken away or miserably mimicked from the prior titles with the only worthwhile thing to come from this other than an HD model pack was that now one of the many Barney's has been given the last name Calhoun meaning that THIS of all things is canon.\n\nFirst the positive. The best thing about Blue Shift is it's built upon Gold Source (Really stretching here). While the places you fight the HECU are the highlight of the game because they are ONLY fun thing in the whole game and even then these areas are poorly designed as their placement is poor/careless/haphazard. The HD pack is also a good option to toggle between having on or off. And it's short (A blessing and a curse all considered). I guess it does try something new in regards to having constant interaction with a single NPC named Dr.Rosethal (or something) later in the game but thats about it.\n\nHo boy onto the bad. Blue Shift feels like someone released an unreleased game that had cancelled early in development with nothing but it's basic skeleton finished, waiting for the meat and muscle to be added prior to the afformentioned cancellation. Released in 2001 and yet free mods have larger more impressivley designed areas, setpeices and scripted sequences for free. It has dull puzzles, and uninteresting story that says nothing new, the game is short yet has a lot of it's lenght taken by REALLY bad Xen levels, and it has lengthy PAINFUL sewer levels early on that very few of my friends have ever even gotten the motivation to get past to this day. It's worst offense is how it fails the core attraction and appeal of Half-Life which is to feel like you have been put into a real/tangible location. Thanks to how bad and bizzare the layouts are past the short opening before the elevator this is failed epicly. Nothing interesting happens. Funnily enough this is far from the worst FPS I've ever played (Chaser and Medal of Honor: Underground for the GBA come to mind.) as it is at least stable/functional but it makes the cardinal sin of wasting my time and being so boring as to make you question why you bothered playing it or games in general.\n\n\"How could something made by Valve be bad?\" you say. Opposing Force and But S h i t were made by Gearbox in addition to an often forgotten COOP addon for a PS2 port of Half-Life that was worked on by Gearbox. I don't dislike it because it's by Gearbox as that would be petty but if you are inclined to defend it for the glory of Valve as opposed to based on his own merits than at least you know it wasn't by them now. Another annoyance is that Barney goes into space aka Xen without any sort of protective gear so who needs a space suit when you can hold your breath right? They weren't kidding when they said the fabric in their dress shirts can really breath.\n\nOpposing Force is one of the few expansions that was not only great but could stand on it's own so may so maybe the expectations for Blue Shift aren't fair. While Opposing Force is non canon dissapointingly all thanks to it's inclusion of badly designed aliens called Race X Blue Shift on the other hand is. That might be because it has no new weapons or aliens though because it's not like anything interesting happens in Blue Shift other than Barney physically escaping before all the interesting shit like the military pulling out could happen (Oh and Shepard gets mentioned for some reason in addition to you watching Gordon get dragged away). Considering the time and location Shepard arrived at Black Mesa it's not to hard to believe that there may be weapons Gordon didn't find as the HECU related weapons that Shepard would come across weren't very common compared to the MP5/M4. No new weapons is sort of excusable having played future titles like Half-Life 2: Episode 1 and 2 but considering Opposing Force was probably made by similar people it's ridiculous that they learned nothing and that there was no variety. \n\nNo Race X? Thats fine. The Race X aliens didn't fit in with Half-Life's aliens and weren't even fun to fight. In Blue Shift the environments were made small for console in addition to already being painfully linear, uninteresting and looking really out of place. They are REALLY flat. You have sewers, parking lots, sewers, storage rooms, parking lots, sewers, parking lots and Xen. That's a lot of variety ey? All the puzzles take forever and the peices for them move slow as hell. The combat encounters are also a  bore and primarily take place in these afformentioned parking lots or a train yard which while outdoors don't seem to be part of the facility thanks to poor cohesion. \n\nI don't swear often but I must to get to the point and be brash. You are a security gaurd. In Black Mesa. And luckily you are Barney Calhoun out of all of them. Yeah not much is going to happen this should be pretty grounded. Then again this is Black Mesa. Other then the arbitrary showing Black Mesa go to hell during the resonance cascade whats there to show? How many dull fucking puzzles can one gaurd survive? I like puzzles so why is this game so bad at them? Where the fuck are other friendly NPCs and security gaurds after the resonance cascade? You'll see one get killed by zombies and another thrown in a pit but thats all I can recall. Why doesn't Barney talk? Does Black Mesa go out of their way to diversity hire tons of mutes? The amount of mutes around here is getting out of control. Not only that but if it's canon why is Barney so quiet? If Barney spoke that would really give it some personality. \n\nAlso I get Barneys resourceful but without the HEV suit or some protective gear he should look like swiss cheese considering all the shit he survives. In Opposing Force you take more damage because a vest and some armor isn't as protective as an HEV suit but here in Blue Shift they treat nothing but a vest and a dress shirt like a bomb defuesal kit armor wise. Again, the story on offer is just so meaningless and worse yet the gameplay is hampered by the awful design. The fact it's version of Xen managed to be WORSE than Xen in Half-Life is amazing. Not to mention he goes to space with nothing but what you see him wearing on the cover. Stay away and buy Opposing Force or Half-Life if you haven't already!\n\nWow what a wall of text.
