The story is excellent, the voice acting talent is top-notch, and the puzzles are very clever and extremely satisfying. The co-op mode is also very fun, and really tests your communication skills and teamwork. Without proper communication, it really is quite challenging. The soundtrack is awesome, and is testament to how talented the people are over at Valve. This is an absolute masterpiece.

Zaczynając od trybu singleplayer mogę powiedzieć, że zarówno fabuła, grafika, gameplay oraz soundtrack nie zawiodły moich oczekiwań. Przy zagadkach trzeba się chwilę zastanowić, jednak ani razu mi się nie zdarzyło zaciąć na tyle bym musiał sprawdzać rozwiązanie w internecie. Dodając do tego pojawiające się co jakiś czas bardziej ekscytujące momenty, a także tajemniczą otoczkę dostajemy świetną zabawę, którą ciężko zapomnieć. Kampania kooperacyjna też jest niczego sobie. Może fabułą oraz długością nie dorównuje tej głównej, ale mimo wszystko z uwagi na sam fakt grania z kolegą raczej nie można tam się nudzić. Przy okazji dzięki zwiększonej liczbie portali do wykorzystania trudność zagadek znacznie wzrasta, przez co trzeba przy nich spędzić dużo więcej czasu, by najczęściej metodą prób i błędów dojść do właściwego rozwiązania. Jednak dzięki temu zapewniają także znacznie więcej satysfakcji po rozwiązaniu.
