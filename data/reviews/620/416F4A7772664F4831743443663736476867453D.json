It's a classic of video games. Ask any PC gamer about Portal, and they will know about it. It is a true icon to have in your library, with a great physics engine and loads of community based support the game manages to keep on selling and even winning awards, winning the \"Golden Joystick Award\" once in its lifetime.\n\nAbout Portal 2:\nPublished on 18th April, 2011 by Valve Corporation\nEngine: Source\n\nVery smooth but rather short campaign, however the voices and the clever use of props and other system clashes has lead the game to immense popularity. Especially when it comes to the exact words that the characters say, which are in some sense rather a mix of Dark Humour and sensitive Sarcasm.\n\nThe game has faired well in the market and is recommended to be bought for its Singleplayer and Co-op campaigns. Also adding a free solution to more gameplay, where the community makes their own maps and creates their own ideas around problems.\n\nWith the success of Portal (1), Portal 2 is a great follow-up, following the same principle with again... More Dark Humour and even more Sarcasm.\n\nVerdict:\n- A great game with a lot of potential.\n- Amazing map creating system for users. (no special programs necessary)\n- Great Singleplayer and Co-op campaign.\n- Amazing sales throughout its lifetime prove the game to be trustworthy to be bought.\n- For a 6 year old (updated 2017) game, it holds a nice amount of awards which bring it to success.\n- Impressive use of the Source Engine. So quite similar physics to games like; Half-life 2 and CS:GO.\n- A masterpiece of a game and a true classic!\n- This game made me cry. Such a beutiful game. ;)\n\nIn-general, I would strongly recommend buying the game!","timestamp_created":1506378219,"timestamp_updated":1506380606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35210075","author":{"steamid":"76561198195015942","num_games_owned":715,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1967,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":904,"last_played":1609727045},"language":"german","review":"[h1] Portal 2 ist brilliant.[/h1]\n\nIch bin zu tränen gerührt, denn beide Portal Teile sind absolute Spitzenklasse.\n\nDas Gameplay, die Logik und Schwierigkeit halte ich für sehr gut abgestimmt und das beste an der Portal Reihe, der Humor und die Story, kommen nicht zu kurz.\n\nVon mir gibt es eine absolute Kaufempfehlung, vor Allem für diejenigen, die schon Spiele wie \"Please, Don`t Touch Anything\", \"The Stanley Parable\" und \"Dr Langeskov, The Tiger And The Terribly Cursed Emerald - A Whirlwind Heist\" gespielt haben, denn diese wurden offensichtlich stark von Portal inspiriert.\n\nUpdate: Ich habe mittlerweile auch die COOP-Kampagne mit einem guten Freund durchgespielt und bin der Meinung, dass auch dieser Teil des  Games absolut zu empfehlen ist, denn zu Portal gesellt sich hier die COOP-Dynamik, die sich bei mir in endlosen Lachanfällen geäußert hat.","timestamp_created":1506371220,"timestamp_updated":1572361914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35209286","author":{"steamid":"76561198142707440","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":419,"last_played":1506263713},"language":"french","review":"Bon jeu histoire sympathique et on en apprend plus sur Glados","timestamp_created":1506368175,"timestamp_updated":1506368175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35208437","author":{"steamid":"76561198162283953","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":980,"last_played":1590230363},"language":"english","review":"Short Review:\nGreat game, worth it.\n\nIn-depth review:\nAnother amazing game from the world of Half-Life! This game is a gripping adventure through the Aperture Science laboratories while, once again, doing testing for GLaDOS. Naturally, there are some interesting boss battles and well-thought out puzzles in the game. However, I found the old Cave Johnson area of the facility dragged out for a long, long time. An interesting adition to the Portal game are the new Gels; Repulsion Gel, Propulsion Gel, Conversion Gel and Cleansing Gel. They add a facinating twist to the game.\n\nUnlike the original Portal, this game also has a multiplayer co-op which can be played with 1 friend.\nSomehow, I managed to find myself a friend, and we played through the first few chapters of the co-op missions. A few things I love about the co-op missions are the gestures, and also the sheer siliness of the Robots. My friend was assigned the role of the Orange robot (the dimmer of the two) and he played that role very well, by messing up things a lot. The puzzles are great and all, but having a friend just adds a whole new level of greatness!\n\nWell, I think I've rambled on long enough and many people will have the \"TLDR\" attitude, so I have decided to add a Short review at the top.\n\nThanks for reading,\nAgent","timestamp_created":1506365051,"timestamp_updated":1506365051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35207845","author":{"steamid":"76561198407658226","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":395,"last_played":1509027582},"language":"russian","review":"Игра качественная.

I think the Potal puzzles were harder compared to portal 2, still enjoyed most of them and would play again!  \n\nI rate this 7/10, the reasons are above. Please make Portal 3 better than this. Maybe combine it with black mesa or smth from half-life. Would be cool.","timestamp_created":1506297318,"timestamp_updated":1506297318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35192030","author":{"steamid":"76561198062802687","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":803,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":773,"last_played":1501718346},"language":"brazilian","review":"Gostei muito da mecanica do jogo, os puzzle sao enigmaticos voce gasta um tempo olhando ao redor para char a solução, faz vc pensar mesmo, estou no aguardo do Portal 3.","timestamp_created":1506292024,"timestamp_updated":1506292024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35190811","author":{"steamid":"76561198029742769","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1687,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1381,"last_played":1507459495},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic follow up to a legendary game. \nThe addition of a cooperative mode makes this game phenomenal.","timestamp_created":1506286950,"timestamp_updated":1506286950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35189738","author":{"steamid":"76561198253770310","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":388,"last_played":1594312440},"language":"english","review":"one second i am here next second i am there W00SH teleport is cool","timestamp_created":1506283385,"timestamp_updated":1506283385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478431373834609985","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35188662","author":{"steamid":"76561198141376321","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":762,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":534,"last_played":1584130582},"language":"russian","review":"One of the best game ever!","timestamp_created":1506279970,"timestamp_updated":1506279970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35188299","author":{"steamid":"76561198199624526","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":1476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1399,"last_played":1530659854},"language":"turkish","review":"Arkadaşlarla çok eğlenceli single da biraz sıkabilir","timestamp_created":1506278940,"timestamp_updated":1506278940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50519031286239624","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35187059","author":{"steamid":"76561198415531328","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":537,"last_played":1507698601},"language":"english","review":"Such a fun game that builds on the original in pretty much every way.

great sequel of the original Portal, this game has everything you want for a game nowaday: graphics, story, stages (in this game.. puzzles), characters, soundtracks, and co-op mode that.. while it's a little bit complicated when you haven't played the single player story mode, still awesome and worth spending your time on\nOverall: 9/10.
