The variety of weapons to keep with you in the main game is my gripe compared to the DLCs. It's like going to a war starting with your only weapon then take or steal more. But being a Bioshock game means you do have vigors to use to attack or defend from enemies, just like the fighters from Dragonball Z. The maps are not as linear as typical war-genre games but I would think the map should be more open enough just not to fall off the map.\n\nOverall, the hidden collectables I didn't managed to find all of them, the whole storyline, combat and the graphics are excellent. I just think the dialogues could be improved more to add the energy of the characters to their full extent.\n\nCome to think of, if anyone was wondering the ridiculously long playtime I achieved was all because off my addiction pointing the gun at Liz and watch her reacting to it.
