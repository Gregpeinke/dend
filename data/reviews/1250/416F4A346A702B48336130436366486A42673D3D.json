I bought it on sale figuring I'd play it once in a while at a LAN party or something. But once I started playing it hooked me pretty quick. There is something really satisfying about all the weapons, and upgrading your perks really adds to your combat effectiveness. Using iron sights is essential and firing \"from the hip\" with no on-screen aimpoint adds an additional challenge but when you get good at it you feel pretty badass. Teamplay is essential and I love that 6 people can play instead of just 2 or 4 like most co-op games. Gameplay is relatively simple (fight off waves of monsters with a boss at the end) but the levels are large and well designed. Strategy consists of finding a holdout spot with fallbacks (if possible) and channeling the zombies into your killzone. Public games actually work well too. This game is very different from Left 4 Dead 1&2 in a good way.

The variety of equipment is very good; better that L4D2, say, with no 'dud' items.\n\nInterestingly, playing as one class doesn't halt your progress against the other six. For example, a medic who fires a shotgun or lobs a grenade can advance their support and demolitions skills, respectively.

For beginners, it has a lot of replayability value (since obtaining level six perks takes quite a while) which can take from 100-200 hours. After that, due to the Steam Workshop, there are a lot of options of playing with modded content. There are also dedicated custom servers with custom skins, perks, levels, weapons and more! (I recommend International Gaming Community btw ;) ) The gameplay isn't something to write home about, but there is something about that hooks you on. It's not as team intensive as L4D2, (as in, when there's only one person left, they're basically dead) but it does get close to that point. It's harder to understand the mechanics than L4D2 (since different weapons at different levels for different perks do different thigs to different enemies on different difficulties at different.. see what I'm getting at here?) BUT, once you get the hang of it, the game is tons of fun to play! Get a friend or two, (or three, or four, or five!) and get into a server and go spend hours and hours leveling up! :D\n\nIn conclusion, want to shoot zombies with your friends while having a level up game mechanic with different kinds of enemies and perks?

There are lots of games that claim to be co-op but Killing Floor demands that each player do their job and that overall you work with a team you can trust.
