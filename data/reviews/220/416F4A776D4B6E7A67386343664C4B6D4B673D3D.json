The long awaited sequel to the mindblowing Half-Life(1998) is not only ahead of it's time but a consistent source of joy for years to come. No other game has a physics based gameplay that engages you throughout the entire game. No other game has level design that features exploration throughout a linear story. No other game allows you to contorl hordes of monsters to assault and bring down a high security dystopian prison. All of these facets are not parts of the game they are part of an entire expereince that leaves so much to be desired from every shooter that has been released to date. \n\nThe short of it: Half-Life 2 will never get old for a long list of good reasons. Buy now!\n\nThe long of it: Half-Life 2 has been out for over ten years at this point and it still feels as if it were minty fresh on the store page. I find myself inexplicably pretending to be Gordon Freeman as he lives and breaths in the fumes of a 7 hour war he never witnessed. The world has chunks and crumbs of lore and all of it compliments gameplay significantly. The Black Mesa incident is not forgotten as the entire game takes from its predecessors storyline. The old NPClones you briefly encountered before are now fully fledged characters with plot and arc all their own. The new faces allow us to see what it means to showcase characters to a voiceless protaganist with full facial animations, and voice acting that has yet to find its equal in the industry let alone first person shooters of the \"Next Gen\" Era.\n\nThe immersion simply accentuates gameplay. The enimies are fierce and smart, or slow and overwhelming (in the best ways). The pacing allows for an experience that doesn't lead you to questions about the flaws or inconsistancies of the world, but rather shows in every moment of its playthrough how it makes sense and what the world has been up too since Gordons departure in the first game. \n\nMuch of what this game entails is great level design that urges you to press forward and search resource caches. Shooting with a myriad of weapons has never felt so engaging and rewarding. The guidance and motivation to achieve the goal is done so tastefully and without campiness that the game pulls you through its story without you even noticing. The physics engine is one that has yet to be matched by any game since its release! I can use physics to kill as well as overcome obstacles!\n\nThere are so many unique moments in this game that the only way you can understand its scale and scope is to play through it. In the end Half-Life 2 leaves only one thing to be desired after ten years: Half-Life 3. If it is as big of a leap from top to bottom as half-life to Half-Life 2 was then it will be worth the wait. If you honestly can't think of what to play next open up Half-Life 2, put on a hazard suit, and get ready for the whole city to chase you down a shooting exprience of the highest caliber.","timestamp_created":1405016486,"timestamp_updated":1405016486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11163974","author":{"steamid":"76561197985615652","num_games_owned":362,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":786,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":786,"last_played":1330156800},"language":"french","review":"HL2 n'a pas besoin de commentaire.","timestamp_created":1404986516,"timestamp_updated":1404986516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11160881","author":{"steamid":"76561198083683515","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2134,"last_played":1404786074},"language":"english","review":"Loved this game, source engine was fantastic.. however.. the story at times made me feel a little \"blind\" the plot seemed to be very loose, and i found myself having many questions after finishing the main game in regards to the story.

I enjoyed it alot through my 14 hour playthrought and i must say it surprised me. I was always very close to half-life series. it was a game of my childhood. i loved original hl because of its soundtrack and many more. First things first so lets talk about the combat. IT'S GLORIOUS no really if you want a nice shooting experience then choose this game. Combine soldiers and metrocops as well as striders and gunships are enemies that you will encounter. Many weapons and GRAV GUN the best gun in gaming history (apart from Samus's Murder Beam) you can kill people with TOILETS! and BEDS! and JUNK! But lets go to story. Combine taken control over earth and resistance tries to beat them .Allies!  Vortigaunts are friends (i dont trust them anyway) and ALYX OMG ALYX! The best sidekick in gaming history (sorry companion cube). She helps you and spits Breen's face. Eli and Kleiner your friends from Black Mesa ( Gordon is a nerd but he is a nerd that can beat you to death with crowbar. Or toilet). So i tell you now BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT! I'm a huge hl fan and i played every single HL1 expansion and completed it 5 times. If you are HL universe nerd then buy this game right now. Summary: Gameplay 9/10 (Some physics engine bugs) Story 10/10 (one of the best stories told apart from Heavy Rain) Sound 8/10 (Gliches) Weapons 9+/10 (explosive barrel cliche) Overall 8+/10.\n\n\nThank You Valve and remember: I WAIT FOR HL3!\n\nEdit: My english got better since i wrote this so hopefully you can at least undrstand this part.\nHalf life 2 is 11 years old but it still has one of the best shaders to date. most modern games are either too dark or too bright. also the lens flare is not noticeable which makes it an even more enjoyable experience. Some people say that this game sucks. Why? Because of:\n\n-Bad graphics (Then why does ocarina of time have 99 points on Metacritic? it has even worse graphics but alot of people love it to this day (me included)\n\n-Blank character (...No just No. The quiet protagonist it helps you get immersed in the eastern europe setting of this game and also, Gordon does not save the world. in HL1, Without help of other employees he would not kill nihilanth and most of humanity would be dead before combine's arrival.)\n\n-Bad Physics (I admit the physics can be a little bit weird at times but it has an much better physics engine than other non-physic based games. But that was the main thing about HL1 n' 2. Physics. There are better physic engines out there but if HL2 wouln't be physic based then the Grav gun would not be in the game.

You have a variety of weapons, but can only hold so much ammo.   When you pick up stuff (by touching it), it adds those bullets/health to your supplies if you have any missing, and any excess is lost.  Carrying around health packs/extra ammo is impossible.  You still progress through a bunch of areas, needing to press the right button or trigger the right event to proceed.\nWhat sets it apart is the obvious polish, quality design, and good story.  The game uses only in-engine cinematics, and never takes over the player's camera.  It counts on you to observe the world around you, take an interest in the environment, and solve the various physics puzzles.  \n\nInstead of just a bunch of corridors and enemies (though it has those, too), it focuses on small engagements, then big set-piece battles.  You'll play for a while in one setting on foot, then switch to a more vehicle-oriented bit, then a new mechanic is introduced, then it kind of repeats those 3, etc.  This varies up the gameplay and keeps introducing fresh concepts through little in-game tutorials.\n\nAbout the only complaint I had is that the game wants you to be immersed in its world, and use their impressive physics engine to solve puzzles.  It wants you to approach the obstacles as if you were actually there, making use of the objects around you to get past them.  This is great when it works, like making use of plastic barrels' buoyancy to get past one spot, but then you get to points where you try out a solution over and over, convinced it should be working, and it won't.  Oh, it [i]should[/i] work, because it seems obvious, and because it totally [i]would[/i] work in the real world, but in the game they want you to do something else pre-scripted, and until you figure out what that thing is, you're not going anywhere.  They make you stack boxes & crates in several spots to climb up/over things, but try it in the wrong place and you'll hit an invisible wall.  There's one area where you have to get past an electric fence and can see the power cable running above you.  Even though you've got a way to hurl nice big, sharp, wide saw blades with great speed and accuracy, you can't sever that cable.  No amount of shooting will help, either.  That cable's not a solid object, it's just there to let you know where to go to hit the switch that you need to find in order to turn off the fence.\nDespite a few tired elements and some minor breaks in the immersion, this is one hell of a game.","timestamp_created":1404801281,"timestamp_updated":1404801281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503153085708618164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11129032","author":{"steamid":"76561198059140584","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":119,"last_played":1481252577},"language":"english","review":"everyone needs this game","timestamp_created":1404794762,"timestamp_updated":1404794762,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11128255","author":{"steamid":"76561198041013325","num_games_owned":582,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":3164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3082,"last_played":1574803229},"language":"english","review":"An incredibly well paced game with an excellent balance between exploration and action, and still, after 10 freakin' years, a leader in conveying an interactive narrative.\n\nThe people at valve are not only experts in gameplay and pacing, but also at facial animation and NPC player tracking which give the game an immersive step above the rest in terms of really selling the story to you.

There are good reasons why this got a metascore of 96/100. What propped the game to such a reputation is the immersion factor. It's been said before that playing through the eyes of  Gordon Freeman (in First person mode) enhanced the feeling of being part of the Half-Life universe and the cause being fought for in the game. That is quite true. But I must add that the surrounding characters also contribute to immersive feeling of the gamer. The characters are fleshed out; the facial animations, subtle expressive actions, running animations, and dialogue gave me the impression that I was engaging with \"real\" people.\n\nIf I had to describe the gameplay in two words they would be: fluidity and variety. Fluid because there are no cutscenes and very little breaks in the game. No framerate issues that make your mouse movements feel laggy (well, at least for me). Variety because you tread diverse landscapes in the game from the urban, daylight environment of City 17 to the creepy, dark, zombie-infested town of Ravenholm. There are also diverse obstacles in your way outside the Combine soldiers which include dangerous choppers, physics puzzles, sand traps, and much more. \n\nThanks to the variety, the game does not feel monotonous at any point; it often forces you to adapt your strategies in a given situation,which made it more interesting to me than just mindlessly shooting and plowing through enemies. Like the immersion factor, fluidity and variety helped this game achieve its masterpiece status. \n\nRecommended for all FPS gamers. If you're still skepitcal about purchasing it for whatever reason, you can download the free demo to try it out.","timestamp_created":1404595220,"timestamp_updated":1404609554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11091085","author":{"steamid":"76561198048402447","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":283,"last_played":1374186249},"language":"english","review":"This game is a masterpiece.
