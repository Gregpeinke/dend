Buena jugabilidad y optimizado.\nMe pareció buena la historia, pero no me gusto la manera en la que uno la experimenta.

Граффика примерно средненькое по тем годам - ( хотя это не особо важно ). Так же интересная задумка сражения - ( то бишь 4vs4 люди против заражённых). А в плане компании обстоит всё так - надо просто добраться из пункта А в пункт Б - ( проще говоря, бегаем от убежища к убежищу что бы добраться до спасательного транспорта).\n\nНебольшое введение по особым заражённым и методами борьбы, для тех кто только только решил ознакомится с данной игрой. \n\nВсего особых заражённых 5 , и почти у каждого из имеются способности. Начну с - Охотник -( способности у него такова - набрасывается прыжком на выжившего и наносит урон когтями, издаёт рычание когда ходит на четвереньках, до тех пор пока он не начнёт ходить на четвереньках, он будет идеально бесшумным.Чем как раз таки можно использовать в режиме Сражений, ну а если он решил прыгнуть на вас, то вы можете его резко в этот момент его оттолкнуть).  Толстяк - ( ну это тупо ходячий клиент МакДака, своей блевотой может призывать орду. Но, с лёгкостью можно убивать без каких либо проблем, потому как выдаёт громкими звуками бульканья и отрыжками, хотя один раз он может не издать и звука, что даст премущественно заблевать вас из какого нибудь угла/или прохода/или с крышы, а если он стал перед вами, то толкните его и убейте, ибо после смерти блевота на вас может попасть). Курильщик - ( тоже как и толстяка можно вычислить по звуку, он постоянно кашляет и даже когда просто стоит, так же он может выдать себя небольшим дымом который он испускает при ходьбе, хватает своим длинным языком выжившего и тянет к себе что бы отрезать от остальных и в то же время наносит дамаг после того как  подтянул к себе). Ведьма - ( внешне выглядит тощей и костлявенькой, выдаёт себя звуками плача, с ней можно вообще даже не сражаться, главное идите на шифте рядом с ней и не светите фонариком, но вы можете быстро убить её.Притом условии если есть полицейская дробь - она быстрая и выпускает быстрыми выстрелами по 2-3 картечи, и надо успеть её убить ДО того как она встанет, способностей у неё нет,кроме острых ногтей). и вот венец ужаса так сказать... ТАНК - ( это просто невероятная гора мышц которая  может машины на вас свалить без какого либо труда, валить эту махину лучше в 2-3 и закинуть молотов этой горилле, и да он передвигается на своих руках как горилла или арангутанг, может метать камни). \nА теперь, предметы и оружие ; Предметов совсем немного - Бомбы,Молотовы,Аптечки,Таблетки. Но чем я действительно  я разочарован, это скудность разнообразия оружия, всего их 6 шт - 2 дроби-Помповый и Полицейский, 2 автомата-Узи-М16, 1 снайперка - Охотничья, Пистолеты. \n\nНебольшие советы по использованию предметов. \nАптечки - Советую их держать до тех пор пока хотя бы вас не вывели из строя, а потом можете лечится/ или полечить друих.\nТаблетки - тоже самое как аптечки, НО, их можно передать другим если тем нужно-(справка для тех кто только начал играть в данную игру, таблетки дают ВРЕМЕННОЕ ЗДОРОВЬЕ,поэтому будет убавляться).\nБомбы- советую кидать  тогда когда вас заблюёт толстый.\nМолотов- Тоже советую держать, либо после того как вас заблевали, или же использовать на танке - ( кстати факт который я вспомнил, танка можно потушить блевотой толстого)\n\nИтог : 9 блюющих толстяков из 10.\nP.S. \nКак не прискорбно, но в данной части..... онлайн чутка под-вымер, примерно % 20-35 играют в эту часть - ( по большей части наши играют в неё).","timestamp_created":1598562612,"timestamp_updated":1598696955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554327130317687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75022058","author":{"steamid":"76561198088671224","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":97,"playtime_forever":21,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1482642379},"language":"english","review":"YES its an amazing game but don't waste your money on it, buy the second game.

The basic premise is that you are a team of 4 survivors left in a world where most people are zombies and you have to go through each campaign from start to finish without dying all the while being hunted by the zombie horde and special infected.\n\nThe game plays like your typical Source engine shooter so if you've played one then the learning curve here won't be that difficult, but this game feels so satisfying as each gun really has a distinct feeling of impact and control to it that other games don't. Each of the 6 guns all are good in their own ways and can be deadly in the hands of a great player. You have The Pump Shotgun, The Uzi SMG, The M16 Assault Rifle, The Hunting Rifle as well as The Auto Shotgun and your Pistol Side Arm.\n\nThe game looks really good for 2008 as it has some really nice lighting effects and models for the time. It also is very well optimized and will run on pretty much anything, even a potato could run this well.\n\nI also think the campaigns themselves are all very good and each feel distinct and different enough and are fun to play through over and over again, especially in Versus mode.\n\nSpeaking of I feel I should mention the modes available in the game. You have your standard Campaign mode where up to 4 players play through a campaign and try to survive till the end, There is Versus mode where 8 players face off in a 4 vs 4 battle in a campaign where 4 players play as the Special Infected and the Tank and the other 4 play as the survivors and the 2 teams trade roles back and forth to see who gets the furthest in the campaign and the team with the highest score at the end wins. The other mode is Survival which involves up to 4 players playing as the Survivors in a small map and trying to last for as long as they can before they are overwhelmed, it may seem simple but it gets chaotic really fast.\n\nI feel I should mention the Special Infected as well, There exist 5 types of special infected in Left 4 Dead, they are as such\n\nThe Boomer: A big fat Zombie that is slow and very weak but if he vomits on you or blows up on you then he will cover you in Bile which will attract hordes to you as well as cover your screen.\n\nThe Smoker: This guy will grab you from a distance with his Tongue and drag you to him where he will start hammering away at you or he'll hang you from a high place, the only way to escape is to either shoot him before he drags you or a teammate will have to help.\n\nThe Hunter: This guy can move pretty fast and is small, but he can leap onto a survivor and pin them down and constantly slash away at you, the only way to get him off is for another player to smack him off or shoot him.\n\nThe Tank: The Tank is like a boss basically and only shows up once or twice per chapter depending on the campaign, he takes a big beating and he deals out a lot of damage by punching you or throwing rocks at the player. He also can smack cars and other objects into a survivor for an instant knockdown, so watch out.\n\nThe Witch: The Witch is a stationary infected that sits and cries and if she is awakened or startled by a survivor such as shining a flashlight on her or getting to close, she'll get up and charge at that survivor and instantly knock them down if she lands a hit and will continue to slash away. It's best to stay away from her\n\n\nI also really love the horror atmosphere of this game as it really nails it's tone so well and the characters are fantastic and all have unique personalities, backstories and bounce off each other well and are entertaining.\n\nOverall this game is really a classic and you absolutely should play it, I also would highly recommend playing it over Left 4 Dead 2 as this game is a much better experience.\n\nI would give this game a solid 9/10","timestamp_created":1598496238,"timestamp_updated":1652242526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74961803","author":{"steamid":"76561197989945278","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":5655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5599,"last_played":1615092738},"language":"english","review":"great

Суть все игры бегаешь, убиваешь зомби, и выполняешь задания. ","timestamp_created":1598253959,"timestamp_updated":1598253959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545680642127990723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74821678","author":{"steamid":"76561198090314791","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1598251828},"language":"spanish","review":"el mejor juego de zombies que pudo crear Valve","timestamp_created":1598251903,"timestamp_updated":1598251903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74815510","author":{"steamid":"76561198835614010","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1973,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1969,"last_played":1599106163},"language":"english","review":"Good Game","timestamp_created":1598239429,"timestamp_updated":1657157190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74809407","author":{"steamid":"76561198245979862","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":887,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1641334929},"language":"english","review":"A pleageback in the day because everybody talked about it and most pople had it, but i didnt cuz i wasnt into killing a horrible amout of zomis but to be honest: Recently when lockdown stared i checked it out and love it^^ \n\nIt has that classy good old school CS feel that i like anyways and the mPCs are fun to listen when thay give out a stupid and fun comment^^ :D\n","timestamp_created":1598228244,"timestamp_updated":1598228244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74805100","author":{"steamid":"76561198802838060","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":388,"last_played":1653855848},"language":"english","review":"...GOOD GAME....I LOVE ZOMBIE GAMES.....","timestamp_created":1598220649,"timestamp_updated":1598220649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74795332","author":{"steamid":"76561197978413207","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":57,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":57,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"This game is super boring. Not much else to say about it. There are four weapons to choose from, and 3(?) weapons of a higher tier (kinda) later on that you can switch to. A couple maps to get through. \n\nIt's only fun when you play with a group of friends and are in a rowdy mood already.\n\nOther than that, this game's been uninstalled on my computer for years since I bought it.","timestamp_created":1598206516,"timestamp_updated":1598206516,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.444553464651107788","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsoOijvQCdJSpnQI="}
