If you've never played it, never experienced the true birth of the shooting genre, then you best be buying this game. Half Life didn't just revolutionize the genre; it gave it it's modern form. \n\nHalf Life is split across many different chapters, and honestly is great length. It takes about 13 hours total to beat, making it longer than some modern games, but also short enough to play casually. The game's chapters are all individual experiences that don't do justice just watching or explaining. When you play this game, you understand why it's loved.\n\nThe shooting, while a little odd at times, is great. Enemies aren't impossible to kill and take a reasonable amount of damage to eliminate. Ammo isn't everywhere, but you almost always have a gun with some ammo through the majority of the game. You never run too low on it; it's found in many rooms and many corpses across the whole Black Mesa Complex. \n\nThe only complaints? Two. Uno, the difficulty. If you casually game, or even somewhat often game, play on at max medium. Hard is doable of course; I just did it myself. But christ, it's a pain. The game doesn't allow you to change the difficulty, so if you start on Hard like me, you're stuck on it. On hard, the Health and Suit Recharge Stations are unforgiving, only giving around 30 of each at max. The enemies tank a bit more ammo, and quick-saving becomes a common occurrence. It's mostly down to the fact that Hard, back in the day, meant HARD. If you want to try it, it's up to you.\n\nSPOLIER ALERT FOR THIS PARAGRAPH! The other complaint is the last portion of the game; Xen. Xen, as many will say, is the game at it's lowest. The idea of pressing ctrl and space to do a long jump complicates things. The jump is often unresponsive, and sometimes you'll just not do it even though you really should have. It's also needed a lot for Xen, such as leaping across spiraling islands and such. The platforming is really annoying with this mechanic, and it makes the game overly difficult at times. Some other issues are with the overabundance of enemies, and the lack of ammo. It really combines into a hell of corridors filled with enemies that you only get the bare minimum to kill. Might just be a hardmode issue, but it really hurt me.\n\nOverall, it's a fantastic classic, a true glory of the 1990s. I fully suggest playing it, ESPECIALLY if you plan to play Black Mesa, the remake of Half Life. It is a good place to start when getting into Half Life in general, and is an amazing game to play in your free time.","timestamp_created":1584328823,"timestamp_updated":1584328823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65125059","author":{"steamid":"76561198351214658","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":345,"last_played":1611613061},"language":"english","review":"is gud 7/10 and mods are the GOAT","timestamp_created":1584328422,"timestamp_updated":1584328422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65124824","author":{"steamid":"76561198061335343","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":970,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":851,"last_played":1592769376},"language":"german","review":"This game is very epic.

Japanese Caption Ver」というものができ、そちらからゲームを起動することになります。\nなのでHalf-Lifeにプレイ時間は記録されません。自分も日本語化したのでプレイ時間が極端に短くなっていますが、難易度普通で一度クリアしました。\nチートコマンドで無敵になったりすることも可能ですが、それだとゲームを始めからやり直す必要があります。\n途中から「敵が強いからここからはチートを使おう・・・」ということはできません。\n\nゲームの中身についてです\nなかなか面白いゲームでした、当時名作と言われただけはあると思います。\nしかし当然目新しいわけではないので今の時代の人がやると「どこが名作？」となってしまうかもしれません。\nランボースタイルで無双するようなゲームではなく敵に囲まれたりどこに位置取りをすれば一度に複数の敵を相手にせずに済むかを考えながら、あるいは死にながら進んでいくゲームです。このゲームの面白さはそこにあると感じました。\n\n自分は難易度は普通でやりましたが難しく感じました、昔の海外のゲームは難易度ノーマルやミディアムでもなかなか手ごたえのある難しさだという話を聞いたことがありますがこのゲームもそれに洩れずといった感じです。\n\nゲームを始めた時に最初に戸惑う点としては床が凍っているのか？といわんばかりにツルツル滑るような感触があることです。初代カウンターストライクをやったことがある人ならその感覚に経験があると思います。現在のFPSならシフトを押しながら移動ですがこのゲームの場合シフトを押さないとそれが走るになります。\n走っている人間は急には止まれないということでしょうかね。\nこのゲームは足場が狭い所にジャンプする場面が結構あるので着地した後に慣性の法則のごとく スーー・・・っとキャラが動いてしまうのでそれでよく落下しダメージをくらったり落下死したりしました狭い足場に連続で飛ばないといけない場所では一か所ジャンプ＆着地が成功するごとにセーブしていたほどで、敵に殺されるより落下死でのゲームオーバーのほうが多かったです。難易度普通なのになかなかの敵の手強さと落下死で一周するのに200回近くゲームオーバーになりました。\n\nこのゲームは先に進むためのルートが分かりにくく迷子になって同じところをグルグル回ったりします。方向音痴の人は気をつけましょう。正規ルートは狭い場所を入っていかなければいけなかったりするので普通の通路のように分かりやすいものでは無い場合もあります。今時のゲームのようにマップがあるわけではありません。次にどこに行けばいいのかすら分かりません。\n\nオートマチックのハンドガンとグレネードランチャ付きのM4カービン銃の弾薬が共有になっています。\nM4の弾が尽きたからハンドガンで戦おう？残念、ハンドガンの弾も0だ。\n9ｍｍの弾薬と5.56ｍｍの弾薬がどうして共有なんですかね・・・。\nどうやら他の方のプレイ動画を見るとM4ではなくMP5の時代があったっぽいのでそれで同じ9ｍｍ弾薬という設定を引きずっているのかも・・・。科学者が作ったレーザー兵器のような武器が二種類ありますがその武器の弾薬も共有になっています。\n\n自分が遭遇したバグを二つほど紹介しておきます。steamを通じて最新版にアップデートした状態のものです。(win7)\n1.このゲームは木箱をEを押しながら引っ張ったりして移動させることができますがなぜか真後ろに引っ張っているのに勢いよく横方向に木箱が吹っ飛んでいきます、これは自分の環境では100％起きる現象でした、どういう物理法則だ・・・\n2.乗っているエレベーターが到着するとその瞬間にスタックします、しゃがむこともジャンプすることもできずにロードするしか無くなります、たまにマップを読み込むタイミングでもスタックしますがエレベーターの方が結構な頻度でありました。自分はエレベーターを乗る前はかならずセーブしていました\n\n\nゲーム内容のレビューのつもりが「これからこのゲームを始める後輩たちへ ｂｙ先輩より」みたいな内容になってしまいました。そのついでにいくつかアドバイスを\n1.セーブはこまめにしましょう。オートセーブもこまめにやってくれますが自分でもやりましょう、スタックしたりゲームオーバーになった場所までの距離短縮になります\n2.ジャンプでは届かない場所も一瞬しゃがんでジャンプすると届いたりします\n3.木箱はこまめにバールで破壊しましょう、中からアイテムが出てます\n4.敵に気付かれたくない場合は歩いたりしゃがみながら移動しましょう。クロスボウなら銃声もなく他の敵にばれずに倒せます。クロスボウに限りませんが敵の頭を狙いましょう\n5.警備員や科学者にEキーで声をかけると一緒についてきて戦ってくれたり回復してくれたりします、ロックされている扉の近くにいけば開けてくれる場合もあります。もう一度Eキーを押すとその場で待機し、ついてこなくなります。たまに後ろを振り返っても付いてきてくれなかったりもします、こちらの移動スピードが速すぎたのかも\n6.右クリックでそれぞれの武器のセカンダリショットが使用できます、M4だと付属のグレネードランチャーを打てたり、ショットガンだと水平二連式でもないのに二発分同時に発射できたりレーザー兵器だとを溜め打ちできたりします。\n7.昆虫のようなものを発射する武器が手に入ります。最大八発まで連続発射できますがなんといってもこの武器、弾無限です。終盤で弾薬の節約に重宝しました\n\n\n悪いことばかりを書いたように見えますが総評としてはこのゲームは「買い」だと思います。\n古いゲームですがグラフィック関係なしに面白かったですね。\n上記にも書いたとおりちょっと不親切じゃないの？という場面や仕様もありますが幾分古いゲームなのでそこはご愛嬌\nゴリ押しが厳しい場面が多々あるので、武器を使い分けたりしながらその場面場面を攻略していくのが楽しいです。\n突破が難しいような場所の周辺には「これを使え！」と言わんばかりに兵器、弾薬が置いてあったりしてくれています。\n動く足場に飛び移るタイミングがシビアな場面もクリアしてしまえば達成感があるものです。（足場が滑るので余計にね）\nなによりこのゲーム安い時は90％OFFとかで手に入るので財布にもやさしいです。\n\n日本語化もファイルの上書きで済むので簡単です。\n昔の名作FPSってどんな感じ？と気になっている人はセールの時に買ってみると良いと思います。","timestamp_created":1584294245,"timestamp_updated":1584294245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65100397","author":{"steamid":"76561198973527203","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":902,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":807,"last_played":1658617792},"language":"brazilian","review":"esse
