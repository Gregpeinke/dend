Given the task however I can tell you\nthat it is the brilliant coadunation between nazi zombies, and Left4dead.\nThat however, is the briefest of summaries that one could hope to give on \nsuch a fine specimine as this.\nThe main strengths of this sanguinary experience is the multitude of options\nin the form of weapons, classes, enemies, and maps. Each when combined with 6 players all striving for the same goal of unconditional dispatching of the so called\nPatriarch, who leads your opposition with an iron fist along with the gentle caress of fatherly love.\nSo what can be derived from this is that the co-op gameplay is amazingly balanced, allowing you to tackle easier challenges with others, but as you gain experience by leveling your class and through actual playtime you'll soon be able to solo easier maps on lesser difficulties. \nThis feeling of accomplishment can be compared to the feeling of getting an A on that difficult test. You can actually get better, and are rewarded for it. The game does require quite a bit of time investment if you want to max out all the classes, and this could be a turn off for those with significant others (buy them a copy), you'll still find delectation from the game while at a lower level. So what do you do when playing in killing floor? Simply put you try to survive waves of enemies alongside teamates, on a selection of different maps. \nIn between waves you're given one minute to run to a shop which is randomly chosen from those available on the map. From here you and your collaborators will restock on ammo, armor, and buy new Armaments.\nYou must persevere through 10 waves of ever increasing difficulty, (this also scales buy the number of players in the game). After the tenth, wave the previously mentioned father figure will make his appearance and threaten you for dangering his children. Unlike other games with shitty bosses, this one will unleash torrents of minigun fire and missles onto your location. In addition to his armaments he's equiped with a cloaking device which will allow him to literally scamper up to one of your comrades before giving him the ol' one two. And if it didn't sound hard enough yet, he also heals himself once he's taken sufficient damage, meaning that if you wish to annihilate him quickly it will require a chase after him before he's able to inject himself with some sort of hypo.\nAfter you achieve victory your team will them do an epic freeze frame shot as your camera moves into third person. From here you can appreciate how much money everyone has, because everyone will be throwing it on the floor at this stage.\nBasically If you want to enjoy some of the best co-op shooter gameplay ever, it's right here. So hurry up and buy it already!","timestamp_created":1369232185,"timestamp_updated":1393038429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5096363","author":{"steamid":"76561198045000666","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":521,"last_played":1643740231},"language":"english","review":"KF rules!","timestamp_created":1369165761,"timestamp_updated":1369165761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3433080","author":{"steamid":"76561198022636177","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":79711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52264,"last_played":1572643380},"language":"french","review":"\n","timestamp_created":1369156718,"timestamp_updated":1369156718,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500998020172119141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2814805","author":{"steamid":"76561198013024197","num_games_owned":444,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":37857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22044,"last_played":1576545293},"language":"english","review":"All the dosh you can handle.

A game that took a simple concept and made it truly enjoyable. The leveling process was fun, surviving with random people online was fun, and I even enjoyed the learning curve when playing harder difficulties. This game has some neat tricks you can learn when it comes to handling different situations, like knowing what causes a fleshpound or scrake to enrage, or how to handle the patriarch. There's a map editor that allows you to create custom maps as well which I instantly fell in love with because it's the same one Unreal Tournament used which I was already familiar with. Some of the maps that the devs designed were truly atmospheric and made each level feel unique.\n\nSome cons - getting from level 5 to 6 can feel a bit grindy, perhaps. The game is old now, and if you're looking for newer graphics they aren't here. The game is simplistic - if you're looking for something more than tactical zed killing it's also not here.","timestamp_created":1368567901,"timestamp_updated":1558508030,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7006258","author":{"steamid":"76561198082370685","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2303,"last_played":1585389740},"language":"english","review":"A pretty creative and fun game, and after you get bored with the original game go get some mods. Steam workshop offers up loads of mods for this game which are easy to install and use, some even online. The game itself is just waves of different types of mutants with a boss at the end, which sunds boring but is enjoyable. The game comes preloaded with tons of maps as well as difficulty settings, and mods buit in as well as slow motion at times[headshots trigger it] and a trader with tons of different guns wich are categorized by their class. Yes their is different classes or skills I should say. Each class has diferent advanteges such as more damage for shoguns, or a lower price on fire weapons. As you get experience you will level the class that you are using at the time up, usually when using the weapons specified for that class. That is all my short summary/recommendation gives to you. I would rate this game 3/5 mostly because it is just a game with waves.

История началась с корпорации Horzine Biotech, которая получила от государства заказ на создание идеальных солдат. Учёные долгое время пытались улучшить показатели обычного человека, но лишь одному удалось добиться успеха. Учёный по имени Кевин Кламели сделал прорыв в области восстановления, научился клонировать людей и управлять их волей. По случайному стечению событий учёный теряет своего сына, но отказываясь принять судьбу, клонирует его. В семье возникает проблема, и жена разводится с Кевином, в ответ на это он создаёт её клона, а настоящую жену убивает. Учёный продолжает трудиться над своими достижениями и создаёт целую армию мёртвых клонов, которые управляются только мыслями безумного гения. С такими возможностями он решает захватить целую страну и начинается всё с Великобритании.

Along with it's satirical stab at our cousin's across the sea(UK), and some of the most fun I've had in an online community. Killing Floor lands near the top of my most played games. Even after KF's long past release it's still aquiring new members and expanding its community daily. I would highly recommend this video game to anyone who enjoys killing zombies or enjoys a good tactical shooter. My favorite ploy that this entire game has to offer is its specific classes and each role they play in your squad of exiles. Not to mention this game has the best Sound/Feel/Look to placing a bullet into the skull of your target. \n\nWarning.... the game will chew you up and spit you out if you don't play correctly. Running and gunning will turn you into lunch 90% of the time.","timestamp_created":1367358916,"timestamp_updated":1367358916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519774019718170166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1832168","author":{"steamid":"76561197998576081","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":8196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7849,"last_played":1545277797},"language":"english","review":"its goood","timestamp_created":1367348673,"timestamp_updated":1367348673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5022548","author":{"steamid":"76561198044276889","num_games_owned":292,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":3924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2888,"last_played":1552175924},"language":"english","review":"Классно :3","timestamp_created":1367346831,"timestamp_updated":1367346831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6163279","author":{"steamid":"76561198060354612","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1504,"last_played":1366527600},"language":"english","review":"If you don't already own it.
