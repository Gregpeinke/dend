But Killing Floor isn’t about having a beautiful game but the beautiful killing. The zombies look very creatively made and scary. Designed uniquely and different from one another makes it amazing. And the maps look amazing as well, West London is my favourite and it really displays the aftermath of the outbreak setting well. The developers know how to make something look like it had just experienced a zombie outbreak. And the weapons are very interesting, some look like normal weaponry, and then there are the more creative guns, like the Zed Gun, which was literally developed and designed to kick zombie ass, and it looks like it would too.\n\n+ Gameplay is outstanding. It is because of the gameplay that makes the game so enjoyable with mates. You need to work together to defeat stronger enemies, and sometimes you need to whip out the knife and just run to the hills. And when you run out of ammo, you scream for help. There are so many situations you can get into that make the game so enjoyable, whether or not your teammates help you. The healing mechanism gives you more to look out for, the second you run low, you need to inject yourself and heal. Because it is a wave game, you need to last long. Then there are classes, which diversify each other and players. Medics can heal you with guns and quicker. Then there are commandos, which are better with rifles. Then there are marksmen, which do shittons of damage with these weapons against the head. There is just so many good things about the gameplay.\n\n+ The sound is great, just plain great. Since Killing Floor is set in England, it makes the game slightly funny to a lot of people, especially Americans. As they “talk funny” and you need to share your “dosh”. And the voice acting is just amazing, the things each unique character say is funny, even the robot talks. The shopkeeper always has something weird to say when the store opens or closes.\n\n+ Gamemodes, this is the tricky part as there are two, normal waves of zombies, in which you can customize the amount of rounds and difficulty. There is an objective mode, which is curious, it tells you to do all these objectives while fending off zombies. It is not played frequently, but normal killing floor of killing waves of zombies is very enjoyable. It is not the gamemode of the game that is supposed to be fun; it is the gameplay of the game.\n\n+ Unique, there are games out there about fending off waves of zombies but KF pulls it in a different direction whereas it is humorous and fun. It has a lot of different components, like a shopkeeper and you can share cash. And unique classes that you can level up the more you play it. But you cannot achieve the same level of fun playing alone, this game [b] requires [/b] friends.\n\n[h1][b]Warning:[/b] Deep Overview[/h1]\nThis game. So many memories of me and my friends. Much like Left 4 Dead 2, it is an incredibly fun Co-op game to play with friends, which is easy to abuse as a means to troll and have fun in various ways. \n\nIt has a simple mission, last this many rounds and kill the boss, GGWP. But that is not the point of the game. Much like everything else in life, it is the journey that makes anything notable. The experience along the way, in Killing Floor, when you play with friends, hours and hours. \n\nYou will cry, laugh, rage, joy, sadden, shock, every emotion. The connection made between you and your friends will determine the outcome of your story, whether you will rage against them for not helping you and decide to face the boss alone, or learn to work together to take down a common enemy as you know that you cannot achieve everything alone, everyone needs a little help, you might need to share money, or have a mate be a healer to heal everyone during a round, or work together to have combined firepower to overwhelm the boss. \n\nBecause you will not only learn in the Floor, but in life, not everything can be achieved alone, that is what teammates, friends, and family are for, to be with you until the end. \n\nAlso an amazing British Simulator. 9.5/10 - God's not here, You save the queen.\n\nI strongly recommend this game to those who love to play coop games with a lot of your mates and are looking for a lot of fun and good times.","timestamp_created":1420650519,"timestamp_updated":1420732275,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13880950","author":{"steamid":"76561198131798067","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":14123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9471,"last_played":1534762141},"language":"russian","review":"Clot — Сын Кевина.

Besides having a solid arsenal, there are some fearsome and gruesome enemies to be fought. \n\nKilling Floor takes place in England. Some scientists were toying with human tissue and ended up by mistake making zombie specimens. There are two types of modes in Killing floor : Killing Floor and Objective. Killing Floor mode is a horde defense type game. After every successful round, the player is allowed to upgrade buy more ammo for their arsenal. Every kill will equal more money for disposable income. Every new level becomes more difficult until the final boss appears. In objective mode, there are specific challenges that players need to pass against certain zombies. To win a round, at least one player needs to remain alive to win. \n\nThere are a lot of categories of weapons (or perks) to choose from as well as specific weapons. The categories are melee, pistols, support, commando, sharpshooter, firebug, demolition, field medic, berserker, perk neutral, and non-damaging. Melee weapons range from knives (almost spelt knifs), machetes, fire axes, katanas, chainsaws, claymores, sytches and a dwarves axe. Pistols range from regular 9mm to dual handcannons. Support comes in the form of shotguns, impalers, a \"zed\" thrower and a AA12. Commando weapons include bullpup, AK-47, M4 carbine, tommy gun, MKb and SCAR's. Sharpshooter weapons include lever-action rifle, single piston long musket, compound crossbow, M14 EBR and M99 AMR. Firebug guns include Mac-10, trenchgun, flare revolver and flamethrower. Demolition weapons include L.A.W, grenade launcher, seeker six, M4 203 with grenade attachment, Harpoon Bomber, m79 grenade launcher, orca bomb propeller, pipe bomb and grenade. Field medic weapons include Mp7, Mp5, M7A, Schneidzekk and the blower thrower bile launcher. There is a single berserker weapon which includes a buzzsaw bolt. Neutral perks include a zed eradication device as well as a MKII version and finally, non damaging weapons include medical syringes and a welder. You're probably wondering what the heck is a welder doing in the game? The welder can sort of \"lock\" or weld doors shut in the game. The AI is smart though and will take a different route in a certain door is locked. To un-weld a door, simply press alt+fire. Each perk is selected at the beginning of the round and can level up. \n\nGraphically, the engine is nice and the dismemberment of the hordes is awesome. Sounds are pretty decent and provide for a nice ambience. Some of the screams that come from the infected specimens is quite chilling. \n\nOverall, a pretty good game if you're hardcore into FPS, zombie and horde type genre. I have quite a few friends that do not like the game due to it's type but the mods can keep you coming back for more. \n\n\nRATING :  7.0/10\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]Gameplay[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n\t[td]N/A[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Replay-ability[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Overall [/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]","timestamp_created":1420512096,"timestamp_updated":1470089845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60280376672744751","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13858310","author":{"steamid":"76561198067856740","num_games_owned":538,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1482992210},"language":"english","review":"This game appears to have startup issues.
