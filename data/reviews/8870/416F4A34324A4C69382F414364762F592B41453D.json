在梦之海的彼端，连接着两座城市，和两个人 [/h1]\nBooker, are you afraid of God?\nNo, I'm afraid of you.(97/100)\n\n\n\n\n剧透慎看\n\n\n\n\n\n[h1] 概述 [/h1]\n第九艺术的精华和典范，肯列文在阴冷潮湿的Rapture之后给世界带来了Columbia这座明亮美式哥特的蒸汽朋克天空之城，也带来了游戏史上令人惊艳的女主伊丽莎白（这可真是我见过最强大最智能最迷人的NPC了）“把那女孩带来，债务就一笔勾销”，1912年 缅因州海岸， 一个雷雨交加的日子，一男一女划着小船带着一位名为布克 德维特的私人侦探来到了一座灯塔前，他的任务是找到一个女孩并把她带回纽约，可故事真的就这样简单吗？\n\n[h1]玩法与机制 [/h1]\n作为一款线性叙事的FPS BSI做的很到位了，一手打枪一手撸魔也是Bioshock系列一贯的核心元素，丰富的武器类型搭配八种魔法的组合（喝饮料会技能也太cool了吧，瓶子都好喜欢啊）可以满足各种玩家的打法需求，天钩的加入使得打法变的更加灵活，是个不错的设计.售货机和前两代一样好用.(就是钱不是很充足）在世界观的塑造上，通过NPC的对话 场景 海报 放映机以及祖传录音带（多么复古而有趣的设计，还能补全剧情的来龙去脉）来叙述，敌人的种类繁多，模型也很多，节奏控制的很好\n\n[h1] 剧情 [/h1]\n浅层一点理解的话，这是个美国梦碎的故事.肯老爷子想讲的东西有很多（奈何经费不够）延展开来：历史 文化 宗教 艺术 种族 政治 科学（遇事不决，量子力学嘛） 哲学 [strike]伦理[/strike]平行宇宙 反乌托邦 等等都可以挖掘出许多信息来，有很多长文和视频解析不一 一赘述了，就个人来看，这一切包括海葬的故事都只是卢特斯姐弟的实验罢了，他们早已洞穿了一切并引导了命运的走向（或者说都是注定的），游戏名叫做Infinite，看起来也确实是一场无尽的轮回，直到最后一位布克和伊丽莎白的陨落.(在海葬之后我认为他们都已彻底的在各个宇宙中死亡，把接力棒交给了一代主角Jack,虽然主线结尾彩蛋这一切都没发生，不过这大概只是一个幻想吧）这是一个悲剧，一个不断还债的过程，终结这轮回的办法就是回到原点，不再有康姆斯托克，不再有布克，伊丽莎白们也随之烟消云散.无论是主角还是配角的刻画都有血有肉有故事，各有性格和信念，令人印象深刻\n\n[h1] 哥伦比亚[/h1]\n一座迷人的“天上人间”，融合了蒸汽朋克美学和19世纪末20世纪初建筑风格的天空浮岛城市群，当玩家第一次乘坐火箭在迷惑和惊慌中不断爬升，突然天堂般的哥伦比亚在太阳的光辉下展现在玩家面前，那一刻注定是震撼人心的，宛如梦境，再降落在教堂之中，在 will you circle be unbroken（这首曲子贯穿全程，也很耐听）的歌声中前行，洗礼之后在这新伊甸园仿佛真的重生一般（老康的洗脑效果也达到了）而在这富人区背后的真相是以康姆斯托克为救世主的宗教神权个人崇拜白人至上的极端种族主义城市（爱尔兰裔也白皮怎么也歧视呀，人性呀啧啧啧）贫民窟的人民只能为芬克工业干到死，和地上的索多玛并没什么分别（甚至更甚）军国主义也在老康的规划下生根发芽，整座城市的美术设计和贯穿始终的音乐都优秀的还原了那个浪漫的时代，宏伟的高楼大厦，花园式的装饰，古典的木制结构和家具，大工业生产的工厂，湿冷严酷的贫民窟等等，一出大戏的好舞台呢（指压迫与反抗）\n\n[h1] Elizabeth [/h1]\n她单纯而善良，聪明又机智，梦想着去巴黎游玩（尽管可能从未实现，不过也许在另一个时空她真的能如愿以偿和布克在塞纳河畔徜徉吧)，丰富的知识储备，拥有着强大的裂境能力（外带超强臂力加撬锁，真是缺啥扔啥人形外挂呀)，Columbia的lamb，也许当玩家经过最初阶段的战斗来到了纪念碑岛时会好奇“先知”口中的羔羊，让他们建造如此巨大的监狱来关押并监视的女孩，究竟是怎样的存在，随着BGM进入我们遇到了可爱的她，带着她逃离，看着她在人群中起舞，吃棉花糖时兴奋的样子（如果这一切都停留在军舰湾多好），她和布克的关系是缠绕在一起的，在经历了这一系列后，他们的感情超越了亲友爱情（本质上是父女没错啦）她同情芬克顿的贫民，尽管那可能会害了她（很喜欢那个弹吉他唱歌的小彩蛋，难得的惬意时光呢) 女孩和女人之间有什么不同呢？Blood 卢特斯们精心设计了菲茨罗伊的死亡来让她获得成长，从懵懂无知的少女变成了独立自强的女人.在海葬第一章中我们见到了一位妩媚诱人的“丽兹”，这种变化可是相当的惊人了，她是勇敢而正义的，纵使追到天涯海角也要把最后一个康姆斯托克绳之以法，而第二章把伊丽莎白的对布克的感情展现的更加淋漓尽致，她需要布克，他是她唯一的朋友，以对讲机的幻象陪伴玩家走完这最后的旅程，在被阿特拉斯折磨到崩溃边缘时，布克牵着她的手带她穿过那些门，就如本体她带布克穿过梦之海的灯塔群接近真相般，她用自己的生命完成了最后的救赎，即使形神俱灭，也愿意为了莎莉牺牲自我，为了那一个微小的可能，一曲玫瑰人生为她送葬，永远的沉睡在海底之城.\n\n[h1] Burial At Sea [/h1]\n海葬两部DLC作为连接一代剧情的衔接真是神来之笔，再现了大西洋海底Rapture的繁华及崩溃前夜（和一代的黑暗惊悚氛围相比海葬的Rapture看起来更安心更有安全感，大概是因为有伊丽莎白一直陪伴着玩家吧），交代了最后的结局.1958年12月31日，一位神秘莫测的女郎，一件没有酬劳的案子，一座注定沉沦的城市，希区柯克式的结尾（科恩的放映机真的太艺术了，看不懂看不懂，也许这就是销魂城美学吧，兔子面具倒是很喜欢）\n\n第二章的开头无比梦幻，伴随着老式留声机温柔的La vie en rose（Edith Piaf版），最后的伊丽莎白在塞纳河畔望着远处的巴黎铁塔坐在咖啡馆街角（这场景比初入哥伦比亚都美），然而有些事最好还是留在梦中，再次回到这罪恶的冰冷都市是为了救赎，一切的由来因果都在此交汇，最后的谜团一 一解开（玩具区的月光真是安详而平和）为什么要拿神明和可颂去换死亡和病菌？责任与延续，还有爱，当巨大的城市衰败倒塌，浑身是伤的伊丽莎白用慈爱的目光静静的看着眼前的莎莉慢慢逝去 ，紧接着就是客机坠海的声音.\n\n[h1] 缺点 [/h1]\n对于晕3D的玩家来说，在空轨上的战斗（或者说大部分时间）很不友好，剧情晦涩第一次通关可能还搞不清讲了个什么样的故事，大量重复无法潜入躲过去的战斗，浪费时间的搜刮，存在感极低的支线（就是找密码开箱子），要是如2077般做出一个庞大城市系统一定会很有趣（几乎无法实现）存在一些辱华的游戏内容（不清楚是不是制作组私心）见仁见智. 无法手动存档，游戏设定逻辑有些小Bug,部分场景有点小惊悚.(不知道这个算不算缺点）\n\n[h1] 感悟 [/h1]\n谢谢你能看到这里，这款游戏与我的渊源发生在2013年的暑假，当时对只玩过COD现代战争三部曲的我的震撼极大，原来FPS还能做成这样如此有深度，之后才去玩初代，盗版本体海葬通关过两遍，入正后本体两遍海葬一遍（重温，也是为了刷成就，云端交锋真的不太好打呢）此后我玩过许多单机，都没有BSI这样把文艺和游戏性融合的这样好的作品了，感谢肯列文和Irrational Games工作室，游戏的本质是一种娱乐也是一种逃离，人们身在其中或独自走过或交织联系，留下些感受和情绪或思考，再投入到现代生活中去，好像生化奇兵系列大包史低-80%￥40了吧，比光买无限大包还便宜点呢，买它就完了，三部曲齐全，也不知道什么时候2K BS系列能出新作品，出必买.

of all, if you haven't played the original Bioshock and you are thinking about playing Infinite please consider playing the original first (Bioshock 2 is also very good). The best option is to buy the collection on sale, which includes all three games with all the DLCs (I wouldn’t mind paying full price for these games, they definitely deserve it). Now with all that out of the way here is my review for Bioshock Infinite: \n\nThe game is a first-person shooter, with an interesting but complicated story. I personally didn't understand everything till the end of the game but that’s what made me hooked to the game's plot. I love that your companion (the girl) helps you in and out of combat with some pretty cool mechanics. As the game progresses the bond between the main character and her grows to the point that you start to really care about their relationship. The combat is great! it gives you a lot of freedom and creativity to match your own playstyle, and the world has a vintage vibe to it which I loved. As I said the story sometimes gets complicated, so you might need to do some research after you complete the game, but that doesn't hurt the overall experience. It's worth your time and money trust me. I wrote this review about my first 8-hour gameplay, not including any of the DLCs.\n\nNow that I have played the DLCs I have to say, they are definitely some of the best DLCs that I have played. The ending for me is one of the most touching, sad, and beautiful moments in gaming (especially if you have played the original Bioshock). The Bioshock series is a very good example that games can be more than just games they can be art. For me, this game and the original are a must-play, they showed me the potential that games have to become a more popular and unique way to tell a story than movies, books,

is a solid 4/5 game.  It's another sequel that fails to live up to the legacy of the original, but it's quite a bit better than Bioshock 2.  It's great if you love story-rich games, as well as action ones.  I found that I prefer the silent protagonists of Bioshock 1 and 2 because it helps me feel like I'm the one playing, but your mileage may vary, and I'm sure plenty  of people prefer a protagonist who speaks.\n\nMy only real issue is that there is no manual save.  That may not be a problem for you, but if you're like me and can usually only find 15 minutes at a time to play, you'll find yourself replaying a lot of the same parts because I didn't make it to a checkpoint.  Sometimes when I'd get to a checkpoint, I'd find it pointless to continue because I wasn't sure if I'd lose all my progress again.","timestamp_created":1584482731,"timestamp_updated":1584482731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65231425","author":{"steamid":"76561199003776931","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":793,"last_played":1584657718},"language":"russian","review":"Четко, классно, ставлю лайк","timestamp_created":1584480746,"timestamp_updated":1584480746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65229888","author":{"steamid":"76561198407444517","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1584478474},"language":"russian","review":"бляяяя верните деньги","timestamp_created":1584478578,"timestamp_updated":1584478578,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486996471881866455","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65226453","author":{"steamid":"76561198450722760","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1644268721},"language":"russian","review":"Сначала ты играешь в какой-то простенький и практически бездумный шутан.
