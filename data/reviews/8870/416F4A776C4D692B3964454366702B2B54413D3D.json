As a fan of Bioshock, I am utterly disappointed. \n\nThere was nothing wrong with the art, the graphics, the music - I even loved the voice actors - but there was issue with the gameplay mechanics, plot devices - even the plot itself - that destroyed this game.  The biggest gripe I had was the plot itself - SPOILERS: It inolves alternate realities and time loops and all that jazz - which the creator of this game tried WAY too hard to do that whole cliche and just destroyed the game.  It was similar to when an author finishes a book with \"and he/she woke up, and it was all a dream.\"  It was atrociously done, and at the same time they tried to throw together the same plot devices that occured in the other two Bioshocks; Civil war/rebellion, class strife/racism, and some ultimate twist at the end that tries to make the palyer realize something new about the human nature.  The plot was just so full of holes and cliches and things that made me pause the game and go \"what the fuck?\".  Take the first few minutes of the game where we travel to a lighthouse, where the lighthouse keeper is horrificly murdered with messages in blood scrawled on the wall and there's a chair at the very top.  I sit in the chair and suddenly it becomes a rocket ship.  Not just any rocket ship, but one that lifts me up past the clouds and 'gently' (because fuck physics) lands me in a populous city in the sky.  Yeah, what?  \n\nTo sum up, the plot had potential, and to be perfectly honest they should have scrapped the whole \"time travel paradox\" thing.  Its a tough thing to do by itself, and now you want to throw it in with themes of class struggle, religious fanatacism, civil war, and a man fighting his inner demons?  Good fucking luck.  Sure the game did well for sales, but to this fan of Bioshock they gouged a serious scar on the trilogy.  If they make a Bioshock 4 it had better be damn good to wipe this mess away.  \n\nI did however enjoy the game as a 'game' where I got to run around and shoot people with a pretty lady in a beautiful city in the sky.  I ignored the plot, imagining I was just here to conquer and bang, and it really made the game a lot more interesting.  I'd say its worth the steam sale price, but no more.","timestamp_created":1451438363,"timestamp_updated":1451438363,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20098446","author":{"steamid":"76561198073532438","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1308,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1116,"last_played":1452447599},"language":"german","review":"Also ich finde dieses Spiel so Gut wie meine Uhr die auch so Gut ist! \nhttp://www.christ.de/product/85867946/emporio-armani-herrenchronograph-ar5988/index.html\nEindeutig Schleichwerbung! :O und das beste ist.

Всё настолько интересно запутано, что после прохождения, скорее всего нужно будет обращаться за помощью к гуглу. В игре очень много «НИАЖИДАННЫХ ПОВОРОТОВ». Кроме всего, существует 2 дополнения, которые раскрывают абсолютно весь смысл вселенной «BioShock», и поясняют связь, с предыдущими частями, что бы обьяснить что тут и к чему.

It had so much depth, such character development, such deception, such unpredictability in the story. The combat system was just like the rest of them, adequate yet irrelevant. Because we don't play these games for the combat, we play for the story, for the experience of knowing what the hell happens to Booker DeWitt and Elizabeth. And boy do we find out with a twist.

Данное отличие выходит как некое выделение из предыдущих частей. \nЭто отличие на мой взгляд никак не влияет на всю красоту самой игры,игра по-прежнему затягивает своей уже новой атмосферой. Игра на первый взгляд покажется простоватой,но игра вправду достаточно сложная. Самое классное в игре во-первых атмосфера,которая показано просто замечательно,во-вторых игра очень красочна и сочна. В игре интересные и продуманные персонажи со своей историей прошлого,например главный герой \"Букер Девитт\" в его прошлом много тёмного и неизвестного,много ошибок и упущений,но в течении игры кое-что будет известно. Сам геймплей тоже не заставляет расслябляться,в каждой ситуации необходимо менять тактику боя,менять плазмиды для победы над врагами. Кажется это не та игра в которой можно тупо вылести и идти всех ложить,нет,здесь нужно прятаться за укрытиями и наблюдать за врагами,местами их бывает много и не все из них простые смертные,с некоторыми приходиться попотеть и пытаться не погибнуть с нескольких очередей. В игре и самих заварушках Элизабет пытается активно помочь с малым кол-вом здоровья,с запасом Евы (если сравнивать с RPG,то что-то типа запаса магии) и если почти не остаётся патронов,то Элизабет подкинет,но сравнительно немного. Сам сюжет тоже очень хороший,но как мне показалось немного запутан и сложен для первого представления после прохождения. В течении игры,появляется обильное кол-во оружия,а в автоматах множество видов прокачки к ним и \"Плазмидам\",в игре с одним оружием слишком долго не побегаешь,так как патронов не всегда хватает на одну заварушку,нужно всегда сменять оружие и подбирать граммотно,чтобы было легче проходить. А что ещё касается самой игры,в игре очень классно подобрана музыка,чтобы сама обстановка,так и реализовывала себя,как я уже и сказал,в игре очень интересные персонажи,которые дадут себя запомнить. В игре очень оригинальная концовка,чтобы полностью понять весь сюжет,стоит пройти и Season Pass. Итак подведём итог,игра мне очень понравилась абсолютно всем,несмотря на то что она отличается от предыдущих.Если вы любите затягивающий сюжет,любите получать наслаждение от погружения в игру и если любите напряжные перестрелки вместе с кучей способностей и препядствий,то эта игра должна вам понравиться. Я оцениваю эту игру по десятибальной шкале в 9 из 10,почему не полная оценка,если игра так понравилась? Отвечаю,потому что,чтобы понять весь сюжет и ещё поиграть в эту замечательную игру пришлось купить недешёвый Season Pass,он подарит ещё несколько часов на прохождение,но я не пожалел о покупке того и другого. Короче говоря,пройти должен каждый =))","timestamp_created":1451348363,"timestamp_updated":1468859923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548260033130645752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20050485","author":{"steamid":"76561198075355006","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1560959296},"language":"english","review":"Played this awhile ago on the PS3 and now played it for free on the Xbox 360 for gold members. It takes place in 1912 America so it’s kinda a prequel to the original BioShock. This guy Booker De Witt, a former private eye is sent to this floating city called Colombia to rescue a girl. When you first get there it’s pretty amazing and peaceful but when you get to the carnival’s lottery it’s pretty shocking.\nThere’s also a choice option but I heard it doesn’t matter when they happen at certain times. Around when you meet the girl, Elizabeth, I stopped playing because I heard this game is long and I kinda lack patience for long. It’s still pretty good as well even the DLC where you go to rapture from what I heard.\nThere’s also these vigors which give you powers like mind control and fire powers. As well as some guns from both the Colombia people and the Vox Populi. Oh also there’s this faction called the Vox Populi that are basically a socialist faction trying to take down Colombia. There’s also this old guy that wants to stop the leader of Colombia, Comstock, but wants to keep Colombia. I think you have the option to decide between the old guy and the Vox Populi but from what I heard the choices still don’t matter, I think.\nAnyway this is a classic from the people who made the BioShock series. You should give it a try when you can and add it to your collection if you can.","timestamp_created":1451346383,"timestamp_updated":1451346383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20050430","author":{"steamid":"76561198043957398","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":625,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":555,"last_played":1519573305},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely amazing game.
