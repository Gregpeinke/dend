Купил по акции, был приятно удивлён. Вопросы к игре есть, но для 2004 года. это, просто отвал башки! \nВся игра - спринтерский забег, мы постояно движемся вперёд, только иногда лишь останавливаясь. Мне подобное не совсем по душе - однообразно, но это корявая придирка. )\nПолно плюсов: физика, графика, искус. интел., локации, повествование, не большие головоломки, оригинальность и многое другое.\nБольше всего понравился второй эпизод (дополнение). Здесь лучше всё скомпоновано. Два новых врага. Интересная и очень красивая локация, где мы проходим в поисках экстракта. Грустный финал.\nНе верилось, что нет окончания сюжета. Думал есть ещё одно дополнение, но... \nСлишком затянули с продолжением, а оно нужно, иначе не было смысла проходить всё это.
