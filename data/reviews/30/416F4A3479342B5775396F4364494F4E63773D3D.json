The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II. The attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. There were simultaneous Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been strong, disappeared. Clandestine support of Britain (e.g., the Neutrality Patrol) was replaced by active alliance. Subsequent operations by the U.S. prompted Germany and Italy to declare war on the U.S. on December 11, which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day.[/b]\n\n9/10\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1497733516,"timestamp_updated":1497733516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32515824","author":{"steamid":"76561198181223525","num_games_owned":441,"num_reviews":131,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1483721627},"language":"tchinese","review":"二                                                                                                                                                                                                     战","timestamp_created":1497728918,"timestamp_updated":1497728918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32410833","author":{"steamid":"76561198067109130","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":72,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":72,"last_played":1346137200},"language":"spanish","review":"Juego de culto.

Но их достаточно для того, что бы игра стала непохожей на CS. Сама игра очень качественная : ходить по локациям, захватывать точки или расстреливать противников, например, из снайперского ружья - одно удовольствие. Но несмотря на всё это - игра не получила должной популярности, онлайн сейчас очень мал и постепенно уменьшается.
