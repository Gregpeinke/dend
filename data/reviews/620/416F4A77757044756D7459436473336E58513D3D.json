It makes you feel terrible, like the first one did, and gives you a glance of how disturbed AI might think. \n\nThe dark humor offers a critique of capitalism and techno-scientific domination. Since the game puzzles envolve physics, gravity and out of the box thinking, it is perfect for learning. The editor tools makes it possible to explore level design as a educational experience. The multiplayer mode gives you a whole new kind of cooperative experience.\n\nWhile some may find Portal 1 to be better, others may consider it as a prototype for what Portal 2 is: a first-person with a memorable story, setting and characters that is only comparable to Bioshock.\n\nIn conclusion: One of the greatest games in videogame history.","timestamp_created":1470101557,"timestamp_updated":1470101557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24661255","author":{"steamid":"76561198139588314","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2486,"last_played":1531344510},"language":"turkish","review":"Bu oyunu gerçekten taktir ettim.

As someone who has rarely played anything that isn't an MMORPG or Minecraft, it was overwhelmingly awesome. I'd never come across a game that managed to combine an amazing story arc, awesome graphics, first-person shooter mechanics, AND puzzle levels successfully. Not to mention the totally epic boss battle.\nUsually I don't expect too much from sequels, but, based on the awesomeness of the first game and the good things I'd heard about the second one, I had some relatively high expectations of Portal 2. Let me just say that any preconceptions I'd had were blown away.\nMaybe I'm not the hardest person to please where games are concerned, but, for all intents and purposes, Portal 2 is the bomb. \nAlthough it had far less cake than the first Portal, the humor was just as good, if not better. I loved the way the tutorial blended perfectly into the storyline of the game without seeming completely invisible. The graphics (which I thought were good in the first Portal) were some of the best I've ever seen. The atmosphere was incredible, even though it changed rapidly; this game has so many moods and settings, from the verdant, overgrown beginning, to the empty, haunted ruins of the old Aperture facility, and finally to the smooth but jilted, futuristic-but-half-destroyed world of Wheatley Laboratories. (Was that a spoiler? Sorry!) The voice acting was perfect; it's a challenge to make two robots convey emotion with limited or no facial expressions, but somehow, Valve's writers did it.\nThe gameplay was great. Although the tests all consisted of the same mechanics and elements, they were all so different that they didn't seem repetitive at all. Ingame, it ran very smoothly, although it crashed a couple of times when I tried to minimize it. \nAnd then... the story. Ooooh, boy. \nWhat I considered the first Portal's story was more a combination of rich history and a great climax (if you don't count the unseen Doug Rattmann's portion of the plot). This one, though, somehow managed to convey an amazingly rich story with only five characters (Chell, GLaDOS, Wheatley, Cave Johnson, and Caroline - does she even count as a separate character??), one of whom never even speaks. This game has so much heart and feeling, despite the austere, sterile environment.\nThe boss battle was just as good as the one in the first Portal, if even better. The new mechanics made it a hundred times better than it would have been otherwise. The ending to the first Portal game was poignant, if predictable, but the end of Portal 2 was unexpected, ingenious, and a huge tearjerker. (Hint: Stick around to the end of the credits. Not only is the song hilarious, but the post-credits scene makes the whole ending a thousand times better - or is that worse?)\nSo, bottom line. Would I recommend this game to a friend?\nHeck, yes. I already have. She bought it, and we've spent hours playing the equally amazing co-op mode together.\nIf you've never played a Valve game, if you've never played a Portal game, if you've heard of it but never gotten around to buying it, if you've played the first Portal game, if you've seen a friend play both games, if you've watched playthroughs of Portal 2 and know everything about it... basically, if you like video games, buy this game. I swear, you won't regret it.\n\nDo I want a Portal 3?\n...I don't know. On one hand, another Portal game would never be a bad thing. On the other, this game left off in such a perfect spot... I don't know if I want it to be ruined.","timestamp_created":1469994136,"timestamp_updated":1469994988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24637883","author":{"steamid":"76561198175930890","num_games_owned":297,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":561,"last_played":1617833522},"language":"brazilian","review":"mt lgl e dificil principalmente o multiplayer","timestamp_created":1469986502,"timestamp_updated":1469986502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24637584","author":{"steamid":"76561198057812907","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1699,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1179,"last_played":1619926152},"language":"turkish","review":"Hayatimda oynadigim en guzel oyunlardan biri.

Portal 2 feels fantastic with a great improvement on graphics gameplay and somehow even better dialog. the characters feel lively and the new mechanics don't feel forced and fit right in with the last games feel. blending new and old perfectly with great multiplayer chaos and a co-op mode that has you coming back. community support that adds more and more to play and when the story ends your challenge truly begins with all that content to explore from the community. I Highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles and especially any fan of the first game. Portal 2 is an easy 10/10 and now i just want portal 3.\n","timestamp_created":1469945072,"timestamp_updated":1469945072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523615658283233643","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24627777","author":{"steamid":"76561198196730498","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":526,"last_played":1575250671},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom, porem com SERIOS problemas de leganda, as vezes fica inglês e até mesmo nem aparece :|","timestamp_created":1469942051,"timestamp_updated":1469942051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24626345","author":{"steamid":"76561198082946388","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":494,"last_played":1518719252},"language":"schinese","review":"为什么我不能一直待在Aperture Science里呢？GLaDOS非送我走，讨厌！","timestamp_created":1469933508,"timestamp_updated":1469933508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24626119","author":{"steamid":"76561198064418546","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":562,"last_played":1605732987},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game.
