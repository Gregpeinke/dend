zu Half-Life 2: Episode Two[/h1]\n\nEndlich verstehe ich warum Fans der Half-Life Reihe seit Jahren einen dritten Teil fordern... Das Ende der Episode Zwei ist nämlich vollkommen offen und zeigt die Schicksale wichtigere Charaktere nicht auf. Es ist unglaublich. Unglaublich enttäuschend. Das Ende kam viel zu abrupt, sodass ich es gar nicht fassen konnte, dass ich vor dem Abspann saß...\nBis auf das Ende war Episode Zwei deutlich besser als Episode Eins und teilweise sogar etwas besser als das Hauptspiel, weil weitere Ideen dazukamen und das Gameplay sichtlich verbessert wurde. Zwar gibt es jetzt wieder Fahrzeugabschnitte, doch machen diese, im Gegensatz zum Hauptspiel, sehr viel Spaß! (Außer natürlich man versucht sich, wie ich, am Gartenzwerg-Achievement, aber das ist ein anderes Thema)\nHalf-Life 2: Episode Two erweitert die Hintergrundwelt von Half-Life und führt neue Charaktere und Orte ein, die interessanter nicht sein könnten. Besonders gefallen hat mir, dass Dr. Magnussen am Anfang recht arrogant wirkte und später immer sympathischer wurde, wenn auch nur geringfügig.\nNeue Gegner gibt es auch, die sog. Jäger, die recht anspruchsvoll sind.\nAlles in Allem jagt die zweite Episode den Spieler von einer aufregenden Situation zur anderen und macht dabei immens viel Laune. Bis auf das Ende.\n\nKommen wir für die Schnellen unter uns einfach mal zur Pro-Contra-Liste:\n\n[u][b]Pro:[/b][/u]\n\n+ Das Hauptmenü verändert sich bei fast jedem Kapitel und zeigt eine gewisse Szenerie, auch wenn die letzten 3 Kapitel immer das gleiche Bild gezeigt haben\n+ Die Objekt basierten Rätsel, bei denen man seine Umgebung genau im Blick haben muss, haben mir sehr gefallen!\n+ Im Gegensatz zu Left4Dead 2, oder Portal 2 kann man in Half-Life 2 sogar sprinten!\n+ Untertitel haben unterschiedliche Farben für unterschiedliche Charaktere, zumindest, wenn innerhalb einer Diskussion mehrere Personen teilnehmen\n+ Menschliche Animationen, wie Gesichtsanimationen sehen ziemlich gut aus. Allerdings weiß ich nicht, wann, oder ob die von Valve mal überarbeitet worden sind. Wenn die allerdings schon im Jahre 2007 so aussahen, dann... meine Güte, welche meisterhafte Arbeit!\n+ Man kann mit überraschend vielen Dingen interagieren (auch wenn ich es stellenweise schwierig fand, zu erkennen mit was überhaupt)\n+ Zerstörbare Objekte\n+ Eine recht interessante und fesselnde Geschichte!\n+ Großartige Charaktere!\n+ Abwechslungsreiche Orte, die immer wieder etwas anderes verlangen können\n+ Man erhält im Verlauf des Spiels enorm viele Waffen, die sich auch grundlegend unterscheiden. Man hat da so seinen Standardkram und auch ausgefalleneres Zeug\n+ Einige Gegner waren recht interessant. Vor allem herauszufinden welche Waffen bei welchem Gegner am effektivsten ist\n+ Alyx ist für längere Zeit eine hilfreiche Begleiterin\n+ Zwar gab es Fahrzeugabschnitte, die mich im Hauptspiel nicht sonderlich begeistern konnten, hier machen sie jedoch immens viel Spaß!\n+ Die Energie der Taschenlampe ist nun separat zur Hilfsenergie, beim Sprinten, oder Schwimmen. Das heißt im Klartext, dass man nun unter Wasser länger schwimmen und die Taschenlampe gleichzeitig verwenden kann\n\n[u][b]Contra:[/b][/u]\n\n- Auch wenn das Spiel auf Deutsch vertont ist, so sind einige Synchronsprecher wirklich schlecht. Zumindest in einigen Wörtern, oder Satzteilen. Der Synchronsprecher vom G-Man ist das grausigste, was ich bisher gehört habe, die Sprecherin von Alyx nuschelt besonders und vor allem die Aussprache von Wörtern wie \"Dad\" oder \"Gordon\" haben mich bei der Sprecherin von Alyx extrem gestört. \"Dad\" wird von ihr \"Dat\" ausgesprochen und statt \"Gordan\" zu [u]sagen[/u] sagt sie tatsächlich \"Gord[u]o[/u]n\". Weshalb ich das Spiel das nächste Mal auf Englisch spielen werde\n- Das Spiel hat keine einheitliche Soundpalette. Geräusche der Lebens- und Schildstationen sind ohrenbetäubend laut, Musik ist viel zu leise und Schussgeräusche wieder zu laut. Auch die Optionen sind nicht umfangreich genug dieses Problem konsequent zu lösen\n- Kurze, unterbrechende Ladesequenzen, die ohne jegliche Vorwarnung auftauchen und so den Spielfluss dezent stören. Allerdings sind diese, wenn man ein geübtes Auge dafür entwickelt, schneller zu bemerken als noch im Vorgänger\n- Befreundete NPCs können nicht mehr getötet werden, um deren Munition zu klauen. Das ging im Vorgänger nämlich. Ich fand es schade, dass das in Half Life 2 (und in der Episode One) nicht mehr funktioniert\n- Es gibt keine Schnelltaste für Granaten, wie noch im ersten Teil\n- Untertitel sind oftmals fehlerhaft\n- Offenes, unbefriedigendes Ende. ICH WILL EINEN DRITTEN TEIL VERDAMMT!\n\n[u][b]Prontra:[/b][/u]\n\n+- Die gewählte Musik ist zwar gut für die jeweilige Situation, aber kein Soundtrack, den ich abseits vom Spiel hören wollen würde\n+- Das Aufladen von Leben und Schild an den Stationen dauert recht lange. Ich vermute, dass man vermeiden wollte, dass man die Gegner dorthin lockt und sie von dort aus bekämpfen kann und sich währenddessen immer wieder Leben zieht, aber dergleichen habe ich nie ausgenutzt, weshalb ein Aufenthalt dort immer recht lange gedauert hatte\n+- Ich fand es teilweise recht umständlich von Leitern herunter zu steigen, wenn man an ihr zuvor nach oben geklettert ist, bis ich dann bemerkt habe, dass man sie mittels \"E\" betreten und wieder verlassen kann. Davor habe ich immer versucht von ihr herunter zu springen, was schlecht funktionierte\n\nHalf-Life 2: Episode Two darf man sich als Half-Life-Fan natürlich nicht entgehen lassen. Das Spiel hätte aber noch viel länger sein können. Das letzte Kapitel hat nicht mal 5 Minuten gedauert, wodurch ich schon sehr enttäuscht wurde.\n\nIch danke fürs Lesen und wünsche sehr viel Spaß beim Spielen! ;-)\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/420/HalfLife_2_Episode_Two/","timestamp_created":1588064337,"timestamp_updated":1588064337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55737537145614624","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68164924","author":{"steamid":"76561198355429650","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":454,"last_played":1589551307},"language":"english","review":"a game that runs 60 fps on mac","timestamp_created":1588062249,"timestamp_updated":1588062249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68158915","author":{"steamid":"76561199007417538","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":436,"last_played":1588052017},"language":"spanish","review":"Espera que algun momento jugare Alyx","timestamp_created":1588052135,"timestamp_updated":1588052135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68140873","author":{"steamid":"76561198821714702","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":298,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":298,"last_played":1587996056},"language":"english","review":"Right off the bat, I absolutely recommend this part of the HL series, but I definitely have some issues with it nonetheless.\nSome parts feel really odd and sometimes just plain frustrating, since the game throws countless bullet sponge enemies at you at a point in the game, which kinda ruined the fun for me. This section was also unnecesarily long in my opinion, as it got quite repetitive very quickly. But that out of the way let's talk positives!\nThis is by far the most entertaining part in the HL series in terms of story, as it appears to be much superior in writing and overall really makes the entire game an enjoyable expirience! This is the part where I got really attached to the characters, as they expirience possibly the most characterisation in the entire franchise, which is simply outstanding. The game, whilst quite action-packed, has some really emotional moments which can really just stir you up and get incredibly invested in the story.\nFinally, Episode 2, whilst not completing the HL2 storyline rounds it off quite well, but there is definitely a LOT of unused potential which may hopefully manifest in a third game in the maybe not-so-close future.\nSo what are you waiting for?

Cet épisode est donc, comme le précédent, indispensable pour tout fan de la saga.\nInaugurant pour l'époque une nouvelle version du moteur Source, ce second épisode bénéficie entre autres de nouveaux effets d'ombres et de lumière. Quelques années plus tard elle sera aussi utilisée avec l'épisode précédent.\nSeule véritable ombre au tableau : la saga attend sa conclusion depuis des années, cet épisode ne lui en apportant pas. Mais cela n'enlève rien aux qualités du jeu et de ses deux épisodes qui restent toujours aussi plaisants et divertissants à jouer encore aujourd'hui.\nComparé à l’épisode précédent, le niveau de difficulté se montre ici nettement plus élevé, notamment avec l’apparition de nouveaux ennemis : les hunters, rapides, résistants et puissants, parfois combinés à d’autres ennemis déjà compliqués à gérer tels que les striders.\nLa partie exploration est encore une fois à la hauteur et offre toujours autant de plaisir avec des cadres tels qu’une exploitation minière, des cavernes souterraines, les montagnes, une gare de triage ou un garage aux mains du cartel.\nLa dernière partie de l’épisode réserve pour moi les combats les plus difficiles et punitifs que la saga ait réservé, rendant le challenge particulièrement élevé, rageant et frustrant. Pour ceux qui comme moi ont une bonne expérience des FPS mais ne sont pas des joueurs avec d’excellents réflexes, il est dommage de devoir autant peiner pour terminer cet épisode.","timestamp_created":1587778671,"timestamp_updated":1605971551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67959193","author":{"steamid":"76561198158634155","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":523,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":523,"last_played":1587766990},"language":"brazilian","review":"SIM, CARALHO, VÁ JOGAR ESTA PORRA, DESGRAÇADO!!!","timestamp_created":1587767023,"timestamp_updated":1587767023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67954016","author":{"steamid":"76561198078360186","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1091,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":854,"last_played":1636907532},"language":"russian","review":"Культовая игра от Valve.
