[/url] [/h1]\n\nNot sure why I'm even reviewing this, because I'm pretty sure almost everybody knows about this game, but here we go anyways. Portal 2 is a steadily paced story-driven first-person 3D puzzle platformer in which you navigate through a massive facility with mechanical parts and machines galore. The factory is owned by what the player can assume is a robotics conglomerate called Aperture Science Laboratories. It takes place in the same world as Half-Life and can even be considered a continuation of not only Portal, but the Half-Life saga as well. \n\nYou play as Chell, a silent female protagonist and are guided by two robots. The first robot you meet is named Wheatley and the premise of the story at that time is to escape and enter the real world. When that plan fails, you are reintroduced to GLaDOS, (which is an acronym for Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) who you initially destroyed in the first Portal. Wheatley makes multiple attempts to contact you while you go through GLaDOS' tests, and once two bodies are switched the story takes a more sinister turn that I won't be describing so I don't spoil it for you. \n\nThe story is pretty much all dialogue narrated by whatever robot you're with, or prerecorded human voices if you find yourself alone. The game is heavily focused on solving \"tests\" or puzzles, and not too much platforming is involved in my opinion. Luckily, the tests never feel tedious or too difficult to solve, although they can be a little confusing. You can expect to see enemies that take part in some of these tests (like turrets) or if not that you'll encounter lasers. You can die during these tests, so be careful. \n\nThere is a cooperative mode to play with friends, but I haven't tried that yet, so I won't be mentioning it elsewhere. Overall this is a nice little game with an intriguing (and sometimes comedic) story that everybody seems to enjoy. It's well worth the price, and if you like games that make you use your head, you'll enjoy Portal 2. Edit: Just finished the game and the ending is really cool. Should take about 7-9 hours to complete.","timestamp_created":1603262116,"timestamp_updated":1616549395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77906397","author":{"steamid":"76561198271873866","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":6625,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6045,"last_played":1645896950},"language":"english","review":"I cannot believe I have played this game for 100 hours+. Portal community is one of the best when it comes to creativity. All the solo and coop maps are absolute head-scratcher and I can spend hours with my friend trying to complete one by one whether it is Digital Realm or The Order of Things. Your brain goes 10000% when you complete even 1 room of their chambers. P.s. Atlas and Peabody are great.\nThe campaign mode is also really fun and a good sequel for portal. It is a long tutorial for the community test chambers. The puzzle rooms from the devs are huge and feels trap at the same time. All in all a great masterpiece from Valve.","timestamp_created":1603261824,"timestamp_updated":1603330282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77906210","author":{"steamid":"76561198268398729","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":2492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2156,"last_played":1628528748},"language":"spanish","review":",mmahbgadf","timestamp_created":1603261359,"timestamp_updated":1603261359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77905875","author":{"steamid":"76561199055994271","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":976,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":512,"last_played":1641949561},"language":"russian","review":"отличная
