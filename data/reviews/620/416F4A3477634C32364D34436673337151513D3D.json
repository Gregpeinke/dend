Es war im sale auf 10 euro runtergesetzt und dann habe ich durch das herstellen eines abzeichens einen 90% Gutschein für Portal 2 bekommen. Somit habe ich mir das Spiel für einen Euro geholt. Ich fand die Story in dem Spiel eigentlich sehr gut, da es manchmal etwas spannender wurde. Aber die Story ist jetzt auch nicht so wichtig, da ich denke die Levels mit den Portalen der Hauptgrund des Spiels ist. Ich habe ungefähr 20 Stunden für die Kampagne gebraucht und meinen Euro war es so oder so wert. Mit der Kampagne ist das Spiel aber noch lange nicht vorbei, da noch eine koop-kampagne existiert, die man mit Freunden spielen kann UND es im Workshop noch tausende weitere Levels gibt die man lösen kann.Selbst für den vollpreis (20€) würde ich das Spiel empfehlen, und wenn es im sale auf 10€ runtergesetzt ist dann muss man es sich schon fast holen.","timestamp_created":1438044919,"timestamp_updated":1496945656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17258492","author":{"steamid":"76561198082099954","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1662,"last_played":1439882848},"language":"english","review":"!!!!","timestamp_created":1438044531,"timestamp_updated":1438044531,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17258444","author":{"steamid":"76561198125523237","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":587,"last_played":1544562779},"language":"spanish","review":"lo admito, hoy en dia sigo pensando que paso con BLaDOS, a la final la amé, el mejor BOSS de todos los tiempos, hablando de BLaDOS, y pues wheatley es un buen chico XD jajajaja, \nPORTAL 2: OBRA MAESTRA!","timestamp_created":1438044204,"timestamp_updated":1438044204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17258129","author":{"steamid":"76561198132443775","num_games_owned":667,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":1468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":751,"last_played":1590545707},"language":"portuguese","review":"SIMPLESMENTE PORTAL 2 BAUDUCCO","timestamp_created":1438042232,"timestamp_updated":1438042232,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17257742","author":{"steamid":"76561198020968421","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":517,"last_played":1422479058},"language":"english","review":"","timestamp_created":1438040031,"timestamp_updated":1438040031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17257694","author":{"steamid":"76561198051891411","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":457,"last_played":1434186807},"language":"english","review":"I AM NOT A POTATO\n","timestamp_created":1438039807,"timestamp_updated":1438039807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wcL26M4Cfs3qQQ=="}
