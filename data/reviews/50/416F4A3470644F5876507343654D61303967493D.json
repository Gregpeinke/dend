In Half Life, I was exhausted by the time the credits rolled, while I was pleasantly surprised when this game ended. It was good conclusion with a nice difficulty spike at the end to test your knowledge with all of your weapons, and there a lot of them here.\n\nI love that they replaced those bee guys with the tall laser cannon aliens (I'm sorry for butchering these aliens' names, but I don't want to look at the wiki for their names in case of spoilers). These guys felt intimidating, scary, and were a fun challenge every time they showed up. And the weapon they drop is LEAGUES better than the auto-aim bee gun. It shoots faster, sounds better, does not recharge passively, and the projectiles go much faster. And in this game, you get 2 additional alien weapons! That booger launcher was very reliable in rough spots, and that barnacle alien was very fun to mess around with (I even found a few skips due to it). But on top of having these and most of Half Life's weapons, Opposing Forces gives more powerful guns to play with, my favorite being the sniper and dislocator.\n\nBut Opposing Forces does heavily rely on the world Half Life set up so perfectly. It was a great expansion on that world, but it didn't put me in awe like Half Life did. Could be that I'm just getting used to it by now since I'm playing these Half Life games in rapid succession.\n\nThe story is pretty good too. It picks up when Freeman reaches the surface, which makes sense because you are playing as a soldier. It makes logical sense that you arrive at this point since the army would be calling in a lot of reinforcements due to the alien (and Freeman's) assault. And instead of trying to fix the problem like in Half Life, you are trying your best to just survive here. All in all, I appreciate what this game brings to the table without stepping on the toes of Half Life.\n\nAlso I see some Borderlands DNA here, but I won't spoil it. I like seeing these connections in games that share developers, and if you didn't know, this game was made in part by Gearbox. If you've played Borderlands before, you'll know when you get to it.\n\n8/10 great continuation of the Half Life franchise. Has lower highs and higher lows than it's progenitor, which to me means makes it a generally better, if only by a little bit; even though I think I'd rather replay the original Half Life over this, Opposing Forces is still a solid game.","timestamp_created":1630731972,"timestamp_updated":1653894259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98732869","author":{"steamid":"76561198009405342","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":122,"playtime_forever":117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":117,"last_played":1575238405},"language":"english","review":"This game has not aged well.

Sí, es obvio que aquí no cuentas con una pistola de gluones por ejemplo, sin embargo tiene un arsenal algo más extenso y con objetos que en una opinión personal hubiera sido genial tenerlo en el juego original, entre ellos obviamente están algunas armas del juego base, y con ellos los Barnacles que nos sirve para llegar a sitios inaccesibles, la Desert Eagle que es una pistola mucho más poderosa que la Glock e incluso el cañón Teletransportador que, como su nombre lo indica, nos permite teletransportarnos, aparte de matar a los enemigos de forma muy rápida y llevándonos a sitios particulares del juego. En cuanto a la historia, en mi opinión me pareció algo interesante por el hecho de que estamos jugando Half-Life pero desde otro ángulo o personaje: los acontecimientos no pasan al mismo tiempo que en el juego original sino unos capítulos más adelante. Eso sí, el final deja un sabor agridulce, ya que cuando acabas el juego, deja mucha intriga por el paradero de nuestro personaje, dejándonos en la incógnita. En cuanto a los enemigos pues son muy distintos a los de Half-Life, hay unos tipos llamados alienigenas de la raza \"X\" que llegan a tener algunas habilidades interesantes a primera vista (al menos para mí). Como el juego original, este juego cuenta con unos servidores casi vacíos, por lo que jugar en línea con gente random no es lo mejor que puedes hacer aquí.\nEn resumen: Si deseas probar algo nuevo a lo que viste en Half-Life, recomiendo bastante probar esta expansión.

My main gripes with it are the weapon selection doesn't feel as fleshed-out and balanced as the original Half-Life, some of the chapters in the midgame just feel like aimless filler and the last few chapters felt incredibly rushed. Other than that, it's authentic Half-Life but with some new stuff added in.\n\nI like a lot of the weapons they added, my favourite being the Desert Eagle, which combines the raw power of the Revolver with the speed & consistency of the normal Pistol. The SAW (the machine gun) is a fun toy to play with when you do get the chance, since ammo is sparse and it chews through that stuff. The sniper rifle is basically just the crossbow but hitscan. \n\nThe shockroach gun (or whatever it's called) is a better weapon than the hivehand (the weapon it replaces), but it doesn't have the shooting around corners niche, instead it's just an all-rounder (sorta like what the SMG and shotgun are for except  it doesn't require ammo). I'm not sure what the point of the spore launcher is. It's cute, i'll give them that, but you already have tons of explosives at that point. It's just sorta there.\n\nYou get to see so much more of Black Mesa, and so many things that raise questions (like stuff that was brought up back in Questionable Ethics), it's neat and I love it.\n\nThe introduced expanded enemies (\"Race X\" yeah really tried on the name there guys) are nice, but some of them are a pain in the ass to deal with. There's a part of the game where they just spam these giant walker-looking enemies that shoot energy orbs at you and have SO MUCH FUCKING HEALTH, ALL OF THEM. \n\nAs alluded to earlier, this game seems to be a bit less generous with the ammo pickups than the original Half-Life (probably to encourage use of the Displacer), but there were parts of the game where I seriously had no ammo for like 50% of my weapons. So, watch out. \n\nOverall, it's good, but some of the things it tried weren't perfect in execution.","timestamp_created":1630217025,"timestamp_updated":1630217025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47999998927116394","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98422012","author":{"steamid":"76561199071688674","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":292,"last_played":1631107189},"language":"russian","review":"там куча экшена и крутых новых пушак","timestamp_created":1630209968,"timestamp_updated":1630209968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98413181","author":{"steamid":"76561199099301808","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":447,"last_played":1629995352},"language":"czech","review":"The story of Adrian Shephard was very interesting.
