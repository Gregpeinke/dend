Interface amigável, sem FRESCURAS pra poder jogar, é só iniciar e jogar!!! Ah, e pra quem acha que o jogo tá morto, alguns servers tem bots desafiadores e sempre uns players perambulando por eles. Já vi mais de 5 players humanos num server. \n\nE pra finalizar, se num jogo vc não vê as horas passarem, é porque ele é realmente DIVERTIDO!

right...where do I start? I think this game might be a bit more familiar to some of you old school shooter fans if I ask this question: have you played QuakeWorld? If so, well, this is basically QuakeWorld on GoldSrc. Not that that's a bad thing inherently, GoldSrc fits a game like Quake quite OK, actually. The problem with DMC is, the movement sucks. It's a lot worse than even something like NetQuake. I'm not sure how to explain it further, but I suppose gameplay videos would help prove my point (or not, it's still quite a bit subjective).\n\nThe maps are mostly just carbon copies of stock Quake DM maps with lambdas, with the exception of dm1 & dm5 for whatever reason. There's this one other map in the default rotation, which is dmc_e1m2 (EDIT 10/1/2019: this may be because the famous Red Annihilation was performed on this map). Once again, a Quake map, but with some deathmatch-appropriate changes like removing traps & monsters.\n\nThe weapons, well, for the most part, they're just retextures. The sounds are like what you'd hear from such weapons in Half-Life (this is most recognizable with shotguns). The crowbar has the same sound as Ranger's axe in Quake, funnily enough, but that doesn't matter, nobody uses that anyway. Not in Quake, & not in DMC. If you know your Quake loadout, simply get used to the weapon models & you'll feel right at home, especially since the weapons are still at the center of your screen (yay!). Besides maybe the thunderbolt, that thing makes your screen shake awkwardly (still does the same thing, though).\n\nThe community...is actually OK! I hosted a server for this game (mainly as a test), got a friend & me into it in the evening (Eastern time) & to my surprise, we managed to get 5 concurrent players! Now, on dmc_dm4 (the DMC version of the infamous Quake map), this would be quite hectic (note: this is an FFA, not TDM). However, on some maps you might find yourself actually...quite in need of more action than you can get with 5 players on that map. Probably the best example of that is dm3, which has historically been a TDM map in the QuakeWorld scene, but is still great fun for FFA if you have like...maybe 8 players? Quite an achivement for a DMC server, but nonetheless common.\n\nThat part was about the community's livelihood, mostly, but how is the community as far as stuff like toxicity / average skill goes? Glad you asked, as this may be...one of the only reasons one may want to play this game. The average skill of the DMC player is \"not an FPS casual but never really played QuakeWorld\", which I find rather inviting compared to the QuakeWorld scene where people have the bhops & the rocket jumps & they have the whole map layouts memorized & all, wew! Sadly that's an inherent flaw of almost any high skill cap game without ranked matchmaking. If this is your first time playing DMC & someone joins the server...well, chances are they're also playing this game for the first time. It's not like in QuakeWorld or AG (a competitive HLDM mod) where you'll likely see some kid who will frag you every single time for 10m straight. It's very much a casual shooter due to the amount of involvement people have with it. Things like Quake have always been very competitive from the start, with people finding practically every single way to exploit the engine to their advantage (not in a derogatory sense, not at all, I respect it) & practically mastering it. It's like a speedrun scene. It's definitely rather intimidating if you're not willing to do the same, I'll be straight up on that. The toxicity of the QuakeWorld community is practically identical to that of the DMC community: very minimal, if even real (I have yet to see any myself). Use of chat can be commonly seen (but not with most players, maybe 1 in 4 players), & it's often actual English & not a \":^)\" bind.\n\nNow, the engine. Back in its heyday I can really see why one'd prefer GoldSrc over the Quake engine. Even today I still find some aspects of the GoldSrc engine fun, like the ridiculous over-the-top skeletal animation (jumping animations, especially, wew). But guess what, Quake's source code has been around since roughly Y2K. There are loads of source ports (forks), & I'd say a lot of the more famous ones ones like FTEQW or ezQuake / nQuake are equally good-looking, if not even better than GoldSrc. This is especially true in the case of FTEQW, which I'd say could go beyond Quake 3 Arena levels of graphics if Quake used anything besides brown. Trying to argue in favor of GoldSrc without introducing some kind of nostalgia factor really doesn't get places, & I really don't want to be talking purely on the basis of nostalgia here.\n\nOne area where you could certainly argue in favor of DMC, however, is ease of setup, albeit only just a bit.\n\nDMC's setup process:\n1. click INSTALL\n2. click PLAY\n3. profit (???)\n\nezQuake setup process:\n1. install Quake from Steam / GOG\n2. throw ezQuake somewhere\n3. drop pak0.pak & pak1.pak from the Quake Steam / GOG files into id1 in ezQuake's directory\n4. launch it\n5. basically done\n\nIt's...really not a major difference. Even if you just wanna play it casually, this can be done in literal seconds, assuming your internet connection is good.\n\nNow, with all that info out of the way, would I say the game is worth it? Not really. However, should you refrain from playing it? Nah. Even I, who is mostly into QuakeWorld for the fast action & extremely responsive movement, will admit there is no be-all end-all reason to avoid DMC. It's an OK way to spend a Sunday evening if there's a server with players. I wouldn't recommend that this be your daily driver, though. It's extremely unlikely you'll get many hours out of this game & you're much better off buying Quake for that if you're willing to get gud. Quake has a lot more to offer as well, such as a match readying / warmup system on almost all servers, TDM, CTF, & also QWTF (the very first Team Fortress).\n\nI am aware I'm not too good at organizing & not too many will ask this, but since I felt I had to put it somewhere:\n\n[quote=Whoever] Uh, why do you compare it to QuakeWorld so much? [/quote]\n\nWell, that's because DMC basically is Quake, even intentionally. It's right there in the description: \"...tribute to the work of id software...\" & this \"work\" is almost certainly Quake. It's certainly not DOOM or Wolfenstein, is it? The maps are basically the same, the loadout is basically the same, & even the objective. They even kept the lack of crouching like in Quake, contrary to every other GoldSrc game out there. I'm not sure if anyone could want more proof that DMC is a Quake clone.\n\nAnd, that is all. I hope this was informative.","timestamp_created":1565744425,"timestamp_updated":1569980450,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517681598663330078","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54506274","author":{"steamid":"76561198379058313","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":21,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1562068392},"language":"english","review":"not bad game","timestamp_created":1565206880,"timestamp_updated":1565206880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54490615","author":{"steamid":"76561198108924310","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":114,"playtime_forever":25,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1483666459},"language":"english","review":"add grifball","timestamp_created":1565123293,"timestamp_updated":1565123293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54475306","author":{"steamid":"76561198959271502","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1967,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1535,"last_played":1600430302},"language":"english","review":"To be fair, you need to have a very high IQ to understand Deathmatch Classic. The gameplay is extremely unique, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics, most of the features will go over a typical gamer’s head. There’s also GMan nihilistic style, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The best players understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this game, to realise that it is not just good- it says something deep about ART. As a consequence people who dislike Deathmatch Classic truly ARE idiots- of course, they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the skills required in this game's mind-blowing map “dmc_dm2,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as this game's author wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.","timestamp_created":1565035509,"timestamp_updated":1565035509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571431875228881836","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54469571","author":{"steamid":"76561198811822632","num_games_owned":693,"num_reviews":834,"playtime_forever":88,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":88,"last_played":1565008050},"language":"brazilian","review":"recomendo..","timestamp_created":1565008723,"timestamp_updated":1565008723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54466928","author":{"steamid":"76561198269475011","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":16,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1578928606},"language":"french","review":"c'est quake mais avec les connard de personnage de half life ducoup ca a creer quake life ENFIN VOUS AVEZ COMPRIS BANDE DE NAZI, sinon il est bien :)","timestamp_created":1564994781,"timestamp_updated":1564994781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54460489","author":{"steamid":"76561198097473222","num_games_owned":2407,"num_reviews":87,"playtime_forever":12,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1495831348},"language":"english","review":"The game was great, sad that I can't find any games :(","timestamp_created":1564952348,"timestamp_updated":1564952348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54416998","author":{"steamid":"76561198157396854","num_games_owned":364,"num_reviews":221,"playtime_forever":20,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1564731383},"language":"english","review":"?/10\nDead\n凉了","timestamp_created":1564731420,"timestamp_updated":1564731420,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54364118","author":{"steamid":"76561198410169156","num_games_owned":1242,"num_reviews":492,"playtime_forever":13,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1564441673},"language":"english","review":"Unfortunately this is awesome game that do to being old, the player count reached zero and died.
