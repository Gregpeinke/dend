I picked up this game shortly after release, played it for a couple hours, thought 'this is trash' and didn't come back for four years.  Enter 2017 I decide out of spite to play the game due to its ratings and my fond memories of the first two.  It still took me several attempts to get more than just a couple hours in, but I was determined to finish it. \n\nThe plot seems more like an excuse to shoot at and destroy imagery of our founding fathers and historical culture of the US.  The gunplay is redundant, the levels too small and repetitive, and the vigors forgetable.  You find yourself running through the same level multiple times, back and forth, Including how many times I tried to start the game, I must have climbed that light hosue a couple dozen times.\n\nThe ending too, for the last half of the game I was just waiting for it to be over.  Then just when you think you're finally done, it drags on for a few more hours, only to drag on for another hour attempting to tie metaphysics into the game to make brainlets feel special.  It doesn't work, it's objectively a convoluted mess of a story, like the devs couldn't decide what plot to pick, so they just mushed all the concepts together into one disaster.\n\nTL;DR - 3/10, don't

      什么样的游戏可以被称之为艺术？生化奇兵无限便是可当之无愧称之为第九艺术的游戏。艺术不仅是美好的，他可以是残酷的，血腥的，游戏中充满着各色暴力恐怖，但也无妨他艺术品的地位。\n       系列一二三代都建立在无比美好的乌托邦之上，从海底城到天空城，场景的塑造无可比拟，进入游戏看到那天空中的哥伦比亚，我当时：wow！觉得什么词都无法形容。游戏中各色场景天气的变换严格切合着游戏氛围，场景变换的迅速所带来的落差与不协调感也更能给我带来更多的好奇。可以说，制作组真真切切的创造一个耸立于云端上的天空之城。\n       相比于前几作，本作节奏更加快，也不是那么沉闷，喜欢突突突的玩家也可以很好的找到感觉，我觉得前作很蛋疼的弹药问题在这一作完全没有一点感觉，上好弹药，异能轰炸去拯救你的[spoiler]女儿[/spoiler]吧！\n       本作的剧情很晦涩，要结合各种录音跟场景语言的暗示来理解，不过可能是我很懒，没有一个个看完，到达结局，看到主角的遭遇后也是懵懵懂懂，最后也是看的评测里的完整剧情解析23333。然后，amazing！哇哇哇，突然贯通了。很有意思。\n       但是最令我惊喜的还是关于伊丽莎白这个人物的塑造，从一开始一个天真无邪的女孩（?）,从第一次看到布克杀人对布克产生的厌恶，天真的阶段，到自己为拯救他人而亲手杀人，成熟阶段，到最后洞晓一切，理性阶段。从人物的神情语言至动作，我觉得是一个足以媲美《最后生还者》艾莉的存在。评测的朋友们一个个喊着女儿老婆不是最有力的证明吗（滑稽）。\n

Sadece ufak bir bug oldu. \"Optional Mission\" yaptığım halde yapmadım diye Quest Log'da görünmüştü, onun da oyuna hiçbir etkisi yok zaten. Herneyse bu oyun Bioshock 1 ve 2 ile alakalı ama hikaye bazında değil. Hikayeler kesişmiyor ama mantığı bir noktada kesişiyor. Grafikleri hala muazzam görünüyor. 20 sene geçse de öyle görünecek bence çünkü kendine has bir tarzı var. Loot yapmak, gizli Vox Cipher'ları bulmak, Lockpickleri toplayıp kilitli odaları ve kasaları açmak, \"Vigor\" denen her biri ayrı özellikte sihir güçlerini kullanmak, silahları ve vigorları geliştirmek ve tüm bunları yaparken de hikayeyi merak ederek oynamak. Bir FPS oyunundan ne beklenebilirse hepsini karşılamış bence Bioshock Infinite. Hikayesi ise tam anlamıyla MU-AZ-ZAM. Oyunu bitirince \"Wow!\" Türkçemizle \"Vay Anasını!\" diyorsunuz ve garip hislerle başbaşa kalıp Credits'i izlerken kendinizi buluyorsunuz. Sonrasında Credits'i tam olarak izlerseniz bitiminde sizi düşündürecek ufak bir sahneye şahit oluyorsunuz. Ben oyunu tüm toplanabilirlerle bitirdim ama henüz DLC'lerini oynamadım. Onları da bitirince incelemeye ayrıca ekleme yapacağım. Duyduğuma göre DLC'leri serinin ilk oyunlarıyla bağlantılıymış. Ve benden size bir tavsiye; eğer ki bu, oyun için okuduğunuz ilk inceleme ise diğer incelemeleri okumadan oynayın, çünkü bir çok kendini bilmez arkadaş oyun hakkında spoiler vermiş, hiç hoş değil. \"İyi ki incelemelere bakmamışım.\" dedirtti yani bana.\n\nGüncelleme: DLC'leri de an itibariyle bitirmiş bulunuyorum. Çok üzgünüm çünkü Irrational Games dağıldı biliyorsunuz ki. Bir daha oyun camiası bu denli kaliteli bir oyun göremez diye çok üzgünüm. Sadece Bioshock Infinite oynayanlar bile hikaye hakkında çok fazla şey öğrenebilir DLC'lerde ama seriyi tamamen bitirmiş oyuncular daha çok etkilenecektir. Hikayeye tam manasıyla noktayı koymak için DLC'leri de bitirmelisiniz. Yukarıda çok övemedim, kelimeler yetmiyor ama oyun hikayesiyle, görselliğiyle, müzikleriyle ve de anlatım tarzıyla tam bir sanat eseri. Kendine oyuncu diyenlerin kesinlikle oyun anılarında yer alması gereken bir oyun. Yine muazzam bir film izlemiş ve \"Allah'ım ben ne izledim böyle\" der gibi kaldım Credits'in başında. Credits bitince yine ufak bir sahne giriyor bu sefer serinin başlangıcına bir gönderme var. Böyle kaliteli oyunların çoğalması dileğiyle incelememi burada sonlandırıyorum.\n\n\nOkuduğunuz için teşekkürler, iyi oyunlar!","timestamp_created":1509945116,"timestamp_updated":1535739946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.645669281482696533","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36314937","author":{"steamid":"76561198227794540","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":3584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1110,"last_played":1609737491},"language":"english","review":"FINALY.
