The commercials and promos I viewed about it at launch and close therafter didn't show me anything even remotely close to the experience of playing this game. It's a puzzle game, and as such an increasingly difficult one. It does test my abilities, and I feel it evolves them as well. That's not bad for a game.\n\nIt's difficult to say much more without spoiling, since experiencing stuff for the first time is part of what makes this game a strong title. Very nice sense of humor in the story as well, and a very strong sequel to Portal 1.\n\nFinally, playing this game co-op continues the storyline, and does so with the same type of humor. It pits you and a mate in more difficult puzzles than in the single player setup, and is a very good continuation on the first part of the game. Through the years I have now ended up completing the co-op chapters three times, and some of the puzzles you tend to forget, so the enjoyment of the game is still there even after long time.\n\nStrongly recommend this one.","timestamp_created":1480193752,"timestamp_updated":1638003203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27730636","author":{"steamid":"76561198195993434","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":578,"last_played":1499197396},"language":"french","review":"Portal 2 , une grande histoire d'amour , a force d'un combat acharné contre Glados je le nomine dans la catégorie \" Meme les mechants ont besoin de reconfort \" car a force on se lie d'attachement avec ce méchants , a force de ce prendre la tête sur des niveau on en viens a l'aprécié :D","timestamp_created":1480193705,"timestamp_updated":1480193705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27730494","author":{"steamid":"76561197980876769","num_games_owned":640,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":871,"last_played":1550786415},"language":"english","review":"Awesome humour, awesome gameplay, awesome puzzles, just an overall awesome game! :)","timestamp_created":1480193635,"timestamp_updated":1480193635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27730288","author":{"steamid":"76561197994488617","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":23,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1475911554},"language":"romanian","review":"Very nice game at super price!","timestamp_created":1480193538,"timestamp_updated":1480193538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27730216","author":{"steamid":"76561198072464367","num_games_owned":900,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":730,"last_played":1656890327},"language":"english","review":"THIS GAME IS GREAT\nI love Valve and their game but this game is more or less just a better version of Portal.\nThis game does not only include a neat singleplayer but also has a moding commnity and valve does provide the needed tools for people who wanna try out their own level ideas.\n","timestamp_created":1480193505,"timestamp_updated":1480193505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504727602005004883","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27730183","author":{"steamid":"76561198149111931","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4555,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3806,"last_played":1597384316},"language":"english","review":"Great game","timestamp_created":1480193487,"timestamp_updated":1480193487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27730009","author":{"steamid":"76561198065854803","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":520,"last_played":1440754101},"language":"polish","review":"Nie tak dobra jak jedynka pod względem spójnej wizji artystycznej, ale wciąż fenomenalna zabawa, czasem wymagająca nieco pomyślunku.

It has a very deep story, but you'll have to have a small understanding of the first game to get the full picture. The gameplay is very fun, and the game is pretty light on the computer for budget gamers. By default, the graphics are gorgeous, but can be altered for smother gameplay at the cost of a visual downgrade. The game is highly configurable and has a lot of content packed in, like a mode to build your own test chambers and post it on the Steam Workshop. And the story is one of the best I've ever seen in a game, with memorable characters and a deep yet engaging plot. Even though this game was originaly released in 2011, it'll still holds up very well in 2018, especially for the current prices. I would put my money into Portal 2 if you like puzzle games.","timestamp_created":1480190151,"timestamp_updated":1530701308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27722384","author":{"steamid":"76561198067066840","num_games_owned":329,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":883,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":876,"last_played":1654196910},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1480190123,"timestamp_updated":1480190123,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27722135","author":{"steamid":"76561198106814022","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1567021439},"language":"english","review":"Very nice game, it makes you actually think instead of shooting people..","timestamp_created":1480190009,"timestamp_updated":1480190009,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27722128","author":{"steamid":"76561198105820348","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":908,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1592516224},"language":"english","review":"By far the best puzzle game out there.","timestamp_created":1480190005,"timestamp_updated":1480190005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27721931","author":{"steamid":"76561198054190692","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1738,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1738,"last_played":1474315253},"language":"english","review":"One the most intelligence-aspiring games out there.","timestamp_created":1480189918,"timestamp_updated":1480189918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27721683","author":{"steamid":"76561198039905990","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4228,"last_played":1657277844},"language":"english","review":"there is a hidden half life 3 trailer\n\n5/7","timestamp_created":1480189822,"timestamp_updated":1480189822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27721626","author":{"steamid":"76561198141464781","num_games_owned":568,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":784,"last_played":1467670390},"language":"spanish","review":"Imprescindible para cualquier biblioteca.","timestamp_created":1480189799,"timestamp_updated":1480189799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27721622","author":{"steamid":"76561198331536707","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":6797,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1721,"last_played":1558785014},"language":"russian","review":"Игра простая с помощью двух пространственных дырок решите головоломки и идите в следующий уровень и так снова и снова.
