Along with these perks are a large arsenal of weapons for each perk. Assault rifles for Commandos, grenade launchers for Demolition Experts, katanas for the melee murdering Berzerker. You name it. Despite it just being wave after wave of monsters to kill, the game does have a sense of progression as you're rewarded with money to buy better weapons and as your perks level up and grant you more benefits.
