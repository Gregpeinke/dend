Очень многое изменилось, начиная с заставок и заканчивая разнообразным гемплеем. ) Эта игра меня очень парадовала своей атмосферой и меняющимся сюжетом, 🔺 безусловно эта игра теперь войдёт в список моих любимых игр 🔺 ! 💙💚💛💜\n\n+Плюсы этой игры :\n   1. Радует, что разработчики изменили главное меню и все заставки ! 💙\n   2. Ооо мой бог, они добавили сюда саундтреки и лёгкую мелодию ( как же ёё не хвотало в первой части Portal ! ) 💚\n   3. Крутые сюжетные повороты и главное развязка ! 💛\n   4. Просто крутейший _САУНД-ТРЕК_ в конце игры ! 💜\n   5. Интересно было следить за сюжетом :D \n   6. _ГЛАДЕС_ ТОП ! 💙💚💛💜\n   7.

Добавили коператив, в нём очень крутые уровни, их намного интереснее проходить + ещё с другом или онлайн 🙂👍\n\nПосле середины игры ( Где то между серединой и концом ) мне не понравились эти уровни, мне кажется они были лишними (Они меня реально изматывали ) не то что бы, они были сложными, нет просто немного надоедают, ( мне кажется, они просто сделаны чтобы увеличить время гейм-плея :D\n_Мне всё понравилось в этой игре ! _\n( Некоторые Уровни стали сложнее, они занимают определённое количесво времени, на их прохождение )\nПокупайте эту игру ! Я рекомендую, не надо стесняться  !\nТеперь это будет моей любимой игрой ! 😍\n\nМой вердикт_>>>>>>>>>>>  10 лун из 10,______  10🌚/10🌚\n\n                                            11 оленей из 10,____  11🐂/ 10 🦄🐮🐎🐴\n                                          \n                                            1 птица из 1,_______ 1🦅(🐔) / 1🦅(🐔)\n\n                                            1 крутая музыка из 1,__1🎵/ 1🎵\n\n                  и                        1 куб компаньён из -10 , 10💠/ 10 💠 Топ игра!!

A lot has changed since the ending cutscenes and various gameplay. ) In this game, I remember the atmosphere and changing the plot, 🔺 of course this game is now included into the list of my favorite games 🔺 ! 💙💚💜💛\n\nThe pros of this game :\n  1. I am glad that the developers changed the main menu and all the screen savers ! 💙\n  2.
