There is a pretty high skill ceiling, a lot of ways to play, 6 different classes and a decent number of weapons.\nThe gameplay is simple - it's a coop game that supports up to 6 players and the goal is surviving waves of zombie enemies randomly spawning around the map. When a player dies, they become a spectator until the wave is killed. Then after each wave players have the chance to find a shop and buy some weapons and ammunition. The final wave is a boss.\n\nKilling Floor requires teamwork, cooperation and team effor to survive. It's usually impossible to stay on a single position, players constantly have to move and keep enemies as far as possible. Each class has different abilities, medic has healing bonuses, specialist is better with shotguns and can weld door faster etc.\n\nIt's a pretty good coop game, cheap and easy to learn (although hard to master) so if you're looking for a new coop game, this is definitely something you should give a try to.
