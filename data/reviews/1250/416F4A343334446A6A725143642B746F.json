This is a coop FPS similar to L4D, but the objective is to survive waves of zombies, rather than travel from A to B. The action is really intense, especially on higher difficulties, and there are a variety of roles to play and weapons to use. KF also has the BEST FPS community I've seen. Most players use teamwork, cover and heal each other, share cash between waves to help others buy better weapons. Tripwire support the game with special events, new maps, weapons, skins and achievements. Servers are more stable than L4D, and if a player ragequits, the game adjusts the number of zombies so its not automatically a lost cause (no useless bots!).

Einen Wermutstropfen gibt es allerdings; die deutsche Version ist sehr stark geschnitten. Dies wäre ja an und für sich kein all zu großes Problem, wenn es lediglich mit dem Verlust von Spielatmosphäre einhergehen würde. Leider stört es aber auch deutlich das Gameplay selbst, da Zombies beispielsweise sehr merkwürdig bzw. verzögert umkippen und man deshalb unfreiwillig Kugeln verschwendet.","timestamp_created":1323368733,"timestamp_updated":1323368733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2302283","author":{"steamid":"76561198005427695","num_games_owned":293,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1472,"last_played":1455068125},"language":"english","review":"Melhor impossível.\nainda mais com os DLC's de arma 4free.\n:)","timestamp_created":1323359687,"timestamp_updated":1323359687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"165307","author":{"steamid":"76561197963863790","num_games_owned":372,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":7020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6742,"last_played":1446304736},"language":"english","review":"Good Solid Game","timestamp_created":1323349391,"timestamp_updated":1386280968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"214711","author":{"steamid":"76561197965471368","num_games_owned":756,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":5029,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4837,"last_played":1375367254},"language":"english","review":"The original horde mode.
