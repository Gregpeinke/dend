História do jogo muito boa, história não tão longa, mas é uma ótima história, deve adimitir que o jogo é um pouco dificil nas dificuldades baixas '' normal '', no começo e um pouco pro final eu achei meio '' engraçado '' em algumas situações do jogo, onde aparece um homem e uma mulher que tem os nomes de Um homem e Uma Dama, essas partes deles falando não tem como nao rir. O jogo tem uma especie de Vigor que resumindo seria um poder, que existem muitos tipos de Vigor para usar, existe uma barra marcando. O jogo é bem religioso, dificil negar isso, eu achei um pouco confuso a história sobre isso, mas uma segunda zerada sempre é bom para entender melhor.

Сюжет 10/10, хоть и понять его можно лишь играя с русской озвучкой, такова кстати имеется, да и пройти игру может понадобиться не 1 раз, чтобы полностью понять и вникнуть в суть всех приключений Букера и Элизабет, которые не заканчиваются с концом самой игры, так как имеется 2 части дополнения \"Burial at sea\", которые заставят вас прослезиться не меньше чем основная концовка самой игры. Механика боя также на высшем уровне, убивать врагов разными оружиями и энергетиками доставят вам немало удовольствия.)\nВзаимосвязь 1 части \"Bioshock\" и \"Burial at sea 2\" заслуживает отдельного упоминания, чтобы придумать такой приквел к игре 2008 года, нужно быть по меньшей мере гением.

There's no better one. Trust me.\n\nThe plot is covered in shadows all the time, which also makes it massively interesting. Together with the possibility of exploring through all the areas you are present in at the moment, hidden story based scripted interactions with your companion, which is, by the way, the most beautifully animated woman character with the most beautiful face, smile, even damn walk-style, voice and especially (!!) eyes, of all time, and all those weapons and vigors, very enjoyable and do believe me, that as soon as you start playing it, you will experience some horribly hard time trying to convince yourself to finally turn it off and go to bed.\n\nDon't be afraid of story based video sequences, where you can just watch and not do anything, as there are just a few of them and they are quite short. I'm not a huge fan of these scenes in a game myself...'cause I'm here to play the game, right? But...after beating this game...wow, I wish there were more of them...and longer, much, much longer. You will love every single scene where you can just sit 'n relax and simply watch Booker interacting with Elizabeth. Even if you won't like the plot, I'm certain you will finish the game, because of her. It's almost impossible to just tell yourself..\"well...screw this.\" She works as a perfectly functional and efficient glue. She won't let your ass to abandon your chair without at least 90 minutes spent ingame.\n\nConclusion? After beating this game, you will pray to god of gaming industry to make it longer. Like next 15 hours longer. As that's the time you'll spend with the basic campaing on hard difficulty, if you scan through every place you possibly can. Ofcourse there are things that could have been made better. But in the end, it is absolutely worth it. Even if it costs like 30€. You will be able to forgive the game everything, except some parts of the plot..as it's some quite emotional stuff. Simply, the game is so good it made the Call of Duty/PUBG based player realise that this is the greatest game he has ever played in his entire life.\n\nSo, if you haven't played this game yet...go on. Accept what's inevitable :D and play it finally, for f***s sake!\n\n\nPros:\n+ story\n+ enviroment (graphics are amazing yet not too demanding)\n+ Elizabeth (possibly merge \"story\" point with this one, 'cause sooner or later you'll give no f***s 'bout the story; you'll care just about her)\n+ weapons and means of tactical play\n+ even if you are plying it for the second/third time..you will almost always find something new...and you will still enjoy the game\n\nCons:\n- there possibly are some, but I ain't give a shit about them\n- the campagn should have been like twice as long..I'd love it\n- not enough Booker/Elizabeth interaction based video sequences uncontrollable by player\n\n\nMy insignificant evaluation: Infinite/10","timestamp_created":1535754945,"timestamp_updated":1535754945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44495073","author":{"steamid":"76561198168668101","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1542997730},"language":"italian","review":"Gioco sorprendente, trama imprevedibile e gran attenzione ai particolari (easter eggs, cura dello scenario, parti di storia nascoste e recuperabili nel corso del gioco).\n\nL'unica pecca è il sistema di combattimento, poco naturale come nei precedenti bioshock, a cui però ci si abitua in fretta e che complessivamente non compromette la giocabilità.\n\nOttimizzazione hardware consistente, mai avuto un singolo crash, tantomeno un calo di FPS tenendo il gioco in ultra (1070ti) anche nelle scene più cariche di grafica.\n\nAssolutamente consigliato!","timestamp_created":1535748594,"timestamp_updated":1542997867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566666662693023682","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44494359","author":{"steamid":"76561198161567146","num_games_owned":293,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":601,"last_played":1574115902},"language":"russian","review":"Не вижу смысла хвалить этот шедевр.

so what you should know right off the bat about this game is that it doesn't take place in Rapture. You might have seen this already from the trailers though, but figured I'd get it out of the way. \n\nSo, first off the bat, graphics. The visuals are simply stunning, the aestethic is bright and filled with light in most places. As you carry on though it will subtly go from brighter to darker avenues. If you feel it's too dark, don't be afraid to fix your gamma. The guide in the beginning of the game didn't really help me set the right tone since I fumbled around in a dark a lot towards the end of the game.\n\nStory wise, oh yes, this is absolutely the best one out of all the series, but spoiler alert: The ending really doesn't make a lick of sense. But you won't really care anyway when you get there, because the game is going to keep you guessing anyway. So if you're the sort that likes analysis, you're going to love playing this game.\n\nIn terms of game mechanics, this game unfortunately suffers from consolitis. Which means that you only get to have two plasmids (called vigors here) active at one time and you can only carry two weapons. Highly annoying, but halfway through the game I didn't care, since I just picked up whatever weapon I had handy. It got really annoying in boss fights though since it's very possible to run out of ammunition halfway through the fight. And to add insult to injury, there's a boss that raises infinite minions. I seriously hate fake difficulty like that because it just means you have to kite all enemies and keep firing at the boss at all times. Tedium like that really put me off a game. However, thankfully that's just one boss so it's not big hurdle. \n\nOn that note, the plasmids in this game are utterly boring, huge minus there. It's like the devs just forgot about all the other fun stuff in the game. Also, there's so much less hacking in this game, doors are now locked with actual locks which require you to use lockpicks which autosucceed. Again, I blame this on consolitis since that usually results in stupid \"streamlining\" like this. The same goes for the number and design of weapons, they definitely on the simpler side and not at all as fun as we've been spoiled with in the previous games. No special ammo either, boo developers, boo! Sometimes less isn't more, sometimes less is just simply less.\n\nBUT.. here's where we get to the truly interesting part: Elizabeth. She's an NPC you play with the whole game. And the reason I waited so long to pick this game up. I hate escort missions with a fiery passion, hell if you could make it a plasmid it'd be quie useful. Anyway, I digress. Elizabeth is literally the perfect AI. She's invulnerable, she actually HELPS YOU during fights and after fights, she highligts interesting things in areas or recommend that you should check nearby area X for loot. \n\nOther devs, take note, THIS is how you make a good companion AI! Full marks for that one!\n\nAlso, there's a new mechanic where you jump around on big rails going through the sky and that's a really interesting mechanic which has a lot of advantages. Ever wanted to play Bionic Commando Rearmed as an FPS? Well now you can, sort of anyway. In fact, in the beginning of the game, I put on the BCR sound track and decided this was simply a prequel to that game and it kind of works too. \n\nUltimately though, I have to say that the game was really short compared to the previous ones. I explored quite a bit in the game and found a lot of things, but there's a whole lot less content to play around with unfortunately. \n\nBut to be honest, it's short but really sweet.
