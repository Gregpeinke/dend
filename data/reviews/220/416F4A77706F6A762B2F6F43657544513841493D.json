Enemy variety is extremely poor and the weapon sandbox is a noticeable downgrade over HL1's exceptional host of weapons. HL2's really excels with its implementation of Valve's advanced physics engine that still holds up. Once the gravity gun is introduced puzzles, enemy encounters, and exploration becomes more dynamic; without the physics half life 2 would be another by the books shooter. The graphical presentation and artstyle has aged remarkably well, so if visuals are important to you then HL2 will not fail to deliver. Valve failed to live up to HL1, but HL2 is still a worthwhile experience to any fan of the FPS genre.","timestamp_created":1627784892,"timestamp_updated":1627784892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96724959","author":{"steamid":"76561199055971807","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":59,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1660328756},"language":"spanish","review":"my dad told \n\nSon you are a huge wuss\n\n\ni do not know what that means so i bought this game","timestamp_created":1627784391,"timestamp_updated":1627784391,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96724326","author":{"steamid":"76561198079110141","num_games_owned":392,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1993,"last_played":1598205678},"language":"english","review":"My favorite Half-Life.

For example, in the *dreading* boat mission where the valve is broken, you need to blow up these oddly placed explosive containers to have an item break the bridge. Although not anything new, I spent 20 minutes trying to see if I missed anything because I didn't think id have to blow them up as they are always scattered around the map and you don't have to shoot them.\n\nThe boat mission was repetitive and the motion was annoying. I gave up during the boat mission cause i could never tell if I had to get off the boat or keep shooting.\n\nAlthough I personally dont like story based puzzle games, this is not a bad game at all, just not my cup of tea.
