Portal is by far my favorite Valve franchise, even though most like Half-Life the most. For those of you who don't know, here's a crash course for Portal: You are playing a silent female named Chell. You volunteered at Aperature Science as a human test subject. You are guided through many test chambers by an A.I. unit named GLaDOS. She is sarcastic, and witty. The test chambers are always puzzles that you use with your surroundings, and the Portal gun. The portal gun is an excllent game mechanic, and it's very appreciated. basically, the Portal gun has an input and an output. You go in one side and come out the other. You use these portals to find a way out of each chamber. I won't give away anything else for those of you who haven't played it. It's an excellent game. This one is the easier of the two in the franchise. I finished this one in a short amount of time, compared to Portal 2. The game is still good, however, and has extra levels if you wish to play them after you finish the game. It is definitely a very creative game with memorable characters. You only really get to know GLaDOS, but there's some side characters, like the sentries. I recommend this game and give it a 9.9 out of ten. Now, if you play through this game, you may just get some cake....","timestamp_created":1466087300,"timestamp_updated":1466087300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23596380","author":{"steamid":"76561198040551661","num_games_owned":403,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1513271762},"language":"english","review":"There is no other game for me personally, that I would consider perfect, other than Portal.\n\nThere is literally NOTHING flawed in the game, nothing at all I can think of.\nThe pacing is impeccable, with the correct timing on music and ambient playback with the story.\nIt covers all types of pacing with music and ambience in gameplay, from the slow and depressing downward spiral of thinking you may never escape (Self Esteem Fund from the OST), to the fast paced finale music of the game. The game made me go through so many emotions all in the expanse of my first time playing around 3 hours.\n\nThe game is UNBELIEVABLY clever, yet doesn't need to break the fourth wall to do that, which is incredibly impressive.\nThe game's humour is absolutely timeless, it is old as hell (9 years from this review point), and yet the jokes are still brilliant. witty, and dark. There are almost NO games that do it on the same caliber of Portal, hell, not even Portal 2 could live up to this godly creation.\nThe puzzles are beautifully made, completely fair (no fidgety rubbish) and once again, timeless in the sense of enjoyment. \n\nVisually, you might think this game is nothing to write home about, but to me, once again the game shows how age will NEVER affect this game. NEVER. simplistic visuals will always be timeless, intricate wank in videogames will ensure it stays contemporary.\n\nI think I play through Portal 1 at least once a year. The game is short, and scales next to nothing in comparison to other games, but unlike those said games, which take hours upon hours of your life, portal will only take an hour or two. But it stays with you for life, and allows you to experience true perfection in a videogame.\nI generally hate analogies for this kind of stuff, but if you can think of some other medium with a perfect technicality and timelessness to it (think of Citizen Kane or something), then Portal is that kind of game.\nI think most people in the year 2016 will have played this by now, but sometimes you just gotta pour your heart out for something you cherish a bunch.\n\nValve may not be the greatest company, but some small dev adopted by them gave us a glimpse of perfection in a video game format. And for that, I am grateful.","timestamp_created":1466085149,"timestamp_updated":1494538068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":56,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.815918624401092529","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23592425","author":{"steamid":"76561198040557732","num_games_owned":918,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":1803,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1323,"last_played":1622366199},"language":"english","review":"[h1]This review article analyzes the tone and design of the excellent single-player campaigns in [i]Portal[/i] and [i]Portal 2[/i], concluding that the original [i]Portal[/i] is the stronger title.[/h1]\n\n[. . .] I think it’s fairly trivial to say that [i]Portal[/i] is a significant and influential franchise.

We're Chell, a girl used as guinea pig forced to do tests for an artificial intelligence called GLaDos with a portal gun inside this gigantic and apparently deserted structure named Aperture Science Labs. The puzzles you will be prompted to solve involve the use of the portal gun, a gun that shoots two linking portals on specific typologies of walls and, you must complete every test where you might have to push a button, drop cubes, make huge leaps with the help of the portals and a clever use of physics and gravity.\n\nSeems simple and effective but what's so special in this game? Well, besides the clever puzzles you can't ignore the ourageously and funny GLaDos, with her sarcastic comments and black humour that will keep on encouraging you in doing tests for her while at the same time insulting you. Exhilarating.\n\nThe interesting fact is the minimalistic story behind the game. Portal is set in the same \"universe\" of Half-Life 2, but the time is not specified. Anyways it's interesting to notice the small clues around the maps, the small hints and stories told by GLaDos to understand a little what's going on, why are we here and what happened to the Aperture Science Labs.\n\nUnfortunately a very big problem of the game is it's length, it just take less than a fistful hours to fully complete it, but believe me it's really worth it.\n\n[h1]+++PROs+++[/h1][list]\n[*][b] PORTAL.[/b] Very innovative and creative puzzles.

The AI Woman/Robot (GLaDOS) that talks to you throughout the short story mode is absolutely hilarious.

I snagged Valve’s Portal a game which came out back in 2007. Nine years ago now, wowzers. This is also my first Valve game I’ve ever played.\n\nRelying on an innovative clever gameplay mechanic that challenges the player’s intellect and our silent female protagonist Chell’s combined with the the always observing AI GLaDOs (voiced brilliantly and hilariously by opera singer Ellen McLain), Portal is an example of a game that symbolizes the industry at its full potential. I imagine her character’s silence was deliberate, Chell doesn’t desire to give GLaDOS any additional satisfaction. Portal is indeed part art, part revolutionary. It is quite a gem, something I’d like to find more often. \n\nIt doesn’t force Chell or the player to be traditionally violent in the slightest. Something the majority of male protagonists do which as a whole isn’t good for the gender. As in, most of them are stoic, comprised of muscles, Caucasian, likely to shoot first before considering asking questions (discovering an alternate means), perpetuating detrimental stereotypes for men to persist adhering to. Chell’s not pointlessly objectified in her brief appearances either, that’s definitely worth noting. \n\nThe difficulty flows organically, from coddling near the inception to completely on your own as more insta-death dangers and harder to solve puzzle elements are added to the test chambers. GLaDOS promises to reward Chell with “grief counseling” and “cake” if she succeeds being a test subject for Aperture Science. Using the Weighted Companion Cube, your only physical friend, Chell will be able to press various switches throughout the game. Spliced with deadpan black humor from GLaDOS that sometimes drops hints at Chell’s past along with the character’s connection to Aperture Science, Portal is probably one of the most satisfying game experiences I’ve ever had, period. Despite currently being stuck in Chamber 15, ha ha. \n\nAbsolutely a new favorite I highly recommend if you haven’t personally given it a glance before, yeah, just do it.","timestamp_created":1465623879,"timestamp_updated":1465623879,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23496161","author":{"steamid":"76561198080264029","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1465619592},"language":"english","review":"Beautifully crafted game.

In terms of video games: it is the very definition of short & sweet. There are many people out there overly concerned with the length of games, and I believe [b]Portal[/b] is an excellent example of why one shouldn’t immediately scoff at a short game due to prejudices. Sometimes 3 hours of perfection is better than 20 hours of mediocrity. Sit down, immerse yourself, and just play through the game in one sitting as you would if watching a movie. It is worth it.\n\nI say this because I believe this is a game best enjoyed in one sitting. There are no lulls or down points, and every second of the game is riveting and purposeful. The whole experience is so genuinely entertaining and the pacing is so perfectly on point that I think it is designed to be played like this. In this way, I see the length of the game as a strength and not a weakness… but maybe I’m just crazy.\n\nBut what is it that makes the game so genuinely entertaining in the first place? Everything… and then some. The concept is innovative, the puzzles are intuitive and interesting, the atmosphere is captivating, and the dialogue is hilarious and flawless. And when all of these facets come together in the finished product, the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. And a game is created that transcends opinions: it is undeniably great.\n\nHonestly, I respect everyone’s right to their own taste in video games; but if you don’t enjoy [b]Portal[/b], I would dutifully suggest you consider finding a new hobby. I would find it very hard to understand how anyone could possibly not enjoy this game if they consider themselves a “gamer.”\n\nIf you haven’t yet had the luxury of experiencing [b]Portal[/b], then I envy you.
