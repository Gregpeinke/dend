Explore everything, every corner, every photo, every desk, listen to what everybody say, memorize as much as you can. Game will reward you for that in many ways. Clues are everywhere, much hidden places. Lots of FPS, you can fight from the ground, you can fight in the sky, using weapons or ability, two at the time of each. Duality in all things, life and death, left and right, good and evil, love and hate, so you will have to choose from time to time, heads or tails... HEADS OR TAILS?
