Кроваво-красные лучи солнца озаряли небоскребы, полосами ложились меж домов на дорогу, где не были свалены в кучи машины. Везде лежали трупы, кое-где продолжали бродить \"овощи\", чьи братья-зараженные чуть не прикончили меня накануне. Ремень винтовки я перекинул через плечо, в саднящей руке держал найденный пару дней назад пистолет, что жестко царапал и так покалеченную ладонь. Город был мертв, а я еще жив. Сегодня это не изменится.\n\nШрам, пересекающий верхнюю губу, не позволял расслабить лицо, подставив его под лучи знамени нового дня. Быть может, я и не смогу больше нормально спать. Даже в убежищах уже не чувствую себя в безопасности. Долбанные уроды! Будь мне не тридцать два года, а за сорок там или меньше двадцати пяти - хрена с два бы продержался так долго. Война научила не доверять военным и пропускать мимо ушей все эти оповещения о вертолетах, БМП и всей \"спасательной\" фигне. Знаем мы этих военных. Ни толку, ни порядка. Вспомнился тот чувак, неделю назад. Пытался вынудить какого-то байкера отдать ему оружие, так тот ему сначала зубы выбил, а потом продолжал бить в лицо, превращая в кровавое месиво. А все почему? Потому что не смог оценить свои силы. Главная ошибка. Нельзя переоценивать себя. Мы ничего не стоим. Одна ошибка - и мы не будем жить.\n\nКогда все началось, я был обычным менеджером среднего звена. Клерк, офисный планктон, ноль без палочки, фанат комиксов и видеоигр, потомок русских эмигрантов. Был ли я готов к апокалипсису? Нет. Даже в мыслях. Это просто случилось. Сидел в баре после работы, раздумывал об увольнении - задолбало все. Как в том фильме... или книге ли... захотелось что-нибудь разрушить. Вокруг, в себе - не важно. Просто уничтожить. Может и умереть, не суть важно. Потому я ударил полицейского, что сидел рядом. Не знаю, может оно и к лучшему. Закрыли меня на пару дней, но выпустили уже следующим вечером, когда все и началось. Их начальник пришел, придерживая носовой платок у окровавленного горла, и сказал выпустить всех, дать нам оружие и заставить оборонять участок. Он умер, когда цепь из пары десятков заключенных прорвали зараженные и повалили его на землю. Я не помню, кричал ли он, звал ли на помощь или просто хрипел. Единственное, что помню - мелькающие перед глазами горящие окна домов и догорающие остовы машин, как болели ноги, непривычные даже к простой ходьбе, как гулко билась кровь в голове и застилало глаза едким дымом...\n\nГде-то неподалеку послышался новый взрыв. Совсем близко от госпиталя. Часть \"овощей\" двинулась в ту сторону, меня, к счастью, они не заметили. Не хотелось подниматься с теплого капота пикапа, на который так хорошо уселся минуту назад. Не знаю даже, как к ним относится, к мертвецам этим. В прежней жизни я их и не видел особо, а на тех, что видел, были красивые костюмы, опрятные, строгие. И лица такие облагороженные. Совершенно не похожи на этих мертвых. Но даже сейчас чувствую себя довольно отрешенно, как и раньше. Они мертвы, те мертвы - так было всегда, сколько свет существует. Много изменилось? Опаснее стало, да. Боюсь даже представить, что в Китае творится, там же полтора миллиарда трупов бегает по континенту...\n\nЧто ж, уходить в подвал все-таки придется. Мертвецы проснулись окончательно, уже скоро новые толпы придут к этому госпиталю \"Милосердия\", может быть и живые с ними. Но меня им видеть нельзя. Пусть их забирают вертолеты, спасают и спасают новые спасители, пусть мир гибнет, люди умирают, свет нового дня укладывает теплые полосы лучей на покрытую трупами дорогу - я останусь тут. Даже если десять Танков с парой Курильщиков и Ведьмой вдруг решат навестить меня - я их встречу порцией свинца.\n\nЯ - всего лишь пустое место. Но его никто не займет.\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32313063/] Куратор\t[/url]\n\nСтавьте лайк, подписывайтесь на кураторскую страничку и ищите новое в играх!)","timestamp_created":1458918972,"timestamp_updated":1546505602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568132460117340088","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22018534","author":{"steamid":"76561198025598976","num_games_owned":395,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":696,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"*tldr* want to beat a game in an hour?

I remember playing this game when it first came out on the Xbox 360. The game contains 4 campaign levels each with 5 sections. These can be played in single-player and co-op. In addition to the campaign there is a Versus mode and Survival mode that you can play single player or online. This game even by gamer standards can't compare to engines like Unreal Engine or Crytek. But L4D uses all of Source Engine and does it while looking good. The lighting, scenery and blood all look very realistic and stunning. Anyways, overall this game is a pretty good experience and I'd recommend it to anyone who's new to the genre.
