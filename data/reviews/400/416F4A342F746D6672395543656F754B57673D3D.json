Игра сделана на движке Source.\n\nДевушка Челл просыпается в камере 3х3 метра, где искусственный интеллект ГЛэДОС предлагает пройти ей испытания во благо науки \"Лаборатории исследования природы порталов\". Со временем задания становятся всё сложнее и опаснее...\n\nПри помощи портальной пушки и 2 порталов, что создаются на простых поверхностях, Челл должна наступать на кнопки, ставить на них кубы, прятаться от турелей и избегать ядовитой жидкости. В игре также присутствует режим дополнительных продвинутых карт, проходимых на время, количество шагов и количество порталов.\n\nГрафика движка Source выглядела достаточно простовато, учитывая что создана была в одно время с Half-Life 2 : Episode 2 с гораздо лучшей графикой.\n\nОзвучка полностью русская, есть субтитры. Есть интересный и познавательный режим субтитров разработчиков. Песня ГлэДОС в конце мне очень понравилась. Музыка... компьютерные шутки... всё на высоте.\n\nУправлять лучше при помощь клавиатуры с мышью, хоть и поддерживается геймпад. Точность и скорость прицеливания у них выше. Поддерживается как ручное сохранение, так и по чекпоинтам. Нахожу оригинальными, хоть и неправдоподобными, ножные рессоры, что не дают травмироваться.\n\nНедостатки: про простую графику я уже сказал, да и вообще Portal вызывает ощущение пробы движка, игры-репетиции перед чем-то грандиозным. А рессоры вообще от таких-то травм не спасут.\n\nИнтересна и увлекательна, но всё же более подходящая на демо-версию движка Source, игра дарит свою долю положительных эмоций и необычный опыт.

Its a sarcastic, funny game, and I recommend it to anyone with some spare time, and a spare space in their hearts for a new favorite series.\n\nA great game, with fun portal physics and a sarcastically serious robot commentator. Once you finish the game, go and buy the second one! Fun, smart, and lovable, I say that you should try it if you haven't already.","timestamp_created":1466270939,"timestamp_updated":1466270939,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23635630","author":{"steamid":"76561198267695338","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":1354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1073,"last_played":1650129643},"language":"english","review":"genius. just get it.","timestamp_created":1466268935,"timestamp_updated":1518381132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23633177","author":{"steamid":"76561198040864477","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":86400},"language":"french","review":"Ce soir j'avais prévu de bosser...\nEt je me suis dit \"bah, je vais lancer Portal vite fait, histoire de me faire une rapide idée par rapport au 2\" (Oui, j'ai fait le 2 AVANT)\n\nEt voila, je l'ai fait d'une traite !
