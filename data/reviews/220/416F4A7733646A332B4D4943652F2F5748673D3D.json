If you are looking to purchase this game then allow me to elaborate on how wonderfull this game is and why. The year is 2013 and Half-Life is one of the most beloved and praised series in any video-game related publications. To me is just simply a game that gets mentioned every once in a while, I've played FPS all my life (who hasn't) and recently got into PC gaming so I wen't \"hey what the heck let me validate my PC Player status\" so I dicided  give Half-Life 2 a try (always on the Top 10 PC games of all time)  and oh boy my mind was blown. Now, you have to take into account that this game was developed back in 2004. The level of storytelling is out of this world and back then it was years ahead of its time. Not only is the story intriguing and suspenful ,but, it completely emerges you in the narrative by eliminating cutscenes and demands that you pay attention giving you vital information on what to do next and how the story is evolving. In a time where game developers believe us to be brain dead by putting big markers on screen to the next objective or bombarding the screen with every type of info just so you know and are sure of what you are doing like you have some advance form of ADD, its irritating. When I gazed upon the simplicity of the HUD in HL2 it damn near brought me to tears, it was such a relief. If you didn't catch what to do next in the dialoge don't fret there is no - next objective - pause screen (thank the heavens). The level design (which to say is good or excellent is a huge understatement it's superb) will lead the way foward. There are those who complain about the linearity of the game, yes this is NO Mass Effect when it comes to open level design, but make no mistake, Call Of Duty this is not either. You have small and big areas which present you with various enviromental puzzles in order to progress through the map. They just feel so natural as if they created them-selves, not a guy behind a computer. They also serve as a dristraction from all the gunplay, which points to another thing that HL2 does so well, the PACE, it is flawless just when you are about to be bored of doing something or happen to think you are not being challenge the game will through a new game mechanic like the Gravity Gun or vehicle combat. I could spend my whole life discussing or explaining how great this game is but the truth is that nothing beats the feeling of playing the game and emerging yourself in the world. If you want to experience one of the GEMS of video gaming, nay, entertaiment as a whole buy the game, turn off the lights, raise up the volume and click play.","timestamp_created":1387528448,"timestamp_updated":1387528908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8135458","author":{"steamid":"76561198097262585","num_games_owned":362,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":348,"last_played":1586364117},"language":"russian","review":"эпичная игра)","timestamp_created":1387527822,"timestamp_updated":1387527822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8134100","author":{"steamid":"76561198056832171","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":874,"last_played":1490436005},"language":"english","review":"Half life 3 will be out by the time I get this...","timestamp_created":1387521152,"timestamp_updated":1387521152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8133987","author":{"steamid":"76561198070551640","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":116,"last_played":1387409076},"language":"english","review":"It's a really great game because of the mechanics.

life 2 è uno dei titoli di punta di valve, uscito nel 2004,  questo gioco salta subito all'occhio per via dell'elevato livello grafico e dell'elevata fisica degli oggetti (sfruttata in molte sezioni platform). probabilmente senza aver giocato il primo half life si perderà parte dell'esperienza per due principali motivi: il piacere di riconoscere i personaggi presenti già nel primo capitolo di HF e la mancata conoscenza della trama e del perchè i fatti avvengono, di fatto la trama è un elemento di fondamentale importanza per il completo divertimento. le sezioni che compongono i 13 capitoli sono sempre ben progettate e mai ripetitive vista la presenza di trovate di gameplay sempre diverse e innovative ( si va dal guidare dei veicoli al distruggere mezzi volanti con un lanciarazzi ). inoltre l'esperienza di gioco potrà successivamente essere allungata per via di svariate mod a pagamento e gratis ( alcune aggiungono anche l'online). in conclusione HF2 è un gioco da comprare,

The result was an influential classic that many people consider one of the finest games of all time. While it's perhaps not the literal best game ever made, it's certainly up there, and is worth experiencing at least once.\n\n\nTo begin with, the game has aged remarkably well. It still looks nice (although the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/290930]free Update mod[/url] makes it look that much more better) and plays quite intuitively for a game as old as it is, with much-improved physics over the first game thanks to the Source engine. That alone was a significant advance; even if most of the game's physics puzzles were rudimentary in comparison to later games, the inclusion of a weapon that manipulates physical objects is lauded to this day.\n\nThe actual shooting in this FPS was never revolutionary in and of itself. It's pretty old-school these days what with no aiming down sights, and it has less cool guns than HL1, but it's still fairly satisfying. Valve's masterful grasp of pacing is displayed as enjoyable shooting sections are interstitched with traveling, puzzles and plot scenes - HL2 continues the series tradition of taking place entirely from first-person perspective. One could consider some of the beginning and endgame plot sections to be glorified cutscenes anyway, but that technique is generally used sparingly enough to justify it. It's more of a problem in the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/380/]episodic[/url] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/420]sequels[/url].\n\nThe story pitting Gordon Freeman against the alien dictatorship of the Combine years after the events at Black Mesa has lost a bit of its bite, simply because of the fact it was released in 2004 and was more original back in its day. (Seinfeld has the same problem with its comedy.) The cultural problem, not the alien problem. It's still ultimately engaging; even if the mid-game drags at points, the majority of the game is smartly laid out and enjoyable, displaying considerable variety in both gameplay and tone that was revolutionary when it came out.\n\n\nIf there's criticism to be had of the story, it's that it's basically in the middle of its series. It's a continuation of Half-Life 1 that keeps going until HL2: Episode Two, which itself ends on an unresolved cliffhanger. The characters and story therefore may not be as compelling for some people if they haven't played HL1 and received the context from that game. Valve's continuing decision to eschew traditional cutscenes and give the player absolute control at all times, as well as the lack of spontaneity in combat, means that the game can get tiresome on repeat playthroughs in comparison to HL1.\n\nWhile there's also something to be said for reliving those narrative scenes after years and years of not playing, it ultimately doesn't work quite as well as a narrative vehicle here as it did in the chaotic confines of the original Half-Life, where danger was seemingly around each and every corner. Gordon Freeman as a silent protagonist also doesn't quite work as well in this game, with its individually defined, designed and voice-acted supporting characters, as it did in the original game with its masses of nameless scientists and Barneys.\n\nI'd still urge you to try this if you're a fan of shooters and you haven't already, as these criticisms are ultimately minor in the face of how good the game is overall, and of how influential it was.","timestamp_created":1387324545,"timestamp_updated":1558811774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518294274806976318","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8084411","author":{"steamid":"76561198068137196","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1053,"last_played":1479759139},"language":"english","review":"Buy it!!!","timestamp_created":1387313025,"timestamp_updated":1387313025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8084144","author":{"steamid":"76561197995686503","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2812,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1604,"last_played":1545943322},"language":"english","review":"If you haven't played Half-Life 2 yet, you must.

By far my favorite game. I bought it during the Autumn Sale, downloaded it, and then it just sat there on my desktop for a few weeks. So one Saturday, I was bored so I decided to try it out. The next thing I knew, it was 10 o'clock at night. In one day, it was already my second most played game. I have played it a lot more so far. It's hard to quit. Like really hard.\n\nSound: 9/10\nThe voices are good, but I rate it 9/10 for those who don't speak English because it's only English with no subtitles. The sound effects (guns, explosions, vehicles) are near perfect too. I love it when there's an explosion nearby and everything goes silent except a high pitched noise like it would be in real life.\n\nMusic: 5/10\nSome parts of the game have a good soundtrack, but most parts don't. I usually don't notice the soundtrack so much because it doesn't stand out like I wish it did.\n\nGameplay/content: 10/10\nGreat gameplay. You can run, duck, jump, all 3D controls. With the right mouse, it's extremely easy to switch weapons. There are many types of enemies and a few vehicles you can ride or go against. One helpful thing is that it's made pretty clear which NPC's are allies and which are enemies. In some other similar first-person shooters, I've found it difficult to tell them apart. You mught think that such a good game would lag a lot on a computer that doesn't have a great core processor or graphics card. My computer has neither. But this game doesn't lag at all. It splits the map into different areas, or chapters as the game calls it. Each new area has to load, but the load times aren't long and there is no lag during play.\n\nStory: 9/10\nThe story is long, and has almost no boring parts. It has different aspects that include different enemy groups, and take you through some pretty interesting parts. I only docked a point because it doesn't branch off. I wish it had a couple of different endings that are affected by decisions throughout the game. There are little parts that provide different options, but the outcome is the same.\n\nAnd I saved the best for last.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nBoy do I wish I could rate more than 10. The first thing I noticed when I played the game was the people looked very realistic. They had real ears, noses, eyes, mouths, etc. Their mouths move to the word's they're really saying. The body movement is real. The second thing I noticed as soon as I left the first part was how incredible the details in the walls and floors were. I didn't even have my graphics turned all the way up. When I finally got to an outdoor part, I litterally stopped and said \"wow\" with an open jaw. The building details were incredible. The background was even better. The weather, the landscape, the far out buildings, all of it. Even further into the game, the landscape changed and I though they were even better graphics. I don't know if a young child would be able to tell the game and a TV show apart. The final thing I have to say about the graphics is they blend well. Like I talked about before, each area is continuous. The background and the foreground both blend together so nicely with the next area. This also allows for people to be able to make a map of the entire game because there aren't any part where it skips an area. You can go directly from the beginning to the end and not miss a single blade of grass. \n\nOverall rating: 9.5/10\nI only rated it as 9.5 because the soundtrack isn't good. The gameplay, content, story, and sound excel. The graphics left me speechless. But every game needs a good soundtrack. Especially one as good as this. Perhaps a DLC could fix that? Disregarding the music, This game is as perfect as games come. If you are looking for a game with good sound effects, this is your game. If you are obsessed with good stories, get this game. If you like great graphics, why don't you have this game yet? But if you only look for the soundtrack, there are better games. But you should still get it. No matter what you should get it. So why are you still reading? You should be buying, downloading, or even better, playing this game! Go on! Hurry! I promise it'll change your life. Or Half-Life rather.","timestamp_created":1387145073,"timestamp_updated":1387145073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8057782","author":{"steamid":"76561198087531751","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":64,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1544131839},"language":"english","review":"Thsi is a Single Player FPS with a long story and a bunch of steam game mods for it i totally reccomend this game, YOU CAN EVEN RUN IT ON A BAD PC WITHOUT LAG!!!","timestamp_created":1387132065,"timestamp_updated":1387132065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8057572","author":{"steamid":"76561198061850573","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":2182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":745,"last_played":1555847731},"language":"english","review":"This game, my friends told me to get it and play it so many times, and i eventually did.
