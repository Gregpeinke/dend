Gordon e Alyx são resgatados pelos Vortigauns, que de alguma forma parecem ter conseguido tanto salvá-los da explosão do reator quanto da influência do G-Man. \n\nO jogo trás algumas respostas às duvidas deixadas em jogos anteriores mas também outros novos mistérios, com uma trama bem encaixada e instigante.\n\nQuanto a história, após a explosão do reator, a cidadela sofreu graves avarias e explodirá deixando destruição no raio de quilômetros, de forma que não seria possível escapar em tempo hábil. Desta maneira, a única chance de sobrevivência seria entrar mais a fundo na construção e retardar sua explosão.\n\nNão há praticamente nenhuma novidade no jogo em relação ao HL2, com apenas alguns inimigos novos e uma sutil melhoria gráfica, além de agora contarmos com Alyx nos auxiliando durante quase todas as fases do jogo.\n\nDe qualquer forma, apesar de não trazer novidades, esta expansão é praticamente obrigatória para quem jogou o HL2, pois além de complementar a história, mantém o mesmo padrão altíssimo de qualidade do jogo anterior.

This game is the continuation of Half-Life 2, and once again we take control of Gordon Freeman on his unstoppable killing spree.\n\nWhile Episode One is very short in comparison to Half-Life 2, it still holds the same level of quality in terms of gameplay. The same characters are there, and a few new enemies and mechanics are introduced. None of this is exactly game-changing, yet it does keep it fresh. The story lacks a little, which is mainly due to the lenght of the game.\n\nThere isn't much to say for Episode One that hasn't already been said for Half-Life 2. While it is fun to fight alongside Alyx, it doesn't quite make up for the length of it. If purchased through the Orange Box, it isn't much of a problem.\nOverall, definitely worth playing, but only as part of the series, and not on its own.","timestamp_created":1417848050,"timestamp_updated":1417848050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515503883361816406","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13242640","author":{"steamid":"76561198063791563","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":394,"last_played":1639184770},"language":"english","review":"Cool extension to original Half-Life 2.
