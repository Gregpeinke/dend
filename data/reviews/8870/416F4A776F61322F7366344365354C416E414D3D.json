Logo que chegamos na cidade flutuante de Columbia, ficamos impressionados com sua beleza steampunk: é tudo muito cheio de vida, com jardins e beija flores, pessoas se divertindo no festival com barraquinhas de comidas e brincadeiras usando trajes de época, cantando, zepelins voando em volta da cidade, máquinas à vapor funcionando, é uma ambientação sensacional. As partes sombrias da cidade não são tão escuras, o jogo no geral é bem claro, mas são nestes lugares que vc consegue sentir a verdadeira essência sombria da história, dá pra sentir o clima perverso apenas observando, a direção de arte soube passar muito bem um sentimento através do visual. É um daqueles jogos que vc fica parado por vários minutos só admirando os detalhes. Os gráficos tem uma pegada levemente cartoonizada, principalmente nos NPCs, e são muito bonitos. Atenção especial à personagem Elizabeth, que tem ótimas expressões faciais de acordo com a situação, e interage com várias coisas do cenário E É MARAVILHOSA. Elizabeth é perfeita. \n\n=== Requisitos ===\n🔲 Qualquer coisa que conduza energia\n🔲 Uma calculadora com 1 pilha\n🔲 Um PC qualquer sem placa de vídeo / Um celular\n✅ PC de entrada \n🔲 PC Gamer\n🔲 PC da NASA\n🔲 PC com I9 11900k + 4x Rtx 3090 ligadas numa usina nuclear \n\n\n=== Otimização ===\n🔲 PC da Nasa rodando em 2 fps tudo bugado e crashando, injogável\n🔲 As vezes dá pra jogar, mas é muito instável\n🔲 Tem que fazer umas gambiarras no Windows pra conseguir abrir mas roda\n🔲 Dá umas dropadas de fps vez em quando\n🔲 Algumas configurações gráficas derrubam o desempenho\n🔲 Roda liso, condiz com o hardware necessário\n🔲 Bem otimizado\n✅ Jogo muito bonito rodando liso em PC fraco\n\nOBS: O jogo praticamente não tem opções gráficas avançadas. Você não pode alterar sombras, serrilhado, texturas etc individualmente, apenas escolher uma pré-definição e a resolução, mas o jogo roda tão liso que não tem necessidade.\n\n=== História ===\n🔲 História? que história?\n🔲 Rasparam a bunda no teclado e fizeram uma história\n🔲 Tem que se esforçar pra gostar\n🔲 Tem uma história bacana\n🔲 Uma história digna de prestar atenção\n✅ Feita pelo Tolkien (prepare seus lenços)\n✅ Platão escreveu junto com Machado de Assis e virou novela das 21h.\n\nOBS: Assim como qualquer BioShock, este também tem uma história um pouco complicada de entender, mas é porque o assunto que ela trata é um assunto complicado. O protagonista Booker DeWitt recebe a missão de resgatar uma garota presa em uma torre guardada por um pássaro putasso afim de quitar suas dívidas, mas chegando lá se depara com uma população extremamente religiosa e fiel ao pastor local que já sabia da sua chegada, e o declara inimigo público de Columbia, o que o leva à descobrir os reais motivos de estar na cidade, e revelações sobre o passado dos personagens. O jogo ainda possui algum alívio cômico em alguns momentos com certos personagens. É muito difícil dizer alguma coisa sem soltar um spoiler, qualquer coisa é spoiler quando se trata de BioShock. BioShock Infinite conta a sua história de uma forma muuuito mais intuitiva do que os seus antecessores, e o protagonista não é  mudo, ele fala e tem rosto. E que história emocionante, senhores... Chorei no final fodase KEKW \nSaudades da Elizabeth, vô rejogarkkkkkkkkk\n\nOBS2: Não precisa jogar BioShock 1 e 2 pra jogar o Infinite, é uma história separada (tem algumas ligaçõezinhas mas é irrelevante), mas é recomendado que jogue pra entender o \"clima\" e alguns assuntos do jogo. MAAAASSSSS se você pretende jogar a expansão Burial at Sea, aí sim você tem que jogar os jogos anteriores, pois ela traz uma conexão com eles.\n\n=== Jogabilidade ===\n🔲 Precisa de dois dedos pra jogar (é simples)\n🔲 4 dedos pra ser específico\n✅ Jogabilidade bacana\n🔲 Precisa ser um polvo pra conseguir usar todos os botões\n🔲 Anda no Esc e pula no Ç com delay de 3 segundos\n\n\n=== Complexidade ===\n🔲 Jogo da velha é mais complexo\n✅ Fácil de entender\n🔲 Fácil de aprender, difícil de dominar\n🔲 É daqueles jogos que as pessoas ficam estudando\n🔲 Precisa de no mínimo 2 doutorados\n\n\n=== Dificuldade ===\n✅ Você escolhe a dificuldade\n🔲 Seu cachorro consegue\n🔲 Da pra zerar com uma batata de controle\n✅ Fácil\n🔲 Médio\n🔲 Alta\n🔲 Dark Souls\n🔲 Você precisa de reflexos instantâneos e 4 mãos\n\nOBS: Pode aumentar a dificuldade sem dó, é bem de boa matar os inimigos. Mas se vc quer aproveitar a ambientação e a história, o jogo fica bem legal no médio tbm.\n\n=== Tempo de jogo ===\n🔲 Não se aplica\n🔲 Da jogar enquanto ouve 1 música\n🔲 5h  ~ 10h\n✅ 10h ~ 20h\n🔲 20h ~ 30h\n🔲 30h ~ 40h\n🔲 40h ~ 50h\n🔲 50h ~ 60h\n🔲 60h ~ 70h\n🔲 70h ~ 80h\n🔲 80h ~ 90h\n🔲 90h ~ 100h +++\n🔲 Você começa, seu neto termina\n\n\n=== Efeitos Sonoros ===\n🔲 Beep\n🔲 Cachorros miam e gatos latem \n🔲 Sons ok, mas com baixa definição\n🔲 Aceitável\n🔲 Bons\n✅ Excelente\n\n\n=== Musicas / Soundtrack ===\n🔲 Não Possui\n🔲 É melhor jogar no mudo\n🔲 Tem 1 música que repete o jogo inteiro\n🔲 Aceitável\n🔲 Os caras capricharam\n🔲 Baixe a playlist pra escutar no ônibus\n✅ Mozart escreveu junto com Beethoven, toque o tema no seu casamento\n\nOBS: Diferente dos outros BioShocks, aqui a trilha sonora toca quase o tempo todo. Sempre tem alguma vitrola, auto-falante, ou pessoas cantando em algum lugar. Você achou que \"toque o tema no seu casamento\" era só pra análise ficar engraçada? Nesse caso é pra tocar mesmo, as músicas são maravilhosas. No geral são músicas de época, bem românticas e as vezes instrumentais; um jazz de ambiente. E com aquele chuviscado de som antigo, vc se sente dentro do jogo.\n\n=== Bugs ===\n✅ Nunca vi nenhum\n🔲 Quase nunca buga\n🔲 Bugs engraçados\n🔲 Pequenos bugs\n🔲 Pode ficar irritante\n🔲 Pode estragar a gameplay\n🔲 Parece até uma lâmpada acesa cheia de inseto\n\n\n=== Publico ===\n🔲 Crianças\n✅ Adolescentes\n✅ Adultos\n🔲 Moradores do porão da mãe que comem maionese\n🔲 Tudo e todos\n\n\n=== Compensa Comprar? ===\n🔲 IT'S FREE\n🔲 Preço justo\n🔲 Compre se tiver dinheiro sobrando\n✅ Espere uma promoção\n🔲 Caro demais não recomendo\n🔲 Mais fácil você queimar seu dinheiro\n\nOBS: O preço cheio é bem caro, mas eventualmente acontecem promoções muito boas de BioShock: The Collection, que inclui todos os BioShocks + todas as suas DLCs por um preço muito bom, e vale cada centavo.\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\n✅ Não Possui\n🔲 Opcional\n🔲 Deserto\n🔲 Meia dúzia de gatos pingados\n🔲 Razoavelmente Ativo\n🔲 Bastante Ativo\n🔲 Maior que torcida do Flamengo\n🔲 Poderíamos colonizar um Planeta inteiro\n\n\n=== Fator Replay ===\n🔲 Experiência de uma vez só\n🔲 Sozinho não fica tão legal, mas com amigos é divertido\n✅ É um jogo legal pra rejogar depois de uns meses/anos\n✅ Se comprar DLC vale a pena\n🔲 MODS MODS MUITOS MODS\n🔲 Infinitamente\n\n\n=== Conclusão ===\n\nBioShock Infinite é simplesmente um dos jogos mais maravilhosos que eu já tive o prazer de jogar. Seus personagens cativantes, uma história muito bem escrita e emocionante, gameplay fluida, divertida e viciante, ambientação excepcional, Elizabeth, gráficos bonitos, trilha sonora que se encaixa perfeitamente, é tudo muito bem feito. Até as conquistas são legais de ficar caçando, pra quem gosta de platinar. Seu único pecado é durar tão pouco, mas acredito que se o jogo fosse maior poderia comprometer a história, que com certeza é o segundo ponto mais forte do jogo (porque o primeiro é a Elizabeth. Todo mundo que já jogou ficou apaixonado por ela, vc tá me julgando agora mas depois que jogar vai entender).\nBioShock Infinite é um daqueles jogos que, para quem prioriza boas histórias, vai fazer parte de sua vida e provavelmente retornará anos depois com um sentimento de nostalgia. E para quem prioriza a gameplay, é um jogo divertido de meter bala nos inimigos e soltar poderzinho com uns efeitos legais em lugares bonitos. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaudades da Elizabeth, vou rejogar","timestamp_created":1642492112,"timestamp_updated":1642496231,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.767113626003265381","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108252421","author":{"steamid":"76561198974868656","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":898,"last_played":1644125469},"language":"english","review":"this game is just awesome\n","timestamp_created":1642489005,"timestamp_updated":1642489005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108251431","author":{"steamid":"76561198321186672","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":697,"last_played":1642487103},"language":"english","review":"mindfuck over mindfuck play the dlc especially if you enjoyed bioshock 1 omfg\n","timestamp_created":1642487127,"timestamp_updated":1642487127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108247731","author":{"steamid":"76561199182188153","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":108,"last_played":1642513278},"language":"schinese","review":"童话般的世界，没想到还有血腥的场面。彦祖，买吧","timestamp_created":1642480534,"timestamp_updated":1642480534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108242762","author":{"steamid":"76561199220813951","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":379,"last_played":1642857643},"language":"english","review":"only bioshock that hasn't crashed on me yet","timestamp_created":1642472579,"timestamp_updated":1642472579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108241973","author":{"steamid":"76561198232037560","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":341,"last_played":1642643245},"language":"schinese","review":"GOOD","timestamp_created":1642471429,"timestamp_updated":1642471429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108240127","author":{"steamid":"76561199114043774","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":345,"last_played":1649455486},"language":"english","review":"This Game is an 10/10 for me","timestamp_created":1642468608,"timestamp_updated":1642468608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108239343","author":{"steamid":"76561198451080398","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":941,"last_played":1642467215},"language":"english","review":"wow i played all the bioshock and they all come to this one.

I took the time recently to go through the Bioshock collection including Minerva's Den and was pleasantly surprised at the quality and care that was taken to ensure that the first two games in the series were as good as they could be. Then I got to this game and was unpleasantly let down HARD. I do not understand the amount of people who played the first two games including Minerva's Den in their entirety and then get to this game and think this game is as good or even BETTER than it's predecessors, it ASTOUNDS me beyond belief. Even if you try to view this game as a standalone it's subpar at best. I find it hard to believe anyone with a modicum of brain function can sit through this and genuinely say they enjoyed this snoozefest. I'll start with the gameplay first because trying to wrap my head around the story and put it into words right now on how absolutely horrendous and brain hemorrhaging it is after finishing it recently will strain my patience more so than it already was while playing this dumpster fire of a game.\n\nGameplay: For starters, This is LITERALLY a COD campaign, you are paying for a COD campaign with the Bioshock title slapped on it. Everything about the first two games is thrown right out the window, you no longer have your own guns that you can carry with you to change on the fly with unique ammo types meant to deal with different enemy types, instead you're forced to scavenge for other guns when you inevitably run out of ammo. Although, to be fair, I did carry the same carbine and sniper up until about the end of Comstock's house chapter. Did I mention there's a TWO weapon limit by the way? As opposed to the collection of weapons you carried in the first two and their versatility in combat. The weapon upgrades also work differently in this game and honestly for the worse. I don't mind not being to upgrade all the weapons but there are thirteen weapons in this game each having four upgrades to go through, a lot of them being completely useless as well because they either don't really make a difference because the gun was already fine without it or you will just never use that gun. I never once, aside from times where I just wanted to test them out, used the Vox weapons because they are downgrades of the weapons used by the Founders' soldiers. You find yourself going through the game buying ammo for the two weapons you have at every vending machine you see or swapping between the same four weapons because the other weapons are just that bad and not worth using. The vigors are this game's version of plasmids but honestly they're a downgrade as well, I found myself using the flame vigor the most because the counterparts for everything else was so completely garbage and useless in the middle of combat outside of a few situational moments or just used up too much of your salts to actually be effective. You also don't carry your own medkits or salts to recharge your vigor uses, instead you have to rely on drops scattered around an area or wait for Elizabeth to see that you're low and hopefully throw you the item you need the most. I almost forgot to mention the shield. I played on medium so I didn't really see a big problem with it. It's pretty insignificant without the infusion upgrades and it's really just a buffer between your health getting shredded instantly but I've heard on hard it's pretty much useless and just a way to take a single bullet while you poke out of cover to shoot at enemies and repeat the process until everything on the screen is dead. This game's equivalent to gene tonics was pretty underwhelming as well and it takes the form of \"gear\" which you can only equip four of at a time in certain slots for each. Your health, salt and shield upgrades take form in infusions which are scattered around the map and pretty hard to miss if you aren't exploring the already limited map or can't use your brain and you can fully max two out of three upgrades. Truthfully, salt upgrades are useless and you should be going for health and shield upgrades first. \n\nStory: Honestly, I don't even want to get in depth with the story, just watch an unbiased review, my patience for this game has been expended. This story is full of plot holes and unanswered questions lined with pseudo-intellectualism, convoluted dimension hopping and time travel. It physically hurts my brain to even think about it's so obnoxious, it amazes me a group of people sat down and decided this was the best story they could come up with. It feels the need to beat you over the head with the story at every turn instead of letting the world tell the story itself like in the first two. There are  points in the game where Elizabeth has to lockpick a door with a lock that doesn't even need to have a lock on it and is literally only there so the game can dump exposition on you, I called them exposition doors. In fact, it isn't even always doors, the game will just randomly stop you from playing the game to dump some more of the story on you. You can think about the story and the events that happen for a few seconds and it falls apart at the seams.\n\nAs for the story DLC, it is absolutely a slog to push yourself through. The Burial at Sea EP 1 plays basically the same as the base game except you can carry more than 1 gun for whatever reason now, that being said it is still incredibly boring and almost feels like Bioshock 1 again but falls flat on it's face for almost every reason the base game did. EP 2 however is a STEALTH SECTION, the ENTIRE GAME is a STEALTH SECTION and it is as scuffed as it sounds. This DLC also retcons the entire series, so if you enjoyed the world and story of the first two games and all they that stood for, this DLC is here to bring that crashing down for you.\n\nThis game and it's DLC are an absolute bastardization of this series. I cannot express this enough that this game is not even worth getting on sale, save your money for something else and just play the first two games or watch someone else play through this dog vomit. Please, don't touch this game with a 10 ft pole. I wouldn't even wish this game on my worst enemy.","timestamp_created":1642402049,"timestamp_updated":1659232051,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490489274263381958","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108188984","author":{"steamid":"76561198980086692","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":488,"last_played":1642407554},"language":"schinese","review":"世界万千美好，不及伊丽莎白。生于大地，长在天空，长眠海底","timestamp_created":1642401640,"timestamp_updated":1642401640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":47,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.771719038486480713","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108188743","author":{"steamid":"76561198286060438","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1071,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":916,"last_played":1642684391},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏体验非常棒，根本停不下来一个通宵直接拿下\n和楼上推荐的一样主升狙击一枪一个不开镜也准的出奇.打到后期完全没问题完全不用担心弹药，你的小棉袄靠谱的不行\n不要再往下翻评论啦，买吧不会后悔的\n记得去B站找简中.非常好找\n不说了，我去找伊丽莎白跳舞了","timestamp_created":1642401243,"timestamp_updated":1642401243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108188728","author":{"steamid":"76561198121048580","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":887,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":887,"last_played":1465558058},"language":"tchinese","review":"跟很多遊戲比起來，伊莉莎白NPC確實在戰鬥的時候一點都不惱人。","timestamp_created":1642401213,"timestamp_updated":1642401518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108188727","author":{"steamid":"76561198946980777","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1623,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":894,"last_played":1645316864},"language":"english","review":"great game","timestamp_created":1642401210,"timestamp_updated":1642401210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108186907","author":{"steamid":"76561199229411988","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":380,"last_played":1651986626},"language":"english","review":"this games fucking crazy","timestamp_created":1642398174,"timestamp_updated":1642398174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108186292","author":{"steamid":"76561198044170886","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1059,"last_played":1365145200},"language":"english","review":"trash","timestamp_created":1642397132,"timestamp_updated":1642397132,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.428571403026580811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108186203","author":{"steamid":"76561198961820225","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":325,"last_played":1642497976},"language":"schinese","review":"en","timestamp_created":1642396990,"timestamp_updated":1642396990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108184904","author":{"steamid":"76561198441282563","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":1324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1315,"last_played":1642422014},"language":"schinese","review":"最后一句台词i both可以说是解答了一切，当之无愧的“第九艺术”","timestamp_created":1642394936,"timestamp_updated":1642394936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108184502","author":{"steamid":"76561198064201359","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":740,"last_played":1637974607},"language":"english","review":"As a huge fan of the first two Bioshock games + Minerva's Den, Bioshock Infinite is an enigma in terms of story and gameplay. It truly boggles my mind that 8-9 years after it's initial release the game has an overall overwhelmingly positive rating on Steam. Each time I've played Bioshock 1, Bioshock 2, and Minerva's Den, I've enjoyed myself thoroughly. Yeah sometimes the flaws are more noticeable on subsequent playthroughs, but those flaws did not detract from my overall enjoyment of those games. Bioshock Infinite, however, has only gotten worse and worse with each subsequent playthrough, and with Burial at Sea, just shits on the legacy of the first two games and what they stood for.\n\nThe gameplay for Infinite is a downgrade in every aspect imaginable. Those who have played through all three Bioshock games and claim that Infinite has the best gameplay out of all of them, respectfully, you guys are on drugs. First off, Infinite has a shield system and two weapon limit. That is garbage. Here's why.\n\nIn the first two bioshock games, you carried 8 weapons, 7 of which can have multiple ammo types. Those games wanted you to not only use all your weapons at your disposal, but to experiment and see which ammo type is best against certain enemies (although things like armor piercing rounds and anti-personnel rounds are self-explanatory). In Infinite, being limited to two weapons GREATLY reduces the need to experiment and vary your play style. Not only that, but when you run out of ammo, you are forced to pick up weapons off the ground. Why is this a bad thing? Well, Infinite carries over the weapon upgrade system from the previous games. But again, you're limited to two God damn weapons. So, when you run out of ammo for your good weapons, you have to pick up weapons that are, more often than not, not upgraded and therefore completely useless in combat. This issue is compounded on Hard and 1999 modes, where enemies are incredibly spongy, while you are a wet noddle get shot at in multiple directions.\n\nOn top of all that, the weapon pool is plagued with useless variants of the base weapons, so more often than not, you're gonna be holding onto two, maybe 3 or four weapons MAX for the entirety of the game. And when you run out of ammo, tough shit. You either have to wait for Elizabeth's dumb AI to hand you ammo, or pick up an UNUPGRADED gun off an enemy and pray you can survive until the end of the encounter. Why limit the player to two weapons, all the while having the weapon pool so bloated that half the time defeated enemies won't even drop ammo for the guns you are carrying? \n\nTo emphasize how much even further of a downgrade the gameplay is, the shield system is some of the worst I've seen. Even on normal difficulty, the shield might as well be made of paper. And the upgrades you find over the course of the game do not help in making it useful, as by the end of the game even at max upgrades, the shield BARELY takes any damage for the player. Why not give the player extra med packs and salts like in the first two game? I know the game was made around the time CoD was huge, but to go so far as to copy it's mechanics to the detriment of the gameplay is so asinine.\n\nThe vigors in the game are also un-inspired. I'm not gonna pretend the plasmids in Bioshock 1 and 2 were masterpieces, some of them were kinda useless and others fell into the same type of attack. But it's like they didn't even try with Infinite. Out of the 8 vigors the player will use, 4 of them are stuns. At the very least in the first two games, you aren't required to get all plasmids and have them equipped. In Infinite, since all 8 are equipped at once, the overlap is more noticeable.\n\nAnd the story... oh boy. I truthfully believe Ken Levine just said \"screw it\" halfway through development and just gave up. With the way the story plays out, you'd think it was written by a bunch of monkeys wielding typewriters. The story in the first game was something special, and while the 2nd game's story was weaker, it was still a very good, more personal story, with Minerva's Den being the peak of the series for me. Infinite's story was just a bunch of smoke and mirrors, with the story writers waving their hands in front of the player's face while shoving a bunch of pseudo-science down their throat. It tries to be deep and complex, but if you even THINK about the story for more than a second it completely falls apart. Hell, the ending of the base game was such a colossal mess that Burial at Sea Episodes 1 & 2 were made to circumvent the huge, gaping plothole it made. We will get to that plot hole later.\n\nYeah, at first the story is simple enough, Booker is sent to Columbia to wipe his gambling debt, and all he has to do is bring Elizabeth back with him. However, the moment the player goes through Fink Industries and open another tear into an alternate timeline is where the story drops HARD. One mission to find a gunsmith for a rebel faction single-handedly ruined the game's story, as Booker and Elizabeth open not one but TWO tears into two alternate timelines. Even then, the timeline the story falls into, where Booker is a martyr for the Vox Populi, also doesn't make sense because Comstock, the villain in this game, somehow KNOWS Booker and Elizabeth, even though they were from another timeline. Hell, Comstock doesn't even mention his Elizabeth from his timeline, so like, HUH???\n\nAnd the ending, OH BOY. The ending of this god forsaken game states that there are infinite universes with infinite possibilities. \"Constants and variables.\" Yeah, infinite universes, bit of an asspull, but that's not all. Elizabeth shows Booker all of the events that has happened prior to the start of the game, him retaining a huge gambling debt, him selling his daughter, Anna (A.K.A Elizabeth), to Comstock, etc. Elizabeth then concludes that Comstock and Booker are one in the same, but in alternate timelines. The cutoff point was when Booker attends a baptism to wash away the guilt he's been carrying with him from the Wounded Knee Massacre. So, two timelines, two Bookers. Ok, simple enough. Elizabeth also concludes that to prevent Comstock from ever existing, the original Booker (the player) must die so that those timelines and universes do not come to be. This would make sense... if the game wasn't shoving the idea of MULTIPLE UNIVERSES down your throat for the duration of the ending. There is no way killing ONE Booker off can erase Comstock's existence, when the GAME ITSELF says \"Hey, there an INFINITE amount of you Booker.\" It's such a slap in the face to the player's intelligence, this whole story is a slap in the face in general. Burial At Sea was made because the dev team knew how much a gaping plothole the base game's ending made, and how couldn't they with the number of reviews on the internet stating how much of a mess it was.\n\nI've had this game in the back of my mind ever since it first released. I liked it when I first played it, but I definitely thought it was a downgrade compared to the first two. Now? I absolutely loathe this game. I don't know how people can play the first two Bioshock games, then play this one and say it's the best. I mentioned Ken Levine in this review, and here I go again. A lot of the development issues Infinite has faced was due to him removing a lot of material from the game, a lot of cut ideas were lost to time and were only shown off in the few gameplay demos before release. Since Infinite, he's the head of his own game development team. And sincerely, I am GLAD he is not part of the development for the rumored Bioshock 4. And considering the recent controversy with him and how he's handling his dev team, I am praying Bioshock 4 will bring back what I loved from the first two games and leave Infinite behind for what it is: a massive disappointment and a tumor on the Shock series.","timestamp_created":1642394327,"timestamp_updated":1642394327,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514606714248657227","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108182704","author":{"steamid":"76561198882130134","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":379,"last_played":1644288526},"language":"english","review":"awesome game, get it now","timestamp_created":1642391703,"timestamp_updated":1642391703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108182516","author":{"steamid":"76561198205588427","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":2690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2649,"last_played":1644245666},"language":"schinese","review":"生化奇兵系列无疑是神作，身为中国人，听见黄皮斜眼的羞辱就挺气愤的。但是无可奈何，落后要挨打，史书胜者写，亘古不变的道理。","timestamp_created":1642391420,"timestamp_updated":1642392051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108181342","author":{"steamid":"76561198360574769","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":817,"last_played":1646225353},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая игра в которую я когда либо играл","timestamp_created":1642389644,"timestamp_updated":1642389644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587347924709320068","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108177864","author":{"steamid":"76561198872059836","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":2762,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2762,"last_played":1642286759},"language":"spanish","review":" [i] Bring us the girl, and wipe away the dept [/i]","timestamp_created":1642384561,"timestamp_updated":1642384561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108176663","author":{"steamid":"76561198448680334","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":945,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":945,"last_played":1642382477},"language":"russian","review":"Если вам стало скучно,если вы хотите новых эмоций.

I would highly recommend both the main game and the DLC.","timestamp_created":1642348042,"timestamp_updated":1642348042,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108142974","author":{"steamid":"76561198206962280","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":661,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1642348095},"language":"schinese","review":"随着剧情发展有心理准备但还是被结局震撼到，简直了，就像看了一场深入人心的电影久久难以忘怀。","timestamp_created":1642346528,"timestamp_updated":1642346528,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108140562","author":{"steamid":"76561198359653438","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":380,"last_played":1643200340},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏都打不开了，玩个屁","timestamp_created":1642344234,"timestamp_updated":1642344234,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.45267486572265625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108139835","author":{"steamid":"76561198042987636","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":664,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1652518934},"language":"koreana","review":"여러 게임들을 하다보면 어느덧 익숙한 게임들에만 관심을 가지고 새로운 게임은 어째서인지 설렘과 기대감은 어디간 듯 거부감과 부담감을 먼저 갖게 되는 때가 있다\n그렇게 익숙하던 게임들에선 지루함이 생기고 새로 할 게임들에선 거부감을 느껴 방황하던 나에게 이 게임은 날 전적으로 부정하듯이 미친듯한 몰입감을 선사해주었다\n아예 새로운 스토리의 게임을 하고 있음에도 곧 잘 읽히는 스토리와 같이 동행하는 엘리자베스의 존재는 소위 말하는 예전 게임, 옛날 게임이라는 느낌이 든다 한들 이를 충분히 무마시키기에 충분했다\n비록 80%세일해서 주말 날잡아 구매해 플레이 했지만 이 정도의 완성도와 스토리 몰입감임을 알았다면 정가로 구매해도 전혀 아깝지 않을 것 같다","timestamp_created":1642343562,"timestamp_updated":1642343562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108135629","author":{"steamid":"76561198882292948","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":480,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":480,"last_played":1642293592},"language":"russian","review":"Энергетики вредят вашему здоровью.","timestamp_created":1642339252,"timestamp_updated":1642339252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108134699","author":{"steamid":"76561199092753250","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1027,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1645782793},"language":"schinese","review":"意犹未尽，太棒了\n","timestamp_created":1642338282,"timestamp_updated":1642338282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoa2/sf4Ce5LAnAM="}
