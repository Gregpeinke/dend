Read on to find out why.\n\n---\n\n\"Half Life: Blue Shift\", a Gearbox Software expansion to Valve's debut title \"Half Life\", is the first thing I've seen in quite some time to leave me completely unsure how to feel about it.\n\nOn the one hand, it's not a bad game per sé. It's got generally the same gameplay one comes to love playing \"Half Life\", it's got the same gimmick of remaining in full control of the player character, this time around a security guard named Barney Calhoun rather than Dr. Freeman, throughout the entire game with no cutscenes, and it provides a unique perspective on the Black Mesa Incident we haven't seen before in \"Half Life\" nor in Gearbox Software's previous expansion pack \"Opposing Force\".\n\nThese all sound like good things, but there's a wide variety of bad things about the game as well. Firstly, it's too short. Because I'm a terrible gamer it took me about 4 hours to complete, but it only takes most people about 3 hours. None of the new weapons introduced in \"Opposing Force\" return, many of the weapons from the original \"Half Life\" don't return, including the iconic Crossbow. Throughout most of the game, the only enemies players can expect to run into are headcrabs, vortigaunts, barnacles, houndeyes, and HECU soldiers. While other enemies such as bullsquids and alien grunts will occasionally appear, at no point in his adventure will Barney Calhoun encounter zombies of any kind, Black Ops personnel, or any of the new enemies introduced in \"Opposing Force\". Alien controllers will appear only once, during Calhoun's brief stay on the borderworld of Xen. In a truly shocking display of pure laziness, there isn't even a final boss. Bear in mind here I'm not saying the game failed to introduce an original final boss and simply recycled one of the old ones, which would still be bad but forgivable, I'm saying there literally is no final boss; the entire grand finale is literally just pressing some buttons. In lieu of any kind of variety in enemy encounters (or even enemies themselves), players can expect at least one headcrab to be hiding behind EVERY corner and inside EVERY wooden box. I mean that, by the way; no matter how strapped for ammo you are, break wooden boxes at your own risk.\n\nEnemies aside, the story is weak and uninteresting. Without spoiling anything (although there's hardly anything to spoil), the basic plot is that Calhoun must help the Black Mesa scientists execute a hare-brained plan to teleport outside the doomed research facility. This heavily simplistic story is relayed to the player exclusively through lengthy bouts of expository dialogue from random NPCs whom one couldn't be blamed for wanting to kill rather than listen to. Unfortunately, one of these NPCs cannot be killed as he is an essential character to the story who, at one point, must be escorted by the player to his destination, making \"Blue Shift\" the first \"Half Life\" game to feature an escort mission. Expository dialogue, even in excess, can be forgivable if the story is interesting, but here, it just isn't. Again, it's simple and boring.\n\nAll of that being said, though, is it really that bad? Sure, the story and the enemies are both overly simplified, but is this really that much of a problem in such a short game? Herein lies my dilemma in determining what I think of this game.

This is not watched, but the faces of the characters look like as realistic. Unfortunately this Supplement the short of all that upsetting. Even more upset that the boss is at the end of the game, and indeed they are not. The ending was very easy when compared with OF. \n\nBut still have to go, if you want to know more who is this Barney. Because many started playing HL is the second part of the game and asked the questions: \"Who is this ?\",\"From where is he ?\". \n\nBeer 7 out of 10.\n\n(Русский)\nБесстрашный коп !\n\nНе самое лучшее, но и не самое худшее дополнение. Сюжет рассказывает нам про интересного персонажа Барни, которому нужно держать контроль в Чёрной Мезе и служить закону. Главная цель сбежать с Чёрной Мезы, но и не только вам одному, но и профессорам которым вы будете помогать что бы свалить всем вместе с этого страшного места. Сюжетные моменты раскрывают обрывками, а хотелось бы побольше. \n\nНе совсем то чего я ожидал, но получилось средне. Изменений никаких нет, разве что теперь ваши жизни и т.д. показываются синим цветом, ну и текстуры может каплю сделали получше и то не факт. К этому не присматривался, но лица персонажей выглядят вроде бы как реалистичнее. К сожалению это дополнение самое короткое из всех, что огорчает. Еще больше всего расстроило то что босса нет в конце игры, да и вообще их нет. Концовка получилась очень легкой если сравнить с OF. \n\nНо все же пройти надо, если вы хотите узнать поподробнее кто такой Барни. Ибо многие начинали играть в HL именно со второй части игры и задавали вопросы: \"Кто же это ?\",\"От куда он ?\". \n\n7 пива из 10.","timestamp_created":1470406469,"timestamp_updated":1470406469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24722962","author":{"steamid":"76561198245636438","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1470344880},"language":"brazilian","review":"Contando a história dos seguranças da Black Mesa, muito bacana..","timestamp_created":1470393368,"timestamp_updated":1470393368,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24705387","author":{"steamid":"76561198064122960","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":142,"last_played":1455380392},"language":"czech","review":"Pecka !\nHalf Life, za sekuriťáka (Barneyho).\nNečekat, KUPOVAT !","timestamp_created":1470305769,"timestamp_updated":1488018318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500050485134124756","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24693566","author":{"steamid":"76561198183087631","num_games_owned":1016,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":224,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":224,"last_played":1447780096},"language":"turkish","review":"Half Life efsanesinin gizli kahramanlarından Barney reyizimizin gözünden Black Mesa faciasına tanıklık ediyoruz bu oyunda.Zaman çizelgesi olarak direk 1. oyunla aynı anda Gordon Freeman'ın dışında ortalıkta başka neler olup bittiğini, aslında Gordon Freeman dışında başka gizli kahramanlarında olduğunu görüyoruz.

I only feel compelled to write this review because Blue Shift was so underwhelming compared to the original and the expansion. It has half as many weapons as either previous game but none of the new, charming weapons found in OF. Though it includes a few decent Half-Life style physics puzzles, boring and frustrating filler sections bury the good parts. \n\nTo start with, there is just too much exposition comprised of unnecessary Easter eggs winking at the original or the expansion. For a 2.5 hour long game, the 20-30 minute exposition adds nothing by retracing the steps of the original. The expansion further wastes time with long NPC dialogue sections that consist mostly of pointless techno-babble which does nothing to flesh out or expand the Half-Life universe. The game also contains a needlessly long NPC escort portion chock full of pathing bugs. At the end of the game, the same NPC leads the player through another pointlessly long Simon-says segment with nothing to do but press a button every minute or so.\n\nWhen the action actually happens, the game frustrates by leading the player down long, maze-like corridors with headcrabs behind every box, rock, and corner. Fights with soldier-type enemies similarly become frustrating because the game throws so many at the player at once. Combined with their high ridiculously high health pool (a problem shared with the original), the player spends long stretches shooting at enemies who won't seem to die and who won't stop coming. By contrast, fights with alien enemies simply pit the player against easily dispatched pairs or triples of Vortigaunts or Houndeyes. The most difficult enemies are a few grunts. None of the new, difficult enemies introduced in OF appear.\n\nAs a whole, the expansion plays more like a fan made bonus level relying exclusively on existing game assets. It lacks the polish and clever moments of the original and the sci-fi schlock charm of the OF expansion. The player learns nothing new about the Half-Life universe that the original had not already covered. As a whole, Blue Shift adds nothing to the Half-Life experience except for a few new short, frustrating levels. It might as well be skipped even if you picked it up as part of the anthology.","timestamp_created":1469839807,"timestamp_updated":1469839807,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55782240629196167","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24558571","author":{"steamid":"76561198059434609","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":1847,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1596002642},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life: Blue Shift was released in 2001 as the second Gearbox Half-Life expansion. In this game, you play as Barney Calhoun, a Black Mesa security guard during the time of the original Half-Life's Resonance Cascade, and the subsequent invasion of Black Mesa by the US military in attempt to cover the event up.\n\nThe game is similar to Opposing Force in that it illustrates a part of the world of Half-Life during the time of the Resonance Cascade, though from the eyes of someone other than Gordon Freeman. In Blue Shift's case, you start in a similar environment to Gordon within the depths of the Black Mesa Research Facility as an employee there, and after a casual introduction into basic mechanics and the neat environment Barney works in, you're thrown into combat quickly after the Cascade hits within 15 minutes into the game.\n\nMost of the basic weaponry Gordon has in Half-Life can be used by Barney, from the Shotgun to the Revolver to the Crowbar, and the plot surrounds Barney's attempt to escape Black Mesa and resist against US marines who are pouring in to the facility to cover the whole Cascade up, along the way, you'll solve puzzles, fight baddies, and help scientists to find the way for yourself and others to escape the doomed facility before the impending nuclear destruction of the facility kills your chances.\n\nThe game itself is pretty great; because it was built around the same engine and built around Half-Life as an independent game, it resists many problems itself; most being attributable to those that Half-Life had itself (the flashlight that could stick to surfaces across the room). That being said, the game has a few glitches (saves breaking, certain elevator scenes near the beginning leading to game-overs, Gordon getting stuck on the tram tracks, etc) but none that were utterly game-breaking or capable of ruining the player's experience.\n\nThat being said, this game's main problem is its length and the amount of content it introduces. While Opposing Force, the previous Gearbox Half-Life expansion, had within it a fairly long plot, introduced many new weapons, aliens, and even had a boss battle, Blue Shift is fairly short and doesn't really introduce new weapons, (that being said, most of them to my knoweldge use different skins) and in my opinion, serves more as a compliment to the original game by allowing fans of Half-Life to see more of Black Mesa behind the scenes.\n\nTo summarize: In my opinion the game is great and is my personal favorite of the Half-Life expansions and vies with Half-Life 1 for the best original Half-Life title; I've always enjoyed the character of Barney Calhoun, and I find it enjoyable that there's an entire expansion detailing his own escape from the Black Mesa complex. However, I do recognize the flaws that this game has: This game doesn't introduce as much content as Opposing Force did to be considered a different title from Half-Life, and isn't as long as either Opposing Force or Half-Life to have as much of an impact on the average player post-completion. That all being said, I enjoyed what it was, the narrative and story was solid, and I enjoyed the chance to see the Resonance Cascade and the subsequent invasion of Black Mesa from the eyes of Barney. The game has a certain narrative to it that creates an interesting environment that compliments the plot, and because of its length, you spend more time with other characters and as such are able to more greatly build an understanding of their character because you spend more time together. While it's short and doesn't add much to the Half-Life universe, I myself liked it and found it enjoyable, even if it's only around 2-3 hours long in comparison to the original Half-Life being around 10-12 hours in length.\n\nIn the end, the game's narrative and plot outshine its gameplay for me; it's interesting to see the quest of a security guard escaping Black Mesa while it's under seize by Xen creatures and the military, and the ending is a complete contrast of the ending of Half-Life, and I can't help but feeling like it hit all its narrative marks in those regards.\n\nI myself recommend it, but whether you want to pay 5 bucks for something like this is your opinion in the end. That being said, I myself got it as a part of the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/231/]Half Life Complete[/url] Steam Bundle, which goes on sale during every major seasonal Steam sale. If you were thinking of getting this title or any of the other games in the Half-Life franchise, I'd suggest you turn to that bundle during a sale, as you get discounts for all the games if you buy it, so it's cheaper than buying each game individually.","timestamp_created":1469636867,"timestamp_updated":1469636985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.710298717021942139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24549550","author":{"steamid":"76561198264451003","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1628717795},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life: Blue Shift is a very short game and can take you a maximum of 3 hours. That's how long it took for me at least, others say that it took them about 2 hours to be the game. It's as short as MGSV: Ground Zeroes, but doesn't mean that I didn't have with this game. On the contrary, I enjoyed it for what it was.\n\nGAMEPLAY!\n\nThe game plays just like Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force (no big surprise, honestly), but instead of the HEV or PCV suit from the other games, you have your security guard helmet and vest as the armor you got. You can't use the Health or Shield regeneration station, instead you must find pick up dropped helmets and vests from dead security guards. It makes sense as in the other games, the security guards never really seem to be wearing any special suits like the HEV or PCV.\n\nThere is no new weapons in this game, all you have is the standard military weapons from the original game. \n\nThere is also no new enemies to fight, you got the Vortiguants, Marines, Headcrabs, Barnacles, and Zombies. I pretty sure there were more enemies, but those are only ones I remember.\n\nPretty much, this is like the original game except your a security guard.\n\nLORE!\n\nAs I said, there are no new enemies so, you won't be seeing any new aliens or special black ops here like Opposing Force did. Instead, you will be fighting the traditional enemies from the base game. In terms of story, it answers some questions, such as how Barney got out of Black Mesa and how does the portals work. There not a lot of things here that is new here. \n\nVERDICT!\n\nAlthough, I really listed a lot of cons to the game that will turn people off. I'm still going to reccomend this for anyone who wants a little more insight on Black Mesa and the Security Team. It's definitely not a bad game, but it just lacks anything new. Still, I think people will find it pretty enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1469593240,"timestamp_updated":1469593240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24540772","author":{"steamid":"76561198124852427","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1527891761},"language":"english","review":"No matter its age, its fucking amazing","timestamp_created":1469554060,"timestamp_updated":1469554060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24500801","author":{"steamid":"76561198085615378","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":103,"playtime_forever":286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":286,"last_played":1469106829},"language":"czech","review":"I liked it!","timestamp_created":1469372966,"timestamp_updated":1469372966,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500050485134124756","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24499568","author":{"steamid":"76561198100814766","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":161,"last_played":1469368471},"language":"russian","review":"Охеренно, как первая халфа, только короче в 2 раза","timestamp_created":1469368618,"timestamp_updated":1469368618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24487575","author":{"steamid":"76561198002203340","num_games_owned":1032,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1469215035},"language":"english","review":"Short, lacking in new content but ultimately good and fun expansion to Half-Life.\n\nXen once again sucks a bit, with a crawling maze and annoying platforming, but those are only short sections and the rest is fine.\n\nFrom a story perspective Blue Shift shows a bit more of how Black Mesa operates, and gives a little more history on the technology key to the HL story, but overall it is an unessential tale of a minor characters escape.","timestamp_created":1469310872,"timestamp_updated":1469310872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24468608","author":{"steamid":"76561198192300069","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":93,"last_played":1637805677},"language":"english","review":"90/65 would shoot people again","timestamp_created":1469227694,"timestamp_updated":1593366570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24459532","author":{"steamid":"76561198107660883","num_games_owned":358,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164,"last_played":1469129800},"language":"russian","review":"Халфа с новыми картами и отсылками к первой части.

Originally, Blue Shift was meant to be an add-on for the Dreamcast version of Half-Life, much like Half-Life: Decay was an add-on for the PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life. (Which you can now play as a mod for the original Half-Life: [url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-decay/downloads/half-life-decay]moddb[/url])\n\nThe fact that Blue Shift was originally just an add-on which became an expansion later on is really visible when looking at the time it takes to finish it. Opposing Force took me 6.6 hours to complete on normal, while Blue Shift took me 2.5 hours. In my opinion, Blue Shift is also too easy with too many health crates laying everywhere. What also makes visible that it was originally just an add-on is that you get no new weapons, and you only get to use the non-alien weapons of the original Half-Life. Even though this expansion of the Half-Life universe is maybe lesser in content. I still enjoyed it. It is short which makes it get to the action directly. Also, you go to the alien dimension more often in this one. \n\nThe gameplay in this expansion is mostly just shooting and not really any puzzle solving. The game also doesn't have any boss fights. Everything is mostly combat oriented. With some more parts in the alien dimension. \n\nThis expansion takes place at the same time as the previous Half-Life games with references to the previous expansion and the original game. The only difference this time is that you experience the story from the perspective of a security guard. \n\nThroughout the story, you can really see the style of Gearbox once again with adding a lot of humor in it. What I think is funny to mention is that one of the characters is voice acted by the voice actor of Duke Nukem. Years later, Gearbox went on to create Duke Nukem Forever. \n\nWith Blue Shift I encountered some bugs. One was that every time I loaded a checkpoint the game acted as if I was  holding the mouse button. So when I spawned the weapon just kept shooting. \n\nIt was fun to play Half-Life again from a different point of view. but in my opinion the expansions like this or Opposing Force don't really add too much to the story. Still, this expansion pack has some nice action during the short time of playing.\n\nReviews of the other Half-Life games:\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/70]Half-Life[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/50]Half-Life: Opposing Force[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/220/]Half-Life 2[/url]","timestamp_created":1468485950,"timestamp_updated":1470397828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24290678","author":{"steamid":"76561198273777811","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":593,"last_played":1468917385},"language":"russian","review":"Самая лучшая часть HL","timestamp_created":1468395387,"timestamp_updated":1468395387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24280134","author":{"steamid":"76561198304706620","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1530707495},"language":"english","review":"Probably the best expansion made at the time","timestamp_created":1468349406,"timestamp_updated":1468349406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24269355","author":{"steamid":"76561198193659249","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":47,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1468288504},"language":"english","review":"It's a good addition to Half-Life.

Where this game is set apart from that game though, is in the construction and flow of the game.  This one, (a much shorter game), flows much better, and other than one or two spots, it forgoes the platform game style that Half-Life has.  Only occassionally do you have to leap, duck and weave across impossible terrain and asinine engineered structures, and by the removal of this completely annoying aspect of the original game, this one has not aged as poorly.... \n\nLet's face it, games back then, especially of this genre, grew from those platform styled games, and it's what game developers knew, but it's old hat and it doesn't stack up well.  Thankfully Blue Shift doesn't fall into that old game cliche often.\n\nThe plot for Blue Shift flows better as well.  Instead of just hunting down an alien to kill it, this is a better defined story arc, requiring working towards a non-violent goal of escape (though not without a good dose of alien and military murder-mayhem along the way).  Interesting, considering in the original you're a scientist and this one you're a security guard.\n\nFor anyone that is curious about Half-Life, this is probably the game for you, since it's short and IMO, better.
