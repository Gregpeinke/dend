It adds a Tour of Duty campaign, which is a collection of offline multiplayer matches with bots. It also adds a single player campaign which simulates real counter-terrorist missions.

Now this game was released in 2004 and it came packaged with essentially two games, one being the base game and the other being the deleted content that was created earlier in the development of Condition Zero. Deleted Scenes is basically a Counter-Strike game that focuses on single-player missions loosely tied together. It’s just like playing Call of Duty or Medal of Honor but in Counter-Strike. The graphics for this game hasn’t aged well either for both the base game and the deleted scenes. The textures were low res and washed out in some areas. Even back then the graphics didn’t look good because Half-Life 2 came out not too long later and it looked so much better than this. The music for this game is pretty good though and the gameplay maintaining the routes of the original Counter-Strike. The deleted scenes content is actually pretty damn good to be considered deleted scenes compared to the base game. The base game is just the original Counter-Strike but with bots and more slightly more detail in the environment. Both games are both relatively easy and normal but wait until you get to the sixth tour of duty. OMG is it ever f****** hard! Unlike the previous tour of duties that were relatively easy to get through on normal difficulty this one just spikes the difficulty so high that it will rip your head apart and feed it to you because there are more enemy bots and for some reason they started to have 5x more accuracy and can spot you with eagle eye vision. It’s just like playing with players that use aim bot and wall hack to some extent because there reaction times on the sixth tour of duty is like 1/10th of a second. If you can get through that last one without cheating on max difficulty than you really deserve a medal. The multiplayer is just like Counter-Strike 1.6 but with slightly better graphics. Now you might be asking is this game worth it? Yes it is so long as you can get it cheap because it’s neither a good game nor a bad game and is just above the lines of mediocre. The only reason I recommened this game was because of the deleted scenes content. It's acutally quite unique for the series and this is the only game that did it.","timestamp_created":1435001258,"timestamp_updated":1435001480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16617748","author":{"steamid":"76561198201094677","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1435332931},"language":"english","review":"Very good game , but css and go 100% better","timestamp_created":1434972519,"timestamp_updated":1434972519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16609742","author":{"steamid":"76561198104210699","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1116,"last_played":1454363579},"language":"brazilian","review":"Counter Strike : Condition Zero possui missões, dando um sentido ao cs.

This game was released in 2004, so almost eleven years ago. Condition Zero uses the Half-Life engine. \n\nWhat we have here is a CS game which includes a single player mission pack. When it comes to playing Counter-Strike, I am more or less a newb at it. This game gave me the perfect opportunity to learn the guns, maps and mission types without the pressure of feeling like you are letting your team down by sucking. The campaign took me about four hours to complete, but this was only on Normal mode, you can go back and replay the missions on a higher difficulty to eventually work your way up to playing online. \n\nI also found the squad management system to be a nice little feature which isn't seen in other CS games, at the start of each mission, you can choose which squad members to take with you on the mission, each of the team members have their positive and negative stats so you can really get stuck in with min-maxing them. You start out with three members and you work you way up to having a full blown squad of about eight men. \n\nOn each of the missions you also have to complete specific challenges, these can be goals set around killing a certain amount of people, winning the match in less than ninety seconds, rescuing a specific amount of hostages etc etc. This added a little variety of play, especially the challenges where you have to use a certain weapon in order to complete them. This allowed you to learn how to use other guns effectively rather than sticking with your tried and tested Rifle and Deagle. \n\nWhile the graphics do not come close to looking like games we have in the current day, the game still does look nice. I wasn't put off by the dated graphics one bit; I guess that just shows how good the Half Life engine actually is!  \n\nThe difficulty levels completely rely on how hard you want to make it. I started out on Normal mode just to get to grips with the game as I am newb like that; but you can work all the way up to playing as if you are in a match online and have the brutally hard experience if you want to. Easy mode is complete walk in the park though, enemies can be standing in front of you for about three seconds before they realize they should shoot you, and even then they spray bullets randomly all around you without actually hitting, so I wouldn't recommend you start out on Easy mode. \n\nLike I said, the campaign took me about four hours to complete, but there are two or three more difficulty levels to try out, and I can see this adding a lot of variety into the game play, so I can easily see the single player alone taking about twelve hours to complete it fully on all difficulties. \n\nI found no technical issues what so ever while playing, I would assume all the bugs and niggles would of been ironed out years ago.. \n\nIn conclusion I can easily recommend Counter-Strike: Condition Zero for anyone looking to get into the FPS or CS scene, it will easily give you a worthwhile experience, giving you the opportunity to learn all of the CS maps, guns and game modes in a pressure free environment. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Но было время, когда Valve пытались расширить потенциал игры за счет сингловой составляющей. Так и появилась на свет Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, которая на самом деле состоит из двух игр (Condition Zero и Condition Zero — Deleted Scenes‎). Поговорим о каждой отдельно.\n\nCondition Zero позволяет нам сыграть как в классический мультиплеерный режим из CS 1.6, так и в специальную сингловую часть. Сингл представляет из себя набор различных карт, разделенных на несколько блоков (в каждом блоке - по три карты). На каждой карте нам нужно выполнить ряд определенных условий: спасти заложника, убить определенное количество террористов определенным/любым оружием, выиграть раунд за определенное время и т.д. \nОдной из главных находок сингловой части стала команда, которую мы можем рекрутировать из доступных кандидатов за очки репутации. С прохождением каждой карты мы получаем новые очки репутации, а через определенное количество пройденных карт мы получим доступ к более опытным соратникам. Каждый соратник, кстати, имеет свои собственные показатели и вооружение, так что на каждую миссию можно будет собрать уникальный состав, наиболее подходящий для выполнения заданий.\n\nЧто касается Condition Zero — Deleted Scenes, то она представляет собой чисто сингловую игру, но уже с другим, более привычным для нас принципом. Это обычная кампания из различных миссий по всему земному шару - Европе, Японии, Африке, России, Америке. Ничего общего они не имеют, но сами миссии весьма интересны: помимо классического устранения всех и вся тут есть стелс-миссии, в которых нам нужно незаметно прокрасться в помещении и найти какой-то предмет/скрытно спасти заложников, а также ряд других задач. Тут, кстати, есть ряд уникального оборудования и вооружения, которых нет в других частях CS: рация, гранатомет, оптоволоконная камера и паяльник.\n\nВ целом мне понравились обе игры, в каждой из них есть своя изюминка, да и выполнены они качественно, так что могу смело порекомендовать эту игру всем.\n\nОценка игре по 10-ти бальной шкале: 8/10","timestamp_created":1434142402,"timestamp_updated":1434142402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16331025","author":{"steamid":"76561198195077298","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":88,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":88,"last_played":1431752370},"language":"turkish","review":"gerçekten verdiğin paraya değermi bilmiyorum. \nHalf life 2 oynayın daha iyi daha ucuz..","timestamp_created":1434121866,"timestamp_updated":1434121866,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16323892","author":{"steamid":"76561198105085524","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":329,"last_played":1398127529},"language":"english","review":"wow!","timestamp_created":1434097612,"timestamp_updated":1434097612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16315177","author":{"steamid":"76561198085399522","num_games_owned":247,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1419538120},"language":"brazilian","review":"+ou -","timestamp_created":1434059941,"timestamp_updated":1434059941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16314062","author":{"steamid":"76561198056746989","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":70,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":70,"last_played":1433592963},"language":"russian","review":"Правильно, что Valve так и оставила контру только мультеплеерной игрой и не продолжила заниматься одиночной историей контры....

That doesn't matter, because even on Medium the enemies bullets don't really do any damage. The same applies to your bullets, but since you got about 2 seconds time to aim, you can simply do all headshots, which kinda works.\n\nAmmunition is always a problem, which adds some kind of difficulty to the game, since you are forced to engage close combat with sniper rifles and long range combats with shotguns, just keep one mag an a long range weapon and it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nThe grafics are like Condition Zero grafics, not fancy nowadays, but better than CS1.6 and are well enough.\n\nThe main reason I dislike this game is the complete lack of any story. There were some minor \"plot\" - like parts, where you are told why to go there and kill all those guys, or sometimes sneek past the guards you could easily overwhelm. Another thing is the sometimes really hard to find routes through the level, some pathways are blocked by a locked door, others by invisible walls, and the worst kind are the pathways, which actually are blocked by some kind of fence, which you are supposed to climb over, but you are never given any hint to do that.\n\nAll in all it is a training program for CS: Condition Zero and maybe some other counter strike games, but does not really have any motivational aspects for me.","timestamp_created":1434046691,"timestamp_updated":1434046691,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.452237963676452637","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16300964","author":{"steamid":"76561198085577509","num_games_owned":514,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1418433880},"language":"english","review":"For some reason I really really like the campaign of Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes.
