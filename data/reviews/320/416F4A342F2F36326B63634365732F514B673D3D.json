The maps are open ended and theres alot of room for all out battles in any part of the map. Taking from arena shooters like the previous game, items are scattered around the map some in great places to abuse the re-spawn, others not so much but you get by. \n\nThe majority of the games servers however are saddly empty. When getting a server list youll find that it will only get about 20 servers of wich 90% of them are empty. You will still find 2 - 3 servers with about 5 - 10 players at most, if youre lucky youll find a server with about more than 10 people. Said players also use voice chat and help out new  players but be warned that these people are the same players that have been on this game since the old days when the servers on this game were populted, so going against them will seem very tough. \n\nStill its a very nice deathmatch game, if you are a fan of the HL series and like deathmatch games this wouold be a nice addition to pick up.
