But after playing a bit of coop with my sister I just felt inspired to get around and write a review.\nSo where to begin? Perhaps gameplay. It takes a gimmick, shooting portals to travel, manipulate stuff and ultimately solve puzzles. Portal 2 runs with the gimmick and, in true Valve-style, creates puzzles which feel more rewarding and organic than typical videogame puzzles, where it usually feels like you are trying to mind-read a cryptic all-powerful creature, a creature which tries its best to mask what it wants from you, which punishes every experimentation and failure harshly and without even giving you a clue of where you went wrong.\nInstead, Portal does things like Half-Life 2 did (I touched upon it in my [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197976091020/recommended/220/]HL2 review here[/url]), there´s more of a sense of observing, putting things together without too much arbitrary design choices and rules which never seem to stay consistent and trustworthy. Portal 1 and 2 has some arbitrary things like portals firing upon white surfaces, but it makes this clear and stick with this rule, it creates an environment where learning the rules is not useless, but you keep adding them up lawfully, like a scientist exploring how the game universe operates.\nIt´s fun to figure puzzles out, rewarding, and you can incrementally add up the steps, instead of having to hold in mind a complicated maze and then have to succeed on your first try or start from scratch. I mean, you can and have to strategize, but it can be done in parts, and it is more organic, than feeling gamey, like having to remember the way to put some tilepuzzles together from some scrap of a picture you caught a glimpse of earlier in the game.\nThe Single-Player story was fun, the pacing, telling, the little details you can pay attention to or run past are immersive. I could go on, but many of the strengths of Valve games are here in Portal 2, so what I´ve said about HL2 applies, in the style of relying on atmosphere, environments and observation, coupled with narration. It was a well rounded satisfying experience. I´ll admit it´s now some months since I played SP so I can´t go to more details, but my impression is still very positive. I still have a general idea of the actual substance of the story, it was a bit whacky at times, a scifi story with comedic twists and turns, but it was still told well and had the content was enjoyable, even Wheatley for me, though I´ve heard some were annoyed by that character.\nBut the coop has been utterly fabulous. From the simple way to invite friends and jump into the game, the joy of figuring things out and the game giving the tools to allow you to communicate effectively (mic obviously a tool available), with pings with options to point out where to stand, what to look at, how to interact with, the remote view which allows you to see things from your friends perspective, and just the dynamic, organic humour of flying around portals, messing around, gesturing in a silly way, taunting Glados-- I haven´t played it yet fully, but I expect many more similarly enjoyable rich hours. There´s some story in there as well, it feels like Valve wanted the coop to be rich enough to stand equally strong on the SP campaign side. Some even like the coop more than SP, and I´m starting to see why.\nAs a source engine, the game looks beautiful, plays solidly with little problems, bugs or performance issues, and is a great open engine allowing tweaks and mods. The game has Workshop and will possibly add even more fun to play, both SP and coop.\nIf I were someone to give scores, my initial playthrough would have been a solid lovely 8-9/10, but now after starting to fool around with coop, this is simply 10+ out of ten for me.","timestamp_created":1424170500,"timestamp_updated":1424170500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14512399","author":{"steamid":"76561198077725160","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1431824656},"language":"english","review":"Frst-person puzzle based game with a dark and chilling backstory, one of the gems made by Valve Corporation and definitely worth getting!","timestamp_created":1424170360,"timestamp_updated":1448970622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14511943","author":{"steamid":"76561197999658325","num_games_owned":808,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":1894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1894,"last_played":1395103462},"language":"english","review":"Holding a spot in my heart as one of the best puzzle First person games in the world. \n\nPS: Its made by Valve.. so what do you expect?
