Es cierto que hay veces que te quedas pillado y al final lo averiguas pronto como hacerlo.\nY no me arrepiento de haber roto el corazón a GlaDOS porque para empezar, es una ser inerte y segundo, me obligó matar a mi waifu, el Cubo de Compañía, que aparte no tiene alma ni habla, de hecho no puede. \n¿Jugarlo de nuevo para los logros, los desafíos y las cámaras avanzadas? No creo que en corto plazo.\nSin embargo, es un juego de experimentación de hacer trastadas con la arma de portales para hacer tus chorradas como bucles infinitos y me lo he pasado como un crío.\nNo

la grande famille des jeux vidéo, j'ai pris l'habitude de commencer toujours par le plus moderne, le plus récent.\nAinsi ai-je fait mes premiers pas sur Portal 2, qui en plus d'être intéressant, dur et bien complet, se révèle aussi être LE JEU qui ne m'a jamais autant fait rire depuis que je l'ai commencé.\nRapidement emporté par le succès de ce jeu, j'ai donc décidé de me mettre au premier volet, qui était aussi dans le pack \"The Orange Box\".\nPersonnellement, Le premier s'avère un peu plus lassant que le deuxième (pour ne pas m'attirer la foudre des joueurs, je vais m'expliquer).\nDans Portal 2, vous étiez guidé continuellement par le décor, les voix de GlaDOS, Wheathley et l'esthétique charmeuse des lieux (qui m'a marqué).\nDans Portal, c'est un peu moins le cas, le jeu vous délaissant une fois mis devant les énigmes.\nCertes, le jeu conserve une esthétique accrocheuse qui sera reprise dans le deuxième volet avec quelques retouches,\nmais on ne peut que regretter l'absence des formidables éditeur de salles de tests et mode coop qui ont aussi fait la renommée du deuxième volet.\nForce est de contaster que sur des Portal-like comme The Talos Principle, l'absence de mode coop se ressent immédiatement pour qui a joué à Portal 2.\nEn résumé, Portal reste un excellent jeu qui a posé les bases du deuxième volet et instauré la philosophie de la \"saga\", et l'absence de mode coop ne touchera que les gros fans du deuxième volet, et pas les débutants.","timestamp_created":1425118394,"timestamp_updated":1425118394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14687940","author":{"steamid":"76561198142284223","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1424282974},"language":"french","review":"j'ai

you seen any of the other surrounding reviews? Most of them all pretty much have one thing in common. They say buy this Game and guess what? I agree with those said reviews. YOU SHOULD AND MOST DEFINITELY BUY THIS GAME! Still not convinced? Well you can see more info and reasons to get this game coming from someone who has done a complete playthrough of it on Youtube (Which you can watch here because Shameless Self-Promotion: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8qVdrB0HJEJsxvRvlzVqzYXQ4Y1qLH-) below.\n\nReasons to Get This Game:\n1. It is simple and Easy to Pick Up and Play\n2. The Writing and dialog in this game is top-notch\n3. The Portal Gun is a very fun tool to play around with.\n4. The Game is a puzzle game that does make you think but isn't overwhelmingly hard. The Difficulty curve apart from the extra challenge levels is nice and solid enough for a newcomer to become a Portaling Pro at the end of the game.\n5. The Music in this game fits the mood and tone of the game so well, Especially the later parts.\n6.  It's a Valve game meaning it will be good and I have listed more reasons here than the number of Sequels Valve can Count up to.\n7. There are Extra Challenge Levels for the Hardcore Players looking for a challenge.\n8. GLaDOs is a very memorable character! I MEAN VERY MEMORABLE!\n9. The game does not overwhelmingly punish you for making mistakes which can help a new player ease into making progress.\n10. It is a good enough game for me to make a playthrough of it on Youtube. I don't usually do Playthroughs of games that I don't recommend.\n11. See Reasons 1-10.\n12. It is a Valve Game! A VALVE GAME!\n13. I'm running out of reasons because Reasons.\n14. You Should have Brought this game already if you're still reading this.\n15. Portal is fun. I Recommend it! End of Story!\n\nIf there is anything negative I have to say about this game, I only can just say that the Overall Game Experience lasts way too short in my opinion. Thankfully, There's extra Challenges and levels you can do and there is the Sequel which easily solves this problem but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PLAYING THIS GAME BEFORE PLAYING THE SEQUEL (I can't emphasize it enough).\n\nAnyway, If you're still reading this, you should definitely be convinced to get this game after reading this sentence. If not, just watch my Youtube Playthrough using the link above and watch me have fun with the game because maybe you just visually need to see someone have fun with the game before playing it yourself. \n\nSo thanks for reading this review of Portal.

With its short single-player campaign, and its stripped down graphics (close in term of quality to Half Life 2, released years prior), Portal was to be considered as a bonus in the Orange Box, or even some kind of draft.\n\nYet, Portal managed to stir up the curiosity and the interest of the gaming community. First, the story line is as simple as it is mysterious. Portal is set in the Half Life universe, seemingly at the same time as the first Half Life. The main character is Chell, a young and mute Gordon Freeman-like woman, who wakes up in a huge complex, belonging to Aperture Science, the main competitor of Black Mesa. Chell will be guided by GLaDOS, a strange AI, through a series of \"tests\", in order to attend some kind of \"party\".\n\nWhat first looks like a training level slowly evolves toward a mix of FPS and puzzle game, as the player will have to use the portal gun to solve the \"tests\", which consists in 3D physics enigmas. Create a blue and an orange portal, and what goes through one portal comes out of the other with the same momentum. You then will have to use the law of physics to solve the puzzles. This original concept provides a very interesting and intelligent challenge. It's just a shame that Portal was developped as a mini-game, so it's neither long nor difficult.\n\nBut aside form this originality, the atmosphere of Portal is quite intriguing. Nothing is explained regarding to why Chell is here, or to who she is (hence the simplicity of the sotry !). And as she travels through this disturbingly empty complex, she is permanently lectured by GLaDOS. The AI was seeminlgy conceived as a twisted version of HAL 9000, with its quiet voice, but dangerous schemes and worrying speech elements.

Nesse pacote de jogos tem incluído alguns famosos jogos da Valve, por exemplo: Half-life 2, Half-life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Epsisode Two, Team Fortress 2 e o estreante jogo da produtora, Portal. O jogo consiste basicamente de uma série de enigmas que devem ser solucionados ao teletransportar o personagem do jogador e outros objetos simples usando o \"Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\" (\"ASHPD\", também conhecido como \"Portal Gun\").\n\nNo jogo você assume o papel da Chell, uma cobaia dos testes produzidas pela Aperture Sciencie. Ela é a silenciosa protagonista de Portal e da campanha single-player em Portal 2. Muito pouco se sabe sobre seu passado, além de seu possível abandono quando nasceu e sua teimosa vontade de viver [spoiler] (Baseado nos eventos de Portal 2, é debatido que Chell talvez seja a filha de algum cientista que trabalhou na Aperture Science) [/spoiler]. Durante os testes na empresa, o jogador é guiado por GLaDOS, um computador de inteligência artificial que monitora e direciona o jogador.\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]ANÁLISE CRÍTICA[/th]\n        [th]NOTA (0-10)[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]História[/td]\n        [td]9,2[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gráficos[/td]\n        [td]8,9[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Jogabilidade[/td]\n        [td]9,3[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Trilha Sonora[/td]\n        [td]9,6[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Diversão[/td]\n        [td]9,1[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nMédia final: 9,2\n\nPortal foi um ótimo jogo, apesar da própria Valve considerar que foi apenas um jogo teste para o seu sucessor, Portal 2 e que não acreditava que o jogo seria tão bem recebido pela crítica e usuários. O jogo revolucionou os jogos do gênero puzzle e sem dúvida nenhuma, vale muito a pena comprar Portal e aproveitar tudo que o jogo oferece.
