parece muy increíble la calidad de los gráficos para la epoca (1998), el canon de la historia se presenta como algo que pude tener posibilidad de suceder en la vida real, por otra parte la modalidad de juego resulta ser un poco entorpecedora para un shooter en especial con el cómo elegir las armas ya que Half-life dispone de muchas armas (incluidas las cuerpo a cuerpo) y ya que no existe una tecla clave para seleccionar entre armas debemos recurrir al teclado numérico, lo que dificulta seleccionar el arma apropiada en el momento de combates claves, en las habilidades del personaje destaco la asombrosa resistencia debidos al traje de protección y los hiperimpulsos o saltos largos, en lo que concierne a la historia como ya dije antes resulta ser interesante dado que con los avances científicos no descarto la posibilidad de que pueda ocurrir algo asi en la vida real \"la realidad supera a la ficción siendo esta una copia barata de la anterior\" la historia es muy envolvente dado

Pasa el tiempo y sigue estando bueno jugarlo. Mas que nada por que no es el tipico fps mata-mata tipo cod o Doom. Es un juego con muchos puzzles que te hacen pensar y fases de plataformas. El diseño de los niveles es genial. Cada zona de Black Mesa es diferente. Lo unico que no me gusta de este juego es Xen. Se me hace muy pesada esa parte y eso que es bastante corta. Obviamente lo recomiendo, aunque les diria que si pueden juegen mejor al Black Mesa (el remake hecho con los graficos de half life 2) mas que nada por los graficos y ciertos cambios que le añadieron.","timestamp_created":1531930724,"timestamp_updated":1531930724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43607539","author":{"steamid":"76561198094388664","num_games_owned":1082,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":448,"last_played":1530812194},"language":"schinese","review":"年代太过久远，模型太出戏了！就默默的全程开了GOD模式走走流程。。。","timestamp_created":1531930259,"timestamp_updated":1638657845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.685052990913391113","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43605423","author":{"steamid":"76561198802825970","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":632,"last_played":1654273467},"language":"russian","review":"пиzдатая классика ! 15 хэдкрабов из 10 !","timestamp_created":1531922967,"timestamp_updated":1531922967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583740830421447754","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43601509","author":{"steamid":"76561198239480282","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":935,"last_played":1531892781},"language":"schinese","review":"随时存档对于又菜又怂还tm有强迫症的我真是太友好啦！！！虽然游戏提示比较少，但靠着自己动动脑动动手闯过一关又一关真的很有成就感，也是从小到大花最多时间通关的游戏。神作真不是浪得虚名，可以享受年龄比我还大的游戏真是本人的荣幸。","timestamp_created":1531906777,"timestamp_updated":1531906777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574419677257537842","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43600427","author":{"steamid":"76561198338355201","num_games_owned":404,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":2300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":225,"playtime_at_review":267,"last_played":1660508073},"language":"schinese","review":"如果按照现在的眼光看来，Half-Life缺点也不算多。这款带有恐怖气氛的FPS开创了新的纪元。\n戈登弗里曼的冒险是惊险的，虽然戈登弗里曼非常擅长钻通风管道，但前方依然有许多未知的等着他。\n我依然记得，还是孩子的我第一次玩这款游戏，被僵尸吓到，为什么士兵会攻击我们，为什么有这么多怪物，只能感到深深的无力感，孤独感。\n现在，半条命的故事停滞不前，但我们还会一遍一遍的愿意回到那个早晨，那个保安熟悉的声音：\n[b]早上好，弗里曼博士，您又迟到了。[/b]","timestamp_created":1531901036,"timestamp_updated":1531901036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":47,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.829029738903045654","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43599421","author":{"steamid":"76561198254086515","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":155,"last_played":1578798853},"language":"english","review":"A physicist has a hysterical breakdown caused by a blast of gamma radiation which damages his brain, causing him to hallucinate that the facility has been overrun by alien creatures.

The puzzle-solving elements are fun, even if a tad frustrating at times, and it is very rewarding to discover the solution to something that seemed so impossible beforehand.\n\nThe atmosphere and escalation of tension throughout the game is fantastic. The world is lively, well-crafted, and the twists and turns that occur thoughout the game are enough to keep someone on edge the whole time, especially during the final act.\n\nMy main complaints come in with the combat. Unfortunately, I played through my first time on Hard mode, and realized how much I appreciate DOOM's projectile-based enemies over the more modern hitscan threats. Enemy soldiers have remarkable AI, and can kill you in seconds with barrages of undodgeable rifle rounds and volleys of grenades. Vortigaunts are essentially Shamblers from Quake, but are harder to hit and eventually come in droves to kill you from a distance. Actually, I noticed that hit registration was a bit off during several parts of the game, and found myself often doubting whether or not I could even protect myself. Also, completing the last four levels ended up being one of the most difficult challenges I have ever faced in any video game.\n\nAll that said, on Normal mode, the game is fine, and I highly recommend that you play it if you haven't. I may even wager that I enjoyed this game more than the sequel, if only for the interesting enemies, cunning AI, and twist towards the end of the game.","timestamp_created":1531627625,"timestamp_updated":1531939911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43538018","author":{"steamid":"76561198837964878","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":783,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":710,"last_played":1536386974},"language":"spanish","review":"alv","timestamp_created":1531627119,"timestamp_updated":1531627119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43537234","author":{"steamid":"76561198159338805","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113,"last_played":1636949737},"language":"spanish","review":"sup","timestamp_created":1531623019,"timestamp_updated":1531623019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43536055","author":{"steamid":"76561198231264684","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1610,"last_played":1633107749},"language":"italian","review":"Il rivoluzionario spara tutto in prima persona che ha cambiato la visione del videogioco.
