Insgesamt ist mir das Spiel zwar immernoch zu langweilig, vor allen Dingen aufgrund des stupiden  von-einem-level-ins-nächste-rätsel-prinzip, dennoch kann ich gut verstehen warum es anderen Leuten so gut gefällt.","timestamp_created":1486794201,"timestamp_updated":1592564085,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.400601238012313843","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29840107","author":{"steamid":"76561198128955264","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":514,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1596291503},"language":"koreana","review":"포딸뚜","timestamp_created":1486793348,"timestamp_updated":1486793348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29839607","author":{"steamid":"76561198170572225","num_games_owned":373,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":691,"last_played":1621684538},"language":"english","review":"Got this today after a friend recomended it, no regret what so ever even though its nearly 7 years old still a great game and enjoyed every momen of it would recomend","timestamp_created":1486791277,"timestamp_updated":1486791277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29837498","author":{"steamid":"76561198309850347","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":3191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1225,"last_played":1648567911},"language":"english","review":"1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10","timestamp_created":1486781575,"timestamp_updated":1486781575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29837352","author":{"steamid":"76561198063800693","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":722,"last_played":1398958085},"language":"brazilian","review":"Agora trazendo os conceitos e problemas sociais do mundo pós-moderno, a mudinha enfrenta grandes dificuldades como achar uma vaga no estacionamento para deficientes, já que se encontra aleijada depois de jogar muito Half-Life 3.","timestamp_created":1486780949,"timestamp_updated":1486780949,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.345183581113815308","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29837218","author":{"steamid":"76561198214105695","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":762,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":762,"last_played":1483094989},"language":"brazilian","review":"Não há palavras que descrevam esse jogo, apenas jogue o Portal 1 e 2.

En lo que a mi concierne es una obra maestra. No sé si llega al punto de obra maestra, si no lo llega es porque el apartado gráfico no está muy saturado. Pero no se puede esperar más de una central de pruebas científicas. \n\nPuntos a favor: \n\n+La historia: Es la continuación de portal 1 dónde no pudimos escapar de Aperture Science liderada por la desquiciada computadora central GlaDOS\n+Jugabilidad: Muy parecida a la de portal 1 aunque se le agregan elementos que lo hacen menos lineal y más dinámico. \n+Apartado gráfico: Bastante bien logrado en casi todos los momentos de juego, pero se hace especialmente notorio al principio de la historia y cuando visitamos cierta instalación hace años abandonada\nApartado sonoro: Acompaña en cada momento\n+Personajes: No son muchos, ya que en la historia nos encontramos con sólo 2 personajes (excluyendo al protagonista).Aparece otro personaje en la historia como easter egg y uno más en el multiplayer.Ambos están logrados de manera excelente y nos harán amarlos y odiarlos de a ratos ya que están completamente nutridos de una personalidad casi humana.\n+Dificultad: Puede llegar a ser bastante desafiante en algunos niveles, pero lo que tiene de desafiante lo tiene de enviciante, así que no lo vas a poder dejar de jugar. \n+Posee un multijugador co-op en la cuall, si tenés algún amigo a tu nivel (o quizás no tanto) la van a pasar muy bien y en algunos momentos van a putear un poco.\n+Tiene workshop, por lo cual las horas de diversión y la re-jugabilidad de este juego se puede duplicar.\n+Posee unos easter eggs muy divertidos e interesantes.\n+Precio razonable y llegó a estar 4 dólares en oferta, CUATRO DÓLARES.\n\nPuntos en contra:\n\n-El único punto en contra que encontré, fue que a la hora de jugar multijugador con gente desconocida, me pusieron con un muchacho que parecía de Europa oriental. Espero que hayan arreglado ese temita. \n\nBueno, teniendo todo esto dicho, llego al veredicto final -redoble de tambores- cha cha cha chaaaan:\n\n9.8/10 uno de los mejores juegos que jugué en mi vida. \nExcelentemente logrado, muchas personas lo consideran una obra de arte y no es para menos. Este juego es una de las razones por la cual Valve y Gabe tienen tanto admirador empedernido. \n\nPara concluir esta reseña, me gustaría agregar que algún día me gustaría hacer un videojuego que sea para los demás lo que Portal 2 fue para mi.\n\n\nME ENCANTO","timestamp_created":1486696548,"timestamp_updated":1486696548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540130674839019775","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29815110","author":{"steamid":"76561198140258204","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":81,"last_played":1487065516},"language":"turkish","review":"Aşırı şekilde sıkıcı, akıcılık ve hikaye içeriği düşük","timestamp_created":1486695755,"timestamp_updated":1486695755,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.419724106788635254","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29814958","author":{"steamid":"76561198088517072","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2322,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1033,"last_played":1570888777},"language":"schinese","review":"有趣的关卡设计，很容易沉迷，比较推荐双人模式和好朋友一起解密，比单人模式要有趣","timestamp_created":1486695103,"timestamp_updated":1486695103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29814659","author":{"steamid":"76561198286193072","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":2859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":814,"last_played":1597349182},"language":"schinese","review":"创意工坊能让每个人创造关卡并分享，你能永远玩儿下去\n\n————————————————————分割线—————————————————————\n\n一款近乎完美的第一人称解谜游戏，说实话这种题材的游戏不多见，全程下来不会像传统解谜一样给你太大的压力，关卡难度适中，纯色规则的风格很是亮眼\n大部分关卡的主色调采用的都是白色以及少许的浅蓝色，关卡极度规则，还可以自己编辑关卡\n推荐","timestamp_created":1486693740,"timestamp_updated":1487681422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29813374","author":{"steamid":"76561198091589476","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1490803664},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely brilliant! 10/10 Get it!","timestamp_created":1486687762,"timestamp_updated":1486687762,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29812837","author":{"steamid":"76561197996635926","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":732,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":508,"last_played":1584862276},"language":"english","review":"I really enjoy puzzles and thinking about things so overall I enjoyed Portal.

It’s one of those games where the sequel is better then the original.\n\nPortal 2’s story is better, the puzzles are better, it’s a longer and it’s more polished. It imporves on all of those things, so if you liked the first one, you will enjoy this even more.\n\nIn the original game, the story was simple and straightforward. Now there is a little more to it, but I won’t talk to much about it to prevent spoilers. You also get to learn more about Aperture Science's history and an exclusive behind the scenes look on how those darn puzzle rooms are build. All this is topped with a hefty amount of humor.\n\nThe puzzles are better, not only are several new mechanics introduces that were not present in the first game, but all those pesky timed puzzles are gone. In the first game I got stuck a few times because you only had this 1.5 second (or less) window to perform several actions in a row, these are no longer there. This is a good thing in my book, because they were a source of frustration in an otherwise excellent game. That’s not to say that the puzzles have become easier, in fact they might even be more complicated because all the newly introduced elements, like the blue, orange and gray gels (they provide different extra capabilities such as speed up, bounce, …) combine those with the portals and you’ve got some crazy puzzle solving to do.\n\nThe voice acting is spot on, JK Simons does an excellent job, but so does Merchant as the hopeless hilarious Wheatly and ofcourse Ellen McLain as GlaDOS is as brilliant as she was in the first game.\n\nThe graphics are pretty much on the same level as the first game, which is just perfect, I have nothing bad to say about it, they still hold up very well these days, despite being a +5 year old game. Everything does look more polished though, there is at least a lot more going on, making the environment so much more feel alive.\n\nAs a PC or SteamOS gamer you cannot miss this game, it is essential gaming material.\n\nRuns like nothing else on Linux/SteamOS and plays very, very well with the Steam Controller. Streaming to the Steam Link is problemless.","timestamp_created":1486647566,"timestamp_updated":1486647566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525316417217254639","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29801182","author":{"steamid":"76561198308814433","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":303,"last_played":1571072198},"language":"english","review":"is cool to play with karl","timestamp_created":1486647000,"timestamp_updated":1486647000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29800585","author":{"steamid":"76561198328698069","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1114,"last_played":1642606618},"language":"koreana","review":"정말 명작이니까 돈 아깝다는 생각하지말고 사자. 다 꺠도 사람들이 맵 하루에도 엄청 만들어서 올린다. 그리고 멀티플레이좀 들어와라","timestamp_created":1486644755,"timestamp_updated":1486644755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29800401","author":{"steamid":"76561198031529307","num_games_owned":384,"num_reviews":129,"playtime_forever":920,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":652,"last_played":1595715777},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1486643909,"timestamp_updated":1486644132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29800251","author":{"steamid":"76561198263866423","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":251,"last_played":1498224464},"language":"russian","review":"Шедевр, так интересно небыло никогда\nА конеееец это прям вау\nКруто советую всем ужасно крууто\nКонец понравился безумно","timestamp_created":1486643377,"timestamp_updated":1488284870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29799827","author":{"steamid":"76561198207691632","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1018,"last_played":1590292706},"language":"schinese","review":"唯一一款即使头晕还能继续玩下去的游戏","timestamp_created":1486641474,"timestamp_updated":1651940382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29799755","author":{"steamid":"76561198331835831","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":134,"last_played":1546073481},"language":"russian","review":"это логическая игра  там надо и\n думать\n","timestamp_created":1486641168,"timestamp_updated":1486641168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29799581","author":{"steamid":"76561198124566395","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":966,"last_played":1462516265},"language":"english","review":"This is more of a puzzles game than an FPS.
