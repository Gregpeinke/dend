По продолжительности игра примерно такая-же, однако тут больше упор сделан на шутерную составляющею чем на головоломки. Дополнение повествует о капрале шепарде, из морской пехоты сша подразделение \"HECO\". Добавлено большое количество нововведение, например новые виды оружия - снайперская винтовка/пулемёт и большое количество инопланетного оружия - спорометатель, шоковый таракан, ручной барнакл. Имеется несколько эксперементальных пушек. Добавлено большое количество врагов например целых 2 новых вида зомби, раса Х, мужские \"черные оперативники\". Теперь наши товарищи имеют большой вес, например могут открывать потаённые двери, прикрывают и существенно помогают в бою, медики позволяют лечиться. Короче бойцы хеко намного полезнее охранников с пукалками. Разумеется имеются баги и иногда солдатам приходиться по несколько раз давать команду \"идти за мной\" но всё равно они оказывают должную помощь. Короче огромное количество нововведений и всё это в совокупности с новой историей под другим углом. Могу с уверенностью сказать что этот шутан шедевр, из минусов устаревшая графика. Так же мне не нравиться эффект \"прибора ночного видения\".  Смело рекомендую тем кому графика в играх неважна.","timestamp_created":1658754917,"timestamp_updated":1658754917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119440384","author":{"steamid":"76561198090664712","num_games_owned":473,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":355,"last_played":1552924934},"language":"english","review":"Honestly very fun intro, mechanics, levels.

I used to play this back in the days with friends. The original Half-life feel is still there. Guns behave nicely and puzzles are engaging. It is nice to see things Black Mesa from another perspective, again. \n\nI run into a couple of bugs, like the mouse not moving at first or being stuck after loading the next area couple of times. The game is shorter than I remember, only a few hours long. Textures and models now look dated, but overall this was nice trip to the memory lane.\n\nThis game deserves similar treatment that Crowbar Collective did to the original Half-Life.
