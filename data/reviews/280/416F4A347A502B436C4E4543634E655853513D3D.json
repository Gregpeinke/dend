The setting for the game is an underground research facility, your character witnesses a catastrophe that plunges the facility into chaos. You have to fend off alien species to escape the facility and try to figure out what is happening. It’s a sci-fi game and that’s what gives it its character. The weapons especially get more interesting as the game develops, as you start to discover more and more alien technology.\n\nI used to love watching my dad play this as a kid, but I just never managed to be able to get very far myself until I decided to go back to it now. The Half-Life 1 series is extremely nostalgic to me and its great still being able to play these games despite how old they are. For me, they are great, but I imagine for people that have never played them before, they might just look awful. \nDespite that, I would hope the overall feel and story of the game would be compelling enough to make those people enjoy it anyway.\n\nHalf-Life: Source has a few bugs here and there, a few of which I thought were going to be game breaking for me. But there was always a way around it. The glitches and bugs were tedious but given how old the game is it’s forgivable. \n\nThe source engine reboot of this game changes up the game quite a bit. It was given new map textures, new weapon models, new NPC models and enhances to the sound. The changes are good, they definitely make the game look better. But I enjoy the original just as much, if not more. I’m used to and remember the old one. Which oddly, when I played this game I’m not too sure what happened with it. I downloaded the game, fired it up and played quite a bit in one session. Not noticing that it was all actually the old game assets. I shut it down and gave the game a break and when I booted it back up suddenly the new stuff was being used. Weird!\n\nAnyway, there is never a dull moment in this game, there is action and something new always around the corner. It’s essentially a first person shooter, but it manages to break it up in-between and give you enough else to do so that it doesn’t get boring. \n\nIt’s all around a fun game and I think you should give it a try, even if you haven’t got that Half-Life nostalgia that I do.\n\n\nTL;DR : Old but great, lot of nostalgia for me. It’s a good first person shooter sci-fi game, give it a try.\n\n\nFor anyone interested, My Review for Half-Life: Opposing Force:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/50/","timestamp_created":1451689650,"timestamp_updated":1452364421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.689671099185943604","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20192606","author":{"steamid":"76561198166807806","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":656,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":331,"last_played":1510432371},"language":"english","review":"Through use of the source engine, this game is an excellent rehash of the original \"Half-Life.\" Play and enjoy it.","timestamp_created":1451681714,"timestamp_updated":1451681714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20165848","author":{"steamid":"76561198070549493","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":167,"last_played":1579301860},"language":"english","review":"This game take the original 1998 version to a whole new level.

This is no suprise seeing as the this game was released in 98, unfortunately PC gamers were not as popular at my age when this game was released.\n\nReview- Were I to review this game in 1998 , I would have been blown away by the story and gameplay, but seeing as this is 2015 I cant say that I am blown away, but I can appreciate a classic game during this day and age for what is was. Half Life is a fantastic game, and anyone who is a collector or can appreciate classic games must buy it, there is a reason it is still on the top 50 games of all time lists everywhere you look.\n\nCombat- Ok let me first say, the shooter part of this game is done fairly well, but the crowbar combat is super bad, the game like you to be in just the right spot and swinging your crowbar perfectly for you to kill things with it, which is not a big deal since you won't be using the crowbar for combat really unless oyu run out of ammo haha.\n\nStory- THE STORY BECOMES FAR CLEARER WHEN YOU PLAY HALFLIFE 2. Half Life has a great story, but it is not easy to pick up on , you have an idea throughout the game of what is going on and who you are, but at the end is when you really get a sense of what is to come. I will not discuss the story to avoid spoilers, but PAY ATTENTION to what the NPCS are saying and especially the man in the blue suit. There is no Journal or logbook, so you just have to remember what is going on. That being said, Half Life 2 is a must pick up after you play this.\n\nReplay Value- Next to none unless you want to do the achievment system, or if you want to beat it on a higher difficulty, but in my opinion the NORMAL diffculty is actually pretty challenging.\n\nRating- 8/10, Receiving an 8 because of length of the story, there are times when you just want to get to the end and you feel it is being dragged out by needless extra puzzles that are just there to annoy you(the puzzles are not hard), but regardless great game must play.\n","timestamp_created":1448913513,"timestamp_updated":1448913513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19387176","author":{"steamid":"76561198105203764","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":38,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37,"last_played":1448886443},"language":"brazilian","review":"acho q eles podiam ter aproveitado melhor a engine, colocando legendas e arredondando os modelos. o jogo tb está com alguns bugs, quando abro no fullscreen, fica tudo preto e \"trava\" o pc, então tive q botar -windowed pra inciar. tb as armas estão invisiveis quando to segurando.

The graphics are much more enhanced, now we actually have shiny objects. However there is not a lot of mod support nor do people try to mod this game.

Instead Valve decided Hey let's split up the game into two so we can make double the money hehehehe. So not only with the original are you getting mods, you're also getting multiplayer.
