Mientras Rapture es el equivalente al culo del mundo (negro, feo y maloliente), Columbia es todo lo opuesto (brillante, colorida y con olor a rosas....casi).\n\nNinguna diferencia sustancial con los plasmidos que ahora se llaman tonicos, agregaron algunos, quitaron otros.\n\nAñadieron la posibilidad de realizar ataques aereos al emplear ganchos en el aire y rieles a los que te puedes colgar para matar a los enemigos.\n\nAhi acaba lo bueno, ahora lo malo.\n\nEn comparacion con el primer Bioshock que te cuenta toda la historia de la ciudad, personajes, problemas y eventos, Bioshock Infinite te deja seco, literalmente no sabes nada de Columbia, personajes, eventos, nisiquiera de los enemigos. Minimo deberian haberme dado una pequeña enciclopedia o algo. \n\nPero el problema se resuelve jugando el segundo DLC \"Panteon Marino 2\". ¿Encerio? ¿Me vendes la historia que deberia estar en el juego desde el principio?\n\nPero lo peor de todo es el final de la historia, te quedas \"WTF?\". No es que sea algo tremendamente impresionante, es que directamente no lo entiendes.\n\nCalificacion: 8.5/10\n\nNo es perfecto, pero se acerca... si conoces un poco sobre teoría cuántica.","timestamp_created":1437452729,"timestamp_updated":1437452729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17150848","author":{"steamid":"76561198084354427","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1454302750},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра, рекомендую для ценителей сюжета и антиутопий!","timestamp_created":1437450471,"timestamp_updated":1437450471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17150636","author":{"steamid":"76561198022645026","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":106,"playtime_forever":2277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2120,"last_played":1588977357},"language":"english","review":"WOW!!!","timestamp_created":1437448929,"timestamp_updated":1437448929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17150198","author":{"steamid":"76561198057185269","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":5024,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3391,"last_played":1603375673},"language":"russian","review":"офигенная игра","timestamp_created":1437446085,"timestamp_updated":1437446085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491167813539505005","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17149846","author":{"steamid":"76561198093257591","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":844,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":102,"last_played":1601850543},"language":"english","review":"11/10 would help liz again","timestamp_created":1437443905,"timestamp_updated":1437443905,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17149183","author":{"steamid":"76561198029814773","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":696,"last_played":1491772701},"language":"spanish","review":"LO RECOMIENDO MUCHÍSIMO, DE VERDAD!\nJOOOOOOOOODERRRRR, osea ya que es un juego FPS y logra tener un argumento tan denso, y por decir complicado de entender (Como para darse vuelta 2 o más veces el juego) me encantó en todo aspecto. \nImpresionante final a la altura del resto de la saga Bioshock.

Bioshock Infinite was a big disappointment in comparison. Well, even if not compared to Bioshock 1 & 2.\n\nThe game starts out alright, with nice graphics and a mysterious city, floating in the sky. Since I am not an experienced FPS-player, I started on medium difficulty ... and was surprised how easy the game was. Don't get me wrong, I still got killed quite some times, but not because the fights are difficult ... very often, I simply couldn't see where the enemy was shooting from. On medium difficulty, you will also find as much money and as many lock-picks as you could wish for. No need for tactics when you upgrade weapons or vigors.\n\nThe thing that really killed this game for me was that enemies always come in a burst and with a certain background music and enemy noises. This destroyed every single bit of suspense from the very beginning. You always know that you will encounter a bunch of enemies when you enter a new area. Then it is \"kill until the music stops and you cannot hear any more enemies shouting at you\". Afterwards it is (boring) looting and exploration time. Since the music will tell you that you are safe, you can take your time and you don't have to be careful. No suspense whatsoever.\nVery often, I did not manage to kill all of the enemies because the last one was hiding somewhere. Then you walk around aimlessly with that over-dramatic background music and the last enemy shouting at you. These incidents were so annoying that I usually killed this bastard by ripping off his head.\n\nThe fights were probably made this way to make life easier for the inexperienced casual gamer. The same goes for the automatic save-games and instant revival after having been killed. Unfortunately, the game helps you even more! In the graphics options, the game advices you on how to adjust the gamma. With the correct settings, the game has many dark corners and hidden places. Sounds interesting, until you discover that all nearby objects glow golden or red. Everything jumps directly into your face. Another suspension killer, if you ask me. In Bioshock Infinite, this cannot be disabled like in the earlier Bioshock games.\n\nAnd last but not least, having Elizabeth around feels like cheating. She will supply ammo, money and even point at items or dangerous enemies.\n\nAll in all, I got bored relatively quickly and finishing the game felt like a chore. Definitively not a game that I wish to replay on a different difficulty setting or using a different strategy.","timestamp_created":1437376692,"timestamp_updated":1437376727,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17134523","author":{"steamid":"76561198079844582","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":930,"last_played":1530387541},"language":"spanish","review":"Llevo 11 horas y lo que he jugado es grandioso apenas he acabado la campaña, me faltan los DLC, ha valido la pena descargar las 37gb es un juego que es brillante y el clima dentro del juego casi te hace como si fuera real, en mi opinion lo recomiendo muy bueno :D","timestamp_created":1437362042,"timestamp_updated":1437362042,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17134426","author":{"steamid":"76561198066039249","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2237,"last_played":1490423046},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos meus jogos preferidos, recomendo a todos","timestamp_created":1437361252,"timestamp_updated":1437361252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17134384","author":{"steamid":"76561198004301924","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2228,"last_played":1575352074},"language":"english","review":"yelled \"HOLY SHIT\" a lot, mostly because of plot twists but also sometimes because I died.

The player gets a limited amount of information and is put into this great city in the clouds called Columbia. His mission is to save a girl called Elizabeth to wipe away his gamble debts.\n\nAs the player gets confronted by a lot of trouble, the story doesn't develop much. It's basically still about Elizabeth. But this girl is interesting and thanks to the great voice acting - believable. I personally felt the story got in the background as soon as you are running around with new helping Buddy Elizabeth. But don't get me wrong, it was not boring. It was just... nothing special... sorta predictable. \n\nAs soon as the story progresses further the game got a lot more interesting and I needed to know what the story was about in the end. I thought it would take a different approach and it totally blew me away. Without going into much detail - the ending is yaw dropping - but REALLY confusing. It seems that I was not the only confused player at the end at the game, according to forums full with questions.\n\nHere is a short pro/contra-list if you really need to know if this game is for you:\n\n+ art direction\n+ voice acting\n+ vertical gameplay\n\n-/+ pacing\n-/+ story\n\n- outdated graphics (even for 2013)\n- difficulty kind of \"switches\"\n\nAccording to Steam it took me about 10,5h to complete the game on Medium. That's not very much if you count that the game doesn't offer multiplayer. Is this game worth to play? Yes. Is it worth full price? Yes, but not for 10,5h of Gameplay.

This third game happens in a floating city known as 'Columbia'.\n\nInfinite is without a doubt one of the best single player games in recent years with it's characters, plot and enviroments. Every emotional moment was backed up with tranquility amongst havoc and the soft sounds made it all the more compelling. \n\nPros-\n\n- A fantastic single player story\n- Weapons and powers are fun to use and upgradable. Play the game how you want.\n- Enviroments are some of the most vivid and colourful within recent years, the beautiful floating utopia of Columbia was awe inspiring.\n- Characters such as 'Elizabeth', 'Booker' and others such as Songbird are very well developed and relatable. \n- The story has fantastic transitions and fast-paced action sequences such as flying on the skyrails for example.\n\nCons-\n\n-The limitations of upgrading weapons is hindered depending on your interest in looting. Despite looting, I still felt there was a lot more powers/weapons I could of upgraded. Although this is personal preferance.\n\nBioshock infinite comes with emotional scenes, mind-blowing moments and an adventure which will keep you entertained and provoke your mind thinking fluids for hours afterwards.

Though that means I can't compare it with previous games like I have for my other reviews.\n\nOne thing that I did not like was the post-processing effects. It was great for an overall graphical experience but with my eyes I have to turn DoF and Blurs off or I get motion sick. Even after turning those off I still got motion sick from this game after playing it for more than 2 hours. It was most likely the blur effects natively in the game such as main screen menus and getting shot. Though that's just me, I didn't let it effect me in the overall review.\n\nThe storyline was great. Many kickers that kept you guessing how it's going to end, and leaving you somewhat confused. I have heard, however, that BioShock 2 still has the best storyline. I can agree but I also feel that Infinite had almost the same amount of kickers and confusing or surprising endings. I loved playing through the storyline when I could before getting motion sickness.\n\nCombat was fluid and challenging but not too challenging that you would have a hard time going through a level out of the many that Infinite has to offer. Vigors add to that factor and help you cruise through a level either cutting down enemies or walking past them. After playing Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, it somewhat reminds me of the Vigor system. Each Vigor, or Sign, gives you different advantages against different enemies. You could use just one such as using Igni in Witcher. or you could play it smart and switch constantly using Possession to posses turrets and machines for a short period keeping a few enemies busy or any of the other Vigors to take out enemies or lay traps.\n\nOverall, before getting motion sickness, I loved the game and would pick it up again to finish the achievements I have left if it wasn't for the fact that I can't play it for more than 2 hours at a time. I can't no-life it. I definitely recommend this game to my friends who enjoy the same games I do, Action Adventure RPGs and FPSs. I would probably have more to say though if I had played BioShock 1 and 2.","timestamp_created":1437194720,"timestamp_updated":1437194720,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17101966","author":{"steamid":"76561198123160740","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":568,"last_played":1581318767},"language":"russian","review":"Купил на распродаже, до этого не играл, взял чтоб когда-нибудь глянуть что вообще за игра и почему ею все так восхищаются не пожалел) все  3 прошёл на одном дыхании)","timestamp_created":1437192551,"timestamp_updated":1437192551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17099355","author":{"steamid":"76561198000465728","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1601,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1277,"last_played":1437348771},"language":"spanish","review":"Sólo les dirè que ya no me daba por jugar video juegos porque todo se me hacia trillado y aburrido.

I've NEVER been through a ride like this in my lifetime. I guess, in essence, you could say this game is much like a roller coaster, where the 'WEEEEEEEE's are the INSANE levels of action, and the 'WOOOOOOOOO's are the INSANE level of story, with feels, realization, thought-pondering...a WHOLE lot. I think that this game can literally change lives. It's SO amazing in every way I can think of.\n\n\nI'm still confused about the timeline in the Bioshock series that this stands, but I really don't think this installment is directly  influenced by the first two games (possibly saying this for the sake of spoilers, too :D). It DEFINITELY carries all the gameplay mechanics from those two, however, such as looting every possible thing with ridiculous but accurate sensitivity, Plasmids (now referred to as Vigors), vending machines, upgradeable weapons via them, too. You can eat rotten bananas and lose health, and still get drunk by drinking so little. There's an achivement to killing enemies while drunk, too! :3\n\n\nThe story... I'll say NOTHING about that. I hope that will be a reason for you to try out the game for yourself. It's SO GOOD. It's EASILY next to Majora's Mask as my favorite video game in the world. I want more people to play this game.\n\nAnd for an added challenge, after you beat the game, you can try out 1999 difficulty, which you've undoubtedly heard of. I'm not sure how hard that is, as I'm saving that for a livestream, hopefully.\n\nThe DLCs, now. The first one, as you can assume by the name (Burial at Sea) DOES take place in Rapture; both episodes.\nSecond episode, though, should not exist. I hate that one. Steath is NOT a factor that should be focused on in these games, I don't think, anyway. There's no merit to doing it in hard mode, but I like challenging games.\nAnd Clash In The Clouds can get old pretty quickly, but the extra achievments should keep you busy. :3\n\nPlease give this game a try.

After the first two in the series I had extremely high expectations from this game. And oh boy did it deliver. I was immediately sucked into the flying city of Columbia. The atmosphere, the people, the sounds, all of it made for a truly amazing experience. \n\n- Story\nI won’t talk about any of the elements here as I believe telling even the slightest detail will take away from the experience. Just know that you’re in for an adventure like no other. With a gripping narrative and grand schemes and motives in play, this story is by far one of the best I’ve ever seen. Before you know it you’ll be sitting there with your jaw on the floor at the various twists and turns coming your way.\n\n- Gameplay \nThe combat system is more or less the same as from the previous Bioshock games. This time you’re only limited to two weapons. At first I thought this would take away from the many choices that I had but it instead it adds to the experience as I was no longer the walking tank with an entire arsenal of guns at my disposal. You are required to pick your weapons according to your play style. Do you upgrade the sniper rifle and pick enemies from afar? Do you keep a crank gun with you at all times for those tight spots? \nSimilarly, you are allowed to keep two vigors (powers) within the quick selection menu but you can freely choose between all the ones you collect throughout the game. This time a new set of powers is introduced that greatly enhances the experience and provides new ways of taking out baddies which is extremely satisfying. \n\n- Graphics\nThis game is gorgeous. Just look at the screenshots. Okay, don’t. You might spoil something for yourself. But trust me. Its two years old but has still aged very well. Fits the previous two entries perfectly. \n\n- Characters\nThe characters, in typical Bioshock fashion, are as colorful and whacky as always. With extreme ideals and motives plenty to go about, you play as Booker DeWitt, a man with a shady past who has swum in the wrong waters and now owes a debt to people you never wanna be in debt to. The female lead, Elizabeth, however is by far one of the most lovable and amazing characters you will ever encounter in gaming. She also helps out during combat, giving you potions and ammo whenever need be. She truly is how every companion should be like and is a prime example of how AI should be in games. \n\n-Soundtrack\nThe soundtrack follows the typical fashion of having various different tracks and songs playing all the time around the environment. The tracks really fit well with the theme of the game and are always nice to listen to during loading screens. One track in particular holds a sort of connection with the plot, being a sort of indication to a major point in the story. Simply put, the soundtrack is amazing. \n\nFinal Verdict\nThis game is a master piece on every sense of the word. I would gladly have my memory of this game erased simply to play it all over again. That is the level of love and admiration I have for this franshise. This is definitely something you should try. \n\n10/10. Masterpiece. \nLegendary. \nWould get knocked off an airship by a handyman all over again. \n","timestamp_created":1437075125,"timestamp_updated":1437075125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17079315","author":{"steamid":"76561198096719387","num_games_owned":503,"num_reviews":162,"playtime_forever":757,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":757,"last_played":1436616964},"language":"french","review":"Excellent jeux que j'avais déjà terminé sur PS3 : néanmoins, je voulais la version la + \"propre\" & vu que j'avais pas testé Burial at Sea, j'ai profité d'une promo pour prendre le tout.\n\nBI est vraiment chouette en terme d'ambiance & d'histoire ( les failles, la relation elisabeth/Booker, les univers parrallèles,etc.), on pourra juste critiquer le coté gunfight un peu trop présent comparé aux anciens Bioshock.\n\nBurial at Sea est assez intéressant, l'épisode 1 est dispensable, il n'y a que la fin d'intéressante car elle lançe l'intrigue du (très bon) 2ème épisode.\n\nOn y apprend + sur la connexion entre Rapture & Columbia via les failles (Suchong & Fink, échange de technologie), la relation entre les protecteurs & les petites soeur, & aussi celle entre Songbird & Elisabeth).\n\nDe +, vu qu'on joue Elisabeth, l'approche est moins bourrine que dans le jeux principal : elle est beaucoup + faible que Booker, il faut se la jouer un peu \"infiltration\" par moment, c'est moins bourrin que BI en gros.\n\nLa fin de ces dlc est un peu trop vite expedié, & hors promo : c'est quand même vendu super cher pour une durée de vie moindre (comme d'hab, j'ai envie de dire).\n\nEn tout cas, ça serait un comble de passer à coter de Bioshock Infinite (d'ailleurs, tout les opus sont excellent, même bioshock 2).","timestamp_created":1437068698,"timestamp_updated":1437068698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489492118358612061","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17078031","author":{"steamid":"76561198115854411","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":5040,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2679,"last_played":1517512703},"language":"english","review":"This was my first Bioshock game, and when I heard that a great many people didn't like it, I was shocked to say the least.

I had a couple questions on my hands that needed answering. \n\nIs Infinite better than the original?\nIs it better than 2?\nIs it worthy of the title Bioshock?\nIs it really as incredibly violent and repetitive and dumb in comparison to it's predecessors?\nBetween 1,2, and infinite, which is best and worst?\n\nThe answer to all 5 of these questions is thus:\nHell No\nYes\nYeah\nNO\nBioshock>Infinite>Bioshock 2\nI don't know if most of the nay sayers of this game (I don't wanna say haters because there are SOME legitimate reasons to be turned off by this game) are just fan boys of the original who blindly compare it to the original without realizing that while it isn't any where near as ground breaking or original as Bioshock, that doesn't stop it from being one of the best games of 2013 (Thats not saying much gut still) The visuals are stunning, the atmosphere is astonishing, the immersion is comparable to a cocaine addiction, the combat is gruesome but satisfying, and the story, if you are able to follow it, is arguably better than even the first. It's not as open as Bioshock, not as easy to follow or even as immersive, but as a Bioshock Infinite game, rather than a Bioshock 3, this game is an experience you can't get anywhere other than a Bioshock game.","timestamp_created":1437063660,"timestamp_updated":1437064565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17077443","author":{"steamid":"76561198034259557","num_games_owned":344,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":498,"last_played":1581411486},"language":"english","review":"10/10\n\nSwinging simulator.\n\nGood story tho.\n\nand Liz <3","timestamp_created":1437060905,"timestamp_updated":1437060905,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494880557060241699","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17077194","author":{"steamid":"76561198005365112","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":160,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":160,"last_played":1419349089},"language":"english","review":"10/10 - best narrative I've ever enjoyed in a videogame.","timestamp_created":1437059721,"timestamp_updated":1437059721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17074830","author":{"steamid":"76561198082446637","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1506191922},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1437047405,"timestamp_updated":1437047405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17074090","author":{"steamid":"76561198065133029","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":598,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":598,"last_played":1409575493},"language":"english","review":"Recommend","timestamp_created":1437042797,"timestamp_updated":1437042797,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17073181","author":{"steamid":"76561198105848102","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":708,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":110,"last_played":1585836198},"language":"russian","review":"Игра, в которую должен поиграть каждый. 10/10","timestamp_created":1437036491,"timestamp_updated":1437036491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510149896144866943","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17072234","author":{"steamid":"76561198049071186","num_games_owned":1674,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":618,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":618,"last_played":1437028378},"language":"english","review":"A pretty decent datesim, although a bit nonconventional: the setting and the whole FPS thing is somewhat unusual for a game of this genre.\nThings do get a bit weird near the end, when you realize that [spoiler]your girlfriend is your daughter and you've killed yourself thinking it was her dad and then she kills you for whatever reason[/spoiler], but most of the time you get to have quite a lot of fun.\n9/10 overall\n10 if you're into girls without a finger or two","timestamp_created":1437029245,"timestamp_updated":1437029245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17071550","author":{"steamid":"76561198166345078","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":683,"last_played":1437021877},"language":"english","review":"So I tried to play the original Bioshock but for some reason the game's sound did not work at all. So I was like, screw it, I'll try Infinite. And let me tell you right now, this game is SOOO GOOD!\nPros:\n-Graphics are not the most demanding but the game still looks so good. I always love when creators prefer to have thier games have a unique style over crazy realism. This game will age well for sure.\n-The story was very interesting and I liked a lot of the places it went, I really could not predict the story which helped to keep me interested.\n-Gameplay is simple but a lot of fun. Some people may find this as a negative but I personally did not mind. The game does take more of a guns-blazing, action style gameplay which some people may not like because I've heard how the previous games were more horror-like or something. (again, have not played them, but may try them in the future.)\n--The best thing this game has to offer to me are it's characters, specifically the main protagonists. Booker and Elizabeth are such colorful characters that you really do care for and will probably not forget about. Even other important characters are memorable, but I say who to keep it spoiler-free.\n\nCons:\n-While the story is great, I felt that I couldn't always follow it. Sometimes I felt a bit lost because there were a good amount of times where I would think this is what was happening but it turned out to be this instead. Can get a bit frustrating. (this might just be me though)\n-While there are many interesting and colorful characters in the game, the main antagonist isn't exactly the greatest. I mean, he's fits the role of a bad guy, but you really don't feel sympathy for him, you just kinda think he sucks and that's it. I'm not calling him a terrible antagonist, but I would have preferred to have had him a bit more fleshed out.\n\nConclusion:\nBioshock Infinite is a fantastic first person shooter, argueably one of the best within the past few years. It has fun (but simple) gameplay, a great (but sometimes confusing) story, and some of the most memorable characters within gaming. I really do believe you should a least check it out. (Also, it's a solid port, I had little to no frame-rate drops or glitches.)\nObjective Score-9/10\nSubjective Score-10/10\n*Basically, just get the game!!!","timestamp_created":1437023795,"timestamp_updated":1437023795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17071030","author":{"steamid":"76561198105869983","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1437012239},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bom jogo.

With a beautiful, well developed world and strong characters it is most definately immersive. I takes a cold person not to get invested in Elizabeth, and the voice acting for all characters is top notch.\n\nGameplay is nothing particularly new to the Bioshock series, though the inclusions of tears and the skyhook keeps things fresh, and the vigors are fun to use. Fighting is fast paced and rewarding, exploration pays off and the side quests are well integrated. It does feel a lot like Dishonoured, which I guess feels a lot like Bioshock, which is a good thing, as these are great games,\n\nThe story is excellent, twisting and turning and genuinely interesting. A little less philisophical than Bioshock, this game leans more on theoratical science than political theorum, and that's a good thing, as the questions raised settle into the experience instead of overwhelming it. DLC are worth buying, maybe not the challenge pack, but the story ones are definitely worth a play, especially for fans of the first game, and have very strong stories of their own.\n\nSound, visuals, gameplay, voice acting, soundtrack, story, this game is a fantastic work of art and a very fun and satisfying experience.

Eski Bioshockları bundan önce oynamayı denesem de bi türlü ısınamamıştım. Lakin Bioshock Infinite daha oyunun başında insanı kendine çekmeyi başarıyor. Belki de bendeki hafif klostrofobi yüzünden Columbia, Rapture'a göre daha iyi gelmiştir. Çünkü Columbia'nın atmosferi tam anlamıyla muhteşem. Bulutların üzerinde aydınlık rengarenk bi şehir. Etraftaki insanların eğlenceli tavırları, uçan binaların birbirinin yanından geçişi, ara sıra kenetlenmeleri vs oturup şehri izlemek bile insana büyük bir heyecan veriyor.\n\nOyun eski serisinde de olduğu gibi ütopik bi ortamda geçiyor. Para için kurtarmak istediğimiz Elizabeth bi süre sonra kankimiz oluyor. Bu kız bi oyunda bulup bulabileceğiniz en iyi yol arkadaşı. Muhabbetleri çok iyi, yardımını hiç eksik etmiyor ve mükemmel bi ses aktörü seslendirmiş. Mimikleri sizi oyun boyunca gülümsetmeyi başarıyor. Kızdığı zaman bile acayip tatlı oluyor. Elimi monitörden uzatıp yanağını sıkasım geliyor :)\n\nBu oyunun beğenmediğim kısmı düşmanların çok sığ ve öldürmenin zevksiz olması. Boss fightlar idare eder, loot sistemi ise hiç eğlenceli değil. Elder Scrolls oyunları gibi bulduğunuz her taşın altına bakıyorsunuz ama genelde bulduklarınız ya para ya yiyecek oluyor. Kısa bi süre sonra oyundaki bütün silahları bulmuş ve aynı düşmanları tekrar tekrar öldürmekten bıkmış halde bulabilirsiniz kendinizi. Özellikle oyunda işlerin ters gitmesinden sonra(spoiler vermemek için fazla açmıyorum) oyun bana çok sıkıcı gelmeye başlamıştı. Özellikle ordan oraya koşturup tekrar aynı yere döndüğümüz bölümler beni acayip bunalttı. Ama oyunun son 1 saati için aynı şeyi söyleyemem. Oyunun sonunda kafanızın çok karışacağını garanti edebilirim. Çünkü bu son 1 saatte ağzımdan sürekli WTF! cümlesi eksik olmadı. Bitince de hafif bir boşluk hissettim açıkçası.\n\nSonuç:\n\nOyun kesinlikle herkes tarafından alıp oynanmalı. Atmosfer olağanüstü, çizimler, karakterler mükemmel. Yol arkadaşımız çok tatlı ve oyunu çoğunlukla o taze tutuyor. Ara bölüm geçişleri genelde insanın ağzını açık bırakmayı başarıyor. Ama oyunun düşman çeşitliliği bana az geldi, rpg unsurları da çok sığ ve sıkıcı. Kanca ile havada gezdiğimiz bölümler başta zevkliyken sonra sıkıcı bir hal almaya başlıyor.
