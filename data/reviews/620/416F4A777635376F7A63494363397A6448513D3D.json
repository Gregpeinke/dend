Bir fan gibi düşünerek, bunların yaptığı oyunların hepsi iyidir diye bir yorumda bulunacak değilim ama. Sadece bunu neden tavsiye ettiğimi belirtebilirim.\n\nOyunun konusu bakımından Half Life serisi ile bir bağlantısı var zaten. Hatta Portal sadece bir bulmaca oyunu olarak değerlendirilip Half Life'ın ilerideki oyunu için kullanılacak (Gravity Gun gibi) bir silah olduğu söylentileri vardı ama herkes Portal'ı çok sevdi ve devamı geldi. \n\nBenim en çok ilgimi çeken kısmı oyunda TR altyazı seçeneğinin de olması oldu (ayrıca Steam'da Half Life 2'de Türkçeleştirildi, diğer oyunlarda da bunu bekliyoruz eheheh). Diğer iyi yönlerini de maddeler halinde yazacağım:\n\n-Çeşitli bulmacaları çözmek oldukça eğlenceli. Özellikle bulmacaların yanında GLaDOS'un ilk oyundaki fiş acısı (kuyruk acısı hesabı) nedeniyle bize ikide bir laf sokması vs daha da keyifli bir hâle getiriyor olayı.\n\n-Wheatley adındaki robo yardımcımızın gevezeliği de konuşmayan karakterimizin sessizliğini unutturuyor (Gordon'un kayıp ikizi sanırım bu kadın).\n\n-Özellikle multiplayer kısmı arkadaşlarla oynamak için çok keyifli. Minik robotlarımızın (multideki) şaklabanlıkları ayrı bir keyifli oluyor. Ayrıca oyundaki mic olayı sayesinde (multi oyunların vazgeçilmezi diyebiliriz artık) arkadaşlara laf sokmak vs oldukça eğlenceli. En güzeli de oyundan sıkılsanız bile arkadaşınıza geçeceği bir portal açıp onu suyun dibine gönderebilmeniz ya da parçalara ayrılmasına neden olabilmeniz.\n\nİlk oyundaki çizgisinden bir şey kaybetmeyip, aksine üstüne bir şeyler koymuş olması da yeterince iyi bence.\n\nYukarıda söylediğim gibi oyunda TR altyazı seçeneğinin olması yeterince güzel bir olay. Almanızı tavsiye ediyorum o yüzden.","timestamp_created":1385726215,"timestamp_updated":1385726215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":54,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.825159907341003418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7820704","author":{"steamid":"76561198056159983","num_games_owned":375,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4278,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3419,"last_played":1563639841},"language":"english","review":"Excellent game, and incredible replay value because the Workshop levels keep amazing me and my co-op buddies.","timestamp_created":1385715472,"timestamp_updated":1385715472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7820654","author":{"steamid":"76561197970181481","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2015,"last_played":1607620228},"language":"french","review":"epic game","timestamp_created":1385715047,"timestamp_updated":1385715047,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7820569","author":{"steamid":"76561198043993712","num_games_owned":418,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":185,"last_played":1386572613},"language":"english","review":"After Half Life, Portal will be the best thing Valve came up with.
