Oh, and a crowbar.\n\nA major issue with the game is the sound system. Such as in the opening sequence when you're on the rail system. The slightest twitch and you can't hear what the announcer is saying, even though you are in the same position. \n\nHowever, this can be overlooked because there is not a lot of Dialouge and you're mainly whacking stuff with a crowbar.\n\nThis is an amazing FPS that has actually held up quite well in terms of gameplay since it was released.
