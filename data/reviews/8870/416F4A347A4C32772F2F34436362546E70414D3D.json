A lot of the criticism it has been getting lately is somewhat warranted, but none of those things actually ruined my experience of it. Having only two guns at a time never really bothered me, since I always have my favorites either way, though that is definitely a personal preference. The story is confusing yes, but I don't think it doesn't make sense at all either. I definitely didn't think the ending was rushed as some others think, since we've gotten so many hints throughout the game, from the very beginning. Some flaws in logic are to be expected though, from a story like this one. My biggest complaint is probably the weapon upgrade system, but having beaten it on hard difficulty, even that only became a real problem at the end, when I couldn't refill my favorite guns with ammo anymore. Otherwise, I think it's still a great game, and worth playing, if you haven't played it yet.","timestamp_created":1645200472,"timestamp_updated":1645200472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110497733","author":{"steamid":"76561198865381021","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":2521,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1957,"last_played":1657836828},"language":"english","review":"if you are a GAMER, this GAME is a must PLAY","timestamp_created":1645198712,"timestamp_updated":1645198712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110497577","author":{"steamid":"76561198126179416","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1243,"last_played":1645196985},"language":"schinese","review":"非常棒的剧情体验，但是我也好奇如果游戏中的伊丽莎白会被击伤，需要我们保护，那么对角色塑造是否会产生影响。","timestamp_created":1645198556,"timestamp_updated":1645198556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110495910","author":{"steamid":"76561198053173459","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1300,"last_played":1561355056},"language":"koreana","review":"갓-겜","timestamp_created":1645196818,"timestamp_updated":1645196818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110494257","author":{"steamid":"76561198851307763","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":299,"playtime_at_review":3845,"last_played":1660581292},"language":"russian","review":"Однозначно рекомендовано к покупке!

See, on the surface, the game may seem to be anti-christian, or even anti-religion, with one of the main antagonist being a cult leader and a fanatic. At least that how I felt when I did my first playthrough, seeing how the zealous minds were destroying humanity. But when I reached the end, I began to realise that this game was far more biblical than I had thought. It discusses what it truly means to atone for your sins, and the sacrifice that has to come with it. Only then, can you be \"reborn\". Its story parallels the journey of the Christ, \"to be crucified and rise again\", and draws influence from the famous \"Crime and Punishment\", just like its predecessor Bioshock 1. \n\nOverall, this is an excellent game, one of the few FPS campaigns that makes me want to play it again.

The main asset here is the story, which is really stunning and makes you think. And that, to me, is what a really good game can do. Content that makes you think about your experiences. \n\nThe game falls down on some gameplay elements and moment-to-moment action. There are too many stretches of defense in 3 waves, our princess is a tower in other scenarios, etc, and most of the heavy gunfights come mid-game. Throughout the middle it's a constant stream of room to room fights, which gets tedious, but the controls are solid enough and the weapons are enjoyable enough that it never spoils the game.\n\nThe voice and writing performances here are simply top notch, and not just from the main cast.\n\nThat being said, this is one of those games that will leave you thinking, contemplating, and trying to wrap your mind around the ideas and story elements the game just unleashed on you. It's an emotional story and the characters are relatable enough to make you like them.

Таки зайдя на страницу данного продукта, по описанию я понял, что это динамичный шутер а-ля Doom Eternal без бесов но с глубоким сюжетом. В шутеры от первого лица я особо не играл (лишь пара-тройка игр на подобии Left 4 Dead и Fallout), поэтому было интересно опробовать столь экзотичный для меня жанр. Купил, прошёл за 11 часов. Что я могу сказать? Это шедевр, это просто шедевр игровой индустрии. Столь гениальные проекты мне удавалось проходить не часто, в их список я могу ввести Warcraft 3, Fallout 3, Blasphemous, Cuphead и Portal 2. Такие игры вызывают неподдельный восторг, детское восхищение, глубокие думы после прохождения и наиприятнейшие ощущения во время и после игры. Bioshock Infinite это образцовый пример для подражания, ибо тут идеально почти всё - сюжет, графика, геймплей, персонажи, музыка, локации - всё на высочайшем уровне. Сюжетные повороты и кульбиты затягивают словно прекрасная книга, динамичный шутер не даёт расслабиться а персонажи заставляют сопереживать им. В этой игре нет отъявленных злодеев или правых во всём героев - тут каждый в чём то по-своему прав и неправ одновременно.\nЭто гениально, это шедевр. И даже не смотря на дату выхода игры (2013 год) - она все равно удивляет своей графикой, и ничуть не уступает современным играм по качеству. Несомненно эта игра - один из немногих самородков игровой индустрии, обязательно советую к ознакомлению.","timestamp_created":1645038058,"timestamp_updated":1645437114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110373415","author":{"steamid":"76561198310911617","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":493,"last_played":1645034592},"language":"schinese","review":"听闻是好游戏，所以来回顾经典。游戏是不错，但是这个游戏晕3D是真的严重。。。。不得已只能修改器通关，看剧情。晕3D真是老大难了。","timestamp_created":1645035150,"timestamp_updated":1645035150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110372917","author":{"steamid":"76561198040876715","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1645045279},"language":"english","review":"This is one of the best Shooters with a story worth paying attention to.

The reviews are glowing possitive though so either people stopped giving a shit long ago like I did and forgave it or plain forgot. Or more likely people stopped treating it like what it's title says it is; Bioshock, and rate it based on what it is: A pretty to look at, mutant bastard offshoot of a faithful reimagining that was simplified and trimmed of all but the essential fats and and given a family name instead of making up its own.\n\nMy first playthrough back at release, I remeber being grumpy and just rushing through it after realising what I was in for so most of it's a blur. The only things I managed to remember was heavenly americana late 1800's city, time period apropriate racism and labour laws representation and oddly missing sexism; female soldiers and swimsuits less modest than than their hubbies? Not 'til the day I see you vote let alone carry your own coin purse, dear.\n\nMy second playthrough, now 8 years later. I took my time, ate every snack, opened every thing that could, noticed Elizabeth scatman spaz out and teleport around enough times to just start justifying it with; It's her time and space powers so there's about a 100 of her with me at all times. My overall expierience was just as bland and forgetable as then.\n\nLame, but knowing they had to cut back on so much content and gameplay. What we got is...A mediocre action shooter with rigid and minimal impact arena resource manipulation: Weapons, meds and turrets instead of saaaaay a train, crowd or  a path like we see Elizabeth do in non-combat scripted scenes.\n\nThe rushed pace of the story really kicks you in the groin if you have a love for multiverse/time travel story telling. It flashes  quite a few cool things that the..ummm, genre(?)....has, but leaves it at that or plain disregards it like they do all of main cast. The story uses too many instruments and skips far too many notes to be forgiveably good. It's a passable story not because it shows or tells it to you, but because you already know what it's trying to tell you by knowing the genre and thus filling its blanks for it.","timestamp_created":1644967098,"timestamp_updated":1644967098,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526726424694061279","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110320272","author":{"steamid":"76561199019051591","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":618,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":618,"last_played":1644959247},"language":"schinese","review":"神作！花了两个晚上玩完 就是这结局是真没想到   呜呜","timestamp_created":1644960173,"timestamp_updated":1644960173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110315553","author":{"steamid":"76561198412790378","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":715,"last_played":1644954945},"language":"spanish","review":"dios mio que buen puto juego, es buenisimo jueguenlo","timestamp_created":1644954967,"timestamp_updated":1644954967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110314344","author":{"steamid":"76561198910459828","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":852,"last_played":1643583903},"language":"latam","review":"Bioshock infinite es un spin-off de la saga Bioshock, en esta entrega nos adentráremos en una ciudad en las nubes, con un nuevo protagonista y una trama que se entrelaza con las anteriores. \n\nLo Bueno \nSu trama: Infinite cuenta con un nuevo protagonista, nuevos personajes, un nuevo escenario y una nueva trama que se va desarrollando a medida que pasa el tiempo, es una narrativa muy bien elaborada con sus puntos positivos y negativos. En la cual con sus DLC logra tener ese mayor impacto entrelazando con sus entregas anteriores y logrando un gran final para esta saga.\nLa Ambientación: Rapture presentaba una atmosfera fría, desolada y oscura en cambio Columbia es todo lo contrario, es alegre, colorida, te da la sensación que nada malo puede suceder, y tiene su gran encanto en mi opinión personal me gusto más esta ciudad que la de Rapture, sus escenarios tienen un estilo de los años 80 mezclado con una artictectura francesa.\nElisabeth: De algo que carecía las entregas anteriores era la de presentar personajes entrañables, la mayoría eran bastante simples sin mucha profundidad, pero en esta entrega cambia, conocemos a Elisabeth una joven la cual no va a estar acompañando durante todo el viaje, y de que nos vamos a encariñar, tiene aquella profundidad para interesarnos en ella, además cuanta con una personalidad muy encantadora y aquella inocencia de una niña.\nGamplay: Su gamplay fue completamente mejorado, en los primeros juegos se sentía un tanto tosco y lento también puede ser por el pasar de los años, pero en este juego lo renovaron bastante es mucho más rápido, el usar las armas y los poderes se siente mucho mejor, entre otras mejoras más.\n\nLo Meh\nBanda sonora: La música y los efectos que posee son bastante normales, no te deja tampoco queriendo descargar su música, lo que si el doblaje de vos me gustó mucho.\n\nLo Malo \nSu gran complejidad en la trama: En mi ocasión me jugué los 3 juegos seguidos, me terminaba uno e iba al siguiente, y algo que me costó bastante es lograr entender su trama correctamente, presenta una trama muy profunda demasiado en algunos aspectos lo cual no está mal, pero siento que a veces te podes lograr perder incluso si estas presentando atención a la misma durante todo el tiempo, al final para lograrla entenderla bien tuve que acudir a ver unos videos en YouTube.\n\nOpinión\nEs una saga la cual me ha gustado mucho jugarla, teniendo una hermosa ambientación, que es lo que más me ha gustado y una trama muy profunda y bastante buena.\n\nHistoria: 9/10\nGamplay: 8/10\nApartado técnico: 9/10\nAmbientación: 10/10\nOptimización: 8/10\nValoración: 9,3/10\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1644953732,"timestamp_updated":1644953732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110313961","author":{"steamid":"76561198239746906","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1649770683},"language":"english","review":"Gooooodd gameeeeeeee","timestamp_created":1644953327,"timestamp_updated":1644953327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110312257","author":{"steamid":"76561199149335962","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":869,"last_played":1644789055},"language":"russian","review":"Супер!
