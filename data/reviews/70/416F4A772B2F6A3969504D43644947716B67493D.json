However, I had a huge problem with difficulty which in turn effects gameplay. I decided to play on normal and the game was grueling for me. The first 2-3 hours are pretty good. After this point however it takes a turn for the worst. The last 8 hours are really difficult. This is due to a few different factors. First and foremost, there seems to be a health or damage issue where there’s either A not enough health through base health or through healing stations or B the enemies just do too much damage. I suppose another issue could be too many enemies at once. That’s the thing after hour 5 or halfway through the game give or take your health will always be below 50. Your just constantly 1 hit away from dying at every single point. It also doesn’t help that this game has a lot of jumping puzzles. As the game goes on you will find yourself saving every 5 steps. Its just extremely annoying. Now again its hard to say because this is classic valve gameplay nothing wrong with it on paper its just way too difficult for little to no reason. I also want to mention that the game is extremely detailed for a game made in 1998. The puzzles are generally good, and I never really had a problem with them. It’s just the combat that became an issue.\nPlot 8/10 Very Good\nThe plot at the beginning and ending of the game is good. The middle isn’t necessarily bad but there’s a lack of explanation as to what’s going on. You kind of start randomly going to locations just because someone told you to up until the end where you solve the problem at hand. The story that is there however is good. \nSetting: 9/10 Great \nBlack mesa is an extremely cool location. Just endless labs and facility. I don’t know what exactly it is about it but its so cool.  As mentioned earlier the game is also extremely detailed. It really makes the world feel more interesting.\nMusic 6/10 Decent\n There isn’t a lot of music but its okay for the most part. It was really cool hearing certain themes that I’ve always wondered about such as the Valve logo theme on all of its titles. I will say there is a lack of music which does affect the score but as I said the music that I did hear was okay.\nOverall 7/10 Good\nOverall I would recommend this game. I personally think it’s a pretty crazy game for the time. However objectively I think its just a good game nothing special. However, it’s certainly not bad. The best way to describe it is if your sure you want this game you probably will like it. However, if you’re not 100% just wait for a steam sale where it goes down to like $1.79 which is how much I got it for.

It's Half-Life. Almost every FPS game released after this game owes something to it.\n\nUnlike many other historically important shooters, such as Doom or Quake, Half-Life's gameplay holds up pretty well in comparison to today's FPS fare, probably because it was so influential that other games since have simply followed its example. The gunfights are an addictive mix of frenzied improvisation and tactical planning, and the game's pacing is excellent (at least up until the unfortunate Xen chapters, which murder the pacing somewhat in its final 20% or so.)\n\nIn any case, this game is well worth the $2 it goes down to on sale. The question, then, is which version to buy; the original (as I am reviewing here), the Source port, or Black Mesa. Half-Life: Source is pretty much the same game but with the tradeoff of better box physics in exchange for more bugs and costing five times as much. Black Mesa is a totally different game, and not really my cup of tea; for my money, you should experience the original before deciding whether to try Black Mesa's reimagining.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone with an interest in first-person shooters, past or present. It holds up, and for as little as it costs, you're not taking much of a risk on whether you enjoy it or not.

It's extremely hard to get back into, I first played this game upon near release back in 1999 on my Win98 pc. Which I'm happy I still own the CD. I thought it was one of the most amazing experience I've played then since Mario 64. Fast Forward 21 years later and.......well my memories were nostalgic as is with most old games. Just as many games of yesteryear the controls are very difficult. I think I struggled more with the controls than the actual enemies. I got through  70% of the game until I gave up and activated God mode. You'll want to save before every long jump too as platforming is hard. Still, I give it a recommendation as this is the game that started it all. It's worth a visit if you've never played it. Now that I think about it, I don't honestly know if you NEED to play the game if you can just read up on the synopsis. I've read you need to play it and I had felt the same until I actually replayed the game. It's a trip down memory lane if nothing else. It'll definitely make you appreciate the evolution of gaming, including the sequels.

Overall: You are a drug addict, quick save is your cocaine. You can set bind keys to quick save and load a quick save. Difficulty ramped up about half way through and then some near the end: didn't seem very linear. Having a health bar makes you live with your mistakes as you progress. A problem when the game expect you are on high HP, but you actually are not. There are better games out there, only play this if you want to continue through the series.
