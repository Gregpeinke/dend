The characters are realistic and you will develop emotional feelings for them whether positive or negative. Furthermore, the atmosphere is immersing and unique and the graphics really capture the game's world. The soundtrack only adds to the games narrative causing you to feel different emotions at just the right times. \n\nSo what about the gameplay? The gameplay isn't this games strong suit. It is fun but gets repetitive simple as that really, by mid-late game you will probably be getting bored with the combat. This is partly because the story is so amazing that you don't want to be bogged down by combat and you constantly are. One of the boss battles in this game is recycled multiple times which is dissapointing and annoying. That said, the rarer enemies are lots of fun to fight and some have a lore of their own: namely the Handyman. Furthermore, there are tons of different guns and vigors and while some are definetly better than others they are all fun to use. The sky-lines are a awesome addition and add a new layer to the combat. The gameplay is good nothing outstanding but not bad either. \n\nThis is one of the best games I have ever played and I reccomend it to everyone. Don't let what I said about the gameplay deter you the story more than makes up for the gameplay's shortcomings. Few games have touched me the way this game has and since playing it I have read all the lore. If you get it I would suggest searching for the Voxophones and taking your time it really adds to the game.

But it's difficult for me to find faults in the visual and audio aesthetics of the world, and even harder to find a game that has better.\n Nostalgia plays a large role in why I come back to this game consistently, but the iconic landmarks, environments, and musical covers delight me every time.

But to call it a bioshock game is almost unforgivable.\n\nMany call this game innovative and  I think the contrary, to me at least the game feels like a generic FPS. You can only carry two weapons at a time instead of carying them all, all the weapons lack innovation, and the melee weapon was a simple button press when in the first and second they were seperate weapons you had to equip. Plus a freaking sinper rifle in 1912!? are you kidding me?\n\nEven the sci fi elements lack any interest, the vigors feel generic, most just stun the opponent or are grenades, one just lets you hack machines with no effort. Which brings me to the point that they removed hacking. In the first two you had to go through a mini game to hack machines to fight for you and if failed can deal heavy damage to you. In this you press a button and it fights for you... woo hoo\n\nA lot of people really liked elizabeth but to me she made the game way too easy, when ever I am about to run out of ammo (I used the sniper for everything due to it's one hit kill) she would miraculously find more ammo, I never ran out of ammo. plus her \"powers\" were usually to summon a weapon or health, far from what I expected from these abilities and the explaination was a complete cop out.\n\nAnd speaking of the story it is more \"lets use theoretical physics so we don't have to explain anything\" than actual good writing, the prime example is the fact that Fink stole plasmids from suchong which was fifty years in the future, and the reasoning? The \"paralel world mumbo jumbo\" I myself think it's a cover up so they could make this game in 1912 but still have it be bioshock because there are plasmids.\n\nAnd the setting angers me the most. Rapture was the setting for the first two games and was a dark and claustraphobic war torn underwater city where you were fighting for your life to find out why youre there. In this your in a colorful land where the scariest thing is those godforsaken vending machines with faces. *shudders* And speaking of vending machines I usually ignored them becuase if I needed something Elizabeth would get it for me when I need it. I used my money to buy Vigors (Which by the way they completely removed the ADAM system) And my final thing is the fact that there is a sheild in my bioshock game, this isnt borderlands, just no.","timestamp_created":1423971942,"timestamp_updated":1423971942,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.43266633152961731","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14474878","author":{"steamid":"76561198064460366","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":645,"last_played":1424477988},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game, amazing story line, amazing plot twist.","timestamp_created":1423969951,"timestamp_updated":1423969951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14474323","author":{"steamid":"76561198166222639","num_games_owned":571,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":835,"last_played":1428549502},"language":"turkish","review":"senaryosu güzel oynanışıda güzel\ngüzel bir oyun yani oynayın sizde beğenirsiniz","timestamp_created":1423966496,"timestamp_updated":1527322431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14472979","author":{"steamid":"76561198015082998","num_games_owned":529,"num_reviews":230,"playtime_forever":2213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1218,"last_played":1596183920},"language":"russian","review":"Геймплейные функции Элизабет не исчерпываются услаждением наших глаз.

The combat however was very repetitive and I've heard is the worse of the three Bioshock games but still worth a play in my opinion even if it's just for the sick views.","timestamp_created":1423785030,"timestamp_updated":1423785030,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14436292","author":{"steamid":"76561198118389791","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":729,"last_played":1525153406},"language":"koreana","review":"뛰어난 그래픽과 최적화 거기에다가 게임성과  놀라운 스토리로 바이오쇼크 인피니트는 게이머의 마음을 사로잡는 작품이다\n","timestamp_created":1423676101,"timestamp_updated":1423676101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14434360","author":{"steamid":"76561198106521209","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1087,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1084,"last_played":1561793517},"language":"russian","review":"Класный шутер , с хорошое историей.","timestamp_created":1423667337,"timestamp_updated":1423667337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14433275","author":{"steamid":"76561198033814090","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":396,"last_played":1423729517},"language":"english","review":"All I can say is 10/10","timestamp_created":1423662073,"timestamp_updated":1423662073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14431869","author":{"steamid":"76561198064538748","num_games_owned":353,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":776,"last_played":1475659965},"language":"english","review":"Beautiful imagery, Intricate storyline that unravells as the game prgresses.

No other city has ever fascinated me quite as much as Rapture, but Columbia is the next best thing to lose yourself in. Although the atmosphere of the game loses much of its characteristic intensity in the change of scenery from underwater to up in the sky, going from an action game with a touch of horror to full-on adventurous action is not as disappointing as it is refreshing. The storyline is very compelling in its twists and turns will certainly give you food for thought. I personally do not care for the change in gameplay and mostly find Elizabeth distracting in her attempts to help Booker but have to commend the way her character develops according to the player’s choices. As for the DLCs, while I found part 1 of Burial at Sea absolutely brilliant and essential to my overall understanding of the Bioshock series, part 2 was slightly disappointing, even though the stealth was surprisingly enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1423613784,"timestamp_updated":1423620082,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14426058","author":{"steamid":"76561198011479695","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":339,"last_played":1474251900},"language":"english","review":"convoluted plot, got it on a sale, has good water reflections and texture, but the combat interaction between booker and Elizabeth was removed other than summoning things that do little to change the battle. \n\nIts worth atleast 15 bucks tops if you ever plan on buying it. \n\nThe universal constants could of been more interesting plot line but it gets rediculous at the end and face various spoilerific plotholes. the remodeling the characters went under was mostly asked by outsiders who dont even play games, sort of got rid of the old visual charm. Tying all the stories together is a minefield while combat felt forced and very linear.\n\nBioshock 2's Minervas den has better plot, and even then thats a dlc.
