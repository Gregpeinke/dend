I've had the pleasure of diving back into the world of Gordon Freeman and I must say that it still holds up. For a game that has aged over ten years, the nostalgia is definetly inescapable. After pressing the \"New Game\" option, I was happily reinvited by the notorious, mysterious, and ethereal like G-Man who was only so happy to see my return aswell. At mine and Gordon Freeman's expense, we were allowed to rediscover the world of Half-Life where humanity has been enslaved by a super advanced race of extra terrestrials who entered our world through the means of teleportation that humanity had previously uncovered and prescipitated the resonance cascade event during Half-Life 1.\n\nThe graphics and detail are still appreciated and admired by this reviewer. Although dated, it's easy to understand why Gabe Newell (Half-Life's creator) was happy with his Source engine. Even today I can lose myself in well mapped areas and enemies that will stop at almost nothing to bring down the Freeman. The sounds of gunfire and explosion still hold an amazing level of quality, especially when you're in the midst of a firefight against Combine forces and the human/vortigaunt rebels who seek to take back their worlds from their oppressive overlords. The feeling of dropping enemies in their tracks with a shotgun or any of the others assortment of weapons is memorable and satifying. You truly feel like a force to be reckoned with.\n\nVehicles and other mountables are implemented very well into the world, and rarely do you find any issues with them. Sometimes you may find the occasional hiccup where your boat or buggy will hit some innocuous object in the ground or sticking out of wall, but it's negligible since it's so much darn fun. However, transitional maps can ruin that intense feeling of speed and chases with loading times that seem to come far too often. Half-Life 2 is a game from over a decade ago, so it's forgivable. Ai also does has it's ups and downs. At most times they can coordinate well and truely give you a formidable fight, but at other times they just seem so daft when they have issues navigating their way through a doorway or any other bottlenecked areas. It's funny to see enemies push through areas like the Stooges having a bad day sometimes.\n\nHalf-Life 2 holds itself together well in an age where games are being pushed out faster and faster through the factory belt. We can only hope for a sequel and give it many praises for being a foundation of many other successful games.","timestamp_created":1420220010,"timestamp_updated":1420225476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13788299","author":{"steamid":"76561198039468750","num_games_owned":1707,"num_reviews":114,"playtime_forever":914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":914,"last_played":1420317707},"language":"schinese","review":"[h1]优点[/h1]\n射击游戏的基础设定奠定者之一。\n出色的剧本。\n优秀的画面（以2004年而言）。\n\n[h1]缺点[/h1]\n部分关卡有严重的光影故障。（可通过添加启动参数解决）\n\n[h1]打分[/h1]\n[b]9/10[/b]（第一人称射击·近未来·动作）\n\n[h1]评价[/h1]\n不朽的经典《半条命》系列，它以及它的兄弟反恐精英是一个时代的开端。\n我只说一句话：跪求数3。","timestamp_created":1420218536,"timestamp_updated":1420722369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":34,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.757544279098510742","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13787868","author":{"steamid":"76561198059328881","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":910,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":903,"last_played":1598327601},"language":"english","review":"It's Half Life 2...need I say more?","timestamp_created":1420217485,"timestamp_updated":1420217502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13787848","author":{"steamid":"76561198140588178","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1271,"last_played":1466564727},"language":"english","review":"Enjoy living the life of a fugitive?
