The concept is simple but brilliant: you’re trapped in the labs of Aperture Science and you have to get out. To assist you you’re given a portal gun. The gun opens doorways in almost any surface. Once you have full control of the gun you can create blue and amber portals. Step into the blue one and you emerge from the amber one, step into the amber one and you emerge from the blue one. By positioning the portals in certain ways you can step, jump,  or fall huge distances. You can also use them to redirect lasers and bullets, which you must do in order to stay alive. All through your efforts to escape you’re teased and goaded by GLaDoS, the AI that runs the lab. As with all Valve games the writing is excellent, with GLaDoS delivering some perfectly-pitched lines (and a cute little song at the end). Each challenge is more difficult than the last but none is so frustrating as to annoy, and all are satisfying when solved. My only criticism is that the maps lack variety as you travel from one austere lab to another, or from one utility area to another (this appears to have been addressed in Portal 2, which offers a wider range of environments). All-in-all this is one of the most imaginative games I’ve ever encountered. Check out the Orange Box though, because this offers the excellent Half-Life 2 games and Portal as a bundle and is great value.\n\n4/5","timestamp_created":1385912985,"timestamp_updated":1385912985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539419054985046387","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7864774","author":{"steamid":"76561198093607565","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":275,"last_played":1542459893},"language":"french","review":"Un puzzle game excellent avec au moins 5 h de jeu pour terminer l'histoire plus les defis et les cartes bonus....
