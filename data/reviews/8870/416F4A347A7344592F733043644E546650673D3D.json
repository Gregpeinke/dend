Присутствие нескольких очень важных компонентов, которые неразрывно связаны друг с другом:\n\n1) Потрясающий многогранный сюжет. Причем, настолько необычный, что удивляешься постоянно. В сюжете просто масса отсылок к различной литературе, физике, философии и т.д.\n2) Атмосфера. Необычный город в облаках. Причем, игра не может похвастаться какими-то новейшими технологиями. Графика намеренно сделана немного мультяшной. Но в этом и есть шарм этой игры. Под внешней несерьезной оболочкой скрывается очень глубокая эмоциональная драма.\n3) Персонажи. О да, здесь это главная изюминка игры.\n4) Внезапно очень даже разнообразный геймплей, который часто становится просто ураганным, т.к. на квадратном метре происходит столько всего, что не успеваешь крутить мышкой. И самое неожиданное то, что довольно простая механика шутера вплетена в сюжет так, что появляется четкая связь между игроком и главной героиней. Приведу пример, который  меня приятно удивил. В одном из эпизодов игры главные герои на время расстаются (не по своей воле). Вы настолько привыкаете, что в самый разгар боя Элизабет вам всегда подкинет обойму или аптечку или еще что-то (это очень классная находка, т.к. меня лично не раз выручала в самых казалось безисходных ситуациях, учитывая, что я проходил игру на максимальном уровне сложности), что когда внезапно исчезает такая поддержка, становится не то что трудно, а очень неуютно и некомфортно. Не знаю даже, как правильно выразить эту эмоцию, но я именно в этот момент осознал, насколько сюжет и геймплей сближает игрока с главной героиней. Без неё всё кажется неправильным. Не хватает её присутствия, разговоров, помощи и т.д. После этого ради Элизабет игрок готов положить целые армии, только чтобы она была рядом. Шикарный момент.\n\nВ общем и целом, отличная игра. В каком-то смысле это шедевр. А если не согласны, то покажите мне другую игру подобного уровня. Кроме Half-Life 2 конечно. Таких по пальцам одной руки можно пересчитать. Жалею, что не прошел Биошок раньше. Определенно очень свежо и необычно смотрится на фоне ежегодного конвейера от других студий. Для многих игра стала прямо-таки откровением, и я прекрасно понимаю, почему. Это штучный продукт, уникальный в своём роде. В шутерах не бывает таких сюжетов и такой проработки. Откровенно говоря, и в других жанрах такое редко встретишь. А тут – глоток свежего воздуха.

I prefer the idea of a city under-water then I did of a city in the sky, plus the \"Big-Daddy\" in BioShock 1 is way more badass looking then some of the creatures they came up with in Infinite.\n\nI got the chance to grab this game on sale for $14 and tried it out. Many of the reviews said amazing things about it and a lot of my friends said they loved it.\n\nAll in all, I wasnt very impressed. BioShock 1 is one of my favourite games of all time, and left me with a \"WOW\" feeling when I finished the game. Infinite did not do it for me. The campaign has one of the most confusing, and odd endings in any game ive ever played (to the point where I literally needed to google wtf happened when the game ended). There really arent any new/interesting weapons for the most part, and I found that the game puts more of the focus on upgrading/using weapons as opposed to powers/vigor. One of the most fun parts of BioShock 1 was blasting enemies away with electricty spikes or some other effect of Vigor, I feel like the Vigor is not as powerful in Infinite or something because it just isnt as much fun to use as it was in BioShock 1...\n\nThe game is alright, and for someone new to the series im sure they would enjoy this. But I wasnt super impressed with the story and the confusing ending (which had a TON of hype leading up to it) was a huge let down. The focus was taken away from the super cool 'Vigor' powers the player is given, and they werent as much fun to use anymore. If youve played BioShock 1 and 2, I wouldnt bother with this game IMO.\n\n/rant","timestamp_created":1434509017,"timestamp_updated":1434509172,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50380939245223999","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16460287","author":{"steamid":"76561198120942236","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":264,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1434423837},"language":"english","review":"I'm only partway through the game, but it is turning out to be one of the most beautiful, compelling games i've played to date.","timestamp_created":1434507090,"timestamp_updated":1434507090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16459412","author":{"steamid":"76561198036597754","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1635,"last_played":1434682347},"language":"english","review":"everyone one has cake on them, and there is a bundle of money in the trash cans.\n\n11/10 would check every body and every trash can again.\n\nThe last 1 point is for the amazing storyline.","timestamp_created":1434503570,"timestamp_updated":1434503645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16459076","author":{"steamid":"76561198071221104","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":531,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1492630801},"language":"english","review":"I didn't know what to buy, so I just bought this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm never regreting my purchase.","timestamp_created":1434502141,"timestamp_updated":1434503158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16458964","author":{"steamid":"76561198080381720","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":598,"last_played":1655852598},"language":"english","review":"I came for the story...

BSI isn't the ideal game for someone dipping their toes into gaming like it was for me, but it is great if you're looking for a story that will make you actually think about what's happening, and a story with characters that will make you cry, even if only at the end. The plot isn't without faults - I'm not exactly saying ten stars here - but I personally never thought I'd give a first-person shooter the light of day, and BSI has stretched a lot of what I thought was possible with storytelling and 'lessons' (for lack of a better word) that can be taught within the actual gameplay.\n\nYou'll probably be confused about 70% of the time, and it's definitely one of those games you have to replay a couple of times before fully understanding the meaning of some early lines/plot points. I'm always finding new things to discover in this universe, and new things that make me want to tear my hair out over the obvious foreshadowing. If you're like me and enjoy these kind of plot twist/mindfuck narratives, BSI is great at delivering what it says it will, and the ending actually feels conclusive and deserved.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, I was frustrated plenty of times - playing on a Mac is never going to be a good time - so I'm far from the best person to talk about this or that mechanic or doohickey. But it was fun, and Elizabeth is the best video game companion ever, so no complaints in terms of gameplay difficulty from me. Except the Handymen.
