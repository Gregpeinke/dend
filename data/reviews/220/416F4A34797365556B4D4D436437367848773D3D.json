Witnessing how the Combine have oppressed the people of earth, enforcing their rule, way of life and enslaving those that resist. All of this done without an narrator but through little bits of dialogue as you encounter the citizens of City 17 and what unfolds in front of you on the streets. The Citadel - the headquarters of the Combine - lingers high above, casting a shadow above the entire city, emphasising how hopeless and desperate the situation is for the people. And so, back as Gordon Freeman, you return years after the Black Mesa incident to bring hope back to humanity.\n\nIt has been a pleasure revisiting this universe, seeing the storytelling, the characters, the voice acting, the physics and the mini puzzles that the game throws at you many times throughout the course of the game. The game has aged remarkably well considering it was released in 2004 which honestly still baffles me of how well the technology holds up. The Half Life community still goes strong with even more passion for this game and are constantly creating new mods, a VR one is on the way! \n\nOf course it is not all excellent. The AI is a little bit clunky especially when you are managing a team of your own later on and your companions can get you held up in narrow corridors or stairways as it takes them a moment to move. The gunplay is a little bit outdated and a little frustrating at times. The jumping can also be a little bit annoying when trying to be precise with it. \n\nAll-in-all, for me, the good outweighs the bad.

Even though it IS good and revolutionized the industry at the time in terms of graphics, physics, and interactibility, I still think it's fairly overrated and does have quite a few problems. This is not the best, most perfect game to ever be created in the history of anything ever like a lot of people seem to think. Everyone has already talked about what makes this game good, so if you wanna hear about that just go to pretty much any other review of it. I'm rather going to do something different with this one and list some flaws:\n\n[list]\n[*]It's very gimmicky and tries to be a lot of genres in the same game, but not all of them succeed. Some chapters like Water Hazard and Highway 17 just drag on for far too long and end up feeling like filler.\n\n[*]The AI seems like a real downgrade from Half-Life 1. Fighting the Combine soldiers definitely doesn't feel as fun as fighting the HECU Marines. Watch [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsDM7GKb0xU][u]this video[/u][/url] to have a better understanding of what I mean. In my experience they just kinda ran at me in a straight line, one by one, with no self-preservation in mind, which made the whole combat sandbox extremely boring.\n\n[*]Also, the f*cking resistance members. They tend to be real dumbasses who most of the time don't last a minute during battles and just die by the dozens, and before that happens they're still annoying as hell and block the player's movement a lot because they clinge to Gordon way too much and just keep getting in doorways and it's usually a real hassle to get them to let you through. Antlions do the exact same thing, sometimes I just ended up having to kill them to even be able to walk.\n\n[*]The game has definitely not aged well in terms of aesthetics and art style. It goes for a sort of \"realistic\" look, which ALWAYS ages like milk. Some places can look pretty dull due to blocky geometry, low res textures and bland color palettes. The lighting is also often really bland, which is generally one of the biggest factors that determines if a game will age well or not. Even HL1 had some environments that looked more interesting. I just found the setting to be a little bit blander overall compared to the first game. I much preferred to fight my way through the Black Mesa Facility compared to the places in HL2. Ravenholm still holds up and is probably my favorite place in the entire game and the Citadel is also pretty nice and atmospheric, but most of everything else just feels kind of uninspired.\n\n[*]The level design is just straight-up inferior. Gone is the tight and strategic level design of the original, which was replaced by areas that are far too open, empty and uninteresting.\n\n[*]The game focuses way too much on showing off its physics, which just ends up making it feel like a dated tech demo instead of an actual video-game.\n\n[*]Waaay too many cutscenes. The way the story flows in HL2 just doesn't work very well with a silent protagonist like Gordon, since it feels very weird to just be standing still during the many sequences where the characters dump exposition and you say absolutely nothing. \"Black Mesa East\" is a perfect example of this, and chapters like it are really bad for replayability. I'm not suggesting that Gordon should turn into a voiced protagonist, good heavens no, but rather that they should put less of an emphasis on standing in one place while NPCs dump the narrative on you and focus more on gameplay and game flow and deliver the story through different means.\n\n[*]Very small point, but the whole \"auxiliary power\" mechanic is pretty stupid. Why would the sprint function, the flashlight and the oxygen supply come from the same source? It's just annoying. Also a very petty complaint, but the crosshair is terrible. It's ridiculously small and gets lost very easily when you put it against bright backgrounds.\n\n[*]The weapons aren't as interesting as in the first game, they feel somewhat boring and generic. Where are the satchel charges and the tripmines? I also really miss the alien stuff like the Hivehand and the Snarks, and the experimental sci-fi weapons like the Tau Cannon (which is now attached to the car instead of being portable) and the Gluon Gun.\n\n[*]Enemy variety is lacking. Where are the Bullsquids, the Houndeyes, and the Icthyosaurs? The new zombie types are nice, but they don't really make up for the lack of the other enemies.\n\n[*]The combat doesn't feel all that good or impactful. For starters, where's the gore? Enemies exploded into a million pieces in the original if you dealt enough damage, but now the gore is completely gone with the exception of being able to cut zombies in half with sawblades and being able to gib antlions. Enemy ragdolls usually just fall to the ground in a very unsatisfying way, most weapons sound anemic and severely lack punch and the enemies barely even react to getting shot.\n\n[*]Speaking of bad combat, fighting the Striders is not fun at all and it's usually just a total pain. I mean, hell, it takes SEVEN rockets to bring them down. Difficulty in general is somewhat inconsistent, I found the game to be ridiculously easy for the most part, but then at the final chapters during the battles at City 17 against the Combine and the Striders it just becomes frustratingly hard (I don't know though, maybe I'm just bad).\n\n[*]Continuing upon the last point, the game is made fairly easy by the fact that doing horrible during a gunfight and losing a lot of health doesn't really have a lot of consequences. Those little supply crates that are everywhere are programmed to always give the player exactly what they need, and even if you take those out of the question there's still plenty of health around to get you going. It's just really unbalanced.\n\n[*]Similar to the way health works, I really hate the way the game handles ammo. Your ammo cap for each weapon is severely limited and you'll find yourself running out of ammo extremely fast. Thing is, the game throws so much ammo at your face everywhere you go that it's not even funny. And that's basically the way the game works, you'll use all of the ammo for a weapon in a single fight and you'll get all of it back a minute later, rinse and repeat ad nauseum.\n\n[*]Sucks how you can't shoot friendly NPCs anymore. That really added to the immersion and to the moral ambiguity in the first game, but now you're just hailed as a Messiah who can do no wrong and if you try to shoot anyone your bullets just go right through and they completely ignore it.[/list]\n\nSo yeah, Half-Life 2 does a lot of things right, but it also does a LOT of things wrong. I still enjoy playing it after quite a few playthroughs and I'd say it's a very good game which I do still recommend, even if it is pretty overrated. I really just don't feel like it lives up to the original, which makes me a bit disappointed.

From city streets, underground tunnels, all the way to sandy beaches where you \"shouldn't\" step onto the sand. The gameplay is the classic gun and run Half Life 2 horror with new weapons, new enimies, and tons of new and exciting missions. The game features more achievements then any game I have played and while I have barely done a fraction of them it has by far the best achievements in any game. Some completely change the way you approach a level which leaves the ability for multiple playthroughs without ever getting bored. I can't recommend this game enough for those of you who are a fan of the series or maybe this is just your first one. 10/10 and it still holds up today.
