A wide selection of guns and perks that allow you to develop differnet play styles and contribute to your team. Enemies (Zeds) are for the most part pretty standard, but also unique and challenging in their own way, especilly at the higher difficulties. While not all the maps are great, there are plenty of user generated maps online and Tripwire does an excellent job of providing new maps during their events (which are free!). \n\nI will say I have bought all the DLC and while the character packs are just for aesthetic appeal they're still pretty cool. The weapon packs are solid additions to the arsenal, but are in no way \"pay-to-win.\" \n\nI highly recomend Killing Floor to everyone. :)\n\nNote: One justfied complaint that I hear often is the server set-up. No, it is not great, but at this stage in the game's history, and with a confirmed sequel in the works, I really do not expect the sitution to improve.","timestamp_created":1325465803,"timestamp_updated":1414910808,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4464996","author":{"steamid":"76561198037579823","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":16827,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16582,"last_played":1450504214},"language":"english","review":"Fun game to play with friends, gets pretty crazy on the harder difficulties.
