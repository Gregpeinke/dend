Wir spielen Booker Dewitt, der als Privatdetektiv hohe Wettschulden hat. Um sich wieder reinwaschen soll er in die Wolkenstadt Columbia reisen um dort ein bestimmtes Mädchen namens Elizabeth zu finden und sie nach New York zu bringen. Es gibt sehr viele Magic Moments, aber mehr wird nicht verraten. Als Schlusswort zur Story Ich kann euch versichern das Ende ist eines der besten Enden das ich jemals gesehen hab.\n\nGrafik: Bei der Grafik hatte Ich anfangs wirklich meine bedenken ob mir der neue Grafikstil gefallen wird, aber als ich es ich denn gespielt habe bin ich doch zu dem Entschluss gekommen das der Grafikstil sehr stimmig zur Atmosphäre passt.\n\nSound: Die Soundqualiät ist sehr gut. Der Soundtrack ist zwar nicht so Facettenreich, aber die Kampfthemes so wie die ruhigen Musikstücke sind wirklich wundervoll. Die Musik ist ein echtes Highlight in dem Spiel.\n\nGameplay: Das Gameplay ist sehr gut gelungen. Während der linearen Reise mit Elizabeth Sammelt man wie im ersten Bioshock seine Plasmide auf und hat somit Fähigkeiten die, die Schussgefächte frischer auf einen wirken lassen. Plasmide lassen sich nur mit Salz(dem EVE aus dem ersten Bioshock) benutzen. Ansonsten kann man immer Zwei Waffen gleichzeitig tragen, welche man bei Waffenautomaten upgraden kann. In Columbia gibt es noch überall Schienen die verschiedene Orte verbinden auf denen man sich mit einer \"Skyhook\" einklinken kann und dann auf den Schienen gleiten kann. Es gibt noch sehr viele Boni zu finden. Leute die vieles erkunden wollen können dies tun und sehr viele Hintergrundinformationen sammeln.\n\nAtmosphäre: Die Atmosphäre in Bioshock Infinite ist Fabelhaft. Columbia wird einem sehr gut vorgestellt. Man kann vieles erkunden was die Welt lebhafter darstellt.\n\nFazit: Bioshock Infinite hat meine Erwartungen vollkommen übertroffen, macht sehr vieles richtig und ist fast schon das perfekte Spiel im Shootergenre. Es ist sehr Abwechslungsreich und sehr kreativ  und wenn man merkt das \"Infinite\" kein sinnloser Namenszusatz ist, weiß man dass es etwas ganz besonderes ist. \nMein Spiel des Jahres 2013!\n\nWertung: 10/10 Punkten\n\nEine Review zu den DLCs folgt noch.","timestamp_created":1387577644,"timestamp_updated":1463395137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8152326","author":{"steamid":"76561198035588451","num_games_owned":325,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":609,"last_played":1512944719},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I have ever played and if you have not got it ,you must get it.\n","timestamp_created":1387577364,"timestamp_updated":1387577364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533213675022125244","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8152230","author":{"steamid":"76561197964403222","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":796,"last_played":1387517105},"language":"english","review":"Amazing!","timestamp_created":1387577074,"timestamp_updated":1387577074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8151997","author":{"steamid":"76561197976560328","num_games_owned":510,"num_reviews":103,"playtime_forever":736,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":736,"last_played":1387516033},"language":"english","review":"As with the other Bioshock titles, this one comes with a fantastic story and the setting is a floating city.

This game is both incredibly engaging, rich, and addictive.  Its well written and highly polished in many areas.  From the moment you enter Columbia till the expected 'unexpected' ending you will be at the edge of your seat.  And THATS my only critism for this game.  You are engaged right up to the end...and then just left a bit wanting.  Perhaps the DLC will cure this feeling of wtf you have at the end but it seems to be more a feature by the game developers then a flaw to them.  I also strongly miss the effects of my moral choices having an affect on the game play but in the end this is a minor gripe as well.  Really my only big critism is that the game is so engaging and so thrilling as you play it that when your done...well...your done.  There is the 1999 mode or a bunch of completionists achievements to collect on multiple playthroughs but that ripping and exciting game play of the first play through just...doesn't change.  Nothing new to really see, no choices to go and try the other path, and no multiple endings based on a moral leaning during the game.

The story is well told, but it has some head scratching moments. The graphic, sound and music is stunning. The best enemy is the dangerous Heartbreaker, which made me scream and laugh. Collecting items which is scattered around the levels is time consuming and not fun to do at all. The combat becomes repetitive after a few hours of gameplay (mostly due to the same kind of enemies). Some bugs and glitches (suddenly quitting the game, objectives stuck throughout the entire game, giving an order to lockpick a safe but never happened). It lags sometimes even though my specs are way higher than the recommended specs. There are choice making decisions in this game, but it's far off the scale compared to the great moments in Stanley Parable and Spec Ops: The Line. This game is recommended, because there is no other game out there like it. Its strengths are the storytelling and the exotic environments.

The weapons sound really nice, Especially the shotgun and the rapid fire volley gun (Forgot the name). Here's a trick with the shotgun btw, Hold reload and fire and you'll shoot a bit faster. The burial at sea DLC was really nice. It felt like bioshock 1&2 with the vending machines, gene banks, weapons, and of course, the big daddies. In that DLC was confusion too.

Beautiful design, engaging themes, and entertaining situations. Fast forward to around the sixth hour of gameplay: redundant fights, annoying combat, unsatisfying powers, and (if playing on the highest difficulty) maddeningly frustrating fights with the Handyman. Seriously, if you disagree with me, try to beat the Handyman in one of the last fights on the hardest difficulty. There is nothing gratifying with the combat structure in this game.\n\nMost reviews that I see gush over the game's story. Look, I get it: the idea of alternate universes, travel between them, and consequences of choices that can alter future choices is intriguing. Unfortunately, getting to these themes involved introducing multiple, underdeveloped characters that just seemed like more and more names being thrown at you. The games storyline with the revolution and the overall \"alternate universes\" theme conflicted and annoyed me for the latter part of the game. Fighting animated patriot machines was... dumb. It seemed like the developers felt they could get away with putting any stupid scenario in the game just because in one of the infinite universes it was possible.\n\nI would recommend many other games over Bioshock Infinite. I strongly feel that its success is a product of strong advertising. Not GOTY in terms of atmosphere, story, and combat mechanics.","timestamp_created":1387556613,"timestamp_updated":1387556613,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493885159492492676","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8144211","author":{"steamid":"76561198034233771","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":784,"last_played":1375158487},"language":"english","review":"A beautifully spectacular gaming experience!","timestamp_created":1387556343,"timestamp_updated":1387556343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8144050","author":{"steamid":"76561198069671281","num_games_owned":347,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":811,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":356,"last_played":1388949928},"language":"russian","review":"Рикамендую.","timestamp_created":1387555801,"timestamp_updated":1387555801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8143958","author":{"steamid":"76561198053175545","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":946,"last_played":1519333109},"language":"russian","review":"Очень классная игра!","timestamp_created":1387555572,"timestamp_updated":1387555572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.650838911533355713","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8143854","author":{"steamid":"76561198038357420","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":802,"last_played":1637159051},"language":"english","review":"sale jeu\n","timestamp_created":1387555238,"timestamp_updated":1387555238,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8143829","author":{"steamid":"76561198079640330","num_games_owned":227,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2409,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":457,"last_played":1476463753},"language":"english","review":"Jogo muito bom, ótimos gráficos e proporciona muita diversão.","timestamp_created":1387555167,"timestamp_updated":1387555167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8143786","author":{"steamid":"76561197970534470","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1895,"last_played":1421221047},"language":"english","review":"Is best!","timestamp_created":1387555049,"timestamp_updated":1387555049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8143716","author":{"steamid":"76561198044389017","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":913,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":893,"last_played":1450229277},"language":"english","review":"Engrossing story, beautiful graphics, plot twists and turns.

The combat is snappy and gratifying, [u]some of it's mechanics are easily in my top favorites of any action game [/u]. The story demands attention, but any effort from the player to understand it is rarely rewarded.\n\n[h1] How does it fare against the first game? [/h1]\n\nIt's more streamlined, literally on rails (get it? play it and you will), but as a result I believe it's better since the devs got to design the whole flow of the experience throughout; they called the shots, but still allowed you some freedom to switch things up a bit. Still, this had a negative impact on replayability; once you did the thing™ you don't feel like doing it again differently because the outcome stays the same. [u]It offers the same experience to every player[/u] is what I'm trying to say, which is not that big of a deal unless you choose so.\n\n[h1] Visuals and Sound [/h1]\n\nGame is gourgeous, [u]the graphics are stylized and thus they stand the test of time[/u] (some day, The Last of Us's realism will look old, that game came out the same year as this one) a feast to the eyes I tell you. Aesthetically unique, get ready to be fully immersed in a pintoresque world you've never seen before or since, just like the first game, but this time they leave very little to the imagination, there's no guessing what life was like before things went down, you get to see it first hand.\n\nSound design is distinctively unique. You'll recognise and remember specific sounds from this game, even things that show in other games don't sound like this (guns/melee/UI and menus/Etc.). There's some [b]Adaptive Music[/b] during combat (easily noticeable at the end of an encounter) which is A+ btw, like every song on this game, [u]they both set the mood and capture the time period perfectly[/u]. They even got appropiate covers from famous 80's to 90's pop songs like Girls Just Wanna Have fun, Everybody Wants to Rule The World, Tainted Love, and even Fortunate Son which is from the late 60's.\n\n[h1] Plot [/h1]\n\nI won't lie. [b]It drags[/b]. It starts off simple then immediately goes bonkers speed and expects you to care about characters you've never interacted with before and only knew about for 20 minutes. No exaggeration there.\nMy recommendation is to just ignore the mumbo jumbo and enjoy the moment to moment interactions with the two main characters, these are well written.\nSo how complicated does it get? [u]Let me just say this: There's parallel universes.[/u] That should tell you everything.\nThe last 3 hours you'll be wishing things went back to how they used to be before they got all scientific on you. There's plenty of 40 minute youtube essays out there explaining this game's ending, I'll tell you that much. The game tries to be all like Neil deGrasse Tyson's Twitter but only manages to come across as Jayden Smith's twitter. Both are cringe anyways.\n\n[h1] Is this game for you? [/h1]\n\nDid you play the first one? then you probably already bought this, if not, buy it anyway but understand that the plot, while dense, requires some prior knowledge to fully appreciate, but that shouldn't be the reason that keeps you from buying this.\n[u]There's fun to be had here[/u]. If you like unique settings then this is it, chief. If you like those sci-fi/fantasy/drama Netflix original series then this might also be for you. If you like fun FPS's not bound by realism that give you many tools to use creatively, this already should be one of your faves. [u]The Gameplay design alone is 20/10.[/u]\n\nAlso, the DLC is pretty good and accentuates what the base game had going on: There's a gameplay focused combat-in-waves DLC and a Story DLC split into 2 parts with lots of new content and fan-service. A nice send-off for a nice Franchise.\n\nThis should've been GOTY when it released.\n[strike]I rate it \"Just Like Dark Souls\"/10[/strike]","timestamp_created":1387546807,"timestamp_updated":1592362064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8140871","author":{"steamid":"76561198048716123","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1563,"last_played":1586727866},"language":"english","review":"Рекомендую!!!","timestamp_created":1387546703,"timestamp_updated":1387546703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8140867","author":{"steamid":"76561198116291765","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":121,"last_played":1388093380},"language":"german","review":"das beste spiel in der letzten zeit,super grafik und gameplay","timestamp_created":1387546692,"timestamp_updated":1387546692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8140706","author":{"steamid":"76561198027753755","num_games_owned":1913,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1493,"last_played":1459903649},"language":"english","review":"Mind blowing story with a nice twist at the end.
