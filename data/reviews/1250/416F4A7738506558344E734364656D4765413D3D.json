It is super accessible with a perfect learning curve. You will feel like you're gradually progressing more and more as you play. The teamwork aspect of it is very well designed and it ensures an intense experience every time you play with your friends. One of my friends actually took the time to draw this huge poster of a particular event that happened in the game for my burfday. It was basically me healing three people while fending off zombies, one of my best memories in my time as a gamer. \n\nOh yeah, and Killing Floor?

[Or just wait until it goes on sale]\n\nPros:\n- Unreal Engine 2 can run on almost any PC\n- Still fun alone, or with up to *32 others\n- A huge modding and map-making community\n- DLC that doesn't NEED to be bought to experience all of KF (just cosmetics)\n- Almost everyone in the community is nice\n- Loads 'o money!!\n- Dosh can be thrown after a win\n- KF Objectives (ie quests and such)\n- Lots of gore\n- Still holds up surprisingly well graphically speaking (is that a testiment to this games' awesomeness or how shit games are now???)\n- Voice-overs are top-notch (and so are the one-liners)\n- THE SOUNDTRACK!!\n- A decent selection of classes that are all important to a match in some way\n- The sheer variety of maps\n- The perk system rewards long-time players, and is tailored to how you play\n- A difficulty mode for everyone!\n- Those random guys that come onto the voice-chat after smoking a bong or some shit like that\n\nCons:\n- Some may find the perk system \"too difficult\" to gain exp for\n- Lack of players (probably all in KF2 or something)\n- It is an old game, but it's almost like revisiting something like Doom\n- Non-sale price is a... bit too much this far in its life cycle (but that's Valve for you ;D )\n- Ultrawide support via in-game settings is non-existant (have to edit the .ini file) due to its age\n- Perks max-out at level 6 (a DLC would have been nice for this)\n\nPlease get this game if you haven't already. The more players the better. Also, don't forget to support your favourite servers, and all the modders out there!\n\n* on modded servers","timestamp_created":1494663355,"timestamp_updated":1494663355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31712605","author":{"steamid":"76561197989465466","num_games_owned":364,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":2122,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2122,"last_played":1359532800},"language":"english","review":"there's zombies and you shoot them then a lady tells you that you did a good job and tells you to buy things from her with the money you stole from the once-human beings you've obliterated with a shotgun.\n\n\nhighly recommend.","timestamp_created":1494634120,"timestamp_updated":1494634121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31711489","author":{"steamid":"76561198201740579","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":103964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1249,"last_played":1659067105},"language":"spanish","review":"Juego muy bueno y recomendable :D","timestamp_created":1494628466,"timestamp_updated":1494628466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31711050","author":{"steamid":"76561198040696137","num_games_owned":353,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1100,"last_played":1473569040},"language":"english","review":"Kill this, kill that, WAN*ER!\n\nAs an American, this is some good Britsh pound fun.","timestamp_created":1494626699,"timestamp_updated":1494626810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31709206","author":{"steamid":"76561198013939783","num_games_owned":616,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":16148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16328,"last_played":1477204832},"language":"english","review":"1.
