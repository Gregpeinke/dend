See Conclusion[/h1]\n\n[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]\nHalf-Life 2 is a first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve Software (Corporation) and is a sequel to the extremely popular and revolutionary 1998 game [i]Half-Life[/i]. Half-Life 2 was originally released back in 2004 and was then boasting the newly developed, highly flexible and powerful Source Engine, it then became an instant classic by making good use of new technology, excellent storytelling, gameplay mechanics and an unrivaled online experience. Alongside its predecessor, both games left a lasting impression, particularly on the FPS genre, as an industry standard for future FPS games to come.\n\n[h1]PLOT (No Spoilers):[/h1]\nHalf-Life 2 puts the player once more behind the thick-framed bulletproof glasses of Gordon Freeman, an MIT Graduate of Theoretical Physics with an uncanny ability to wield military hardware and the person indirectly responsible for opening a portal to an alien world and exposing Earth to an invasion that is to be known as the 'Black Mesa Incident'. Half-Life 2 is set 20 years after the events of Half-Life 1 and the world is now under the full control of the 'Combine', an interdimensional empire that is currently harvesting the natural resources of Earth including the human race which is now close to extinction.\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n+ Graphics and artstyle that looks just as good as it is now (2015), as it was eleven years ago (2004).\n+ Excellent sequel with an excellent story that expands the Half-Life Universe\n+ Excellent memorable supporting characters such as Alyx Vance\n+ Great sound quality, facial animation, and voice acting adds to the immersive experience\n+ Excellent enemy AI\n+ Great level and environment designs but...(see CON #1)\n+ Fun gunplay and gameplay mechanics\n+ Good selection of weapons and equipment with very creative special abilities (Gravity Gun)\n+ Atmospheric with excellent use of lighting, sound effects and environment design\n+ Challenging difficulties\n+ Expanded levels that give some room for exploration, but doesn't destroy the narrative storytelling\n+ Lengthy game time\n+ Very affordable price (though I highly recommend the Half-Life Complete pack)\n+ Multiplayer is still active as far as I can tell\n+ Tons of available mods that expand player experience\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n- Driving section may be a little too long but it does offer a few 'stops' where the player can stretch his leg muscles and trigger finger.\n- The Squad Support AI is down right suicidal with no command to tell them to stay in place for more than 15 seconds before they follow you again. [i](This is annoying specially if you're trying to keep them alive against particularly deadly opponents such as Striders)[/i]\n- Rag-doll physics engine can be unrealistically (albeit hilariously) glitchy\n- No Steam Workshop Support for the multitude of MODS that are available.\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\nMuch like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 is a [b][i]MASTERPIECE[/i][/b] of a game and is a MUST BUY and MUST OWN for any fan of the first person genre because how else can you describe a game that is almost 11 years old, yet, can still retain all the fun and excitement of a recently released title.\n\n[h1]WORTH IT?:[/h1]\nIf you decide to purchase and try this game, I do recommend you purchase [url=http://store.steampowered.com/sub/715/]Half-Life: Complete[/url] so you may also avail of the two Episodes that was subsequently released.\n\n[h1]FINAL NOTES:[/h1]\nHalf-Life 2's use of the amazing Source engine reflects on the fact that this game's graphics, despite showing some age, still manages not only to look good, but also to look authentic and atmospheric with its excellent use of sound and music that makes the environment feel alive. Graphics aside, the gameplay has survived for even after a decade and has still not lost its charm. The enemy AI provides an imposing challenge while gunplay and the creative weapons creates one of the most fun and immersive experience you can get on a first-person shooter. Storywise, the Half-Life universe can be considered as one of the most beautifully crafted worlds in gaming history. Half-Life 2 fully emphasizes this point with its amazing and memorable supporting characters that can establish a connection with the player on an emotional level. To recap, Half-Life 2 is the game that once again redefined how modern first-person shooters will be made in the future and remains as the benchmark for good single player FPS gaming experience.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n[h1]Like my Reviews?

This game features a completely new engine called Source and now uses shader based materials which give the game some nice visuals. It also runs extremely well on today’s PCs plus the gameplay is certainly fluid in every way possible. I mean everything just works perfectly especially with much better facial detail and animation. I even spent a minute looking at the water because it looked just so good. Also everything obeys the laws of physics in this game from half ton trucks to paint buckets which literally affect other models if you throw it at them. The storyline is similar to Half-Life’s storytelling methods but let’s say more interesting. Also for today’s price on Half-Life 2, you certainly get more than enough decent content to keep you entertained for hours on end. Plus this game features some kick a** music so please if you haven’t played this game it’s a must have and you should get it.","timestamp_created":1433357249,"timestamp_updated":1433357249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16160222","author":{"steamid":"76561198110573345","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1421935971},"language":"english","review":"Morgan Freeman has a beautiful voice\n\nGordon Freeman doesnt have a voice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet your shit together valve","timestamp_created":1433351480,"timestamp_updated":1437412061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16155621","author":{"steamid":"76561198025916621","num_games_owned":431,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6999,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1542,"last_played":1639629219},"language":"russian","review":"Про эту шикарную игру можно писать много хороших вещей.

Biggest difference compared to HL1 is a huge amount of variety in location and gameplay styles related to said locations. You will crawl through sewer. Shoot gasmask people into face with revolver. Throw saws at zombies in a dark town. Will even get to drive car, the chapter being notable for having a variety of optional side locations that you can exlpore, as you can stop anytime and check the abandoned house.\nAnother thing that it keeps from HL1 design is that it tries to keep you as immersed as possible, without dividing playtime between gameplay part and cutscene part. It's not terribly clever this time though, as it often means that you are closed in a room, forced to listen to characters dialogue and not being able to skip it due to it not being a cutscene in a technical sense. Plot is quite enjoyable by itself though.\n\nIt also had great simple graphics for it's time and still is. Music is nice, but developers still were wanted players to enjoy silence, so it only plays occasionally for event.\n\nWeapons selection is quite great there. Each weapon has a clearly defined role to it. Long range, short range, grenades, such things, all enjoyable to use too. Crowbar still sucks.\nSame goes for enemy. While main enemy, that are people in gasmask, combines, have a sin of using realistical unavoidable hitscan weapon in a game without regenerating health, it still keeps the pure damage they can do on you quite low and game throws enough medkit around not to make you rely on quickloads heavily. Zombies and some others enemies can be met occasionally, some fast, some slower. No human-sized enemies that take ages to kill. It keeps tradition of FPS of not having good bosses though. Shame.\n\nThe biggest step-up the game brought were physics. Well, no, not inclusion of physics by itself, other games already had physics, even ragdoll for corpses. Even Psi-Ops game allowed you to throw soldiers off the cliff with telekinesis, watching them wiggle in ragdoll motion. But Half-life 2 was more special, because, well, more physics felt more real, with more weight feel variety, with physic-based puzzles and Gravi-Gun, weapon that allowed you to grab any object that wasn't glued to the floor and throw it.\nActually, looking at Psi-Ops again, it wasn't any kind of first revolution. Or was, but in FPS genre only. It did set a stone, with other developers putting their own variation of Gravi-gun into their games for a while, as it was a hot thing now. Even Doom 3 expansion pack did it, not caring how buggy their physics were!\n\nNowadays, Half-Life 2 is quite a fine FPS experience. You will enjoy beating it, but I doubt that you will want to rebeat it. It does have some nice pacing to it though, juggling puzzles, combat and exploration.","timestamp_created":1433161269,"timestamp_updated":1433161269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16113422","author":{"steamid":"76561197975581935","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":492,"last_played":1573219414},"language":"english","review":"This is a good game , i'm waiting for HL3","timestamp_created":1433153006,"timestamp_updated":1433153006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16113298","author":{"steamid":"76561198127192529","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":91,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":79,"last_played":1507109783},"language":"russian","review":"Ахуенная игра!!","timestamp_created":1433152128,"timestamp_updated":1433152128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16111575","author":{"steamid":"76561198104061055","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":4518,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4518,"last_played":1561519235},"language":"english","review":"how the fuck have i not written a positive review i have every achievment","timestamp_created":1433139636,"timestamp_updated":1593216578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16110273","author":{"steamid":"76561198141976048","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1586130822},"language":"english","review":"ONE OF THE BEST SCRUB-REKIN_AWESOME_SHOOTER            _xXx_BLAZEIT420_xXx_ MLG GAME OF THE YEAR","timestamp_created":1433129501,"timestamp_updated":1433129501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16108600","author":{"steamid":"76561197974780390","num_games_owned":799,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1375670891},"language":"english","review":"One of the greatest first-person shooters I have ever played.

Gordon is freed from the stasis outside of earth, thought, and time itself into City 17 to free humanity from the Combines oppresion, ultimately destroying their headquarters, the Citadal. Gordan Freeman is accompanied by Alyx Vance, the daughter of Eli Vance, a fellow surviving scientist from Black-Mesa, and the various citizens and vortigaunts (Freed from their master, the Nihilanth) of City 17 who take up arms and aid in toppling the Combines reign. Aside from rebel rousing and combat, Half-Life 2 also encompasses many unique and optional caches throughout its environments, often giving tactical advantages like early weapons, health and ammo. Half-Life 2 is a very straightfoward, linear, cramped title, very rarely straying from being open, or offering varying ways of traversing environments aside from optional, hidden areas. The music score is incredibly well composed musical improvisation, and very memorable due to their uses. The equipment available in Half-Life 2 varies from automatic, semi-automatic, and even balistic weapons, also including much more versatile grenades, the antlion guard Pheropod, a crossbow akin to the one in Black-Mesa, the series staple melee weapon Crowbar, and the trademark Gravity gun, all of which feel very satisfying to use througout the game. Environments are very immersive, and breathtaking from their design and sandboxing. Half-Life 2 is one of my favorite video games produced by Valve, and its gameplay offers lots of replayability. I would recommend this game for new, and returning Half-Life fans.","timestamp_created":1433087643,"timestamp_updated":1516491622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16098512","author":{"steamid":"76561198009414610","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4390,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3871,"last_played":1611414023},"language":"english","review":"buy it","timestamp_created":1433080536,"timestamp_updated":1433080536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16098395","author":{"steamid":"76561198084684798","num_games_owned":314,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":2233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":754,"last_played":1635783968},"language":"russian","review":"Это HL2 и этим всё сказано.
