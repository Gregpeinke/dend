Originally released as an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, Killing Floor is a first person shooter, with the intention of being played in multiplayer. The game made it's way to the development floor, to fine-tune and redesign the core game design, ready for release on Steam in 2012.\n\nRight of the bat, this game is bloody good fun, with it's gory action, large list of weapons to choose from, and freakish looking enemy designs, all topped off with insane fun and entertainments, from popping the heads off of Zeds, ripping the arms off a Fleshpound, or hearing the ridiculous banter from each characters. Fend off waves of horrible experiments with assault rifles, shotguns, knives & swords and more by yourself, or working with a team of upto 6 players.\n\nWhat sets this game apart from other wave defending games are it's perks system and the Trader's store. Perks work in various ways, whether that be making certain weapon types more stronger, faster movement speed, discounts on certain weapon types and resisting certain enemy attacks. Each perks compliments everyone's playlist, from the Berserk's love of melee weapons, Demolition's huge damage boost in explosives or the Medic's quick thinking healing abilities. The more you play with these perks, the stronger they'll get, and the more benefits you'll get out of them. There are seven perks to choose from, with each perk having specific ways of levelling them up.\n\nThe Trader's store occurs at the end of each waves. You're able to purchase weapons, equipment and armour from her, given that you have enough Dosh to throw her way. Dosh being the currency you get from killing enemies and surviving waves. There are a plethora of weapons to pick and play with, with some being more powerful depending on the perk you have equipped. You can be incredibly powerful with the right set of gears, or you can be goody two shoes and share your wealth with your teammates.\n\nEach of the maps are dark and bloody, with streets and buildings coated in paints of blood, body parts hung up like Halloween decoration. There are even maps that are literal Hell, inspired from Quake and Doom map designs. Killing Floor also supports community made maps, the amount of maps to play on is limitless. You're bound to find yourself running and checking every corner of the map, learning your whereabouts and where each corridor leads you, finding ammo crates or weapons to pick up, and pitching down a spot and fight off the chasing Zeds.\n\nAt the end of every match, you'll face off the game's toughest boss, aptly named Patriarch. With his grotesque design, killer weapons and a force to be reckoned with, you will die many times face him off on higher difficulties. You'll want to learn everything about him, and work together as a team to take him down.\n\nKilling Floor has been an absolute fun time playing it. I've made friends playing it, it's gotten me into playing more PC games, and it's left an everlasting mark in my memories of playing video games. It's definitely a game worth checking out after all these years!","timestamp_created":1343609519,"timestamp_updated":1581031592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4312553","author":{"steamid":"76561198035418890","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5803,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3215,"last_played":1625488103},"language":"french","review":"Meilleur jeu de co-op survival horror .","timestamp_created":1343608786,"timestamp_updated":1385411683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5185669","author":{"steamid":"76561198046109925","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":68037,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52648,"last_played":1432337534},"language":"english","review":"Everybody love KillingFloor & it the best game ever & Im a pro on KillingFloor","timestamp_created":1343600777,"timestamp_updated":1343600777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506578981876373291","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2512729","author":{"steamid":"76561198008558307","num_games_owned":705,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":17312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8694,"last_played":1420493372},"language":"spanish","review":"Sobrevive las oleadas de abominaciones de la ciencia con 6 clases distintas, cada una con sus caracteristicas y armas, la cooperacion es fundamental para la supervivencia!

Rather than linear level gameplay like the L4D series, KF presents a wave survival format and open maps with far more challenging and deadly zombies to go up against. Add to that the need to level your class skills, the importance of team composition, the lack of UI crosshairs (you need to aim with the guns actual sights), and you get one heck of a challenging but rewarding game experience. The learning curve is huge and starting at level 0 you will die a lot (even max level people die alot), but it's worth it as the game is really fun and challenging once you really learn it.\r\n\r\nNot a great game if you prefer to solo though, so keep that in mind; you need to play this online (there are plenty of servers out there). Also a great game for achievement fans as this game has a huge array of achievements to try and earn.","timestamp_created":1343318492,"timestamp_updated":1343318492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5614284","author":{"steamid":"76561198052908158","num_games_owned":247,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":9114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2147,"last_played":1621878865},"language":"english","review":"like

What I can say is that it is probably one of the best survival horror FPS on the market. Graphics are pretty decent, even in 2012, considering the game is using an improved version of Unreal Engine 2, which is quite old now. Gameplay is quite hardcore and entirely based on cooperation, which means it won't forgive your mistakes and you'll have to cooperate with your teammates if you want to survive. A great arsenal of weapons is available, ranging from the classic 9mm handgun to the M99 sniper rifle. There are also several character classes allowing you to play the game in different manners, from the berserker on the front killing mutants with melee weapons to the medic healing his buddies, there are classes for all tastes. At last, time sometimes slows down when killing mutants, which is cool ! Overall, it's completely different than L4D, try it and you'll be set !","timestamp_created":1342936212,"timestamp_updated":1342936212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4061810","author":{"steamid":"76561198031494442","num_games_owned":639,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":3929,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3929,"last_played":1413728680},"language":"english","review":"\"CAN YOU SEE IM FUCKING RELOADING!\"\n\n10/10 would tell my friends im reloading.","timestamp_created":1342930330,"timestamp_updated":1413726765,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3146029","author":{"steamid":"76561198018186918","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":13320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9966,"last_played":1584819499},"language":"english","review":"Nothing better to relieve stress XD","timestamp_created":1342927022,"timestamp_updated":1342927022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5017742","author":{"steamid":"76561198044232979","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":27162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22424,"last_played":1426804245},"language":"english","review":"This game is bloody fun!!!","timestamp_created":1342922379,"timestamp_updated":1342922379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1448186","author":{"steamid":"76561197993336553","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":14361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10480,"last_played":1466223182},"language":"english","review":"There is no other way to put it: If you do not buy this game, whether for the full twenty dollar price or while it's on sale, you are missing out. I've owned it since release and still find it fresh and challenging (especially with each new, free update) and have gotten several friends into it as well.
