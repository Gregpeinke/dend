I had been excited for it for so long.\n\nI mean, its an aesthetic I enjoy. That \"Before the Great War\" aesthetic of boundless optimism. Its religious stuff was fascinating. In fact, the world itself was fascinating. The only part of the world that felt totally hacked together and bullshit was the Tonic/plasmid things. They were very clearly only there because plasmids were a thing in Bioshock.\n\nBut the story itself? Showed that it was heavily edited at the last minute. The ending was a 'twist' that was rather predictable. (which is fine, really. Endings that 'change everything' and are out of nowhere are kind of not good writing if you can't see the signs beforehand) major plotpoints are abandoned the moment they're not needed as background dressing. (I.E. Revolutionaries go from sympathetic to unsympathetic villains in the span of 5 minutes. Nothing portraying them as a positive thing occurs again because they're now enemies to get mowed down)\n\nIt also goes to great lengths to just be uh. I know this sounds odd, but horribly violent? There's times when the game feels more pointlessly violent than Postal 2. Don't get me wrong I love some random violent murder sprees. But it felt like it was out of character for the rest of what was going on. It felt very clearly like the story was at odds with the gameplay. And when your story is at odds with the gameplay, the gameplay suffers. Especially when its a game with as much story as Infinite.\n\nAdditionally, Emily is frickin annoying, very early on. Mostly due to her becoming nothing more than a thing that will give you ammo. Why explore, seek new things, when Emily will just give you it anyway? Nothing actually feels like it matters. Breaking into a secret area doesn't feel rewarding. Its just more junk you won't use because you don't need any of it.\n\n\nAdditionally, the handrail things that were so lauded, are mostly used to just jump onto and dodge bullets with while mowing down enemies that can't possibly aim at you. Its...sort of tedious. I think I started getting bored with the game about at the museum. And by the time it was nearing its last stretch and there was ghosts and mysteries being waved in my face that were obvious an hour before, I was done.","timestamp_created":1494065761,"timestamp_updated":1494065761,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570392966270446777","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31575897","author":{"steamid":"76561198343167889","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1082,"last_played":1495027617},"language":"schinese","review":"今天全剧情加DLC通关，\n超级棒的游戏，就是海葬玩得有点不明觉厉，\n强力推荐","timestamp_created":1494059637,"timestamp_updated":1494059637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31571892","author":{"steamid":"76561198209352379","num_games_owned":309,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":920,"last_played":1547988650},"language":"schinese","review":"没有伊丽莎白我要死了。","timestamp_created":1494040849,"timestamp_updated":1494040849,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469798654317855835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31570300","author":{"steamid":"76561198067052243","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1592346434},"language":"english","review":"Damn... \nYou know.. one of those games?

Sure, I have spent more time in other games, and in many ways gotten more enjoyment out of other games. But Bioshock Infinite is the single most perfect gem for the time spent in its world, even if the replay value is not necessarily as potent as that of other similar story-driven games. The story in this game is one of the greatest works of fiction that I have ever come across in my life, if not the best. I do not dare spoil the plot. Any of it. Discover and explore the wonderful world of Columbia for yourself. Find its secrets and follow your own path. The story and game in general hit me so hard that I have a serious problem believing I will ever experience something this masterfully crafted as long as I live. The combat? Wonderful fun. So many different options and your companion/deuteragonist complements the combat exceptionally well; the best video game companion mechanic and story-wise you'll ever see. The soundtrack?

Game with one of the best stories of all time with good combat and cool beautiful scenery. Definently worth buying, 9.5/10\n\nIn depth\n\nThe game does not have anything in common with the previous games, and it is located in a completely new area. Columbia, a floating city in the sky is gorgeous and the scenery is very light and pleasing, although the residents of columbia look very wierd from time to time, but that is a very minor detail to me. You play the game as Booker, a private investigator who is trying to fill a deal by retrieving  \"the girl.\" The main charachters are good, there is depth and you actually care for all of them. The storyline is absolutely great and it makes your head go around. It is a perfect combination of emotions and head-spinning details. The story gets a full 10/10 and that is what is so great about this game. \n\nThe combat system is fun, not too fast-paced action with many guns and vigors, similar to previous games, but the guns are better in this one. There are many upgrades, not much changed since the previous games. The combat does get a little repeditive, even though they tried adding more guns and upgrades. This is pretty much the only thing that drops the final score. Fun bosses, and the combat was not boring at any times, even if it was slightly repeditive. \n\nThe game has everything a good game needs. Wonderful story, good action, beautiful scenery and charachters. \nAlso the DLC is a completely new game, and definently worth buying. It is a bit darker spin of the original game with scenery from bioshock 1 and 2, also definently worth buying.","timestamp_created":1493591228,"timestamp_updated":1493591228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31473263","author":{"steamid":"76561198062349765","num_games_owned":1034,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":1538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1538,"last_played":1493586472},"language":"spanish","review":"Contra más lo juegas, más te engancha.

You play as Booker Dewit, a private eye sent to the flying city of Columbia to find a woman named Elizabeth. In most games, this would result in at least one pain-in-the-a** escort mission, but this is not a normal game. Elizabeth instead acts like a guardian angel, tossing you health and ammo when you need them most and bringing in stuff (e.g. turrets, health, weapons) from other dimensions. This, combined with riding around on skylines, makes the combat flow nicely (for the most part). The story is pretty decent, with at least 1 mind-f*ck ending I'm not going to spoil. \nNow we get to the bad parts. Towards the end, enemies (especially ones with RPGs), seem unfeasably tankish: they can survive multiple shotgun blasts to the face, and are almost immune to melee. Booker himself seems a bit generic, but thats just my personal taste.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10, would play again","timestamp_created":1493581171,"timestamp_updated":1493581212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31468237","author":{"steamid":"76561198314042556","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":1100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1100,"last_played":1493571506},"language":"english","review":"I played it with both Burial at Sea episodes.\nFinished it in some 15-16 hours of gameplay.\n\nThere are so many mindfucks through the storyline, SO MANY.\n\nBut everything comes to a complete circle at the end of Burial At Sea ep. 2. It basically completes the entire Bioshock Saga. It has been absolutely amazing.\n\nI've heard so much about it before, and everything I heard about it was true. All of it.\n\n\n\nNow, about gameplay.\nGreat gameplay! Great combat! You can literally move around quickly using skylines in most of the areas and switch positions to attack from a sniping position or bombard them, or use one of Elizabeth's \"tear-ed\" in items, it provides you with a LOT of items to use in battle.\n\nPlus, the Clash in the Clouds DLC provides dedicated arenas for such badass battles.\n\nLoved all of it.\n\n\nTip for first time players:\nUse infusions to max up the shield first.

Fantastic game. I REALLY enjoyed the story and the gameplay.
