a connection to this games story it is just any old shooter in a somewhat interesting location...  much like the other bio-shock games, however this game differentiates itself from is predecessors by its narrative, this game is not a quest to stop a villian this game feels like an epic Greek poem in comparison,  the narrative is so well interwinded through the game that it feels like wtahcing a movie without ever taking you out of the game (im looking at you telltale)  very few cutscenes but still tells a story just as well. The ending of the game was especcially impactful andd if you havent played the game I suggets you do before you find out too much because if you like story driven games this ones a heavbyweight... the gunplay and fighhtginh are fine and the vigors are a cool addition but nothing special... enemy design is very cool and memorable and also kindd of distruvbing in an epic sauce way tho... which brings m,e to the point that this games map is amazing it changes as the story gains in intenisty showing a utopian turning to a broken city. all in all 10/10 for style 6/10 for shooting all in all tho i

Pasamos de una ciudad en el fondo del océano a una ciudad que va más allá de las nubes, re normal.\n\nEl gameplay se mantiene similar a lo visto antes con ciertos retoques en los controles para una experiencia con mayor frenetismo a medida que nos vamos enfrentando a nuevos enemigos en la utópica ciudad flotante de Columbia. Nuevas armas y plásmidos/vigorizadores se nos presentan, así como también algunos clásicos.\nCiertos comandos podrían estar un poco más pulidos, como el tener que moverse hacia adelante para que la acción de correr se ejecute, eso a veces te puede llevar a tu muerte cuando estás en medio de un combate con poca salud.\n\nLos gráficos, para su época, son bastante favorables a la vista y no decepcionan en lo absoluto. La ambientación y el modelado de los personajes, que tocan un estilo caricaturesco, lucen de maravilla.\n\nComo es de esperarse, el peso pesado es su historia. Fua...\nEs una puta montaña rusa de emociones que te deja con unas ganas descomunales de seguir avanzando para ser partícipe del desarrollo de la historia hasta terminarla, solo para darte cuenta que te has pegado el viaje más disparatado y vesánico de toda tu vida. Puede que sea algo difícil de entender a la primera, pero una vez que vas conectando los hilos sin dejar cabos sueltos, se te va a partir el culo de semejante caída que vas a sufrir por el final. En pocas palabras, nada de lo que experimentarás es como parece.\nLuego están los DLCs de Burial at Sea, que relata sucesos posteriores a lo acontecido en la historia principal. Si bien posee una trama más que decente, no posa un mayor impacto en el jugador que la trama principal (subjetivamente hablando).\n\nDudo que en pleno 2022 alguien desconozca ésta obra magna de tipo audiovisual. Pero para quien no lo haya probado todavía, está esperando una invitación acaso?
