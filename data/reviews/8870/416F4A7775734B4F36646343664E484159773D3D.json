Я очень радуюсь, когда встречаю игры с достаточно глубоким и противоречивым сюжетом – все-таки чаще выходят игры с самыми простыми сюжетными планами. И опять-таки удивительно, что такой сюжет встретился не в классическом квесте для странных личностей вроде меня, а в шутане.\nИгра правда очень порадовала. Прекрасная графика, красивая и оригинальная. Проработанный, с любовью созданный мир, каждая локация полна интересных деталей! Бодрый геймплей; играть не настолько сложно, чтобы игра была непроходимой для кого-то вроде меня (кто с двух метров в мишень не попадет и пистолет от пулемета едва отличит), но и не настолько просто, чтобы пробегать локации было неинтересно. Замечательно, что ГГ сопровождает спутница, Элизабет, которая иногда приносит патроны или аптечки – с ней веселее. И она по ходу прохождения меняет одежду – это еще плюс 10 в карму, девочки меня поймут.\n\nИстория, конечно, такая, что в нее без поллитры не врубиться. Но это замечательно, что она заставляет напрячь извилины, присматриваться постфактум к деталям и вызывает горячие споры у игроков. К тому же, вместо затертой-перетертой темы спасения мира – путешествия во времени параллельные миры, сложные взаимоотношения героев в этой системе координат. Ну, в итоге вишенкой на торте все равно положили спасение мира, но все-таки сюжет игры никто не упрекнет в банальности. Побольше бы таких!\n\nЧто можно отнести к минусам? Ккартонные зомби-лица разных эпизодических персонажей – скорее забавная изюминка, чем минус – я над ними вволю посмеялась. Пожалуй, мне не хватило открытого мира, побочных квестов, больше исследования, карты мира – ну короче, ожидаемые страдашки любителя РПГ, который проходит шутер. Поэтому не 10, а 9 из 10. И отмечу, что мне как стримеру было неудобно слушать сюжетные диалоги на ходу, привыкла, что в такие моменты можно отвлекаться, а ко всему важному игра привлечет внимание. Но для игроков, которые проходят только для себя, такие диалоги только плюс – никакой нудятины, сюжет подается бодро и быстро.\nЕще хочу!

The game is set in a fictional floating city called Colombia. Bioshock Infinite is a totally different atmosphere from the original Bioshock 1 and 2. In fact it feels like a game of its own franchise (its so different from the original bioshock 1 and 2).  However the features from the orignal games were improved such as\n\n-Ammo is more common which makes the game enjoyable as you dont have to carefully use bullets.\n-You can upgrade guns with money instead of 1 gun upgrade per machine. (I like this because it rewards the player for staying alive. Since you lose money when you die)\n\nThe story in the game is very confusing if your not paying attention 100% of the time. Chance is you will be clueless on what the story is even after the game's completion. But the story is not lacking,it's so well written and plotted dont get the impression that just because its confusing that the story is bad. In fact the story is amazing.\n\nHowever every game has there flaws, And Bioshock Infinite is no exception.\n\nIn bioshock Infinite if you get lost you can press a key ('N' by default) which shows an arrow to where abouts your suppose to go. You will get lost in Infinite so much so this is essential. But you have to spam N or whatever your keybind is, for it to actually direct you to where your going. And while your looking at the ground you ignore the beautiful City of Colombia. It gets irritating but that can but thats not the main problem. On certain missions is literally directs you in circles .\n \nApart from that and a few minor bugs this game is great. Just dont come into this game expecting a bioshock 1 or 2 experiance because you wont get that. You get something different but you'll enjoy that experiance anyway.","timestamp_created":1477339823,"timestamp_updated":1477339868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26202640","author":{"steamid":"76561198072397397","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":146,"playtime_at_review":3371,"last_played":1660504668},"language":"english","review":"Incredible game I must say!

Infinite] [i]\"Lives, lived, will live.\" \n\"Dies, died, will die.\" --Robert/Rosalind Lutece[/i]\t[/quote]\n\n时间回到2007年底，肯·列文领导的2K Boston，即Irrational Games，在完成大名鼎鼎的《生化奇兵》后，踌躇满志地着手构思续作。当时，2K Marin接手了保留销魂城(Rapture)设定的《生化奇兵2》，所以肯·列文决定为《无限》构建一个全新的世界，一个区别于已经塑造得近乎完美的销魂城的世界。在他们最初的想法里，《无限》的背景设定在文艺复兴时期，然而09年《刺客信条2》的横空出世让他们不得不改变这一最初的想法。《无限》的时间线来到二十世纪初，蒸汽朋克，伤膝河大屠杀与天空之城成为了关键词。2011年《无限》的E3游戏展demo中，一个破碎的哥伦比亚乌托邦和一个生动真实的AI伙伴伊丽莎白呈现在观众眼前。那是一个齐刘海发型的伊丽莎白。\n\n等到2013年初《无限》正式发售时，夹杂在如潮水般的好评之中的，是一些评论家们挑剔刺耳的抱怨。诚然，《无限》在一些方面有着明显的短板。比如，同样是反乌托邦，天空之城哥伦比亚留给人的印象更多浮于表面，远不如海底的销魂城深刻迷人；又比如，游戏中不平衡的枪械设定，与前两作相比被无比淡化的近战成分，本该塑造得如同大老爹般标志性存在的巨臂匠们打酱油般的几次登场，以及枯燥乏味的boss战。相比于前两作丰富而特色鲜明的技能组合，以及给以玩家巨大压迫感的大老爹和大老姐战斗，《无限》甚至要靠《云端激战》dlc去弥补其本体游戏性的不足。就连最狂热的拥趸们也不得不承认，《无限》在13年的VGX年度最佳游戏评选中，输给了一个没有短板的GTA V。而对于《无限》漫长的开发周期以及游戏主题的两度更易和返工，批评家们甚至说，肯·列文已经成为了现实中的安德鲁·瑞恩。\n\n但是这所有一切的指责，都无法掩盖《无限》在叙事节奏和情感传递上的闪光。一个教科书般完美的序章表演，带给玩家从平和到混乱的环境反差；一对神秘的话痨男女；一个私家侦探的承诺；一段拯救象牙塔少女的旅途；一个牵制于宿命的革命军头目；一个隐藏于时空轮回中的真相；最后的，一个在与E3展示相比已经缩水状况下，依然生动得有如真人一般的AI队友伊丽莎白。尽管《无限》中单个场景的叙事表现力依然无法达到初代《生化奇兵》中安德鲁·瑞恩死前演说那样震撼绝伦的水准，但是总体而言，玩家的代入感以及对游戏人物的情感寄托，都是要高于后者的。\n\n人们对于《无限》的赞誉和抱怨，恰恰说明了想要延续一部开山神作的完美是一件多么困难的事情。初代《生化奇兵》除了最终与弗兰克·方汀有如鸡肋一般的boss战，以及略有槽点的bad ending设定以外，是近乎完美的作品。2K Marin的二代以及Minerva's Den，也因为沿用一代设定而被吐槽“缺乏创新”，实际上仍然是一部被低估的，非常优秀的续作。而对于一个系列的第三作，即使它再完美再优秀，也终会有人按下“不喜欢”的按钮。但是如同初代《生化奇兵》的\"Would you kindly\"通过游戏行为反讽游戏机制本身一样，《无限》和肯·列文一直在通过尝试创造完美去质疑完美。即使Irrational Games在14年3月宣布关闭，他们依然坚持完成了季票。在那个给《生化奇兵》故事暂时画上句号的《海葬：第二章》中，玩家第一次扮演者了陪伴你度过冒险岁月，并且已经杀死你两次的女儿伊丽莎白，听着她在失去超能力变为凡人后的絮絮叨叨，为了拯救小阿妹莎莉葬身海底。玫瑰人生的歌声中，海葬的故事落下帷幕，杰克的故事就此展开。\n\n对于肯·列文本人来说，《无限》的制作耗费了他太多的精力。按照他自己的说法，“两三年间感觉像是老了十岁。”于是他选择了离开。他解散了Irrational Games，并把BioShock的品牌转交给了2K，自己则带着十几名员工留在了Take-Two，成立了新的Ghost Story Games以专注小成本创新型叙事向游戏的创作。作为一枚普通的BioShock粉丝，我们祝福肯一路顺风，同时也祝愿接手BioShock后续作品制作的2K工作室好运。","timestamp_created":1477230796,"timestamp_updated":1506088533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.683362662792205811","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26181616","author":{"steamid":"76561198070371565","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":889,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":889,"last_played":1477222492},"language":"russian","review":"Boshock

Though Mass Effect is much less back-loaded than this, being a trilogy. TL;DR not a huge fan of this because of the ending, though the journey is enjoyable.\n\nThis game was a competent shooter, though there were perhaps some things I wasn't overly fond of. I would have liked a different upgrade system for the guns- removing the damage boosts so that it's not a money limit for guns to be functional late game- and perhaps more creative.\n\nI also would have liked to not be limited to two weapons at a time. The game is stingy with ammo so you have to switch (takes me back to the upgrade system, you want to stick to the guns you've upgraded) but since you'll need a back-up weapon you can't carry something reliable and something fun, because if your reliable gun goes dry you'll need to hope you're not stuck in close quarters with a rocket launcher.\n\nI mention how the ending is told, not what happens in it, if that's too close to a spoiler stop reading.\n\nAs far as the story goes, it's really back-loaded. It basically all gets explained to you when Elizabeth suddenly understands everything that's going on and starts dragging you around. You get hints at what's going on as you go through the story, but when it comes time to put all the pieces together they're missing a few. To avoid spoilers though, I can't really talk about them here.\n\nI can say I'm annoyed that Elizabeth, who has largely been our companion in cluelessness throughout the game, is suddenly given omniscience to the plot and the ability to just drag us around showing it to us. There were a pair of characters already capable of filling this role. I'd probably also prefer an ending that was less vague. There's an after-credit scene (that you have to sit through the credits to see, you can't skip them like I did) that I guess makes it slightly less so, but only a little. All-in-all, not a fan of the story.\n\nFinally characters, these are largely good, though the way things work out with some of the characters feels annoying. I have only a few complaints about the main characters. The recurring side characters are entertaining. The main character I have a problem with is the villain, and that ties back into the ending. They just don't give him a good motivation once you find everything out.\n\nWow, that was long. Like I said at the beginning, recommendation comes down to what you're looking for. If a bad ending to an otherwise good game tends to annoy you like it does me, it might not be worth playing (if you haven't already). If you're more interested in the characters and gameplay along the way, it's probably worthwhile.","timestamp_created":1477205455,"timestamp_updated":1477205455,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26177162","author":{"steamid":"76561198174754527","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1512,"last_played":1558878378},"language":"tchinese","review":"真的是神作 \n玩完之後會愣住無法自拔\n劇情太棒了","timestamp_created":1477205072,"timestamp_updated":1477205072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26176947","author":{"steamid":"76561198058644622","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":982,"last_played":1651748312},"language":"english","review":"Gameplay is fun, combat is incredible, and the difficulty is just right.

Diesmal führt die Reise aber nicht in die Unterwasserstadt Rapture, sondern in die fliegende Stadt Columbia.\n\n[b][u]Die Story[/u][/b]\nAmerika 1912: Der Detektiv und Kriegsveteran Booker DeWitt erhält den Auftrag, ein Mädchen namens Elizabeth - die seit ihrer Kindheit in der Wolkenstadt in einem goldenen Käfig gefangen gehalten wird -  zu befreien, um \"alte Schulden zu begleichen\". Er fährt mit einem Ruderboot zu einem alten Leuchtturm, findet dort eine Art Rakete und gelangt mit dieser in die fliegende Stadt Columbia.\nDort regieren die sogenannten \"Gründer\" angeführt von dem Propheten Zachary Comstock, der von den Bewohnern wie ein Gott verehrt wird. Alle Menschen sind extrem fröhlich, die Sonne scheint und die Stadt ist mit vielen verschiedenen Blumen und Statuen sehr bunt. Comstock wird als eine Art Erlöser gefeiert, der die Menschen von der sündigen und elenden Erde zu diesem Utopia geführt hat.\nDoch der Schein trügt: Die \"Gründer\" verbreiten ein ultranationalistisches und extrem rassistisches Gedankengut (nach kurzer Zeit begegnet man auf einer Art Jahrmarkt zum Beispiel einem gemischtrassigen Paar, welches an Pfähle gebunden wurde und gerade von den Einwohnern gedemütigt wird)  in der Stadt und regieren totalitär.\nIm Untergrund existiert eine Widerstandsorganisation gegen die Gründer, genannt \"Vox Populi\" - die Stadt befindet sich in einer Art Bürgerkrieg.\nMan wird also in dieses Szenario geworfen und muss sich zunächst auf die Suche nach der geheimnisvollen Elizabeth machen...\nMehr will ich an dieser Stelle gar nicht verraten, um niemanden zu spoilern - die Story ist jedenfalls unglaublich originell, ein wenig kompliziert und wahnsinnig gut inszeniert. ;)\n\n[b][u]Die Charaktere[/u][/b]\nDie Charaktere des Spiels sind größtenteils auf eine positive Art und Weise wahnsinnig überzeichnet und verkörpern alle auf eine liebenswerte Art verschiedene Stereotype. Es gibt beispielsweise Comstock - den religiösen Fanatiker, einen Großkapitalisten - der scheinbar kein Gewissen hat, eine rücksichtslose Rebellin, für die der Zweck grundsätzlich die Mittel heiligt etc....\nDer mit Abstand liebenswerteste Charakter des Spiels ist aber der Sidekick des Protagonisten: Elizabeth! Elizabeth ist einfach ein wahnsinnig gut ausgearbeiteter - ein wenig sturer - Charakter und die Beziehung zwischen Booker und ihr wird unheimlich genial dargestellt - ganz großes Kino!\n\n[b][u]Gameplay und Steuerung[/u][/b]\nBioshock Infinite spielt sich wie ein klassischer Ego-Shooter. Jeder, der mit dem Genre vertraut ist, sollte auch mit Bioshock Infinite keinerlei Probleme haben. Es gibt zahlreiche Schusswaffen (natürlich alle in einem gewissen Retro-Stil - Zur Erinnerung: Wir sind im Jahr 1912) und zusätzlich dazu noch übernatürliche Kräfte (wie z.B. Blitze, die man aus der Hand schießen kann, Übernehmen der Kontrolle von Maschinen usw usf.), die man im Laufe des Spiels freischaltet. Insgesamt ist das Gameplay aber nur mäßig bis durchschnittlich - hier liefert Bioshock Infinite \"nur\" gewohnte Ego-Shooter Kost ab. Die Waffen und ihr Trefferfeedback zum Beispiel sind nicht 100% gelungen. Hier habe ich schon deutlich bessere Ego-Shooter gespielt. Und auch die KI ist nicht die allerbeste.\nDie Gegner sind aber sehr vielfältig und teilweise wirklich abgefahren, ähnlich wie auch in den ersten beiden Bioshock Teilen.\n\n[b][u]Grafik[/u][/b]\nDie Optik des Spiels war für mich im ersten Moment ein wenig ungewohnt, aber sie ist wirklich wirklich gut. Vieles ist in sehr fröhlichen und knalligen Farben gehalten, was häufig einen Kontrast zu der teilweise doch sehr derben Gewalt des Spiels erstellt. Was ich am Look des Spiels aber am beeindruckendsten finde, ist, wie das Spiel bedeutende Ortschaften in Szene setzt: Man kommt zum Beispiel um eine Ecke, folgt einem Weg durch ein großes Tor und steht darauf plötzlich vor einem (fliegenden) Stadtpanorama mit verschiedenen Läden und über allem thront im Hintergrund eine große Statue. Nichts wirkt hier so, als sei es zufällig platziert. Jede Location, die man betritt ist wirklich sehr gut durchdacht und unglaublich gut designed. Das ist wirklich ganz große Klasse. Die Stadt Columbia übertrifft alles, was ich bisher in einem vergleichbaren Spiel gesehen habe!\nAußerdem ist die Welt, trotz ihres linearen Aufbaus, überaus abwechslungsreich - kein Bereich gleicht dem nächsten.\nEin einziges Manko gibt es aber: Das Spiel verfügt nur über sehr wenige Charakter-Modelle. So sieht man häufig das gleiche Kind innerhalb weniger Meter zwei Mal etc...\n\n[b][u]Sound[/u][/b]\nDer Sound des Spiels ist ebenfalls sehr gelungen: Die Dialoge sind professionell und mit wirklich guten Sprechern vertont, an den richtigen Stellen wird das Spiel von passender Hintergrundmusik untermalt und die Waffen- und Umgebungsgeräusche gehen auch in Ordnung.\n\n[b][u]Umfang[/u][/b]\nIch habe für einen Spieldurchlauf um die 15 Stunden gebraucht, man kann sich über die Länge des Spiels also keineswegs beschweren. (Ich bin aber auch jemand, der sich jede Ecke genau anschaut, alle Voxophone sammelt (das sind Memoaufnahmen verschiedener Charaktere des Spiels, die noch mehr über die Story verraten) und auch mal stehen bleibt, um die Aussicht zu genießen.)\n\n[b][u]In Zahlen[/u][/b]\n[b][i]Writing[/i][/b]\nStory 10/10\nCharaktere und Dialoge 10/10\n\n[b][i]Technik und Atmosphäre[/i][/b]\nSpielwelt 10/10\nGrafik 8/10\nSound 10/10\n\n[b][i]Gameplay[/i][/b]\nLeveldesign 7/10\nBedienung 10/10\nWaffenarsenal und Fähigkeiten: 10/10\nKI 7/10\nUmfang 8/10\n\n[b]Insgesamt: 90/100[/b]\n\nFür mich ist Bioshock Infinite der beste Singeplayer-FPS seit Half Life 2.

I can honestly say it's been a pleasure playing all three games. I can objectively say that all three are good games worth your time, but I've heard so much on both ends about BioShock Infinite. Everyone and their grandmother's praised the hell out of this game (even Yahtzee), and yet there was still a following of criticisms about the game being just average, and...\n\nMuch like my location on my girlfriend's legs last night, I think I'm somewhere in between.\n\nFor one, BioShock Infinite is gorgeous. The graphics and artistic aesthetic alone are enough to make this game worth playing, even for non-gamers. The world of Columbia is beautiful to look at and extrememly well-fleshed out as you explore it.\n\nAlso, despite what many critics have said, I enjoyed the gameplay just fine. I love the Skyhook system and the 2-weapon-2-vigor system greatly simplfies what I thought was a bit of a clunky inventory system in BioShock 1 and 2. I know some people like all their weapons and sh** in one place so they know when to use what weapon when, but I managed just fine with my various guns throughout the game. \n\nBut... the inventory is a bit too simplified. You get a ton of clothings, but you never get a chance to actually flip through all of the ones you've obtained to mix and match which articles you want to wear. And some of them honestly aren't that good, much like the different upgrades for guns and vigors. It's just not very creative on that front.\n\nWell... actually, BioShock 3 isn't very creative on a few fronts. The vigors themselves seem out of place in Columbia. Plasmids made sense for their existence in BioShock, but in Infinite... super-powers in a society of religious nuts doesn't really make sense.\n\nActually, a lot of stuff in Infinite translates over from the original BioShock, which doesn't make any sense in the new context. Like looting in a lively city, and the sudden disappearance of the citizens of Columbia once the sh** hits the proverbial fan. And the big plot twist and ending, while very clever and unexpected, aren't as visceral or as intelligent as... say, BioShock's big twist. Infinite does have some pretty deep stuff to say about the nature of choices and the concept of a multiverse... but with what few choices you're given in the game, it doesn't really make a lot of sense when you add the story so far to it. Ending's still pretty damn good, though.\n\nHonestly, I did enjoy the story of Infinite. It's just those little details to the world and some of the gameplay issues that make the game come across as kinda sloppy. But with how tightly built the world of Columbia and how addicting the actual gunplay is... I'd still recommend BioShock Infinite to anyone willing to play a fun game with some deep moments thrown in for taste. Like Uncharted with little bits of Gone Home thrown into it. I'd still love to go back and play this game despite my qualms with it, and I think it's worth being played by anyone else willing to try out a damn good game. It's just not quite as great as the first BioShock is, in my opinion. But I'm giving BioShock Infinite a big thumbs-up and a 7/10.","timestamp_created":1476756562,"timestamp_updated":1476756562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519650638103485107","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26093738","author":{"steamid":"76561198083997404","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":1627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1437,"last_played":1491776083},"language":"spanish","review":"Clasico instantaneo","timestamp_created":1476744227,"timestamp_updated":1476744227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26093314","author":{"steamid":"76561198143227439","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1311,"last_played":1592449798},"language":"english","review":"I bought this on sale out of a whim and the hype reviews that came with it. My first demo experience with Bioshock series 1 and 2 was just a \"Meh\". But for this, it was an eye opener like a shining gem in a mound of rocks. In the first half hour, I was imediately captivated by the theme, breath taking atmosphere, and the retro classical music. I could already tell by the quality experience I just witnessed that I am in for a long pleasure ride.\n\nI feel that this game is very well made. Everything from the atmosphere, story, high speed action, and even the game mechanics feel very fluid. I first played on hard thinking this game would be easy beat, but it is not. The enemies are scary and intelegent if you don't know the strategy, and you need to play smart. There are times when I feel like I am pressured and need to run for my life to scounge around for ammo and health. The exploration is great as almost every corner/room there maybe hidden valuables. I like how they implemented assisted navigation to let you know where you are going. Although this game is linear to the objective, finding your way without it can be confusing.\n\nThe only major downfall is the choices you make doesn't really matter. It would be cool if your decisions actually have an impact on the story like Dishonored. This is probably now my favorite solo game of all time. I'd rate this a 9.5/10. If I could go back in time, I'd pay for full price and feel more appreciative for what I paid for.\n\n","timestamp_created":1476741848,"timestamp_updated":1476741848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26092184","author":{"steamid":"76561197983284494","num_games_owned":391,"num_reviews":283,"playtime_forever":673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":643,"last_played":1476642216},"language":"russian","review":"Очень крутая игра, в которую должен поиграть каждый ценитель сюжетов про перелеты во времени и всего фантастичного","timestamp_created":1476736402,"timestamp_updated":1476736402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47552788257598877","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26092066","author":{"steamid":"76561198027819145","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":480,"last_played":1476734402},"language":"italian","review":"Ho apprezzato molto di più la storia di questo Bioshock rispetto ai primi 2 (che comunque restano capolavori), anche se Columbia non è riuscita ad affascinarmi come fece Rapture. \nIl gameplay è divertente anche se a parte qualche novità (skyline) non introduce nulla di particolarmente innovativo rispetto a quanto proposto nei precedenti capitoli.\nHo trovato la difficoltà talvolta sbilanciata ed in alcuni punti ho provato un po' di frustrazione perché erano veramente difficili rispetto al resto del gioco.

The way religion, totalitarian leaderships and revolutions are portrayed teaches you how every action has a reaction, even if it’s not part of the same story, and how no decision is a wrong decision. It shows an alternate way of living, a “what if” ideal to history. Small wonder BioShock Infinite's dizzying science fiction also draws heavily on eye-widening quantum phenomena such as Many-Worlds Interpretation (for multiple universes) and entanglement (for trans-universe communication). Flux pinning is also briefly touched upon along with many others that I will leave for you to discover (incase you still haven't played this game). \n\n[i]Zachary Hale Comstock: \"One man goes into the waters of baptism, a different man comes out, born again. But who is that man who lies submerged? Perhaps that swimmer is both sinner and saint, until he is revealed unto the eyes of man.\"[/i]\n\nThe progression of the story has incredible twists and plot scenarios. You're thrust into the environment in amnesiac state for a very important reason - because it allows for a gargantuan payoff at the end; quite likely, the most unexpected finale to a game ever conceptualized. There is so much depth here. The game introduces new gameplay dynamics and elements at a steady rate which would keep almost any gamer satiated. It is easily one of the most atmospheric games ever made. The sense of isolation, entrapment, and wonder as you explore the world's incredibly diverse and fantastically imagined environment is palpable. One of the very few games where I felt I was a rat in a cage looking for a way out. There was really nothing else like it at the time - a true original. \n\n[i]Elizabeth: \"What happens if someone finds us here?\"\nBooker DeWitt: \"We tell them we got lost looking for the bathroom.\"\nElizabeth: \"And that works?\"\nBooker DeWitt: \"Not usually, no.\"[/i]\n\nAs you can see, my view is completely biased. I [i]love[/i] the Bioshock series, I have from when I first played the games and I still do now. [b]It is an intelligent franchise that confronts philosophical issues on a level most games don't even aspire to. It is one of the games we hold up in the air when trying to convince non-gamers that games can and should be taken seriously.[/b]\n\nEdit: Nominated for the \"Test of Time\" Steam award.","timestamp_created":1476725169,"timestamp_updated":1479968316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547486007213592529","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26089060","author":{"steamid":"76561198160566319","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":466,"last_played":1480000479},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очень хорошая проходил несколько раз обожаю всю серию биошок рекомендую пройти все части","timestamp_created":1476722609,"timestamp_updated":1476722609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26088310","author":{"steamid":"76561198007843399","num_games_owned":387,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":310,"last_played":1629782686},"language":"english","review":"BEST.GAME.EVER.
