It's an amazing experience with (some) enjoyable replayability and very nice puzzles. The story is amazing and so is overall gameplay. Even though some things from the trailers didn't make it to the game, it's still an unique experience tons of times better than Portal 1. In short, if you don't have this game yet, BUY IT. You WON'T regret it, seriously, it's damn worth the money. A perfect 10.\" - My April 23rd, 2011 recommendation.\n\nWell, my opinion hasn't changed one bit: this is one of the greatest single player puzzle experiences you can have on the PC. But why did I decide to remake the review?\nWELL BECAUSE NOW IT HAS A \"#$)%/\" AWESOME LEVEL EDITOR WHICH IS THE BEST THING VALVE HAS DONE TO ANY OF THEIR GAMES SINCE THE GOLD RUSH UPDATE FOR TF2 HOLY !)#/. (my favourite mode in TF2 is Payload, yes.)\n\nOkay, sorry about that. I understand how fanboyish I sounded there. But come on, an already great game getting an EASY TO LEARN AND USE editor?
