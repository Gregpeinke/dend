Every single platform had at least one major FPS released that year. The PC had Doom 3, Far Cry, and Half Life 2. The GameCube had Metroid Prime 2, the PS2 had Killzone, and the Xbox, of course, had Halo 2. And while Halo's multiplayer made it the most important of the group, it was Valve's much-anticipated sequel that took the crown as the best. As the only game of the bunch to not include its own multiplayer component (CS: Source doesn't count), it is perhaps not as surprising as it seemed at the time that Half Life 2 was an adventure that excelled in almost every area. Its most obvious improvement was the new physics engine, something that Valve took every opportunity to show off, marking not only a remarkable technical achievement, but using that achievement as an integral part of the gameplay. Like Doom 3, Half Life 2 allowed every weapon to be carried at once, and the core mechanics were virtually identical to its predecessor (Gravity Gun aside). \n\nBut gameplay was not what made Half Life 2 one of the greatest games ever made. That honor fell to almost everything else about the game; the sharp writing, terrifying atmosphere, incredible art direction, Hollywood-quality voice acting, and engrossing storyline. The universe Valve had created was nothing short of astounding, and the developer remains unmatched in its ability to tell a wordless story using nothing but the Source engine's expansive library of assets. Players who looked at each locale closely enough were rewarded with countless subplots, often touchingly told with nothing but blood, bullet holes, and overturned couches. Players want Half Life 3 not for the next evolution of the genre, but for one last chance to marvel at Valve's unmatched talent of merging story with technology to create some of the classiest games in history.\n\n\nSCORE: 10","timestamp_created":1312323056,"timestamp_updated":1393937960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515072047710418701","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"126808","author":{"steamid":"76561197962651531","num_games_owned":416,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1517048458},"language":"english","review":"So far.

Over 15 years later, this game is still the standard and holds up beautifully. Great storytelling, puzzles, graphics, sound, everything. At this point in time, I recommend playing the \"Half-Life 2: Update\" mod (free from the Steam store but requires the base game) as it includes minor graphical enhancements that bring the game even closer to today's standards. However, the main game functions exactly the same and if you don't mind the graphical difference then the base game is close enough. Overall, I absolutely enjoyed this game and I cannot wait to experience more of this series.","timestamp_created":1309897838,"timestamp_updated":1576190562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3383234","author":{"steamid":"76561198021793750","num_games_owned":310,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":654,"last_played":1313737200},"language":"english","review":"HL series is amazing.
