Einerseits ist es das erkennbar ausgereifteste Spiel der Serie und andererseits ist es kein echtes BioShock. Damit wäre im Prinzip schon alles gesagt. Es ist flüssig, wie aus einem Guss, macht viel Spaß und führt die Story mehr oder weniger logisch weiter. Es ist aber weniger düster und apokalyptisch, man ist nicht mehr wie ein Teil des Bösen, sonder ganz klar bei den Guten. Interessant ist der Wandel vom Big Daddy, zum Agenten einer verwöhnten und köstlich naiven Königstochter, ein ganz anderer Aspekt. Das Happy End allerdings schon von Anfang an klar, es hat nichts mehr mit Wasser und Tiefsee und Hoffnungslosigkeit zu tun, sondern spielt in den Wolken, die Menschen sind nur noch halb so verrückt.

K onomu poslednímu zmíněnému - příběhu, k němu mohu říct bez jakékoliv námitky, že je naprosto dokonalý, leč velmi komplikovaný a složitý. Vyžaduje abnormální soustředění na hru a na všechny detaily. Pochválit také musím velmi do podrobna zpracovaný background story a návaznost na příběh. Co se týče grafického zpracování, tak i na rok 2020 se zdá velmi svěží. Hra v podstatě běží na vysoké detaily na plynulých 60 FPS na jakémkoliv dnešním zařízení a tak celkově působí stejně jako mnoho dalších her od 2K - velmi (na svojí dobu) nadčasově a dokonale, do sebemenšího detailu zasazená do doby, kdy se odehrává. Zde je to rok 1912 v létajícím městě Columbia s nádechem steampunku. Prostředí je přímo dech beroucí. Optimalizace je taktéž skvělá, za celý průchod jsem neměl ani jeden zásek, gamecrash, kolizi předmětů ani podobné problémy. Hratelnostně jsem měl zhruba dvě výtky, a to je nastavení citlivosti myši. Protože v nastavení to sice jde, ale když to máte na nejmenší, tak to vyhovuje na všechno, kromě míření se zbraněmi (což je docela zásadní v FPS hře), a jakmile si to v boji zvednete, zase je to téměř nepoužitelné pro všechno ostatní, tudíž bylo potřeba manuálně přepínat citlivost na myši. A druhá, je koridovost a nemožnost se volně pohybovat a přecházet z jednotlivých lokací, např kvůli vedlejším misím, či sbírání collectibles - musíte přes hlavní menu a výběr kapitol. Ale to je tak asi jediné. co bych chtěl vytknout a mohu se zase vrátit k vychvalování. Tím mohu pokračovat u postav, rovnou řeknu, že Elizabeth považuji za jednu z nejlépe napsaných NPC postav ve videoherním světě.

Rapture, for one.  Great place to explore, wonderfully dreary, yet lively.  Every now and then, it's the perfect world to get your fill of dystopia.  Sort of how one watches film noirs from time to time; the rain, the trenchcoats and cigarette smoke; it's evocative.  \n\nNo Rapture in Infinite.*\n\nOK.  That sounds like a disincentive to playing, right?  Here's the thing; I like that the main game isn't in Rapture; while it's an awesome place, there's only so much you can do in it.  Going back is asking for trouble.**  Instead, we have Columbia, a city in the clouds also accessed by a secret lighthouse.   Now, the dreariness of Rapture, the atmosphere of the place, those were big selling points for me.  Columbia is bright and sunny; people are cheerful, and so on.  Of course, s*** proceeds to get real as the game goes on and we learn of the dark things under the surface.  I consider Columbia a downgrade from Rapture, but better than having a Rapture retread, if that makes sense.  Actually, I think this is so regardless of whether it makes sense to you; my convictions are not bound to your perceptions.  \n\nRight, what else was good in the first two games?  Story and characters.  We have story and we have characters.  Is the story as good as the first game?  I'd say no, but it's more a matter of taste; it's well-executed for sure.  Characters are fine.  Most of you probably know that you get a sidekick for most of the game.  Some people think she's great; others dislike her (leading one eminent reviewer to dub this game \"Steampunk Waifu Escort Simulator 2013\").  She doesn't bother me much; she passes the ammunition and stays out of my line of fire.\n\nLoved the sound design in BioShock; sound effects are still good here.  Check.\n\nThe first game was about a city run on the ideas of Ayn Rand; it goes to s*** (someone discovers magical slugs which turn people into maniacs).  The second game was about the same city run under a Commie broad; it goes to s*** (Communism).  What about Columbia?  Well, it hasn't gone to s*** yet; perhaps you can try to prevent that?  What's its overarching theme?  The Mormons have taken over.  Laugh all you want, but a man who claims to be a Prophet, one [strike]Joseph Smith[/strike] Zachary Comstock claims that God told him to rescue the people from their ways, etc., etc.  He builds a sky city using mysterious technology and rules as a divine leader.  Columbia is going for American Exceptionalism Gone Wrong, or, as I would put it, If America Was Founded By A**holes.  Washington, Franklin, and Jefferson are revered as prophets also, while Lincoln is regarded as a vile perverter (Oddly, one of the enemies in the game will frequently say, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident...\" He does not go on to say, \"...that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness...\").  Naturally, they don't like black people.  I actually have to take issue with the game on this; one of the elements of the first two games is how people of different classes/levels interacted, thrived, lived in Rapture, a city filled with the best and brightest.  It is astutely pointed out that SOMEBODY has to do the menial jobs for society to function, and that a hierarchy will emerge even amongst the elite to handle this stuff.  Interesting, yes?  Now, we go to Columbia.  The theocracy regards blacks as lesser creatures; folks don't seem to like them much.  Right.  Why the hell are there blacks in Columbia, then?  I mean, you have complete control over who comes to your city; you don't like blacks; don't let them come; bam, problem solved, those colored folks won't be polluting your lives any more.  Further, blacks; why the hell would you want to go to a place where the theocracy is opposed to you and where the folks treat you like dirt?  Maybe let the crazy Mormons (with guns, automated turrets, magical power things, battle zeppelins, etc.) have their city?  It would be as if a bunch of hobbits insisted on moving into an orc village.  WHY?  Because the game has to show you that the evil Mormons don't like the black folks.  [spoiler] I think it is further weakened when we learn that, unlike Ryan and Lamb, Comstock is far more cynical than he lets on; those former two were all in on their philosophies, unlike Comstock [/spoiler].  \n\nSo, the overarching theme of the city is not as cool or interesting as its predecessors.  Can't win em all. It's not boring, mind you.  \n\nBioShock games are not much about the gameplay.  As I mentioned in my other reviews, they're pretty easy, especially once you've learned the game a bit and if you're thorough.  Infinite took steps to deal with this.  First, you cannot carry health kits or EVE hypos with you to charge yourself back up; you have to find such items in the middle of a fight or rely on your sidekick to toss you some.  Your weapons are less powerful; in the first two games you could obtain such things as a speargun, grenade/rocket launchers, laser, and other a**-kicking tools.  Plus, you could set up a ton of traps to lure enemies into.  Infinite, as you might imagine, is way more open in its map design, so the addition of a sniper rifle is most welcome.  Ammo is scarce; you frequently find yourself low or out of shots, a rare thing in the early titles.  You only get two guns; ... as a guy who likes old school games, this is a Major f*** you (not a Lieutenant f*** you, a Major f*** you).  I get why they did this, and no doubt the \"B-b-b-but REALISM\" crowd will say that it's how it should be; listen, dips***s; this is a game set in a floating city in which the Mormons have taken over, people have access to what amounts to magic, and you're going to tell me that limiting my gun carrying capacity to two will help with realism?  Have you seen these games' art style?  Don't clench your buttcheeks, you mouth-breathing dim-bulbs; you'd decapitate yourselves.  The game charges money to respawn you; not sure why, but whatever; if you don't have the cash, you get kicked to the menu.  Fair enough; I'll just reload my quick save and...wait, what?  The game doesn't let you save manually.  You get checkpoints.  Again, old school games; they let me save whenever I want.  Now, in the end this wasn't such a big deal; the checkpoints aren't too punitive.  Suffice it to say that I've beaten the game on the hardest difficulty and it wasn't horrendous or anything (yeah, there were some parts I had a lot of trouble with, but taxpayer dollars, American pride, and the sweat of an honest day's work got me through).  Now, again, there are some complaints here about the gameplay for sure; much like the Rapture to Columbia downgrade part; I'm glad they went in some new directions, giving the game a different feel instead of copy-pasting.  It still feels like a BioShock game in some ways.  There's more I could say about the gameplay, but I've gone on long enough; passable to sometimes very OK.  \n\nOutside of a sentence or two in the first game and grunts/pain noises, the first two games had silent protagonists.  Not so here.  I think he's OK; nothing special, nothing abysmal; just a tough guy who's had a tough life, takes on a tough job, finds himself in tough spots, and tries to tough it out.  Tough to say much more about it.  \n\nI suppose I could go on...actually, I'm just about at the word limit.  Good game, all things considered, definitely a different flavor of BioShock; worth a shot. \n\n*By 'no' I mean 'about two minute's worth.'  \n\n**Granted, the DLCs take you back there; I forgive them, as they do so before/during the fall of Rapture (something we don't get to see directly, besides Delta's intro in BioShock 2) and bring different gameplay than the first two games to the city.","timestamp_created":1585233151,"timestamp_updated":1585233341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65858357","author":{"steamid":"76561198450173942","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":554,"last_played":1605437855},"language":"schinese","review":"1：刚进游戏闪退  解决：进游戏输入法先切换到英文 （ 游戏中按shift可能会切换回中文  输入法设置模式切换改为无）\n2.玩十几分钟卡掉  解决：全屏游戏改为窗口全屏模式（我自己是这样解决的，可能还有不同情况）\n","timestamp_created":1585230474,"timestamp_updated":1585230474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65858168","author":{"steamid":"76561198188287746","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":784,"last_played":1598196293},"language":"schinese","review":"四十块钱全家桶，包含无限所有DLC以及1 2和重置版，多划算不用我多说了吧。","timestamp_created":1585230273,"timestamp_updated":1585230273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65857639","author":{"steamid":"76561198883616291","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1990,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":597,"last_played":1585404934},"language":"english","review":"good game would be good to have the dlc added","timestamp_created":1585229771,"timestamp_updated":1585229771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65857621","author":{"steamid":"76561198865287593","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":505,"last_played":1585296801},"language":"schinese","review":"伊丽莎白女神\n","timestamp_created":1585229751,"timestamp_updated":1585229751,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65857338","author":{"steamid":"76561198802046643","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":958,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":517,"last_played":1627087308},"language":"german","review":"Ich finde das Spiel super!

My laptop has a Geforce 820M and after playing around with some settings I got it looking playable and fluid, though obviously with some magic lost. I'm still thrilled!\n\nShould you play the previous 2 Bioshock games before playing this one?\n> Bioshock 1 is a must!\n> Bioshock 2 is not required as the narratives don't intersect, but still extremely good!\n\nShould you purchase the DLC?\n> Assuming you don't just go for the all included bundle, which on a good sale can go for very low prices, I would say the Burial at Sea DLC (which is in two parts) is a MUST-BUY, they are the perfect send-off to the series. The writers really nailed it narratively, and the gameplay in each episode alters significantly from the main game, keeping it fresh.\n\nWhat is the story like?\n> All 3 Bioshock games are rife with twists and turns which (despite the foreshadowing being at times heavy handed) keeps you guessing and hooked to find out more. The characters are engaging.\n\nOther positive points worth mentioning?\n> If there's one thing the devs mastered in this series, it's tone. This was true for the previous titles, but Infinite is in a league of it's own. Shoutout to the people who designed the opening scene of Burial At Sea - Episode 2, you did a great job and I don't know how you could match the emotions I felt in that scene in any other medium.\n> Bioshock is also an extremely political series, offering commentary on the various dystopias portrayed and the different ideologies that clash within them. Infinite has the most interesting political exploration in my opinion because it starts off a lot more subtle than the other games. The dystopia really reveals itself as time goes on. If you were also unaware of early 20th labour history in the US, this game gives you a decent look into that which I really appreciated.\n\nCriticisms:\n> Infinite tends to stutter, even if you mess around to get optimal settings. It's a big title with a lot of moving parts, and it's clear the devs made an effort to camouflage the flaws in some neat and creative ways, but performance can be an issue (though even on my potato, I got through it pleasantly).\n> A looot of repetitive dialog from the goons. This is especially clear in the DLC's which emphasize stealth and slow play, holy shit can they shut up one minute? Minor gripe in the grand scheme of things, but I felt like this could have been done better.\n\nWeird narrative gripe from a politics nerd: \n> This is more of a personal complaint, but I found the development of the Vox Populi to unfortunately be a little... unintuitive? Like I get what they were going for, and the game needed justification for throwing more goons at you, but I felt like the transition from Civil Rights Activist led Libertarian Socialists/Anarchists turning into the Khmer Rouge was not really justified all that well narratively. \n> It's also not really a great look when the people you sympathize with at the start of the game for being immiserated, exploited, and abused ruthelessly for their race and status in society to all of the sudden become bloodthirsty monsters who only ever wanted to murder as many people as possible... Did the writers just forget about the segregation and starvation they wrote into the game?

game 蒸汽朋克+平行世界理论+反乌托邦和宏大的世界观，还有几乎是圣歌的配乐真不愧神作。希望九月份玩2077的时候也能给我这样的震撼吧。（打完之后有太多的思考，就是没什么人可以分享让人感到孤独，现实中怎么没有伊丽莎白这样的妹子呢。对乌托邦的讽刺，这不就是马克思抨击空想主义吗：），平行世界的理论很多影视作品快拍烂了想一想也是能想通，蒸汽动力的设定真的震撼了我一下，特别是序章进入哥伦比亚时，伴着Will the Circle Be Unbroken这个近乎圣歌的配乐(我真的太喜欢这首歌了），走到教堂里看着其他人朝圣，主角进入到一个崭新的空中城市，amazing。武器系统不算加分，毕竟不是fps游戏，都说这部不太恐怖，但我还是觉得有一点恐怖，处决效果真的血腥，在后期探索屋子的时候也真的吓人。whatever，真的引发了我的思考。最后一点是不满，对华人的算得上是wuru了，义和团华人的形象实在太刻板丑陋
