If you're more focused on puzzles, play both Portal and Portal 2 (and get the Portal Level Pack in LEGO Dimensions, like I did) because in this game you'll be taking on lots of puzzles. There are 19 test chambers, an escape sequence and a finale to play through, and you have to rely on the Portal Gun, a machine that can create gateways, to get from entrance to exit. I came into the game thinking 'Oh I'll just fire a portal by the entrance, fire one at the exit and then be off' but that's when you find out about the gun's one weakness - black walls.

While I can't say anything that hasn't been said before, Portal is truly in a league of its own in the puzzle genre. The amount of attention to detail put into the environments and the level of thinking required in succeeding its tests is beyond that of other games, forcing the player to consider physics and the different possibilities opened up by the ASHPD. While it's not overly difficult to beat the game, you have to re-imagine the three-dimensional world around you- you have to think with portals. The mysterious nature of Aperture Science Laboratories and the comedic, yet occasionally cryptic monlogue GLaDOS spouts at you enhances the experience while hinting at the game's hidden truths. The addition of the Aperture Science Sentry Turrets later on adds another level of strategy, yet gives the game some action with the threat of death. I often found myself carefully considering my plan for making it through the chamber unscathed, and learning how to outwit my utterly hilarious foes gives the player a feeling of accomplishment in its own right. It's not very often that a game is so immersive, as well. the graphics are downright beautiful, the character and plot well-developed, and the mechanics perfected beyond perfection. The end sequence and end boss fight are wonderfully memorable, giving even more insight on what GLaDOS is and her motivations for her actions. I have only one qualm with this game, being that, while its writing is witty, its gameplay is captivating, and its mechanics are imaginative, it just doesn't last as long as you'd want it to. Portal is a sweet, yet somewhat short experience. That one flaw, I believe, is not nearly enough to impact this game's overall quality. \n\nValve's Portal is an amazing achievement in game design, and it's worthy of my positive review.","timestamp_created":1456539589,"timestamp_updated":1456539589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21482948","author":{"steamid":"76561198155412316","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1510708480},"language":"english","review":"i havent played this game in 4 year s","timestamp_created":1456519294,"timestamp_updated":1628033485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21481222","author":{"steamid":"76561198255461799","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1585488128},"language":"russian","review":"Не любитель головоломок, но идея с порталлами меня очень заинтересовала, всем любителям головоломок рекомендую, даже тем, кто такой жанр обходит стороной, попробуйте, головолмки не трудные, а очень даже интересные, минус только в том, что сюжет всего за 2-3 часа проходится, а так супер, поиграйте, рекомендую)","timestamp_created":1456514306,"timestamp_updated":1456514306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21480139","author":{"steamid":"76561198062381483","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1570287845},"language":"english","review":"Portal is another great game with excellent puzzles and great graphics.

The puzzle solving in this game is spectacular, and unlike anything i've seen in a game. Levels ranged from easy challenges that i was able to figure out almost insantly, to mind numbingly tough puzzles that took me more time then i'd like to admit.\n\nThe story in this game is minimalist in the best ways. The calming but creepy voice of GLADoS as she guides you ultimately to your death is chilling. Though the final fight is quite easy, the journey to reach GLADoS is an unforgettable one.\n\nThe one gripe I had with this game is how short it is. I was able to complete this game in just about 3 hours, and though the challenges added a few more hours, the length definitely took away from the experience.\n\nOverall, this is a game that all PC owners should buy, and though it won't take you a very long time, you will enjoy every second of the experience.\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1456410800,"timestamp_updated":1456410889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21436499","author":{"steamid":"76561198234153448","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":439,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1460860255},"language":"english","review":"This Game is Awesome i may get the second one!","timestamp_created":1456367062,"timestamp_updated":1456367062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21432849","author":{"steamid":"76561198198551991","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":577,"last_played":1456304974},"language":"english","review":"Of course if you don't already know.

This game has a bit history to it since it was made as a sorry gift for the late arrival of Half Life 2, a game I yet to play and will be playing soon as I get Half Life plus considering the fact that Yahtzee, The Hardest To Please Person out there could not find a criticism for the game means it has to be pretty good. Well then, you are wrong since I'm probley even harder to please so let's start.\n\nFirst thing on the agenda, Portal Placement. Its Fucking Annoying. If one of your portals is slightly angled, you will have to wreastle the camera to aim your gun to shoot a new portal before you go through it again. This gets really annoying when you needed to portal somewhere while in infinte freefall as it is in Chamber 18 I think. Second thing, the fanbase... Lol, not really, its the puzzles. I know its a puzzle game and its appose to be hard but chamber 18 and later on chambers are just stupid. You need everything timed to the tee and if you fucked up once, you will have to wait and prepare everything again so yeah.\n\nThe game is nice to look at and if you need something to play between downloads, I would try this since Portal 2 at $20 isnt worth it so this the alt to the gaming's CLT-ALT-DEL with CLT being Half Life And DEL being Deus Ex.","timestamp_created":1456146115,"timestamp_updated":1456146115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21384904","author":{"steamid":"76561198090041590","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":336,"last_played":1436040266},"language":"brazilian","review":"Tenho q escrever uma análise entao, pra quem nao jogou esse jogo... no words for u","timestamp_created":1456144589,"timestamp_updated":1456144589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21384845","author":{"steamid":"76561198052506840","num_games_owned":1758,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":492,"last_played":1455447771},"language":"english","review":"Starts off light and fluffy but get's twisted quickly.

It starts off easy but gets more difficult along the way. Not to the extend that you would find yourself sobbing in a corner or smashing your keyboard because you can't find the solution. Well... if you don't take the bonus map challenges into account that is. These challenges are ridiculously difficult in comparison to the game. I like a challenge, but some time-challenges took the fun out of the game for me. It's only then you notice handling objects isn't as smooth as you might hope and it can be a little frustrating. But enough about the challenges! I enjoyed playing the game. It's funny in it's own way and the level design is simple but nice.\n\nPRO:\n- Humor\n- Fun level design\n- Fairly solid gameplay\n- Setting\n\nCON:\n- Not really bug-free\n- Rather short\n- Handling objects\n\nThe humor makes up for every CON I wrote down in my opinion.
