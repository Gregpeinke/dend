Portanto, é comum pensarmos que um jogo de estreia funcione como uma mera \"fundação\", uma primeira aventura dos desenvolvedores, que ainda estão com medo de mergulhar no mar e só põe as pontas dos dedos do pé.\n\nIsso é a pior maneira de descrever Half-Life.\n\nO design de níveis é extraordinário, possibilitando diversas maneiras de você atravessá-lo e recompensando a sua exploração com segredos e mais suprimentos para enfrentar invasores de outra dimensão.\n\nOs inimigos são desafiadores (e um pouco frustrantes, mas isso se dá por conta da idade do jogo) e variados, forçando você a usar o vasto arsenal que conquistará ao longo da sua escapatória. \n\nA história é simples: Você é Gordon Freeman, um físico teórico empregado pela Black Mesa, que é pego em um experimento fracassado que traz seres de outro mundo. É uma premissa boa o suficiente para justificar uma campanha de ação e FPS, mas os cuidados com o storytelling e a preparação para o final são inovadoras para a época e uma maneira interessante de engajar o jogador dentro dos limites de um design linear (Me lembrou muito o que foi feito no primeiro Portal. Preste atenção ao que está ao seu arredor!).\n\nApesar de alguns maneirismos da época que podem se tornar inconvenientes para o jogador, como a falta de legendas e de feedback na hora do tiroteio (pelo menos, eu achei difícil saber logo de cara quando um inimigo morreu), é um jogo que vale a pena para qualquer amante de games, não só pela fundação que ele representa para a história da Valve, um dos maiores estúdios de videogame de todos os tempos, como pela própria experiência em si.\n\nNota: 9/10","timestamp_created":1657766298,"timestamp_updated":1657766298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118778330","author":{"steamid":"76561198402477675","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":23,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1656996110},"language":"turkish","review":"Tabi Efendim","timestamp_created":1657765002,"timestamp_updated":1657765002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118775196","author":{"steamid":"76561199180652178","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":33,"playtime_at_review":845,"last_played":1660491957},"language":"spanish","review":"me acabo de pasar el juego y es simplemente una obra maestra","timestamp_created":1657759347,"timestamp_updated":1657759347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118774943","author":{"steamid":"76561198443915676","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":573,"last_played":1656128939},"language":"english","review":"test chamberrrrrrrrr","timestamp_created":1657758895,"timestamp_updated":1657758895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118774076","author":{"steamid":"76561199091277908","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1071,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1071,"last_played":1657214090},"language":"english","review":"It's a very fun game.

Probably it was a problem with HDD but it doesn't matter. Then the disk was stolen (actually not the disk, but the license key. the box was simply replaced or someone thew away the paper with key...), I deleted the game because of small HDD and lived all these years thinking of HL.
