I replayed Bioshock 2 this year as well, and never got into the swing of that. But Bioshock Infinite... on the par of combat, it is amazing. Better than B1 in almost every combat aspect. The rail system allows for a, well, infinite amount of angles to approach and attack enemies. The sounds go so well, such as the ending of combat music, the ding of headshots, or the blare of an incoming airship.\n\nAmbiance - sad, a feeling of despair. B1 had that feeling of sorrow, unknown, and the light of hope. Infinite brings out that aspect, with the addition of empathy, regret, etc. I felt so many conflicting emotions. Sadly, it's not as horrific as Bioshock 1 and 2, which was one of the main reasons I remember those games so well. The boys of silence are frightening, but so trivial in the development of the plot. Sadly they appear for only one level. Songbird is obviously similar to the Big Daddies, but he's just one compared to the hundreds Big Daddies in Rapture.\n\n The story is captivating, the characters bring tears, the plot twists just swing out at you with amazing detail, and truthfully the ending is ... amazing.  Play it, buy it, live it, love it.","timestamp_created":1386045707,"timestamp_updated":1386046131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7891274","author":{"steamid":"76561198026808074","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1283,"last_played":1396765735},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game!\n\nInteresting storyline, interesting characters, fun environment, awesome gameplay!!!

This game has received so much praise that it physically pains me, because I know in the back of my mind people with no concept of consumerism are buying into this hype train wreck.\n\nBioshock Infinite has repetitive gunplay with unsatisfying weapons that are better than their successors that appear later in the game when upgraded. It has horrible hostile A.I. that uses no form of logic other than aggressively running into the open and mindlessly attacking the player. There is also a lack of unique enemy types to freshen up the combat, and any uncommon enemy that is in the game can still be killed by simply shooting at them. No enemy types require any form of special strategy or apporach to defeat them, so the unique enemy types serve no purpose, and may as well be normal generic enemies. The vigors lack variety, and often just replace functions that mixed up the gameplay in previous installments of the series. Many of the combat vigors are simply grenades with fancy skins and a tripmine feature. Also the enemy A.I. hardly makes use of vigors, only the flame and crow enemies use any type of Vigor. Splicers in previous Bioshock titles used plasmids very often, and made enemy encounters more varied, plus with vigors taking the same role as plasmids, should they not be a commonly used tool among the citizens of Columbia? The tear feature is extremely under-utilized, and doesn't alter the game environment during combat nearly enough to really keep the experience fresh. So every fight narrows down to shooting at bullet sponge enemies and throwing vigor grenades. \n\nEscort missions have always been things players dread, but many games have achieved amazing escort mechanics such as Yoshi's Island, Resident Evil 4 and Ico. Instead of actually trying to be inventive, and making escort mechanics seem less of a chore, Irrational Games decided to remove the gameplay element of escorting Elizabeth from the equation entirely (either to pander to the feminists, or avoid the risk of adding something idiots may think is too hard). Elizabeth is unarmed the entire game in the middle of gunfights, there's no way she can, \"Take care of herself,\" without having a weapon or some line of defense. Despite the enemy's main objective to be capturing Elizabeth, they make no efforts to do so during combat. In Ico and Yoshi's Island, the goal of the enemy faction is to capture your partner, that's why preventing them from being captured is an element to the gameplay. Why is Elizabeth in the game? Answer: To pander to Tumblr psuedo feminists who want capable female characters instead of good gameplay, and neckbeards who want to be together with Elizabeth forever. Elizabeth is a useless friendly A.I. that doesn't aid but rather wastes the players time spawning ammo, health, money or other items (due to the previously mentioned bullet-sponge enemies draining you of your ammo, and the enemies dropping ammo for guns randomly, instead of based on the weapons you are currently using) and stripping control away from the player or clouding the screen with a button prompt to receive the item you could have simply picked up yourself, and in no way takes part in combat. While she can pick locks, there is no reason Booker himself couldn't have been given this abilty during development. Either way, you still have to command her to pick the locks, so you might as well be doing it yourself, her doing it for you also removes the possibility of having lockpicking being an aspect to Infinite's gameplay. The tear ability still requires you to command Elizabeth to utilize it, therefore the ability might as well be Booker's. If Elizabeth had an A.I. that utilized tears based on which would be more advantageous to you at any given time, this would have actually given Elizabeth a purpose in the game; too bad that would require work on Irrational Games's part.\n\nInfinite is also highly praised for its atmosphere, but I disagree with this claim.  Attention to detail on the player's part will immediately remove them from the environment they are meant to be immersed in. This game's visuals are praised to be groundbreaking, but only because they used the trite orange-blue contrast everywhere they could instead of the color brown. Level design clashes with the gameplay. Now, the first Bioshock was closterphobic, cramped, tightly packed, consisting of small arenas or hallways. This compliments the more simplistic, arcade-y FPS elements of the game, where you can avoid exposing yourself to many enemies, and reveal yourself to make a quick offensive. In Infinite you have a two weapon limit, so you can't pull out a sniper (you might not have one) and make an offense in the open, you have to approach your enemy, expose yourself, and be forced to take damage. Even the enemy design clashes here, where they'll run at you with melee weapons and be slaughtered by you in the wide open spaces. The melee weapons were useful in Rapture, where enemies could ambush you and get solid hits on you, here it's assanine.\n\nMost of this game's \"atmosphere\" should be credited to fancy skyboxes, and bloom. Whenever I started to take in the environment, something stupid would completely spoil everything. The biggest of all being the first person cutscenes, where the game makes you watch your character do things you didn't command him to do in first person view, the main display mode of the gameplay. When playing a platformer, cutscenes don't play from the stock camera angle, or else you'd be still be in the mindset of trying to control your character, and being surprised to find out that conrol of them has been stripped from you, immediately taking you out of the game.The same rule applies here, the first person view is reserved for the gameplay, so transitions from gameplay to cutscenes are less jarring. Another huge video game sin is where the game presents choices to you through button prompts. These decision making moments aren't presented in the gameplay's format, the gameplay is stopped so you can press a button and watch your decision unfold. One should be prompted to make a decision without being removed from the actual gameplay; the whole Half Life 2 \"pick up the can.\" scenario is a perfect example where you are presented with choice without removing you from the gameplay. The setting of Infinite is nowhere near as compelling as Rapture, where you'd wander the deserted hallways and wonder what life was like before it all fell apart. Instead, Infinite seems to prefer shoving controversial issues like racism or patriotism in, and never actually do anything intellectual with the themes presented.\n\nThe game's focus on narrative is problematic as well, simply because it takes importance over the game's gameplay; the most important part of any game. People seem to think writing has to be \"cerebral\" or \"deep\" to be good, but a simpler story that's charming, horrifying, campy, epic, joyful, or heart-breaking is just as, if not more compelling. Story is something that can be enjoyed on the side. Games shouldn't have to confrom to movies or literature, they are unique in that the player experiences them instead of watching or reading them; the events of the game are happening to you, so you are already invested in the adventure. Video games are about the actions you perform while playing them, the lessons you learn and the the emotions you have while perfoming them, and the sense of accomplishment you experience from overcoming the challenges the game made you face along the way. This game isn't worth your time or money, because it forgets the fact that video games are about the experience of playing them. Anyone willing to look at this game critically will know that buying it is a huge mistake, and a vote for games going further in the wrong direction.","timestamp_created":1386026035,"timestamp_updated":1395428136,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":996,"votes_funny":12,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597342371940612793","comment_count":68,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7887845","author":{"steamid":"76561198028294672","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":910,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":315,"last_played":1401910321},"language":"spanish","review":"Puntuación personal: 9/10\n\nHay que decir que hay un gran salto desde el primer BioShock, que por cierto, fue de lo mejorcito, al igual que este.\n\nRespecto a los gráficos, decir que se ve espectacular para ser un juego de 2012.

Let me reiterate, if you don't play this game, you are missing out on of the greatest video game adventures ever. Coupled with the gameplay, BioShock Infinte is an experience you don't want to miss. It features the same style of gameplay as the first two, you have guns and vigors (this game's version of plasmids). This time around, the vigors are almost completely different from one another whereas in the original BioShocks they mostly all did the same function of stunning and dealing damage. Your companion Elizabeth also adds a whole new element to the game, which is completely new in any game I've ever seen. At a moment's notice you are able to completely change the environment of the battlefield. Be it summoning an automaton ally or creating cover that wasn't there previously, each battle is a dynamic environment that is consistently changing and never gets stale. And did I mention skyhooks? Oh yeah, there is a rail system which you can ride around on in the middle of battle kiting your enemies and moving to different locations quickly.

Floating amongst the clouds, cruising far above sea level, this is a place unlike any you've ever seen. Please enjoy your voyage... \n\nThe third game in the popular Bioshock series, BioShock Infinite breaks away from the underwater setting of the first two games to take players into a floating city held aloft by dirigibles. The game is set in 1912. You play as Booker DeWitt, a disgraced former private detective who's picked up a new case. Your goal is to find Elizabeth, a young woman who's gone missing and return her unharmed. The only problem is that she's being kept on this flying city. Columbia was once a symbol of America's success as a nation, floating around the world as a traveling World's Fair, a marvel of human innovation. But strange things have happened since Columbia's unveiling in 1900, and now the city has disappeared into the clouds. DeWitt knows how to find it, but over the years stories have been told about Columbia having unlawful heavy armament and deranged citizenry. Do not expect this to be a pleasure cruise. \n","timestamp_created":1386007887,"timestamp_updated":1386007887,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7883303","author":{"steamid":"76561198037881352","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1023,"last_played":1591573048},"language":"english","review":"Irrational Games returns with more of what established them as a industry heavy-hitter back in 2007 with the original Bioshock: wildly creative atmosphere/game environment, sharp character development, AAA story that makes for a memorable experience and adds to game replay value and very inventive FPS mechanics.There are few companies that make games where you ought to buy them without thinking twice and Irrational Games are one of them.","timestamp_created":1386007788,"timestamp_updated":1386007788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7883126","author":{"steamid":"76561198041579455","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1503423603},"language":"english","review":"I only got chance to buy this game recently, after playing the first 2 I didn't know whether to buy it.
