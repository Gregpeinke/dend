The workshop, although limited, help the game out a lot, especially for newbies.  The gameplay is relatively different on each map and there are a lot of maps to choose from.  Again, the workshop is still expanding, but the custom maps are also fun.  However, this game is a big hit or miss.  You will either love it or hate it, and there are few in between.  It is mainly just surviving with waves, and a lot of the time, especially on higher difficulties, all you do is sit and camp.  There are a lot of \"newer\" players that can ruin the experience as well since they tend not to use filters when finding games.  With all these bad traits though, if you can look over them, it is definitely worth getting it, especially since the game is on sale 2 - 4 times a year.  Dropping 20 bucks seem like a reasonable price, although I would recommend just waiting for a sale, considering that fact that is can be a swing or miss.  I personally like the game, but I dont think I would pay 20 for it (anymore atleast).","timestamp_created":1385494905,"timestamp_updated":1385494905,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7772530","author":{"steamid":"76561198038500269","num_games_owned":795,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":2345,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1550,"last_played":1449913241},"language":"english","review":"Oh sweet heavenly carnage. Zombie/ monster games are a craze nowadays, and because of that, most tend to become follow the same old boring \"zombie shooter\", failing to stand out much. That doesn't mean they are bad, just uninventive. But not this game.\n  \n Again, oh sweet heavenly carnage! This is one of those games were you have enough ammo to pump those little crawleys full of elad, and feel satisfied about it. The weapons are galore and awesome, the monsters are diverse, tactical, scary, and sometimes even disturbing(You gotta love events!). This game will actually manage to scare you the first few times you turn around to see yourself being smiled at point-blank by a cloth(the slow creepy guy that blocks your movement). Oh and those british voices are bloody awesome! You just won't resist lighting up a smile when you hear something so caracteristically british from yourself or your allies.\n\n So to sum up: You got kewl awesome weapons, kewl classes(forgot to mention),kewl monsters, riddiculously funny and absurd english accents(and some other DLC ones 2), AND unlimmited carnage?

Killing Floor has been updated with content (a lot of it free) so often that Tripwire Interactive is one of my favorite developers.  But enough about them, let's talk about the game.\n\nKilling Floor is a mutant (not zombie and you will be stoned if you refer to them as zombies) survival game.  The premise is that an experiment has gone wrong, mutants emerge, blah blah blah, you've heard it before.  We're not here for the story, we're here for the guns and the killing.  Though one interesting bit about the backstory is that originally it was the military and police dealing with the mutants, but now everyone is in on the fun.  You have DJ's wielding katanas, a guy in a chicken suit, santa clause, and even the pyro from Team Fortress 2.\n\nThe game takes place in the UK, with hilariously over the top stereotypes for each person.  From the accent to the forms of swearing, you'll find yourself spamming in game commands just to hear all the things they can say.\n\nYou'll find yourself in various locations.  The game does support custom maps, but the maps Tripwire have made themselves are amazing as well.  You'll find in labs, carnivals, and even the ruins Aperture Laboratory.  Some have gimmicks like elevators and what not that will allow you to escape from the mutants.\n\nSpeaking of mutants, there are tons of mutants.  You have the Clot, your standard peon.  Be aware of it's grab though, it'll root you in place.  The Gorefast is an upgraded version that can run, but also possesses a longer attack range.  The Stalker can turn invisible and the Crawler jumps around.  Both are easy to kill though.  There are your fat zombies, Bloats, who not only puke on you, but will also explode in a shower of puke when you shoot them too much in the torso.  You have Sirens, mutants in straight jackets that will scream, disabling your grenades and doing pure health damage.  Husks will prevent you from camping by shooting fireballs at you.  Now for the big ones, for which you will need big guns.  The Scrake has a chain saw, get him to half health and he'll charge you.  Same with the Fleshpound, but more frightening.  With two spiked gloves, he'll become enraged and chase you.  At the end of every game, you'll face a Patriarch, armed with a chain saw and rocket launcher to cover the distance.  Get to close and he'll smack you.  Do too much damage and he'll run, turn invisible and heal.  So how do you kill him?  Keep pounding him with all you got and don't give him time to rest.\n\nOf course, to help you kill all these things is a vast arsenal.  You have assault rifles, shotguns (pump, semi, and fully auto), handguns, smg's, snipers, explosives, and even make-shift weapons.  Supporting you are also perks.  Like to blow stuff up?  Equip the demolition perk.  Shotguns are your thing?  Equip the Support Specialist perk.  There's a perk for everyone.\n\nTL:DR - Horde style survival game, played best with friends (up to 6 people, more can be supported with mods).  May get repetitive, but if that's the case, maybe you should try a map other than West London.","timestamp_created":1385486233,"timestamp_updated":1385486233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596590936183929443","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7769334","author":{"steamid":"76561197997119494","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":25665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8620,"last_played":1644523504},"language":"russian","review":"МАСТ ХЭВ!!!","timestamp_created":1385484198,"timestamp_updated":1385484198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7767510","author":{"steamid":"76561198081898755","num_games_owned":276,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":8043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3274,"last_played":1610089724},"language":"english","review":"Its a nice multiplayer game, I have played it for more than 48 Hours in last 2 weeks of buying it for Linux.

Newcomers should start on Normal difficulty to learn the ropes and have fun. Playing on Suicidal and Hell On Earth requires a lot of experience, working as a team, and in-depth knowledge of game mechanics. For many people however - myself included - this is the real draw of the game. If you put in the time, playing on HoE with 5 other experienced players all working together is some of the most fun you can have online.

First off is the graphics ive seen better but its very nice, especially for 2009, and especially for the unreal engine. The guns are very intersting from assult rifles, to shotguns, to crossbows, to a gun that shoots flares. The enemies arec varied and interesting, ranging from the basic \"clot\" to sword armed \"gorefasts\" to the horror inducing \"fleshpounds\". The gameplay is solid, while basic, can be very deep. You'll find yourself welding doors to create choke-points, and using your classes to an advantage, you sharpsjhooters take care of the big guys while the flamethrowers and shotguns take out the smaller enemies. There is a perk system with each level improving damage and even getting discounts on perk based weapons. there are some drawbacks the game is a little too easy on the easier difficultys but thats changed with a simple increase of difficulty. The voice acting can be really annoying and eventually gets on your nerves.I kcould go on for a while but just know this, its messy, bloody, midless fun that you can play with 5 friends. i heartily recommed it. 9/10","timestamp_created":1385411028,"timestamp_updated":1385411757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7744479","author":{"steamid":"76561198040095874","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":122698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":47,"playtime_at_review":71342,"last_played":1660530993},"language":"german","review":"power spiel","timestamp_created":1385409748,"timestamp_updated":1385409748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519910037517547607","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7744185","author":{"steamid":"76561198017899240","num_games_owned":655,"num_reviews":202,"playtime_forever":2326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2144,"last_played":1500344514},"language":"english","review":"there's way too many mods for my taste, but it has a dedicated community.
