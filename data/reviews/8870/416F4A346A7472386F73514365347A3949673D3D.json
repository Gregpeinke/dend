It's got the Shymalan problem: its predecessor executed the late game twist so well, this one feels the need to jerk the narrative around like a bad rollercoaster to compete.\n\nThe first Bioshock was a game about destiny, and its climax is one of the more memorable moments in gaming period: \"A man chooses; a slave obeys.\" The second game explored further the codependence of Big Daddies and Little Sisters. It was a protect-the-girl fantasy, but not in a negative way; it was presented within the context of the compulsive bonding and was ultimately simultaneously touching and altogether unnatural.\n\nBut, while Infinite is a perfectly serviceable shooter, it fails because it does nothing to innovate. Its story is a mish-mash of story elements that these teams had previously written, and written better. Elizabeth is a sorry example of a protect-the-girl fantasy, at one point literally closing the player's hands around her throat and explaining she'd rather die than be imprisoned again. Clearly, someone thought it was brilliant to give you an in-game travelling companion who mostly wonders how you sleep at night with all that blood on your hands when you aren't actively killing people. Gee, thanks for that.\n\nInfinite's biggest contribution to the franchise, if you will, is that they've taken the lid off the series. There are many doors to cities like Rapture or Columbia, and they're all different and the same. But the game also highlights the weakness in that thought: you've already seen everything they have to offer in the first game. Sure, this time they've put the city in the clouds. But they didn't do anything new with it: this entire game can be item-for-item matched to its predecessors! Maybe 2K does more in the future. Will it be on Mars? Maybe, but apparently, it'll still be the same thing...\n\nI wish I could provide more granularity than simply thumbs up or thumbs down. I'd give Bioshock Infinite something like a C+. It's not BAD, but it's not something I'd recommend over any other game you've got on your wish list.","timestamp_created":1393097913,"timestamp_updated":1393097913,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9222495","author":{"steamid":"76561198031964162","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":488,"last_played":1630835848},"language":"russian","review":"!","timestamp_created":1393097587,"timestamp_updated":1393097587,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501039505004882813","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9221892","author":{"steamid":"76561198101526511","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1842,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1127,"last_played":1477635169},"language":"english","review":"Its pretty sweet","timestamp_created":1393094558,"timestamp_updated":1393094558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9221665","author":{"steamid":"76561197994947653","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":88,"playtime_forever":1698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1698,"last_played":1393090109},"language":"english","review":"Wonderfully designed environments, amazing visuals, great story, crap combat. \n\nMain gripes:\n - The vigors (plasmids) aren't very powerful, so I basically stopped using them.

Not much variety or fun.\n - Auto save was kind of rubbish, the indicator is tiny and vanishes almost immediately, so you often have no idea if your progress is saved or not.

The dlc offers a revisit to Rapture, which is okay from what I hear (don't quote me on that I haven't played it myself.)

Even for someone like me who sometimes disreguards graphics as a factor in games reviews it has to be talked about here. Artistic design is wonderful and every frame looks like a beautiful nostalgic pin up poster in glorious HD. \n\nAs for the gameplay expect much of the Bioshock of old, Gameplay is polished and refined with some nice new additions but not overhauled completely, this isnt a bad thing though as combat is satisfying and doesnt get too repetative with the addition of Elizabeths tear ability throwing different situations into the mix every time you face the enemy. One negative I have found however is the lack of depth in the vigours, There only seems to be about 8 different ones and the abilitys the grant in combat are all a little samey and a little weak. They seem like an uneccesarry addition but are clearly there as a staple of the franchise, that said it is sad they couldnt had done more to make them seem more worthwhile like in the first two games.\n\nThe story too is interesting and exciting, the switch to an airbourne world is a nice change of pace from the spooky underwater themes of the last two games but Infinite doesn't loose the gritty violence and sadistic attitude in its new home. Although at first glance Columbia looks like a friendly and awe inspiring place to live, you soon discover that there is a seedy underbelly to the place. Everyone has been brainwashed into worshiping a dispotic leader, racial segregation is rife and labour laws are lax at best. The revolution is neigh and you've stumbled in at the wrong time...\n\nOverall Bioshock is a fun, exciting and beautiful addition to the series with a setting that I find much more appealing than that of the previous two games.

Overall, definitely a buy especially with the Bioshock bundles, but it's still a good enough game on its own to buy.","timestamp_created":1392775638,"timestamp_updated":1392775638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9174387","author":{"steamid":"76561198058668384","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1810,"last_played":1524335774},"language":"english","review":"I felt the story was fine and in my opinion i really enjoyed it, i felt the combat was lacking on my first play through (normal mode) but when i beat it in the space of two days i was still on super hype so went and played it on 1999 mode. Playing it again on 1999 mode was great, the combat opened up and was more interesting i also had to apply more tactics to each fight because i was doing the scavanger hunt achievement which was quite fun. So whilst i loved the game i can see why overs might not, or atleast the ones that aren't just jumpig on the band waggon.","timestamp_created":1392771934,"timestamp_updated":1392771934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506172835826873779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9174232","author":{"steamid":"76561198013641952","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":3222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":839,"last_played":1456006948},"language":"english","review":"Just incredible.

Что же в ней такого примечательного?\n\n1. Сюжет. В первую очередь именно сюжет дает нам главный интерес играть в эту часть Bioshock. Лихо закрученные сюжетные твисты и колоритные персонажи только бездушных оставят равнодушными.\n2. Антураж уровней. От красочной Колумбии до настоящего ада в облаках. Интерьер города поражает воображение и еще глубже погружает нас в события игры. Любителям стим-панка и футуризма эта часть явно придется по вкусу.\n3. Тактический шутер. Именно тактический, ибо если вы играете в Биошок на сложном уровне или в режиме \"1999 год\", то весь геймплей состоит из четко продуманной тактики и быстроты действий, что большой плюс.\nЕдинственный минус отмечу, так это кривоватый NPC, но не все так страшно.\n\nВредикт выношу такой: 9,5/10\nРекомендую. BioShock Infinite оставляет только хорошие впечатления :)","timestamp_created":1392742945,"timestamp_updated":1392742945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529083311557769775","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jtr8osQCe4z9Ig=="}
