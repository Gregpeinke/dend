Стрелять приятно, увлекательные экшн моменты, очень недурный левел дизайн по большому счёту. Если бы сейчас ботам подтянули и без того неплохой иишник, то к геймплею вообще не было бы никаких нареканий. \nЧто мне очень не понравилось с точки зрения геймплея - мир ксен. Ублюдский левелдизайн, мерзкий платформинг, миллион врагов на квадратный сантиметр. В игре также есть раздражающий приём разрабов, который они абузят на протяжении всего повествования - спавн противника у вас за спиной. Не знаю кто их обучил такому непревзойдённому приёму в геймдизайне, но руки этому человеку хотелось оторвать безумно. Ласт босс в игре потешный и по большому счёту беспомощный, что жаль. \nЕсли вы никогда не играли в ХЛ, то я настоятельно рекомендую. Этот тот старый тип игр, который не больно играть спустя кучу лет с моменты выхода.","timestamp_created":1612684541,"timestamp_updated":1612684541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552681446075439453","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86121493","author":{"steamid":"76561198320709447","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":790,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":622,"last_played":1613002037},"language":"english","review":"A Classic to have and a great time to play.

This review will be changed to recommended but I'm keeping my original review down below because it just shows how much this game sucks for new players. Have a good day everybody)\nyou know, this is actually kind of strange for me to actually talk about this when it is a very popular game that is from the 90's but i just want to put something out for the new player.\nthis game is actually really annoying when it comes to just navigating around, i've seen people say \"the path is literally straight forward most of the time\" as i literally force myself to use noclip to see where i am supposed to go, finding it out isnt easy, at all, and the only reason why they say that is because its literally their 500th time playing the f-ing game, and while this game can also be considered a puzzle game because of the way how you have to solve some after venturing around the area, that still cannot help the fact that you can lose your way on non-puzzle areas to. time for other things i have to say about this, lets see. oh yeah, the combat is okay, finding ammo is for some reason actually hard for no f-ing reason even when there are like 500 boxes to break open, the story is meh at best, and it doesnt give me the idea to actually try half-life 2 when i can, might only get that game to latch onto gmod. which actually makes me think, i should've just gotten the source version of this just to latch onto gmod, no other reason because the game is painstakingly boring compared to all the other games i've played. one final note actually, i would like to say that, all of this, is coming from a halo fan, so the way how i play halo can or does affect my opinion on this game, but i never actually try to compare the two, so you can kinda take that out.","timestamp_created":1612673154,"timestamp_updated":1646505010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495652168989181519","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86113824","author":{"steamid":"76561198353363857","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":430,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1612837725},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1612669660,"timestamp_updated":1612669660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86113070","author":{"steamid":"76561198870461639","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":5125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":742,"last_played":1658574220},"language":"english","review":"Highly

Así comienza la travesía de Freeman por sobrevivir a esta invasión y también a descubrir lo que sucede en su alrededor.\n[*]La historia es interesante, cada vez se hace más compleja a medida que avanzas en los capítulos, la gran mayoría será relatada por los NPC o en ocasiones por diálogos entre estos. Recomiendo ser paciente y escuchar lo que dicen, puede ser necesario para saber qué hacer en algunos niveles crípticos.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]+Gameplay: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Es un shooter en primera persona, donde Freeman tendrá que encontrar salidas y nuevas entradas en mapas laberínticos, tendrá a tu disposición la mítica palanca de metal, una pistola, metralletas, una pistola de rayas, una linterna, etc., tendrás que enfrentarte a diferentes alienígenas, ¿soldados?, entre otros. \n[*]De forma similar a Doom, también hay un “auto apuntado”, pero aquí tendrás que ser mas preciso, a veces si será de ayuda con enemigos pequeños o algo alejados.\n[*]Los enemigos no son muchos, pero si son muy problemáticos, algunos lanzan rayos demasiado largos, otros con bolas de energía, otros con granadas, etc., son muy arteros, siempre hay que estar a las vivas y eliminarlos de la forma más eficaz posible.\n[*]Los mapas están separados por capítulos, pero siempre en una línea fija, en donde tendrás que hacer A o B cosas para continuar, pero en ocasiones son algo laberínticos, lo peor que te puede pasar es que no sepas lo que debes hacer para continuar, estarás vagando por un buen rato. Ocasionalmente podrás encontrar secretos, la mayoría con munición, vida o energía para tu traje (armadura). También te puedes topar con compañeros para tu aventura, lastima que son bien inútiles, casi siempre se mueren rapidísimo.\n\n[*]Ahora veamos algunos modos de juego:\n-Modo historia: aquí veremos todo lo relatado anteriormente, puedes guardar y cargar partida en casi cualquier momento, con algunos bugs, por eso siempre guardar cuando sea seguro.\n-Modo en línea: puedes crear y buscar servidores para jugar un modo de batalla, actualmente (febrero de 2021) sigue activo y puede ser divertido con amigos.\n\n[*]Ahora veamos algunos problemas:\n-Imprecisión: oh no, es algo que evite hablar hasta ahora, pero Freeman todo el tiempo se la pasará corriendo, esto me provoco algo mareo, esto será pasable cuando ya te hayas acostumbrado, pero luego tendrás que realizar saltos o saltos estando agachado y aquí la cosa empeora, no es preciso, estuve casi media hora buscando una salida, hasta que encontré un conducto de ventilación, pero no podía entrar en él, así que seguí buscando, media hora después se me ocurrió volver a intentarlo pero forzando al personaje (presionar adelante), y por fin pude ingresar…. Oh vamos!!!!, cuanta rabia me ocasiono esto. Y otras escenas similares (saltar en un charco eléctrico en pequeños espacios, subir y bajar las escaleras, etc.), recomiendo adaptarse y tolerar esto, me parece algo terrible que esto siga vigente después de casi 20 años de su lanzamiento \n-¿Qué haría Brian Boitano?: como ya mencioné, los mapas son laberinticos, algunos con puzles, otros con enemigos, esto no es un problema, hasta que no sabes que hacer y te quedas sin objetivos, sería de utilidad tener un indicador o un mini mapa, pero no, todo dependerá de cuanto explores, así que debes estar listo para perderte y quizá marearte en tu búsqueda de objetivos.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]+Gráficos: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]La versión que pude jugar es una mejorada del Half-Life original, esta muy aceptable, en ocasiones si se puede ver terrible.\n[*]Los modelos de los personajes y enemigos están decentes, hablan muy raro, además que con la palanca de metal puedes ocasionar muchos desastres y masacres, todo un espectáculo.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]+Música y sonido: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Ambiental, casi siempre desaparece, no se si es un error o simplemente no hay, pero los efectos de sonido están muy bien trabajados, además de ser reconocibles, no puede decir lo mismo de las voces, ya que se escuchan comprimidas.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]+Accesibilidad: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]El juego viene en español, además de otros idiomas.\n[*]Puedes jugarlo con mouse y teclado, puedes invertir el mouse para los que lo prefieran así, además con la opción de Play Together. Puedes bloquear ciertos contenidos para protección a menores.\n[*]Existe la opción para comandos en las partidas, así puedes experimentar con el juego de muchas formas: munición infinita, atravesar paredes, sin daño, etc.\n[*]El juego tiene guardado automático, esto puede traer algunos problemas involuntarios, como guardar dentro de un bug o en cuando estas a punto de morir, recomiendo siempre administrar varias partidas, así evitar este problema.\n[/list]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[h1]+En síntesis: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]No tuve la mejor experiencia con este juego, pero si puedo entender el porque tiene una gran fanaticada, tiene una historia interesante y un gameplay divertido, también fue una revolución en su época, elevando aún más el estatus de los shooters. Si algo te interesó de mi reseña, pruébalo, forma parte de la historia de los videojuegos y la historia de una gran compañía,
