Мир поразил вирус, превращающий людей в зомби. Не в тех зомби, что жрут плоть, а в агрессивных тварей, которые жаждут забить всех до смерти. Но есть и иммунные - ими и предстоит сыграть. Ветеран вьетнамской войны, офисный работник, байкер и образованная девушка из богатой семьи. Выбор персонажа зависит от твоего вкуса, здесь нет рпг-составляющей, а значит и нет каких-то главных атрибутов или способностей героев. Разве что, половая принадлежность, возраст и цвет кожи. А это жаль, было бы интереснее. И вот, ты в точке старта. Выбирай оружие, поднимай аптечку и в путь, до убежища. По дороге убивай как можно больше зараженных и старайся не попасть в своих товарищей - простые основы выживания. Не пропускай мимо таблетки, аптечки, патроны и гранаты. Если повезет, сможешь найти оружие мощнее. Так, ты добрался до убежища целым и невредимым - превосходно! Но это не конец, каждая кампания состоит из нескольких карт, которые нужно преодолеть. Кажется, скучно? Было бы так, но помимо обычных зараженных есть и особо зараженные: зомби, которые мутировали и получили определенные способности. Другое дело! Получилась этакая смесь фильмов \"28 дней спустя\" и \"Обитель зла\". Интересно, не так ли? Также в игре присутствуют различные панические события. Например, случайная активация сигнализации автомобиля и на этот шум сбегаются огромные волны зомби. В эти моменты прикрывай спины других, лечи раненных, поднимай вышедших из строя товарищей. Что же, звучит уже намного круче. Как только пройдешь все кампании, не спеши списывать игру со счетов - обязательно опробуй игру по сети с друзьями. Это весело! Команда выживших пытается пробиться к убежищу, в то время как команда особо зараженных напротив - всячески мешают им это сделать, используя свои способности, тактику и ландшафт местности. Нравится \"косить\" толпы зомби? Обязательно поиграй в режим \"выживание\"! Цель проста - продержаться как можно дольше, отбивая растущий натиск зараженных. Наиграл 30 часов и надоела игра? Выполняй достижения! При этом игровой процесс приобретает новый смысл. Заметь - не было ни слова о графике. Игровой процесс настолько увлекателен, что даже не обращаешь внимания на окружение. А графика хорошая и стоит отметить музыкальное сопровождение происходящих событий. Так что скорее хватай ружье и сноси зараженным головы!\n\n[i]\"Аж на части разорвало!\" - Френсис.[/i]","timestamp_created":1401441920,"timestamp_updated":1401441920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10282386","author":{"steamid":"76561198034950216","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":45,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45,"last_played":1394859895},"language":"english","review":"Not my kind of game...I like open sandbox games with exploration options.

Wenn man ab und zu sich einmal etwas Zeit zwischen dem Zombiegemetzel lässt, kann man sogar etwas über ihre Vorgeschichte erfahren. Diese ist allerdings Nebensache, denn man befasst sich haupsächliche (eigentlich nur) damit sich durch eine Horde von Zombies zu kämpfen.\nDamit es nicht ganz so langeweilig ist wie es klingt gibt es auch noch die \"Special Infected\" mit jeweils anderen Fähigkeiten um dich daran zu hindern zu überleben. Zum Beispiel der Hunter, der auf dich springt und dir so lange er auf dir sitzt Schaden zufügt. Alleine kann man sich von so einer Kreatur nicht mehr befreien, ein Überlebender muss dir helfen.\nWeil man dank der nicht gerade schlausten KI recht hilflos gegen solche Angreifer ist, gibt es den Coopmodus. Dieser bildet eigentlich das ganze Spiel und ohne ihn wäre es wirklich sinnlos. Left 4 Dead mit Freunden zu spielen ist ein absolutes Muss. Es gibt nichts was einem mehr Freude bereitet als sich mit drei Kollegen auf dem höchsten Schwirigkeitsgrad durch die Level zu schlagen. Und gerade bei dem höchsten Schwirigkeitsgrad verlangt Left 4 Dead vollkommenes Teamspielen. \nDie Kartengestaltung ist ganz in Ordnung, vielleicht etwas zu düster, aber es ist ja ein Zombie Spiel. Im Laufe dessen kommt man in eine Innenstadt, auf eine Farm und Kleinstädte. \nAlle Level sind vom Anfang an frei zu wählen und zu spielen.\nLeft 4 Dead hat sich mit recht den fünften Platz auf meiner Lieblingsspieleliste erkämpft.\nErwarte innigst einen dritten Teil.\nNikTheZocker","timestamp_created":1398179208,"timestamp_updated":1398260988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577727317810058594","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9886349","author":{"steamid":"76561198108235797","num_games_owned":3665,"num_reviews":493,"playtime_forever":18645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12964,"last_played":1631859442},"language":"english","review":"I hate subways.\nI hate sewers.\nI hate hospitals.

Yes.\nLeft 4 Dead original maps are better than the remakes in Left 4 Dead 2 and also better than the Left 4 Dead 2 maps (even though I love them and that it would be great to have them In Left 4 Dead).\nIn a few words, the maps in Left 4 Dead are darker and different, for example, the No Mercy rooftop level has some kind of \"cabin\" if you could say it that way while there's no such thing In Left 4 Dead, they all have some small modifications that are not that good, it's no big deal though.\nThe mapers being too flashy, that's one big deal for me though, Hard Rain in Left 4 Dead 2 should  be way much darker than that and so the Left 4 Dead original maps, pretty much all of them, it's not just a question of \"sun or clouds\" but also lightings such as those inside, a place that has no or almost no light should be dark, Left 4 Dead does it better than Left 4 Dead 2.\nMelee weapons, well, to me that's just a question of \"Do I feel like playing with melee weapons or not right now, considering it makes the game somewhat easier\" so in this case, it is well worth owning the two games.\nThe weapons, honestly, I prefer the guns in Left 4 Dead than In Left 4 Dead 2, I don't like the guns at all in Left 4 Dead 2, they looks and plays like toys plus I prefer the good old Colt M1911 than the SIG-Sauer P220 and the Glock 26.\nI do like the SIG-Sauer P220 and even the Glock 26 (not the Glock I like the most though) but they're just bad in that game, for some reasons, Valve never been good at making Glock pistols.\nSo that's one more point for Left 4 Dead.\nThe infected, Left 4 Dead 2 has a better variety plus the new uncommon such as the RIOT one.\nThe gore is also better in Left 4 Dead 2 since there's no really gore in Left 4 Dead.\nHeadshots are better in Left 4 Dead than in Left 4 Dead 2, you can kill a zombie one hit if you do an headshot with a pistol while in Left 4 Dead 2, that is not possible and I am of course talking about Expert difficulty.\nNew special infected, well, that's pretty much the same thing as melee weapons, I ask myself \"Do I want to play with a few more kind of special infected right now?\" so once again, that's just a question of personal taste or of what you want to play at the moment.\nBoth has custom maps and mods, you can create your own stuff if you want but Left 4 Dead 2 has a workshop which is a great thing while Left 4 Dead doesn't, both have pretty great co-op maps that are big and very fun to do with friends, I remember the good old (not so old) times with my friends, I'd do it again, again and again.\nThe music is pretty much the same in both games, It has a good soundtrack and you can always replace the music with your own if you want.\nThe community is immature and that's on both games, nothing new though, just kids screaming over the mic and telling you that they fuc*** your mother last night and crap like that, douches, adults acting like 8 years old kids and you probably know the rest by now since most of the multiplayer games have shi**** communities.\n\nIn the end, I'd suggest you to buy this game If you don't already own it and if you are interested and even if the game is not on sale, It's actually pretty worth it.\nIt's pretty easy though, even for the newcomers, I remember back then, I was very good, I started playing at higher difficulties pretty quick, never played on easy, a little bit on normal, a lot on advanced then all the time on expert so you can enjoy even if you are not to good at first-person shooters, you should be a pro in no time, perhaps right from the start, except if you really are bad at video games/shooters.\nThe game is mere child's play on advanced, especially after that many years, I haven't played a lot lately so I am not the pro I once was but damn, I can say that the game is still super easy at advanced and expert even with bots even though that it can be harsh with bots at the ending/survival level on expert since they're pretty dumb, I won't go far into the subject but all you have to remember is that the bots are seriously dumb healing themselves at 70 hp when there are not enough first aid kits around, getting in your way when you are shooting zombies, stealing your kills, etc...\nI remember playing versus and that I was almost all the time \"top fragger\" (MVP), I had fun, I probably wouldn't be as good as I was before today though.\nSo If you are looking for a challenging zombie game, you should forget about it even though I'd still suggest you to play it because it is very fun.\n\n\n9.5/10 - you'll like it if you're looking for something not too challenging (sourcemod/metamod can help make it a little bit challenging), for action, no unlocks, no crap, you got everything right from the start.\n\n\nNote: I have played over 1500 hours on both Left 4 dead and Left 4 Dead 2 together but it was not on this account.\n\nImportant: Do not join modded servers, except if you like playing with morons, toxic players and like cheating and having it easy (more than 100 hp, more than 4 survivors, etc...)","timestamp_created":1398036802,"timestamp_updated":1516758877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482639461755752563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9885484","author":{"steamid":"76561198043133696","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":60817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59367,"last_played":1640350755},"language":"italian","review":"Il miglior titolo co-op nella storia dei videogiochi.","timestamp_created":1398029851,"timestamp_updated":1494467214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9885393","author":{"steamid":"76561198037697418","num_games_owned":1317,"num_reviews":139,"playtime_forever":1470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1468,"last_played":1449500675},"language":"russian","review":"Даже не смотря на выход сиквелла, который был улучшен во многих отношениях, L4D остается лидером и эталоном кооперативных игр про зомби. Во многом благодаря тому, что в геймплейной составляющей игры нет ничего лишнего, а все присутствующие элементы работают безотказно. Незамысловатый геймплей, хорошая графика, веселый кооператив и очень много мяса и крови - вот формула идеальной игры про зомби. И знаете, эта формула была полностью вооплощена в этой игре. Не знаю кто как считает, а на мой взгляд это шедевр и прорыв в жанре survival horror. Теперь L4D - идол для многих разработчиков кооперативных хорроров, которые стараются равняться именно на неё. Я же вам просто скажу, берите эту игру, вы не пожалеете.
