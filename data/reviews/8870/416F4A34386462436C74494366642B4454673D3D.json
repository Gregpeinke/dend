But Infinite being ported to Linux and it did kinda look cool I thought I would throw my money and support to the game.  Nevertheless I always have a hard time with console games, you see normally they suck, most of the time.\n\nSo you can imagine my surprise when I found the game to be exceptionally cool, the graphics are awesome and smooth on ultra,  the environments are gorgeous, sure its not the most realistic graphics I've seen but they are all the same very nicely done.  The story is a bit vague at first but very entertaining and interesting to say the least and one of this games greatest strengths.   \n\nThe story and incredible environment is enough to overcome most of the terrible console deficiencies that it does suffer from.   It does have one of the best menus I have seen for a console port, however the lack of a save game option that you can reload to certain parts to replay is a major bummer.  While you can go back to previous chapters it rewrites your one and only save game and you loose all your progress.\n\nGun play is a bit different at first but not a problem, mapped keys are off but can be altered so no real problem there.  The worst problem I have with console games is the everything is a handed to you ride the rails mash two buttons and you win game play.  Which unfortunately this game does suffers from, the only real skill involved is the gun fights but with no real consequences of death.  \n\nAll that said it is still very fun, its awesome story and action coupled with intense graphical environment and music, I forgot the sound track its really great too.  Even with its glaring console issues it still is a 4 out of 5 star game.  4 ½ because of the Linux port I would like to see what these developers could do if they made a true open world RPG style PC game, they have the environmental and story telling talent! \n\nWith great games like this running on Linux the days of Winblows infecting my computer are almost at a end, thank you!

If you're wondering about why its rated M, I'll tell about the worst of each of its \"content descriptors\"\n\nBlood and Gore: when shooting people there are blood splatters, and when getting a headshot with a shotgun their heads disappear and blood squirts out of their body. You can also do a \"melee execution\", which can include sawing into their neck, breaking their neck, cutting their head off, and more of that nature. When you consume a \"vigor\" you see prolonged images of your hands going through a transformation. You see your hands burning to the bone, crystals shooting out of them, and other gory displays.\n\nIntense Violence: You witness someone being stabbed in the back with a sharp pair of scissors. She falls and slowly dies. You also kill a man by repeatedly whacking his head against stone and forcfully drowning him.\n\nLanguage: Nothing too bad here. Your charactor says \"what the hell\", \"God d**n it\", \"s**t\", and \"son of a b**ch\". Elizabeth says \"oh my God\", and \"d**n\", but very infrequently.\n\nMild Sexual Themes: I actually haven't noticed much. Elizabeth's breasts are slightly exposed throughout the game, but not more than you see the streets these days. I've also been told theres a porn shop somewhere with mild suggestive images, but I haven't seen it.\n\nUse of Alchohol and Tobacco: You see a few people smoking on the streets of Columbia. You can also smoke a cigarette to regain health, but only at the beginning of the game. I think you can also consume liquor.\n\nThere is also racism, but you're never forced to take part in it.

A little easy due to the health, ammo, salt, and coins that Elizaneth picks up but not to the point where if you have no clue what you are doing you'll be just fine.

It took me a good couple of hours to sit down and mash it out and I'm glad that it kept me so invested.\n\nThe storyline and premise was amazing and the voice acting and sassy comments from Booker kept the experience fresh and enjoyable. Unfortunately, there were a few continuity issues, but that may be expected given the overall premise of the story. I was mildly shocked at how abruptly the end came about though.\n\nAt times the combat felt flavorless but the story progression helped keep me wanting to get past its issues.\n\nOverall, my main complaints was the upgrade system. It felt clunky and unfulfilled and once I had finished upgrading a few weapons, the game was already over, and I would never touch any of the other ones. Except out of desparation.\n\nI played burial at sea as well and they helped bring the story back into rapture.","timestamp_created":1452477059,"timestamp_updated":1452477059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20460237","author":{"steamid":"76561198161111285","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":287,"last_played":1452383125},"language":"english","review":"I love this game!

A story so deep and twisted, with a truly epic plot twist in the end that will leave you breathless.  \n\nThere's a reason why Bioshocl Infinite won numerous awards:  the graphics and fluid gameplay; the ability to upgrade weapons and attributes; the depth of the characters, their backstories and the voice acting...it's all so 'fleshed out' that you'll not only feel that you're a part of everything that's going on in Columbia but that you're also a part of each character's life, characters that you'll likely never forget until the end of your days.  The Burial At Seal episodes are a great touch as well and further the plot that unfolds in the main game, with the second and final part being so epic that it feels like a game unto itself.  \n\nAll of the Bioshock games are phenomenal achievements, not just as far as games go, but also as works of art; games that let you know the developers feel as strongly about their product as all of us gamers do. Bioshock Infinite though....is truly a masterwork that must be experienced.\n\nP.S. Try it on 1999 mode while not using vending machines.
