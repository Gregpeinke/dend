To může někomu připadat lehce odpudivé, protože někomu se nemusí líbit, že ho hra omezuje například tím, že si nemůže vybrat za jakou třídu chce hrát. Někomu také může vadit, že umírá během pár sekund, protože dostává do gatí od kulometných hnízd nebo sniperů. A nebo to, že si nemůže sprayovat se zbraněma, protože mají obrovský odpor. Dámy a pánové, vítejte v pravé simulaci 2. světové války! Hrůza války na západní frontě byla zde naprosto výborně vystižena. Hra také disponuje několika různými mapami a ani herních módů není málo. A když se do toho zaberete, na všechny omezení zapomenete.\nHra má ale jedno velký mínus. Ne na každých, ale na některých mapách se může stát, že si protivník vybuduje neporazitelnou obranu a vykašle se na útok. V tento moment je vskutku těžké se dostat za nepřátelské linie. (ale není to nemožné) Ovšem na většině mapách si najdete cestičku a dostanete nepřítele na kolena zezadu! Jediné, co bych tomu vytknul je vybavení \"průměrného\" vojáka. Většina map se poté zasypána granáty a vy se téměř nemůžete pohybovat bez toho, aby vám něco explodovalo pod nohama.","timestamp_created":1451228669,"timestamp_updated":1485442881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19984635","author":{"steamid":"76561198205663684","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":114,"playtime_forever":286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1566056250},"language":"thai","review":"เป็นเกมส์ที่สุนกมาก เล่นเพลิดดี  ผมให้ 7.5/10","timestamp_created":1451192958,"timestamp_updated":1451192958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19981531","author":{"steamid":"76561198037511814","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":230,"last_played":1518232441},"language":"english","review":"Basically ww2 csgo but with classes, unlimited lives, and no gun skins.","timestamp_created":1451180922,"timestamp_updated":1451180922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19980443","author":{"steamid":"76561198114954359","num_games_owned":347,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":172,"last_played":1497763289},"language":"german","review":"Ich muss sagen, diese Spiel macht zimlich viel Spaß mit anderen zu zocken :)","timestamp_created":1451178048,"timestamp_updated":1451178048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19976943","author":{"steamid":"76561198160561224","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":663,"last_played":1540324617},"language":"english","review":"I like it but it is source and i dont have the game on gmod.

Mas eu já joguei muito Day of Defeat Source quando ele foi lançado, jogava com meus amigos na Lan House e online também, mas brincava muito com eles entre nós mesmos e ainda lembro bem desse jogo.\n\nDay of Defeat é um Counter Strike Source de segunda guerra mundial, creio eu que os fãs de Counter Strike ainda o Source vão gostar, e quem não é fã vai gostar também.\n\nMapas baseados em lugares onde aconteceu os combates na vida real, mas claro, com o jeito Valve de ser, mapa limitado do mesmo jeito de CS. \n\nO bom do jogo é que nos servers tem limite de snipers, que são no máximo 2 pra cada time.\nA batalha é Estados Unidos vs Alemanha Nazista, não a monstruosa potência a Rússia (União Soviética) e nem a Grã Bretanha, só Estados Unidos e Alemanha mesmo, na minha opinião deveria a Valve ter feito atualizações colocando mais essas duas nações.\n\nO legal do jogo é o cara do Machinegunner, pra poder usar essa arma na ação tem que deitar ou se posicionar em uma mesa, saco de areia, capô de um veículo, enfim, algum obstáculo para ativar o bipé e meter chumbo na galera.\n\nComprei esse jogo ontem e baixei hoje, no momento, nesse horário da manhã, os server quase que totalmente vazios, há uns 3 servers brasileiros que estavam vazio, um chamado D.T.B Dominated Brasil estava com 2/32 jogando, acho que esse vazio também deve ser por dois motivos; o horário e também véspera de Natal e galera pra praia, acredito que deve ser isso.\n\nO jogo Team Fortress 2 tem grandes servidores brasileiros de muitos anos na ativa e de grande sucesso como ZM Brasil e CZS Brasil. Na minha modéstia opinião, acho que esses dois servers deveriam criar salas no Day of Defeat Source, para fazer com que ele viva, ou pelo menos tentar. DoD Source é um jogo em potencial, poucos mapas comparando com todos os títulos do CS e Team Fortress 2, mas esses dois servidores famosos também criam mapas, deveriam criar mapas de forma mais correta do que aquele jeito animado todo fora da realidade rsrsrs.\n\nSe tiver alguém da ZM e da CZS Brasil lendo minha análise tá aí a opinião, e procurar incentivar a galera de comprar esse jogo que mesmo no preço normal dele está barato R$19,99 comprei ontei na promoção por R$4,99.\n\nIncentivo a vocês a comprarem, quem é membro de outros servidores brasileiros além da ZM e CZS e que tems erver em jogos da Valve e outras emrpesas criem servidor nesse jogo pra da vida a DoD Source, esse jogo precisa reviver e estar no topo junto com CS e Team Fortress 2. E criem mapas bacanas e se possível os mapas baseado em lugares reais da segunda guerra.\n\nLembro-me de um server na época em que o jogo foi lançado, os caras botara o mapa De_Dust do CS Source no DoD Source, era mó massacre, seria elgal vocês da ZM e CZS e outros fazerem isso, mapas de CS Source no DoD Source, nota mil. Espero que estejam lendo e que, mais breve, façam isso.\n\nO jogo vale a pena comprar, mesmo não tendo tanta gente. Compre também pra pelo menos ver algums erver brasileiro criar suas salas nele. Vamos tentar reviver esse jogo gente, ele não pode \"morrer\" com o tempo, como disse, por no topo como TF2 e CS, ótimo jogo para se divertir. ^_^","timestamp_created":1450959065,"timestamp_updated":1450959065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19904342","author":{"steamid":"76561198079740667","num_games_owned":541,"num_reviews":219,"playtime_forever":144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":144,"last_played":1424225574},"language":"english","review":"Very very very fun","timestamp_created":1450956744,"timestamp_updated":1450956744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19902399","author":{"steamid":"76561198253922774","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1487669224},"language":"english","review":"swearing simulator 2016","timestamp_created":1450951375,"timestamp_updated":1450951375,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19902130","author":{"steamid":"76561198025965617","num_games_owned":343,"num_reviews":114,"playtime_forever":4543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4440,"last_played":1490185470},"language":"french","review":"C'est un bon jeu qu'il ne faut pas aborder comme un fps standard. \n\n1° Il faut le jouer parce que vous avez envie de jouer dans une atmosphère de guerre mondiale. \n2° Il faut se la jouer un peu plus survie, pupute, campouse et avancer prudemment car tout ou presque vous one shot.\nC'est un gameplay plus \"lent\" que d'ordinaire.

Its a way different approach than say, Counter Strike. (You can't compare them and that's not what i'm going to do)\n\nYou have 1 gamemode, it involves around capturing flags. There are two teams, the Americans are Germans. Both teams are treated equally (which is awesome, its not like the americans are the good guys and the nazis stupid germans that scream like a girl) and have six classes each with their own sets of weapons. Each class has a ranged attack, melee and explosives (grenades). Most of the classes get a backup pistol with them.\nThe classes are: (German equipment first, the American and then what they share)\n- Rifleman (Mauser Kar89k, M1 Garand and rifle grenades) Has the ability to use ironsights and focuses on long-range combat.\n- Assault (MP40 and M1A1 Thompson, a smoke grenade and a frag grenade) For CQB.\n- Support (STG-44/MP-44 and B.A.R, 2 frag grenades) For mid and close range and surpressive fire.\n- Sniper (Kar98K Scoped and the M1903 Springfield Scoped). No grenades. For long range and to take out classes like other snipers and machinegunners.\n- Machinegunner (MG-42 and Browning M1919A4 (I think)) No grenades. Anti sniper, anti machinegunner and to take out large groups of enemies. Must be deployed using the bipod to shoot accurately. (hipfire not advised lol)\n- Rocket (not the rocket itself, the class) Uses a Panzershreck and M1 Bazooka. As a secondary you get the Mauser C96 or M1 Carbine (my fav). Anti Sniper and machinegunner.\n\nThe classes all have the same health and speed. You die fast (in 1-3 shots, always 1 shot headshot) and rushing is not advised. The game is extremely faced paced and competitive. You need to work together as a team, use your microphone or voice commands to communicate. The voice commands are awesome and well voiced. \nBesides that you have the option to go prone (using Z as default I think) This greatly reduced recoil and makes you harder to hit. The disadvantage of it is that when to go prone or out of prone you holster your weapon for 1-2 seconds. I've died many times of this. You get used to it after a while, though. Another option is to sprint. There is a stamina bar that lets you sprint for a few seconds. You cannot shoot while sprinting. In the realism modes, when you get shot in your arm, you drop your primary weapon. A pretty neat feature, but annoying at the same time.\n\nThe gunplay itself it pretty well done, it has the same feature as Counter Strike when you are standing still, you accuracy with the most guns is near perfect and when you are moving your accuracy decreases. Almost all the guns have massive recoil, and I mean massive, it takes a lot of skill to master.\n\nThe base game comes with a lot of maps and many custom maps too which I don't care about. The stock maps are good and have cool shortcuts and offer a lot of replay value.\n\nThere is no singleplayer unless you download a bot mod, which I haven't tried. There are plenty of multiplayer servers to choose from.\n\nThe servers mostly consist of 32 player slots, which means 16 vs 16 players.\n\nFor active servers DON'T use the serverbrowser, its broken, use Gametracker to locate servers instead. The EdgeGamers servers are pretty good, their clan is EgO (I think). These servers have all the realism settings turned off and have a medic mod that lets you call a medic by typing !medic in the chat. I advise binding this to a key. The medic only heals when your health is below 25 HP (that is when the healthbar turns red). Ping isn't a problem really, but above 150 ping the game becomes unplayable (no shit sherlock)\nThere are a lot of realism servers too, but its your choice on what to play.\n\nCommunity is awesome and mostly mature players. There are daily around 900-1100 players online across all regions.\n\nThe game runs almost on every system, I have no problems with it really, and I have a low end PC.\n\nWhat I hate about Day of Defeat is the constant explosive spam. Grenades deal massive damage and get spammed mostly in doorways and passages. You have the option to throw the grenades back, but this is hard to do.

Разработчик - всеми известная VALVE, которая выпустила эту игру в 2005 г. на движке Sourse. По своей сути DoD - это та же CS, только на тематику Второй Мировой Войны. На выбор нам дается две стороны: вермахт и союзники. Каждая сторона разделена на 6 классов, каждый из которых имеет свою экипировку, достоинства и недостатки. Задачи перед вами будут стоять разные, в зависимости от карты. Это либо типичный захват точек, либо уничтожение/защита объектов. Так чем меня зацепила на столько простая игра? Так простотой и зацепила! Любителям Battlefield 3 и отличного графона тут не место! DoD - это просто хороший тактичный шутер, простой в освоении, а главное - с адекватными игроками! Наиграл я в неё 70 часов и не припомню, чтобы за это время встречал в игре неадекватов и вопящих школьников.
