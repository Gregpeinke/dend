I was feeling this during each of the ten playthroughs of this magnum opus of Valve. The best game I have ever played.\n\nIts fear of the unknown atmosphere and fascinating story reach stellar quality levels. This game collects all the great things that matter in video games and expands them to extremely high levels of polishment, epicness, and pure awesomeness. The result is perfect gameplay, perfect graphics, perfect audio, everything quite perfect, abundant in extreme quality, which you will never forget — one of the most outstanding achievements of the video game industry.\n\nI don't know what to add. Even when I replayed this game for the tenth or so time, I had a wonderful time. Thanks to its perfectly utilized physics engine, the game has a believable world overflowing with interactivity. The Gravity Gun is one of the best weapons/tools of all time. Every second modern game has some player physics interaction and maybe even some sort of telekinesis ability. Still, I have yet to witness such seamless implementation like the Gravity Gun of Half-Life 2. This game also possesses a unique, exotic, and other-worldly soundtrack of the highest appeal that I always like to listen to from time to time. Plus, I will never forget the voice of the Overwatch and all the other amazing iconic sounds of this masterpiece.\n\n[b][u] 10/10 [/u][/b]\n\n+ everything (story, characters, music, physics, graphics), love for a lifetime\n- some of the levels might subjectively seem repetitive and long\n\n[hr][/hr]\nAnd now, the unofficial anthem (IMHO) of Half-Life 2: [url=https://youtu.be/iy61r3Qkm6o] Triage at Dawn |Remix| Path of Borealis [/url]\n\nI've unlocked all achievements! 11 of 11 (100%): [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/globster/stats/HL2] Achievements list [/url]\n\nKomentář v češtině: [url=http://dbher.cz/k17791] Databáze her [/url]","timestamp_created":1293702384,"timestamp_updated":1637829597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.750357270240783691","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4197709","author":{"steamid":"76561198033686504","num_games_owned":452,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":67,"last_played":1602343582},"language":"english","review":"If you have Steam but you don't own this game, you're doing it wrong.","timestamp_created":1293694581,"timestamp_updated":1293694581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533034384250640869","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1142196","author":{"steamid":"76561197987691103","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":3552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2904,"last_played":1529256106},"language":"english","review":"\"Maximum PC awarded Half-Life 2 an unprecedented 11 on their rating scale which normally peaks at 10, and named it the \"best game ever made\".\"\n\nimdbScore 9.0/10","timestamp_created":1293669181,"timestamp_updated":1392743954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4008135","author":{"steamid":"76561198030622516","num_games_owned":769,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1178,"last_played":1387022262},"language":"english","review":"Great.

The engine is still being used today with all sorts of new games. In the end all you need to know is that the price for this game is TOTALLY WORTH IT. I have personally played through this game 4 times. Why? Because its not about the graphics or the engine or the completely bug-free game... its about experiencing the story and plotline for me and there are few games that touch Half-Life 2's level of 'epic'.","timestamp_created":1293016613,"timestamp_updated":1293016613,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2046944","author":{"steamid":"76561198001443856","num_games_owned":249,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":2005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":860,"last_played":1499072510},"language":"english","review":"Meh.
