一部略显失望的小品 [/h1]\n发行于2001年的《蓝色行动》是《半条命》的第二部DLC，本作原计划是DC版半条命的独占内容，然而还没等游戏发售DC就凉了，于是Gearbox就把它单独移植到了PC上。所以本作在之前也仅仅是给DC玩家们的一个小福利，也许这就是为什么本作的内容相比于之前的《针锋相对》就少了很多，整个流程甚至连两小时都不到。\n在《蓝色行动》中，我们将扮演一个普通的黑山保安巴尼·卡尔霍恩，就是《半条命2》中那个欠一杯啤酒的巴尼。但在本作中也没有给出太多关于这个角色的信息，甚至在开场都没有明确给出他的名字，只有一个B.卡尔霍恩，甚至年龄、军衔和学历都没有，我们唯一知道的就是他和戈登一样经常迟到。\n不过本作的开场展示了更多有趣的细节，比如你能看到有工作人员在食堂吃早餐，能从监控中看到吉娜正在帮戈登准备实验品，还有一些科学家对你的态度也远远没有对戈登那样和善。《蓝色行动》用一个更简短的开场展示了一个更加生动的黑山基地，这也是它为数不多的优点。而巴尼在黑山事件中扮演的也只是一个小角色，所以本作的剧情也并不重要：实验失败后，你从一个科学家口中得知一个叫罗森博格的博士研制了一种传送门可用于逃离黑山。于是你找到了罗森博格，然后帮他完成一系列任务并开启传送门。受限于剧情长度，《蓝色行动》并没有为玩家带来什么新内容，在《针锋相对》中出现了不少新的武器和敌人，并加入了新的游戏机制（如爬绳和AI队友），但在《蓝色行动》中却什么都没有，而且登场的武器也比《半条命1》还少了几种。本作最大的改变就是你无法使用HEV充电器给你的护甲充电，甚至在训练关中就已经告诉你那些充电器是给穿HEV的人上人用的，而巴尼的护甲破了就只能在地上拾取其他的保安护甲。\n除此之外，《蓝色行动》的游戏操作和原版相差无几，虽然也出现了很多新的场景，比如下水道、调车场、地下实验室等，但是与《针锋相对》相比这些新场景并不是很多而且也不是很吸引人。在《半条命1》和《针锋相对》的流程最后都有一场BOSS战，而《蓝色行动》的最后只会冲进来几个HECU，你甚至可以无视他们直接跳进传送门。也许这就是为什么很多玩家对它感到失望的原因，就是流程太短、内容太少。不过《蓝色行动》的另一个问题就是讲述剧情的方式，在《半条命1》和《针锋相对》中，从你捡到第一把武器起你就会一直与游戏世界互动，游戏通常不会用过场动画和对话来打断整体的节奏感和代入感，即使有也占很小一部分。而《蓝色行动》恰恰相反，它叙述剧情的唯一方式就是纯粹让NPC用话说出来，你做每一个任务前罗森博格都会唠叨很长一段话来告诉你该做什么，而你也必须老老实实听他讲完，否则游戏不会继续进行。本来《蓝色行动》的流程就很短，而你又经常不得不停下来听NPC唠叨就让游戏内容显得更加乏味。\n总之《蓝色行动》并不是一款垃圾游戏，它依然保留了《半条命》的内核，且制作也和前作一样精良。要是它能在《针锋相对》之前发行，玩家们肯定不会有任何抱怨。但也许是吸取了《针锋相对》的教训，制作组并没有加入太多拓展内容，而仅仅讲述了一个四名工作人员如何逃生的小故事。所以如果你是《半条命》系列的粉丝的话，那么这部DLC也确实值得一玩，但还是不要指望它和前作一样精彩。","timestamp_created":1635516781,"timestamp_updated":1635516781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551805615425109863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101804744","author":{"steamid":"76561199033992784","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1635502380},"language":"english","review":"As
