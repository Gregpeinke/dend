Ora, all'autore Ken Levine io riconosco notevole fantasia e inventiva nel dare vita nei suoi giochi a distopie piuttosto interessanti, ma se guardo retrospettivamente alla serie Bioshock trovo confermato in Infinite l'incapacità di dare spessore, seguito e in ultima analisi di sfruttare a fondo queste idee: in fondo, le vicende di Rapture e Columbia potrebbero tranquillamente svolgersi in qualunque altra città che invece di trovarsi in fondo all'oceano o sospesa tra le nuvole se ne stia nel bel mezzo del deserto protetta dal resto del mondo,che so, da un campo di forza. Ma il fatto che siano società profondamente autocratiche che sostituiscono l'individualità con la fede cieca in un capo/profeta non è adeguatamente indagato dal punto di vista storico (come si è arrivati fin lì?) e sostanzialmente dato per scontato.\n\nTuttavia il problema più grande del gioco è a mio parere la difficoltà nel suscitare interesse nella storia e nei personaggi: perché dovremmo appassionarci alle vicende di Booker DeWitt, impegnato in una missione di cui non sappiamo nulla e il poco che ci viene rivelato è spesso accompagnato da sequenze oniriche a cui non si sa se prestare fede: sono il parto dell'immaginazione di Booker? È  alla fine tutto un sogno? Oppure no? Quali sono le sue motivazioni? Perché ha accettato l'incarico? Qual è il debito che deve saldare? \nElizabeth è molto carina ma anche il suo personaggio è pieno di contraddizioni, a cominciare dal fatto che nonostante sia cresciuta in isolamento, non appena entra in contatto con suoi simili dimostra empatia e capacità di relazione superiori alla norma (come giustamente [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdNhwb7iuI4] notato anche qui [/url]\n[spoiler]\nRiguardo il finale che reinterpreta la Teoria del Multiverso in maniera assai grossolana, non posso dire di averci capito molto: il guaio nell'usare una teoria del genere in qualunque narrativa è che con essa si può spiegare qualunque cosa e l'utilizzo in trame già di per sé deboli è un colpo praticamente fatale.\n[/spoiler]\nSul gameplay non mi pronuncio: \"alla fine\", con tutta la buona volontà degli autori di inserire nel gioco elementi filosofici e sociologici promettenti, rimane un onesto sparatutto, nemmeno troppo difficile, a tratti visivamente spettacolare (le skyline, i dirigibili, New York in fiamme) ma, appunto, uno sparatutto.\n\nA mio parere Ken Levine dovrebbe in futuro concentrare la sua attenzione su pochi temi, svilupparli in profondità e lavorare assai di più sulla caratterizzazione dei personaggi e sulla trama.\n\nRitengo definitiva sul tema [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdNhwb7iuI4] la già citata recensione di Matthewmathosis [/url] che condivido al 100%\n","timestamp_created":1459173418,"timestamp_updated":1459173418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525642812252044678","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22102358","author":{"steamid":"76561198064150300","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":3153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2848,"last_played":1535434832},"language":"russian","review":"1999 год пройден))","timestamp_created":1459162922,"timestamp_updated":1459162922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479971975088119507","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22101554","author":{"steamid":"76561198130097959","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":2313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2167,"last_played":1485046910},"language":"english","review":"This game is beautiful, not the best one, but one of the best","timestamp_created":1459159228,"timestamp_updated":1499642089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5049019455909729","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22101238","author":{"steamid":"76561198072623953","num_games_owned":524,"num_reviews":169,"playtime_forever":1446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":938,"last_played":1521274362},"language":"russian","review":"Отличный шутер и красивая архитектура.

Em batalhas, a mesma coisa, precisamos da Elizabeth não apenas como uma companheira de guerra mas também como uma amiga para todas as horas. Se sua personagem fosse silenciosa em momentos não roteirizados, não sei como me sentiria. Mas sei que apenas o fato de tê-la nos acompanhando por mais da metade do jogo já dá a ele uma nota alta, sem nem mesmo contar os gráficos e a própria história.\n\nNão recebi um spoiler sobre os irmãos Lutece, mas duvido que se tivesse recebido não os teria amado tanto quanto os amei. São um personagens incríveis que dão um pouco de cor ao mundo colorido mas coberto de sangue da cidade flutuante.\n\nTive sorte por comprar o jogo num pacote, pois assim que terminei Infinite pude jogar os outros dois (com alguma ajuda do Wine mas valeu a pena mesmo assim). Para jogar este não é preciso ter conhecimento da história dos outros dois, e também não faz diferença se escolher jogar na ordem correta, mas eu altamente recomendaria, apenas pelo momento \"ei!\" que você pode brevemente ter lá pelo fim da história.\n\nDe resto, apenas que he DOESN'T row.","timestamp_created":1459124095,"timestamp_updated":1459124095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22095507","author":{"steamid":"76561198104015020","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":924,"last_played":1540822628},"language":"french","review":"Bioshock infinite : \nLes + : \n- L'histoire est captivante, on incarne Booker DeWitt qui doit retrouver une fille, je ne vous raconte pas la suite à vous de le découvrir \n- Les graphismes sont biens faits \n- La difficulté est potable\n\nLes - : \n- Une explication un peu plus claire de l'histoire aurait pu être bien \n\n\nConclusion : Un bon jeu, bonne histoire avec tout de même à certains moments une incompréhension de l'histoire est possible.","timestamp_created":1459123341,"timestamp_updated":1499030661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22093100","author":{"steamid":"76561198186333361","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":924,"last_played":1466986085},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom jogo, o ponto forte é a ambientação e músicas, simplismente incriveis.

The one you get on the start, which lets you posses people and turrets, shows how useless it is when you find out you can't disable the turret you're possesing and have to wait for it to get back to its senses and start shooting at you before you can do something about it. Enemy variety is also lackluster, I think there's less than 15 enemy types in the whole game and most can be killed using the same strategy. The guns are toylike, it takes an insane ammount of bullets to kill even the weakest enemies, who are not even threatening. Upgrading guns is always a risk as the game practically scripts what guns are going to be avaliable to you without you knowing (can only carry 2), so you can get fucked by upgrading a gun you like (I was only fond of the carbine) then to be unable to use it. Halfway across the game you get introduced to new guns, but they're just reskins of previous guns, which still need to be upgraded to be useful.  Elizabeth is a joke, she's only there to open up doors, which you could just have done by yourself, like in every other game ever. She also does some context-sensitive actions, but they're just \"make Elizabeth raise a wall\" instead of just having the wall there in the first place. I can count in one hand how many times I used the railways (not for story progression), when they were supposed to be a major mechanic. I think this game is badly designed. The whole game feels like monotonically shooting your way from cutscene to cutscene, except a stealth part near the end, which is by far the best part of the game.\n\n> Story: First and foremost, you have to go in understanding that all the characters are idiots. In the first 5 minutes of the game Booker finds out he's carrying the mark of \"the antichrist\" on his hand in a town full of fanatics and he makes no effort to hide it. This is a man with a bandanna tied to his neck he could have used. All the characters have those moments of stupidity, but the game plays them all with a straight face. It makes it all feel really kitschy. The story is how Disney would portray a story of oppresion and the multiverse to five year olds. In fact, Disney movies are better stories, this is actually a cheap Disney knockoff trying to be a Cristopher Nolan movie. Just like Inception, just because it's complicated it doesn't mean it's good. They try too hard to have subtext by adding too many plots at once (Wounded Knee, The Baptism, Columbia, Racism and Vox Populi, Elizabeth and the Tears, Quantum Physics) that it's just an undeveloped mess. This is what baffles me the most, how do so many people find this to be a good story? It claims to be many things but ends up being nothing. Even games with simple good versus evil stories like Zelda can have a proper subtext, but there's nothing that can be rescued from Bioshock Infinite's story. It's just telling the story for the sake of telling it. There's choices to make but none really matter. If they were using the multiverse for their story they could have Rick and Morty'd their way through multiple scenarios and made really cool levels (like going to the alien world in Half Life times a hundred) but instead the use of such a plot device is very limited. Without spoiling it, the ending is as bad as them saying \"btw it was all a dream\". Also, am I supposed to believe Booker is carrying a turntable everywhere to listen to people's ramblings on vinyl? Or that they would allow a slave to make such vinyl recordings about top secret experiments and just let him toss them around the lab? Every corner store sells magic potions that give superhuman abilities but nobody really uses them? There's a lot of these stupid decisions across the game.\n\n> Aesthetics: The game has an Art Deco mixed with cartoon look, which I believe would have worked better with a more lighthearted story, but it does its job well enough. There are some audio issues. The number of times audio clips play over each other is ridiculous. The guns don't sound with the aggresiveness of a gun, instead they sound like muffled farts.\n\nBuy this if you find it for less than $5.","timestamp_created":1459022945,"timestamp_updated":1459022945,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497051388025283813","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22066555","author":{"steamid":"76561198052416766","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":955,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":955,"last_played":1434801481},"language":"english","review":"Yes","timestamp_created":1459009095,"timestamp_updated":1459009095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.440607786178588867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22066362","author":{"steamid":"76561197966571697","num_games_owned":712,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":2197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2126,"last_played":1413676238},"language":"english","review":"Stupidest f*cking shooter.","timestamp_created":1459008446,"timestamp_updated":1459008446,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.465375900268554688","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22065520","author":{"steamid":"76561198194213422","num_games_owned":637,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":1311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":748,"last_played":1615164861},"language":"schinese","review":"画面简直美炸了，操作感也很强，突突突过瘾，但并没有掩盖剧情的精彩，可以为止剁手哟","timestamp_created":1459005885,"timestamp_updated":1459005885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22064992","author":{"steamid":"76561198122208529","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1695,"last_played":1512491048},"language":"english","review":"the Greatest game I played","timestamp_created":1459004425,"timestamp_updated":1459004425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22063287","author":{"steamid":"76561198042246687","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":8773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":685,"playtime_at_review":2109,"last_played":1660513803},"language":"english","review":"I bought this game while it was on a sale one day and i was thinking.
