Oyuncuların mutlaka oynaması ya da en azından bilmesi gereken bir oyun. Valve'ın en iyi oyunu. Gerçi sadece Valve'ın da değil çıktığı dönemde en iyi oyundu Half-Life. Hikayesi güzel görüntü kalitesi güzel hele hele multiplayer kısmı internet kafelerin vazgeçilmeziydi. Kendi çocukluğumdan hatırlıyorum da bizim internet kafede yer olmazdı sırf herkes oynayabilsin diye herkes en fazla 1 saat aralıksız oturabilirdi. Bir masa boşalınca kimin sırasıysa hemen o masaya geçer oyuna kaldığı yerden devam ederdi. Bomba kurmak, lazer veya süpürge... Bunların anlamları bizim için ayrı bir yer taşır. O dönemde olmayan şimdiki çocuklara üzülüyorum. Asla o internet kafe deneyimini yaşayamıyıcaklar. \n\nAma oyun tabiki sadece multiplayer değil. Ne kadar en güzel kısmı o olsada tek kişilik oyuncu moduda gayet eğlenceli. Sessiz dostumuz Gordon Freeman'ın gözünden oynadığımız hikaye modunda yanlış giden bir deney sonrası farklı bir gezegen ile dünya arasında açılan geçitler sayesinde dünyanın uzaylı istalasına uğramasını anlatıyor. Tabi oyundaki tek zorluk uzaylılar değil. Oynanış yeni nesil oyuncuları biraz zorlayabilir. Çünkü yeni oyunların aksine burda şuraya git buraya git diye bir işaretçi yok. Ne yapacağınızı öğrenmek için dostlarınızı iyi dinlemeli ve ne dediklerine önem vermelisiniz aksi halde çoğu oyuncu gibi sağa sola boş boş koşup zaman kaybedersiniz. Ben dahil çoğu kişi dinlemediğimiz için aynı şeyleri yaşadık, aslında biraz da oyunun yapısıyla alakalı geliyor. Öyle bir oyun ki hani oturupta adamları dinleyesiniz gelmiyor yani. \n\nNeyse işin özü Half-Life bence artık oyun dünyası için genel kültür öğesidir. Oynamasanız bile bilin. Ama ben oynamanızı öneririm.Zaten Valve Complete veya Half-Life Complte alarak tüm seriyi çok uygun bir fiyata edinebilirsiniz.

Well, it sure has stood the test of time, even though it isn't perfect by a long shot. Valve managed to pioneer the FPS genre in a way that wasn't really done elsewhere at the time; instead of trying to ramp up the action as much as possible and make the shooting feel amazing (don't get me wrong the shooting feels fine but is not perfect), they focused on making the story as engaging as possible and pacing the gameplay so that it fits, the world is interconnected, and feels much more alive than other 90s shooters.\n\nIn terms of visuals and sound, well, they sure do exist. Okay, in all seriousness, I find the quality of the game to be quite impressive for something from the 90s, not to mention the godsend that is the ability to run in widescreen on moderns systems. While the visuals aren't my favourite things in the world, There are some parts I do enjoy looking at, most of the time they're areas set outside. However in terms of audio, not bad at all. The game's sound effects are pretty good, a lot of the weapons sound punchy and it makes them all feel wonderful. The music fits in very well, although there isn't much of it, it helps add in a bit of flavour to the atmosphere.\n\n Half-Life has very low lows and very high highs. I feel the game is at its peak in the chapter [i]Surface Tension[/i], it mixes in both story and action without feeling bland, frustrating, nor drawn out. Despite being the longest chapter in the game, it certainly doesn't feel that way, and is my favourite chapter of the entire game.\n\nNow we get to the low points, and I am well aware this has been talked about to death, but the lowest point of the game is obviously Xen. All 4 Xen chapters just don't feel complete and lack any care put into them, I'm going to go into detail on all of them to show my problems with them. \n\nFirst of all, [i]Xen[/i]. This is definitely the least interesting chapter of the 4, and a shame, too, it was supposed to be our first look at the end of the game and this big moment that had been hinted at time and time again. All we got, however, was one map that takes like 5 minutes maximum with one boring and unoriginal puzzle and then we move to the next chapter. This brings me onto the next chapter, [i]Gonarch's Lair[/i]. This is probably my favourite out of the 4 as it annoys me the least. The Gonarch boss fight is fine, I mean there's not much to say about it, all you do is repeatedly hit it, it runs off, repeatedly hit it it again, that's the end. The fight itself isn't too bad, however it still is quite underwhelming if you ask me. After that comes [i]Interloper[/i]. I have no idea what they were thinking when they made this. The only good thing about this is that it gives more insight to the relationship between the Vortigaunts and the Xen aliens, still doesn't make it fun though. The chapter is boring, fight segments are frustrating, and it's confusing on where to head to next. And finally, the final boss of the game, [i]Nihilanth[/i]. Not a very good final boss if you ask me. Nihilanth's whole gimmick is that he sends you to other places in Xen, forcing you to go up little areas, while trying to finish off the creature on top of that. The pacing of the fight becomes all wonky, and I don't really feel much after killing it.\n\nThis goes to how Valve wanted to [b]make[/b] Xen but didn't know [b]how to make it[/b]. I don't blame them too hard though because the first game in the series was bound to have flaws. Also keep in mind these opinions on Xen were strictly about the levels seen in Half-Life 1 and NOT its fan made remake, Black Mesa.\n\nAll in all, the game is definitely worth the praise that it is given, and it's worth a playthrough, as long as you're able to mind the flaws.","timestamp_created":1545389089,"timestamp_updated":1623100240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47673412","author":{"steamid":"76561198120530775","num_games_owned":2888,"num_reviews":259,"playtime_forever":1805,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1748,"last_played":1558999192},"language":"english","review":"Great ride.

I knew it was legendary, being the game that basically kickstarted Valve and an entire generation of mods, but I hadn't played many shooters then and it just felt like what I pictured a shooter should be from all I'd heard about them. Looking back on Half-Life now, after playing Half-Life 2, I realize that it's not just some Important Game that was Seminally Influential and it's not just a game for Valve fanboys to fawn over. It's actually a pretty cool game itself, and I think it holds up better than Half-Life 2. It may not be as cinematic, or as visually polished, but it plays smoother, and with a less physics-gimmicky, less expository-pseudo-cutsceney vision. The levels are interesting and the diverse enemy and weapon types make good use of them, forcing you to move and change up your strategy if you want to play the game the fun Action Movie Way.

The game is over 20 years now and so far, it has aged decently in some areas such as the story, but not in terms of graphics and technical issues (there are many bugs to the game). \n\nHalf-Life may be awesome, but sadly it has to come with a few downsides, because it's an old game, there are many game ruining glitches to it, and sometimes the objectives are not clear and you have to watch a guild to help you.But still, overall Half-Life is one of the greatest games ever made.
