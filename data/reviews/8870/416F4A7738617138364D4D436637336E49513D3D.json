At points in the game where you lose some objective you were trying to get, in order to obtain it, the characters just go,\n \"Screw it, ____ instead\".\n\nIf you've played the game, you should know exactly what I'm talking about, if you haven't, just know;\nthey take danger, and the possibility of ruining their lives over taking more effort, because they lose a damn escape blimp, and then do similiar outrageously over and over as the story progresses.\n\nOverall, good if you like covershooters with interesting mechanics added.\nNot if you like intelligent character design.\n\n(spoiler I guess: If you don't know what I was talking about above, [spoiler]I was talking about all the times they went through the \"tears\".

I have heard that this game doesn’t quite live up to its predecessors, but (obviously) I have no idea if that true or not. However, after completing it, I would find it hard to believe this game didn’t meet and exceed any expectations placed upon it.  \n\nThis game was mind-blowingly good. The first thing I noticed about the game is that it’s gorgeous. Everywhere you look in the flying city of Columbia that hosts the game is stunning and makes you want to stop playing and just admire the world around you for a while. Equally captivating was the interaction of Elizabeth and Booker. Though she contributes minimally to combat, her contributions to drive the story are quite the opposite. As the story progresses you can clearly read the emotions on her face without her saying a word and it makes the relationship between the pair that much more intriguing and realistic.  I will say that a small amount of additional voice acting would have gone a long way, as her scripted reactionary comments, at certain points in the story, make the Elizabeth “break character”. My favorite part of the story was the contrast in the way the each character develops as they discover the dark truths behind the “Shining Example of an American City” - it is extremely enjoyable to watch. \n\nThe game plays like a pretty linear FPS. Controls are simple, which is good. There is enough variation in weapons and enemies that combat stays enjoyable throughout, but never gets so complicated that it detracts from the story – which is spectacular.  It unfolds beautifully; I particularly enjoyed how the atmosphere and scenery flowed with the story, enhancing the beautiful facades and dark culture Columbia has to offer. And no great story is complete without its fair share of plot twists. Which are strong in Bioshock Infinite. After I finished the main story I kinda sat there like someone replaced my brain with oatmeal and said, “Wait… What? … What the fuck just happened...?” And then like 5 hours later in the shower (where everyone does their best thinking) I was finally like, “oohhhhhh, now I get it!” All in all, this is an incredible game that I would highly recommend to anyone, whether you are into FPS games or not. \n","timestamp_created":1390864711,"timestamp_updated":1390864711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8873064","author":{"steamid":"76561198040498091","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1807,"last_played":1443593992},"language":"english","review":"This is a beautiful game with a beautiful story.

Сражаться надоедает уже на середине игры. Доигрывал исключительно ради концовки, которая по слухам должна была представлять из себя нечто такое, что должно было как-то меня удивить. Как история биошок инфинит так же неоднозначен. В начале сюжет просто не интересен, потом в какой-то момент быть может и начинаешь за ним следить, но спустя какое-то время  история снова проседает и даже она уже не держит, а потом и вовсе она сливается в какой-то бред с призраками. Даже локации со временем становятся более мрачными и какими-то серыми что ли. Так мало того - по этим серостям еще заставляют пробежаться пару-тройку раз из начала в конец, и наоборот. Конечно повторная пробежка по уже знакомым местам несколько отличается от первого раза, но все же. Псевдооткрытые локации тут не особо к месту. Они игре ничего не добавляют, зато вносят в игру элемент скуки, а она и без того не самая веселая. Не смотря на то, что в игре летают целые города, а люди с легкостью перемещаются на крюках по рельсам, вот так вот запросто висящих в небесах, главный герой может унести с собой только два вида оружия. Это вот и есть современные игры. Реалистичные только там, где это не нужно в принципе. В поведении же Элизабет тоже не заметил ничего сверхъестественного, она, конечно, в игре полезнее капитана Прайса, открывающего двери, но и чего-то такого, что могло бы вызвать отвал башки я тоже в ней не заметил. Что же до концовки, то она действительно несколько не ожиданна и даже меня, человека, мягко говоря не любящего \"кинцо\" в играх, заставила смотреть ролики и не думать во время просмотра о кнопке ESC\\пробел\\Enter... Но при всем при этом, сейчас бы она меня не заставила купить заново игру. Если кратко, то биошок инфинит - абсолютно разовая игра, которую забываешь сразу же после прохождения (в памяти остается лишь концовка). Покупать или нет? Играть или нет? На мой взгляд, такие игры можно смело проходить на ютубе. Ничего не пропустите, а фана может быть получите даже больше, нежели непосредственно играя в саму игру.","timestamp_created":1390834638,"timestamp_updated":1390834638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8868658","author":{"steamid":"76561198008575547","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1848,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1423,"last_played":1402568241},"language":"russian","review":"Супер игра !!!!","timestamp_created":1390834527,"timestamp_updated":1390834527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8868642","author":{"steamid":"76561198069701153","num_games_owned":397,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1259,"last_played":1406719561},"language":"russian","review":"Отличный сюжет!

All design decisions made by the developers subtly direct the player towards interesting themes that keep reverberating throughout the story.  This Bioshock game takes place in a different utopia that floats in the sky.  Infinite’s gameworld, Columbia, is given incredible detail and is probably the most vibrant and dynamic city portrayed in gaming.  Irrational Games designed characters that exude lively animations and personalities that, for the first time in the franchise, provoked genuine emotional reactions out of me.  You play as an ex-Pinkerton agent assigned with a rather simple task that gets complicated quickly.  Throughout your adventure in Columbia, the player is presented with some of the most uncomfortable and controversial game moments and takes a new approach with choice and morality.  However, these segments are beautifully tied into the story’s theme and portrayed with such narrative finesse that the player’s discomfort is also accompanied with awe and amazement.  \n\nWhile Bioshock Infinite doesn’t have the incredible level design its predecessors had, the game has extremely balanced gameplay that struggles between exploration, combat, and story.  All details of Infinite are so carefully considered, it would be silly to assume that Irrational Games got lazy when designing the combat.  If the combat system became any more complicated with extra secondary goals and additional exploration, it would disrupt the balance between the narrative and ultimately force the player to focus less on the story.  While I would prefer that my Booker DeWitt had the ability to carry all accessible weapons with him, the two-weapon system doesn’t necessary bother me.  Almost all weapons are very well balanced and merely cater to different gameplay styles without offering noticeable advantages in combat.  In addition, I found that Vigors are a much more appealing magic system than the Plasmids in Rapture.  The various Vigors react with each other differently and offer much more depth to the gameplay if you decide to experiment with them.  The defensive Vigors, such as Return to Sender and an upgraded Charge, can become life savers on higher difficulties.  It’s incredibly rewarding when the player perseveres through a challenging combat situation by cleverly utilizing their Vigor arsenal.  Bioshock Infinite is one of the most colorful games ever crafted and steers the shooter genre in a new direction with its fluid gameplay and remarkable narration.\n\nGameplay: 20/20 … PERFECT (The 10+ hours I spent in the combat arena DLC, Clash in the Clouds, proves my enthusiast attitude towards Infinite’s gameplay.)\nStory: 10/10 … PERFECT (The voice talents in this game are flawless and brings the characters to life.  Elizabeth is an outstanding character and a groundbreaking achievement in human portrayal in a video game.

Listened to friends and critics and bought this game for 9.99$ on sale and still feel like I wasted money. The combat was awful, each enemy felt like a bullet sponge. The story isn't very good either, infact it's very, very bad. Its full of plot holes from begining to end. Why doesn't booker cover his hand when he relizes its a sign of the false sheperd? He makes no effort to conceal his hand it doesn't make any sense. also spoilers but why did elizibeth kill booker in the end? if it is infinite universes then wouldn't not matter in the end? wouldn't there just be a universe where he survives in fact there would be an infinite amount of universes where he survives meaning the ending is pointless and fucking retarded in every way. so the story and gameplay suck so far, but I will admit that the atmosphere is decent and for the most part I'd say its not great, not good but not bad by any definition. Also if you say Elizibeth fixed the companion mission I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU I SWEAR TO GOD, THIS IS A WRITTEN THREAT. She can't die all she does is give you stuff, you don't have to go out of your way to save her because it's impossible for her die, she is just there to move the story foreward, if you have  a problem don't just taking it out of the game completly you're not fixing it you're just being a lazy sack of shit.

A questão é que, para aqueles que conseguem se envolver um pouco mais com o jogo, os aspectos positivos simplesmente ofuscam os aspectos negativos.\n\nO gameplay do jogo não é tão bom, os vigores não são tão úteis e você só vai usá-los poucas vezes no jogo para matar inimigos especiais ou abrir locais secretos. O sistema de combate também é um tanto quanto confuso e é muito repetitivo. É sempre assim: vem uma onda de inmigos com dois ou três especiais e depois que ela acaba você continua o jogo.\n\nNo entanto este jogo tem uma das histórias, direção de arte, direção de personagens e trilha sonora mais bem feitas que já vi, e me arrisco a dizer que são das melhores já feitas em um meio de entretenimento, não só no mundo dos videogames.\n\nA história do jogo é extremamente rica em detalhes, bastante complexa e poucos jogos ou mesmo filmes tem uma história tão envolvente e tão bem construída. Quanto a trilha sonora, grande parte é de covers de músicas reais. Foram tão bem encaixadas nas cenas que é difícil encontrar alguma para criticar, além claro de as músicas do próprio jogo te envolverem mais ainda na história. Columbia, na minha opinião, ficou tão bonita quanto Rapture, a direção de arte do jogo é excelente, simplesmente excelente. Agora uma das partes mais importantes do jogo, os personagens. Os principais foram muito bem construídos (com relação ao desenvolvimento na história), Elizabeth é uma personagem extremamente envolvente e que em certos momentos do jogo fez até eu me sentir como o Booker (protagonista), preocupado com ela. O problema com os NPCs do jogo é que são quase todos iguais.\n\nQuanto ao final do jogo, simplesmente dispensa comentários, simplesmente mindfu*****, excelente e recomendo jogar mais de uma vez, pois na segunda vez se percebe muitos detalhes que não se percebe da primeira vez.\n\nA última crítica que tenho a fazer, mas que nem é tão relevante, é que eu acho que deveria haver outras maneiras de interação com a Elizabeth (não no sentido malicioso).\n\nPara resumir, o jogo é uma obra-prima, pois como disse quando se está jogando os pontos bons ofuscam completamente os pontos ruins.","timestamp_created":1390798333,"timestamp_updated":1390820579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8864723","author":{"steamid":"76561198059823756","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65,"last_played":1409507019},"language":"english","review":"The best game i have ever played in my life.

The Bioshock franchise weaves a story that is so compelling, it leaves you with the most satisfying need for more (does that even make sense?). \n\nIt hurts to read some of the negative reviews on here, perplexed at people's opinions and expectations. People see weapons and a first-person FOV and think, \"Oh, this looks good, I wonder how it stacks up to COD, FarCry, (insert modern FPS franchise here), etc. This is where this kind of thinking needs to stop. Sure, the game's fabric is constructed around firing weapons, killing enemies, and solving objectives. But these are just the formalities of a game constructed with the most incredible story and characters you will ever come across.\n\nI could write a book-long review of how amazing this game is, but I'll keep it short.\n\nTechnical aspects:\nThe game mechanics are smooth as we have come to expect from the Unreal environment. Irrational takes the graphics a step further and really paints an incredible picture for this chapter in Bioshock. I found myself constantly pressing F12 to screenshot the amazing landscapes and beautiful detail to the theme that makes Bioshock what it is.\n\nAll in all, get this game, and play it paying close attention to audio logs, conversations, visual cues, and other sensory pandemonium. It's overload at times, but in a great way. Follow the story, and realize what an incredible job Irrational has done to weave social, economic, and religious issues into a game that will open your eyes and mind to what these things can do.\n\n10/10\n\nI can't wait for the next.","timestamp_created":1390789633,"timestamp_updated":1500701177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8863537","author":{"steamid":"76561197993067524","num_games_owned":367,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1456932333},"language":"english","review":"Good game if you can get it for cheep","timestamp_created":1390786896,"timestamp_updated":1390786896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8863061","author":{"steamid":"76561198062496153","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1465,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":769,"last_played":1587435153},"language":"english","review":"Played this game as my first Bioshock game, and gotta say it was a great way to get into the franchise.
