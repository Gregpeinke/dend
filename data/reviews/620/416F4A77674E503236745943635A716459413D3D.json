The rooms start off easy and get progressively harder. The story is pretty much filler, but I had a couple of laughs at the corny jokes and the dialogue.\n\nI also played a few levels of co-op with a friend and it was so much more fun. The co-op rooms are a bit harder, since you need to work together to solve the puzzles. You both need to portal seperate things at the same time to progress the levels.\n\nAll in all, a very fun game. The only downside is that it took me about 10 hours to play through the entire single player mode. That leaves me a bit dissatisfied.

Details about the game's backstory and plot are interweaved throughout the game in hilarious and sometimes surprisingly ominous ways, and the game as a whole was nothing short of incredible in almost every respect. Even though I heard nothing but praise about this game before playing it myself, I was still surprised by just how fantastic it was. Portal 2 is nearly perfect, and I can't say that there's currently anything like it in the gaming world, nor can I say there ever will be in the future. \n\nIf you're wondering whether or not you should buy this game, the question you should really be asking youorself is whether or not you should buy this game as well as the original Portal, and the answer is yer. Oh my god, yes. Play the original Portal, then play Portal 2. Both of them are fantastic, and I would love nothing better than to describe them both and how beautifully well put together and utterly revolutionary they were in every respect, but to spoil anything about the experience would be a crime in itself.
