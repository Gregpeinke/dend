Вскоре осознал, что мне пора выйти в свет и показать себя в кооперативной игре. Что же я увидел? Кучку оболтусов, которые покупают внеклассовое оружие, палят в мясника из пистолета и в одиночку пытаются настрелять отбивальщику из какой-то пуколки.

Forget Nazi Zombies, this is the real shit. Killing Floor is about one thing and one thing only: shooting zombies and staying alive. \n\nOkay, that was too things, but you get the idea. There's no \"story mode\" over-saturated with sappy exposition or even that many modes outside of the basic survival and objective game types. Thanks to the combined efforts of Tripwire Interactive and the modding community, this game does one thing really well and manages to do so with a huge helping of content to enjoy. There's plenty of maps to play, from an old English pub to the moon to the depths of Hell and everywhere in-between. In each stage, the premise is the same: you are being assaulted from all sides by bloodthirsty mutants Left 4 Dead style, with no where to go. If you've played Nazi Zombies or Left 4 Dead by this point, you oughta know the procedure by know.\n\nYou can play on your own on a lower difficulty for a scarier survival experience, or with a few buddies for a more coordinated murderfest. For extra depth, you can pick from one of several classes, each with their own perks that become more useful over time as you level up. If you don't care about any of that though, Killing Floor can still be a great game for when you have that itch to just shoot something, or if you want to hang out with a few buddies online and enjoy some zombie murderin' together.\n\nBut just what makes Killing Floor the best of its kind isn't the abundance of combat or the simplicity of its game modes. Killing Floor has we like to call \"hella good game feel\" That is, the guns just \"feel\" good to fire. They all have weight, heft and serious recoil to them, combined with extremely satisfying sound assets. No matter how many times you shoot a Clot's head off with a double barrel shotgun, it never gets old, and really, it never should.\n\nIf you really enjoyed 28 Days Later and wanted to experience that kind of frantic, fast-paced British zombie slaying action, you've come to the right place.","timestamp_created":1417464704,"timestamp_updated":1417464704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13186024","author":{"steamid":"76561198036524702","num_games_owned":390,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":12616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12311,"last_played":1530866053},"language":"english","review":"dsfdsf","timestamp_created":1417463797,"timestamp_updated":1417463797,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13185417","author":{"steamid":"76561198094101538","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":841,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":744,"last_played":1418606257},"language":"english","review":"lumayan kalau maen multiplayer, servernya lumayan banyak jadi ane yang dlu internetnya cuma 90kb/s ping masih 150 an lumayan gk lag kan ? padahal online loh V...sekarang mah 256kb/s jadi gk ada lag\"an top deh maen rame\" bunuh zombie 9/10","timestamp_created":1417461565,"timestamp_updated":1417461565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13184940","author":{"steamid":"76561198102909223","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":2211,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1451,"last_played":1529709315},"language":"russian","review":"","timestamp_created":1417459831,"timestamp_updated":1417459831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13184937","author":{"steamid":"76561198134750253","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3927,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3240,"last_played":1565105658},"language":"russian","review":"Игра потрясающая!

Killing Floor is a 6 player co-op horde shooter where you battle it out with waves of mutated genetic freaks and earn money for oblidorating them and using that money to buy better gear between waves at the Trader.\nKilling Floor also features a Perk System which has 7 diffrent perks to pick from [b] ( Field medic, Support specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Berserker, Firebug and Demolition.)  [/b]\nwith each level you earn, the higher the benefits of your perk will be, getting you more discounts on perk specific weapons and more damage for those weapons and other perk related attributes of the sort.\n\n[h1] Run down of the Game [/h1]\n\n[h1] Multiplayer [/h1]\nThe comunnity for Killing Floor is large and healthy, many active players and active servers to join and play in\njust make sure to play on servers appropriate for your level of skill and perk, playing on Hell on earth servers is not exactly where you wanna start your game in.\n\n[h1] Mod support/Developer support [/h1]\nKilling Floor has been supported by the developers ever since 5 years ago when it came out on Steam, giving a large amount of patches and fixes for the game along with a ton of Weapons that were added in during special events (Christmas, Halloween, ect) also re-skinning the zeds to fit the theme of the holiday.\nin terms of mods Killing Floor itself was originaly built off a Mod for Unreal2004 so it would be no suprise to see the game have very big mod support, a ton of community made maps and other mods (Weapons, Charaters, Zeds, ect)\ni would recommend to play a bit of Killing Floor Vanila before trying out the mods so that you will not be confused what is a regular part of the base game.\n\n[h1] Performance  [/h1]\nFor a game running on an outdated/aging engine, Killing Floor is quite amazing till this very day.\nusing the old unreal engine to its limits and allowing huge mod support with the SDK.\nRunning Killing Floor should not be a problem to anyone with a low-end PC, (unless you are trying to run the game with a Potato of a computor)\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nKilling Floor is quite a solid and polished FPS, having some of the best gunplay i have ever expirenced in a game\ngiving the player a large amount of options and guns to use.\nTeamwork is a very important part of the game when playing on higher diffculties or playing in general with other poeple\neveryone in the team has a responsibility to take and can contribute to the team with the skill set they have\n(Field medic healing poeple (duhh). Support keeping doors welded and crowd controling zeds with his shotgun, Demolition blowing shit up, ect ect)\n\n[h1] Final notes [/h1]\nKilling Floor is definetly a must have for any fan of horde shooters and cooprative games, you will be playing for hours and might want to get a group of friends to enjoy it twice as much!\nlike i said before, please know what you are doing and dont go running off into Hell on Earth servers at Level 0\nyou also might wanna pick up some weapon DLC, (yeah we all hate buying DLC but this DLC is realy good and the developers deserve the money for this!) there is also alot of cosmetic charater packs you can pick up to add a bit of style to your charater, but they aren't essential nor do you get any special benefits from them.\nI can't wait for Killing Floor 2 and i bet you can't wait aswell, so hop into Killing Floor and have a blast and prepare your ass for Killing Floor 2.\n\nUPDATE 11/18/2016\nkf2 got out of EA, sucks shit not going to elaborate, play kf1 instead","timestamp_created":1417356258,"timestamp_updated":1479488790,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561403512954711914","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13162625","author":{"steamid":"76561198153295883","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":196,"last_played":1419339302},"language":"english","review":"well........
