non solo le vicende dei due personaggi principali arricchiscono l'universo di BioShock  grazie agli eventi che questi trascorrono i quali ci faranno legare ed immedesimare in loro, il gameplay è la logica evoluzione delle meccaniche di gioco dei precedenti capitoli ampliando le opzioni su come affrontare le sfide che ci vengono incontro.\nBioShock Infinite è il migliore del suo genere e tra i

I definitely will not, and can not forget the story of this game for at least 10 years, literally. It shocked me from the bottom of my heart, from the deep inside human beings, from the question round the power of evil & sin in philosophy.\n\nThe story and music is just extremely excellent like I already mentioned, in addition if you are a person who love philosophy and always think about connected questions then it will be unforgettable for you, just like me.\n\nOn the other hand, the graphic and views in the game also amazing, even wonderful if you know it released on 2013. For the gameplay, it is a single narrative FPS game so what you actually need to do is just follow the mark and use both of your magics and weapons to shoot down enemies. There are no puzzles and no side stories, just enjoy playing. The level of difficulty can be selected, so it almost would not have challenges if you just want the story meanwhile also would have if you with high difficult level. From my point of view, shooting experiences were actually fun especially with some hidden clues about the main story. But to be honest it is not a superb FPS game if you are just looking for good shooting experiences.\n\nIn conclusion, it is a masterpiece for anyone who are looking for a great single play experience.

These two games have something in common, a false promise so to speak but another version we didn't know we wanted. Both had versions before release that were so imaginative and bold that it were games that we truly wanted to play but in the end we got something else. I can go on how these two games seem so 'alike', but the this quote above seals the main goal this game was set on achieving and unlike Cyberpunk this game succeeds on its delivery. \"Perception without comprehension is a dangerous combination\" you might say that the game is speaking on behalf of its story but in reality its also speaking towards the cautionary tale of an 'overhyped game', a bloated concept can lead to any downfall and that's where the story of this game's development flourishes. 'Irrational Games' understood how much they can push and how much they can deliver, and they translated that into a well-woven story that will keep us thinking for years to come. I can only say that this game's ending further solidifies that fact, a story that pushed beyond standard story telling yet placing in boundaries that it understood. \n\nAnd in the end all I could say is \"Wow...\"\nbecause \"wow\" is an all purpose exclamation, it can mean you loved it or you can't put into other words how much you did love it. Its up to you, and that's what Irrational Games wanted to do 8 years ago. They couldn't put into words how much this game or this story meant to them so they wanted to place it into a game, to reflect the struggle they had behind the scenes and prove that they can pull something this amazing off. This game either meant to the developers as their Story-Rich FPS or their love-letter to the gaming industry as a whole and how much this industry means to them and how much they proved that no concept is impossible when set the right boundaries.
