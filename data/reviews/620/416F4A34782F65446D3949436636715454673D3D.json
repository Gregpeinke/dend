Я поиграл в эту игру около десятка часов, и я ранее не получал такого удовольствия и напряжения от других игр.\nТе, кому не нравится эта игра, тот не умеет либо размышлять и ему лень думать логически, либо этот человек не знает что такое настоящий шедевр. (Ну у каждого свое мнение на эту тему). Эта игра безусловный шедевр. Геймплей, атмосфера, юмор - просто потрясающе. А то прекрасное чувство, которое посетило меня после прохождения данной игры - оно просто неописуемо. \nКак только ты начинаешь играть новую игру, понимаешь что дальше будет ещё круче, атмосфернее и т.д\nНасколько тут интересный сюжет, уровни, и пушка. О да! Пушка, все бы несомненно хотели эту пушку, но увы и ах...\nПросто поверьте здесь есть все что нужно. Кооператив с сюжетом, одиночная игра тоже с не плохим сюжетом, steam workshop, именно с ним вы уж точно не соскучитесь после прохождение игры. Так же тут можно создать свой уровень, головоломку и показать друзьям. \nPortal 2 - эта одна из тех самых игр, которая запомнится навсегда.\nВ этой игре практически идеально все - озвучка прелестна, графика прелестна, физика прелестна, о сюжете вообще молчу!\nОказывается, заклятый враг, который вас пытается убить, может стать вашим лучшим другом и картошкой; а самый лучший друг может стать вашим заклятым врагом и постоянно пытается вас убить.\nОказывается обычный неприметный сарай может содержать в себе ну просто пи**ец какой огромный комплекс.\nНу так вот, кто не прошел эту игру, вы обязаны пройти ее.

It is AMAZING!\n\n~#P.S A Few Spoilers For Portal 1#~\n\nPortal 2 is a puzzle game that concises of the 'Portal Mechanic'. Where you shoot two different coloured portals from your Portal Gun (Portal Device) which you or other entities can go through. In my opinion it is one of the cleverest mechanics I have seen in a video game.\n\nPortal 2 is the sequel to Portal (If it was'nt obvious enough) You step inside to the boots of Chell (the coolest female silent protagonist ever! (And maybe the only :D)) a test subject at Apeture Labratories who must once again acquire the Portal Gun (Portal Device). A weapon that...... (Read 1st paragraph. I'm not going to repeat myself). That is basically the main plot of the game but I can't go any further due to spoilers.\n\nThe gameplay is amazing and like I said in the 1st paragraph it is the cleverest gameplay mechanic I have seen so far.\nThe story is amazing play it for yourself, but play the 1st Portal game first to fully enjoy the game!\n\nThe game also has it's own co-op mode as well. You are able to do puzzles with your friends or some random guy/girl.\nCo-op mode also has it's own story which is basically an add on to the end of the Portal 2 Campaign. Co-op is just as good as single player mode and numerous critics have claimed Co-op mode is better than single player! So it's worth I try I think.\n\nFinally you are also able to create your own puzzles and post them on the Steam Workshop\n\nConsidering everything I said and the fact that in the 3 times I have played the Portal 2 Campaipn and 2 times completing the Co-op campaign I am yet to come across a glitch. Valve took good care of this game and it holds a soft spot in the hearts of anyon who plays it so I giving Portal 2 10/10!

Particularly in the mid  game, you'll see a lot of the Aperture facility and the machinery outside the usual testing rooms, and those environments look amazing.\n\nNow about the gameplay, since this is still a puzzle game at the core; Portal 2 chooses to have a lower puzzle density and instead, you'll spend more time walking around and exploring Aperture. You could say it's less puzzle and more game. The tests themselves are usually pretty straightforward, some require a bit of trial and error and thinking, but none should hold you up for longer than a few minutes. If the tests are all you are looking for in this kind of game, one could argue Portal 2 is inferior to the first game in the series. However, I believe that the change of pace was significantly improved, and the leveldesign alone makes this game more than worth playing.","timestamp_created":1452774675,"timestamp_updated":1452774675,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542483627796173096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20520259","author":{"steamid":"76561198064549450","num_games_owned":367,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":386,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":374,"last_played":1578856515},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito divertido!","timestamp_created":1452769814,"timestamp_updated":1452769814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20519714","author":{"steamid":"76561198037257563","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":152,"playtime_forever":12491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":608,"last_played":1558753695},"language":"brazilian","review":"Ótimo Jogo","timestamp_created":1452766288,"timestamp_updated":1452766288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20519642","author":{"steamid":"76561198068614001","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1350,"last_played":1654930886},"language":"english","review":"First of all this is one of my favourite games of all time and i think if you are doubting getting this DON'T!

NIkdy bych neřekl, že mě logická hra, ve které používáte pouze jednu zbraň se dvěma portálama, takhle natchne, chytne a zabaví. Co mě naprasto natchlo byly nezapomenutelné dialogy. Hra je jimi prošpikovaná od začátku do konce a jsou takové úrovně, že by se z nich dala udělat rodinná komedie. Dále je zde k dispozici co-op. Pokud máte někoho do dvojice, tak rozhodně neváhejte.

Tired of generic, uninsipred, unoriginal and rushed out the door shooter sequels that you get every year? This is the most creative 'FPsort of S' game you ever played. Great single player, great puzzles/platforming, great story and dialogue, really funny and memorable characters, great presentation (despite the ancient engine) and probably still the best co-op mode on the market today. \n\n\n\nEasily an all time classic. Grab a friend and enjoy :)\nThen start praying Valve makes a sequel.","timestamp_created":1452710353,"timestamp_updated":1454927987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20509642","author":{"steamid":"76561198139269454","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2111,"last_played":1611503277},"language":"turkish","review":"Hayatımda oynadığın en güzel oyun :D","timestamp_created":1452710293,"timestamp_updated":1452710293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20509583","author":{"steamid":"76561198256400485","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":14430,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1319,"last_played":1592929709},"language":"russian","review":"Логичиская игра, лучшая игра и мне нравиться, моя любимая игра ^^","timestamp_created":1452710103,"timestamp_updated":1452710103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545112788677215576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20509334","author":{"steamid":"76561198044774076","num_games_owned":534,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":115,"last_played":1596322413},"language":"english","review":"Good game","timestamp_created":1452709162,"timestamp_updated":1452709162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20508804","author":{"steamid":"76561198083198044","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1617,"last_played":1499536396},"language":"english","review":"Literally the best gaem i have ever played.
