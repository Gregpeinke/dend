The product of Valve Corp. Puplished in 2004. If youre an experienced gamer, you would probably already played this game, and some of you did multiply times. Since that Gaming Industry were creating lots of titles for 14 years, using modern technology, and some titles are may be as good as HL2, may be better.  Ive tryed many games during this epriod, and yes, there are some games better than Half-Life 2. But I can't say that you can find any game that can get close to HL2. Its atmosphere, the story and working out on every detail is like to not some many games in the world.\nThere are a lot of reviews on the internet, and on steam as well, wrote by professional gaming journalists and amateur players, whatever. And Im not a professional journalist and I have none expierence in writing reviews for game or anything, so Im not gonna do that job. I just would like to write here some aspects I would like to share with you my friend, an anonymous gamer.\nThis game is good in everything, except the couple of bad things:\nI dont like the control of person. When you jump on a rail you always fall because the inertia of you in this game is a kind of exaggerated.\nThe similar thing is all the rest of physics of this game. Im not trying to say physics are bad here, but also they bring you too much trouble, unexpected and not realistic trouble. Object movement make you nervous sometimes.\nAI in this game is one the weakest sides of HL2. Combine soldiers dont use any tactics, they just run in the room always one by one right in front of your weapon.\nAlso there are too many unnecessary \"labyrinths\" in this game. I couldnt say it is good, some may think it is, like you're solving a puzzle, but in my opinion you just loose too much time for finding an exit.\nThere was a bigger problem in \"Follow Freeman\" Chapter when i exploded a mine inside of a room from the outside of the room and the door to it closed. I was running all around this level trying to figure out how can i find a way to a room to shut down a generator, unless i watched a walkthrough and found out that i have to replay this chapter. So be careful, remember that! Lol\nExcept that the game is excellent. What can we say, its classics, the basics of PC gaming. If you didn't play this game, you know nothing about PC gaming. Thats it my friend","timestamp_created":1409436001,"timestamp_updated":1409436001,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11925152","author":{"steamid":"76561198053508738","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1657923461},"language":"english","review":"Awesome storyline and gameplay!","timestamp_created":1409425437,"timestamp_updated":1409425437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11924285","author":{"steamid":"76561198008735483","num_games_owned":733,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1331622000},"language":"english","review":"Long winded, repetitive and ultimately forgettable.\n\nEdit: Characters are alright but moving through the narrative of this is tedious.

Rise and shine[/h1]\n\nZwischen Half Life 1 und Half Life 2 gab es keinen Shooter, welcher mich inhaltlich auch nur annähernd so an den Monitor fesseln konnte. Ich erinnere mich noch als wäre es gestern gewesen, als ich nach der Installation von Steam und dem Start in diese Story einfach kein Auge mehr zubekommen habe. Kopfhörer hatte ich dazumals keine, so durften meine armen Nachbarn die ganze Nacht, den kriegsähnlichen Geräuschen lauschen, welche aus meinen Lautsprechern schallten. Erst beim Verlassen der Wohnung kam dann von der Nachbartür eine Wortmeldung: \"Nix schlafen - Du ganze Nacht machen bumm bumm!\" Ich sagte OH, du haben auch gehört? Hahaha so ist das Leben :D\n\nDie bahnbrechendste Erneuerung damals war wohl die sogenannte Gravity Gun, mit der ich als Spieler in der Lage war, Gegenstände anzuheben und wegzuschleudern, was je nach Level und herumliegenden Gegenständen viel Freiraum zum Experimentieren bietet. Ansonsten gefällt mir einfach die Shooter-Mechanik, die wuchtigen Sounds, das Trefferfeedback und vor allem das mysteriöse Storytelling um Mr. Freeman.\n\nIch finde es nach wie vor schade, dass die Reihe trotz ihres Erfolges nie abgeschlossen wurde aber man kann wohl nicht alles haben.\n\n*****\n\n👑 Powered by HoI 4 Deu Kuratorengruppe auf deutsch/englisch 👑\n⠀⠀⠀[url=https:/store.steampowered.com/curator/30388691/] (ง •̀_•́)ง Folgen ผ(•̀_•́ผ) [/url]\nund mehr Reviews von mir entdecken 🎊\n\nCheers,\nFletcher","timestamp_created":1408730631,"timestamp_updated":1587392054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.573043107986450195","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11822175","author":{"steamid":"76561198068843055","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1022,"last_played":1546102435},"language":"russian","review":"1000/100","timestamp_created":1408729010,"timestamp_updated":1408729010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11822000","author":{"steamid":"76561197972567040","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1397,"last_played":1659189007},"language":"english","review":"Recommended.","timestamp_created":1408728081,"timestamp_updated":1408728081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.437544435262680054","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11821263","author":{"steamid":"76561198069117192","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":624,"last_played":1475942735},"language":"english","review":"Egy kis nosztalgiázás :) Kihagyhatatlan darbja a HL Szériának :)","timestamp_created":1408724290,"timestamp_updated":1408724290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11819559","author":{"steamid":"76561198012073617","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":759,"last_played":1526662865},"language":"english","review":"This is one of the game that you must play before you die.
