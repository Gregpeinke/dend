The only flaw that I can think of with it is that once you have finished the single-player campaign, there is nothing left to do with the game. Of course, you could restart it but this would seem to some like a waste of time.

Das liegt jedoch in erster Linie daran, dass man das Konzept unzählige Male kopiert hat. Es unterscheidet sich von vielen seiner Nachahmer aber immer noch in einigen Punkten. Im Zeitalter der Konsoleneinheitsshooter wurden es zuletzt sogar mehr.\n\nSo verzichtet der Titel gänzlich auf neumodischen Light-Gaming-Quatsch wie Deckungssystem und die weit verbreitete Autoteilung. Zumindest ich wäge meinen Angriff ganz anders ab, wenn ich nicht genau weiß, wann mich das nächste Medikit erwartet. Wer meint, er bräuchte sich nur lange hinter einer Wand verstecken, bis sein Lebensbalken wieder voll wird, steht da bis zum Verrecken. \n\nHalf Life 2 ist wie ein guter Wein, der mit zunehmendem Alter an Qualität gewinnt. Optisch sieht man dem Spiel sein Alter natürlich an. Das direkte Gameplay weiß man allerdings mit jedem konsoligen 0815-Shooter, der heute erscheint, umso besser zu schätzen. Wird echt Zeit, dass Valve einen dritten Teil veröffentlicht.","timestamp_created":1424355495,"timestamp_updated":1424355609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14543192","author":{"steamid":"76561198064074987","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1150,"last_played":1649340798},"language":"english","review":"a classic, must play before you die.","timestamp_created":1424351832,"timestamp_updated":1424351832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14542742","author":{"steamid":"76561198178084487","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1823,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":868,"last_played":1604171398},"language":"french","review":"Meilleur FPS qui existe.\nAutant de qualité pour la maudite somme de 10 euros.","timestamp_created":1424349235,"timestamp_updated":1424349235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14540368","author":{"steamid":"76561197962307213","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":84,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84,"last_played":1424331707},"language":"english","review":"Classic!","timestamp_created":1424331208,"timestamp_updated":1424331208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14538223","author":{"steamid":"76561198108031078","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1260,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1106,"last_played":1514329189},"language":"english","review":"Half life 2 is probably one of the best games I have ever played and I have played a couple.

Наверное, пару месяцев назад меня можно было смело показывать за деньги в музее или на выставке - геймер, не игравший в Half-Life. Как-то так получилось, что некоторые популярнейшие игры прошли мимо меня. Их мало, но зато прошагали они целыми сериями. Самые яркие примеры этого - Doom, Half-Life, Splinter Cell,  Но один человек - Nick Robinson не мог смириться с тем, что я не играл, по его словам, в лучшую игру всех времён. Он потерял сон, перестал пить, есть, а если серьёзно, терроризировал меня каждый день. Я попытался найти помощи в Twitter, но оказалось, что он заполнен предателями, гневно трясущими кулачками в мою сторону. Я взял и купил Half-Life 2, поскольку первую часть прошёл давно. Мои впечатления? давайте по порядку...\n\nHalf-Life 2 культовыя вселенная получившая более 30 наград по всему миру, именно Half-Life 2 произвёла вторую революцию в жанре Action. Да что я говорю, у меня с тех времён наклейка наград на мониторах.\n\nПроснитесь и пойте, мистер Фримен... Что меня удивило с самого начала, даже в 2015 эта игра выглядит ну очень привлекательно! Начиная от графики и заканчивая физикой.  Да сейчас я не помню такого замечательного искусственного интеллекта, который бы всегда поворачивался к тебе лицом и отпихивал рукой, подойди ты вплотную. Что касается самого мира... Чёрт, я всегда мечтал побывать в мире \"1984\" Джорджа Оруэлла, откуда и были взяты большинство деталей тоталитарного режима Сити-17. Хотя внешний вид всё же больше напоминает Россию 70-х, чему свидетельствуют Волги на улицах. Но самое главное, что первое впечатление не просто затягивает в игру, а удивляет спустя почти 10 лет после выхода!\n\nG-Man'е: Сама игра проста и разнообразна одновременно. С одной стороны у нас абсолютно линейное прохождение, с другой - большие локации, создающие иллюзию свободного мира. Ну а с гоночными средствами, разнообразными монстрами и 11 видами оружия, перед нами получается целая вселенная, прикрепленная своей историей и мистикой, которая заключается не только в таинственном G-Man'е, но и многими вопросами, возникающими во время игры. Ответа на большинство я, кстати, так и не получил, но буду надеяться, что два последующих эпизода хоть как-то мне их разъяснят.\n\nНо что я оценил больше всего - в игре нет ничего лишнего. Ничего. Каждый солдат на своём месте, каждый монстр нужен миру. Любой твой спутник важен, любое их действие логично. Здесь даже логично объясняется, почему ты не можешь идти дальше, и причина не кроется в том, что только Прайс ты не умеешь поворачивать ручку двери! У нас есть герой (Гордон), красивая и умная помощница (Аликс), лучший друг (Барни), враг (доктор \"Большой Брат\" Бринн), предатель (Джудит), проблема (тоталитаризм), её олицетворение (Цитадель), а также загадка (G-Man). Этой игре не нужен сценарий, ей не нужна экранизация - она и есть фильм.\n\nВ завершении \"Half-Life 2\"  меня не покидало ощущение, что я вновь прохожу игру 2003 года, за исключением вида от первого лица. Если же говорить только о серии Half-Life, разница такая же, как у тех же частей Hitman & Max Payne. \"Half-Life 2\" получает честные 10/10. Честно, я мог бы написать очень большую рецензию, но думаю этого хватит.
