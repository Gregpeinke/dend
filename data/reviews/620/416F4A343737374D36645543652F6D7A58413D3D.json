And the coop is excellent too.\n\nThe story is well written without being too simple or too complex. The core parts are there, but that's not enough. Yet Valve goes above an beyond the expectations. Yes, the events of the previous game, however few they were, have an impact. But we are also introduced to new characters. We get backstory for Glados, the villain, and she grows from learning her own story. But we also meet the new character of Wheatly. He's lovable in his incompetence, yet makes for an interesting character in the final act of the story. We also get to see the glory days of Aperture Science and their fall.\n\nAt the same time the environments greatly support the story, while at the same time being beautiful. The game may be five years old by this point, but the graphics still hold up. And amazingly, the game runs well on my craptacular Geforce 210. Yet, the visuals are never hard to read. You can always see what you need to see with no uncertainties. The overal quality of the graphics is a major improvement compared to the predecessor. It is hard to believe that it is the same engine.\n\nThe music is generally nothing special, if you think of it as something to listen to on its own. But it works magnificently as the background for the game. It really helps sell the experience that the visuals are offering. And as expected, there is a new ending song that is just as great as the previous one.\n\nThat leaves the gameplay. And Valve are incredibly good at singleplayer gameplay. This game is no exception. Puzzles are never too hard or too easy. You will understand what you did and how the puzzle was solved each and every time. The new gameplay elements work exceptionally well. Sure, each part on its own is rather simple. But that's how a good puzzle game should work. Each piece is simple, yet the puzzles keep on using them in new and interesting ways. One key aspect is how each puzzle element integrates with the core gameplay, the portal gun. Every single element works marvelously with the portal gun. You never feel as if the game has forgotten its core.\n\nThe coop is well worth playing, it's a major part of the content and is an excellent experience. The coop may be a different experience, but that's exactly what it needs to be. You are playing with another human being and the game wisely understands this, knowing how to adapt to not having your full attention at all times. But at the same time it knows what to keep. The puzzles are just as good as in singleplayer and fully take advantage of the existence of two players.\n\nThe built in level editor is a nice feature and is no mere extra. It is not a perfect replacement for Hammer (which is free anyway), but it offers all the tools a normal level author needs. You can't do every trick, but it trades the most advanced features of Hammer for ease of use. Hammer has a lot of flexibility that makes it troublesome to produce stellar results. The level editor on the other hand makes it impossible to make many common mistakes in hammer and makes it easy to produce a great result.\n\nOverall, this game is exceptionally great and is a must play.","timestamp_created":1468364835,"timestamp_updated":1468364835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24283623","author":{"steamid":"76561198052374209","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":554,"last_played":1468360370},"language":"english","review":"Funny and entertaining, a bit short though","timestamp_created":1468361029,"timestamp_updated":1468361029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24282404","author":{"steamid":"76561198103907408","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":785,"last_played":1628856859},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego me ha alegrado la vida <<3 :p2wheatley:","timestamp_created":1468356733,"timestamp_updated":1468356733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24281098","author":{"steamid":"76561198218593777","num_games_owned":570,"num_reviews":97,"playtime_forever":6504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3952,"last_played":1641366510},"language":"english","review":"Look at my hours logged.
