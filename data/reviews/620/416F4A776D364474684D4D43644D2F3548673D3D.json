This is what makes it so great, and why I play it.","timestamp_created":1387510593,"timestamp_updated":1387510593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8130905","author":{"steamid":"76561198011132642","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2536,"last_played":1373790981},"language":"english","review":"fun","timestamp_created":1387508374,"timestamp_updated":1387508374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8129688","author":{"steamid":"76561198032528085","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":103,"last_played":1373906772},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo diferente.

I do recommend that you play the first one in order to fully understand the whole story and for you to be familiar with the concept of Portals ^_^\n\nYou play as Chell, a mute girl that just does what she does :/ I seriously don't know what's going on in her head xD anyways, you wake up in a room years and years after the events of Portal and the adventure starts there.... Let the testing begin >:) \n\nStory is well-driven and easy to follow. Although the game features more/less 5 characters (including Cave Johnson and Caroline). They're so lively and have their own iconic personalities, Wheatley is awesome :D You'll never get bored of the dark humor continuously thrown at you xD I have to say that the story is a bit short compared to their flagship game, Half-Life.\n\nThe Source engine is by far my favorite. I'm playing this game at a consistent 100fps set to High/Very High.... no crashes in-game, and absolutely looks delightful (especially the lighting). It can also run very well on older systems, which is always a plus for me ^_^ Music is what you'd expect from Valve....... just pure awesomeness, nuff said xD \n\nGameplay is the same as the first game. It's not a generic shoot-everything-that-moves FPS but a puzzle-solving FPS that involves Portals and require you to have a keen observation on your surroundings and lots of thinking. I honestly was stuck on a puzzle for a good 20-mins. until I went \"Ohhhhh, now I get it\" and proceed to finish the test chamber xD It stands out because of its one-of-a-kind gameplay and does it extremely well ;)\n\nOverall Experience: I have yet to try out the co-op mode, but the single-player campaign left me wanting more. That feeling you get after solving a test chamber is quite awesome ^_^ and doing it again, but faster, feels even more rewarding. Although I have problems launching the game (It just might be my Steam client) the game itself runs incredibly smooth. I give this game two-thumbs up ;)","timestamp_created":1387437294,"timestamp_updated":1387437294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":47,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.737690150737762451","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm6DthMMCdM/5Hg=="}
