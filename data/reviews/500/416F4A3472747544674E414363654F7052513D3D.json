в четвертом сейчас считается одним из самых популярных, и не многие знают то что про родитель этого явления это именно эта игра, за что ей большой респект, она показала нам как должны выглядеть игры в коопе где нужно постоянно друг другу помогать и выживать вместе. И обо всем по порядку.... Игра встречает вас прекрасным вступительным роликом где показаны все, возможности и сюжет, а вот дальнейшие действия уже будут в самом геймплее и так нам на выбор дают разные пути к спасению от самого быстрого и легкого до самого сложного и атмосферного, то есть вызов. Играть лучше вместе с друзьями, и это не убивает атмосферу совершенно, по тому что в некоторых моментах приходится в микрофон говорить даже шепотом, что ПРЕКРАСНО. Так что с атмосферой в игре все более чем прекрасно, враги делятся на несколько типов, это тупые, но многочисленные зомби и умные мутанты зомби коль их несколько видов и каждый опасен по своему. Так же в игре проработаны голосовые команды, сами персонажи который выделяется ярким характером и вообще игра ОЧЕНЬ проработанная. Так же в игре есть куча режимов где можно поиграть и за самих зомби. РЕКОМЕНДУЮ не играть на легком уровне сложности, так как это не интересно, даже если с вами не играют друзья.

L4D is a great squad based shooter that gets even more fanatic with the more people you play with. The graphics, as well as the cues from some of the stronger characters in the game, always gives the quessy feeling wondering whats around the corner. I love this game, but its hard for me to recommend over it's sequal and expansion back, since the expansion leaves you play the original game with melee weapons and the newer monsters.
