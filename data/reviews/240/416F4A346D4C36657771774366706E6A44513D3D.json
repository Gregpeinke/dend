No rewards for killstreaks. \n\nThe core maps are superbly balanced, yet community maps add endless variety. \n\nNo other game comes close for team based play.  Playing 5 v 5 with a great team against a great team is one of my all time gaming pleasures. \n\nSteam was the first to get 'friends' lists right, and CS was the first game to get voice chat right. It is so easy to drop into a game with your friends, and so easy to make friends in game. The game can be very social if you find the right servers.\n\nIf you are in any doubt about how much I love CS, look at the amount of hours I sunk into it. Then consider that gameplay data wasn't recorded until a few years after the game was originally release. I couldn't tell you how much I played in those first few years. \n\nThat's also the one potential negative to the game, of course - it can become a timesink if you let it.","timestamp_created":1292732699,"timestamp_updated":1400590290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1919448","author":{"steamid":"76561197999731523","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":40378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40102,"last_played":1647250365},"language":"english","review":"Just one of the best games you can get to play online.
