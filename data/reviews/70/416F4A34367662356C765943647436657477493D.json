I never played Half-Life before, so one day I decided to fire it up and play because it has a decent modding community. Instead of replaying the same classic Doom mods over and over again forever. This was a fun 90’s cinematic first person shooter. It’s not as “cinematic” as other shooters are today like Call of Duty but it is 90’s FPS cinematic. Unlike some of my favorite FPS games which have little to no story at all focusing entirely on gameplay.\n\nThe games story is primarily focused on a scientist named Gordan Freeman who needs to deal with a group of interdimensional aliens attacking a research facility called Black Mesa after they accidentally open a portal connecting their dimension to earth. From there things take a turn and become more and more complicated.\n\nSLIGHT SPOILERS - [spoiler]At first it's just the scientists, security guards, and fighting off the aliens. Then the military shows up, it turns out that they were there to help cover up the experiments at the Black Mesa research facility. And by cover up I mean destroy any traces of the project by killing the aliens and the facilities guards and staff which includes you. You need to fight them off as much as you need to fight off the aliens. You fight your way through the facility dealing with soldiers and aliens as you go and the whole time there’s some mysterious man in a suit wandering the facility. You eventually go to the alien home world and kill the alien leader. It ends on a cliffhanger for Half-Life 2 where that mysterious man (whose nickname is The G-Man) hires you for a job by putting Freeman in stasis until the second game.[/spoiler]\n\nAlthough the story isn’t why this game is popular. The games community wouldn't become lore nuts until Half-Life 2. Because the story isn’t all that special. This game was famous at the time because of its focus on realism. Half-Life came out in 1998 before that the most popular FPS game was Doom that was released in 1993. In Doom you go to a few different locations but none of the environments felt like real spaces. They felt like geometry that was hastily slapped together to somewhat imitate a real space. But prioritizing giving the players a fun playground to shoot their way through. In Half-Life the Black Mesa Research Facility feels like a real space. Unlike the starting military base in Doom for instance I can actually picture someone coming to work there. Another example is pickups, in Doom pickup items such as health and guns would float about an inch or two above the ground. In Half-Life ammo and health kits will be sitting on tables and shelves instead to make it more immersive. One more example is the story, like I said Half-Life is a cinematic first person shooter. Having a cohesive story in a FPS was new at the time. With Doom having next to no story at all.\n\nUsually when I hear someone say “You should play this game from the 90’s it was revolutionary for its time because of the graphics” I cringe. Because 90’s games had this weird thing where they were prioritizing making the whole thing look good over making it play well. As opposed to the original Doom which looks kind of ugly without modding it at least, but still plays very well. (Although that's probably subjective) One example that I like to use to make this point is Shenmue, a game that was famous for its time for looking good that looks terrible by today's standards. The gameplay isn’t very good either, because it’s just you doing a series of mundane chores and errands for the townspeople. The only reason why that game still gets so much praise today is because the people who played it years ago on the Dreamcast have nostalgia goggles on. It's the same for a lot of older games too and I appreciate that era of gaming because it helped bring the gaming medium into a league of its own. Computer games started to be something for everyone instead of just being a niche hobby for kids.\n\nBut it also means that a lot of older games didn’t age all that well thanks to improved technology. I think that may be why I never played Half-Life until now because I thought it would probably be a product of its time thanks to its focus on realism and in some ways it is. You can definitely tell that the game was made in the 1990’s but overall it's still a solid first person shooter. The beginning of the game starts out as a bit of a survival horror game with Gordan Freeman being armed with only a pistol and his famous and trusty crowbar. But eventually you get more weapons such as a shotgun, an assault rifle, and grenades. From there the game focuses on action shooting, platforming, and some light puzzle solving.\n\nThe shooting feels half-good. What I mean by that is that the guns you get are pretty decent and feel good to fire. You do get quite a few different weapons by the end of the game, 14 to be exact. But the guns I used the most were the MP5 submachine gun with an under barrel grenade launcher, the assault shotgun, and the colt python .357 magnum. Side note, I didn’t know you could mount an M203 grenade launcher on an MP5 SMG. The more you know I guess ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThe other half of the shooting isn’t that good. Most of the enemies will be using projectile weapons and most of the time if one of them starts shooting at you they WILL hit you unless there’s some cover between you and them. Basically if you can't see them they can't shoot you and if you can then they can. No amount of tactics or strafing side to side will stop every bullet from hitting you. (Not all the enemies use “bullets” but you get what I’m saying) Some of the levels drag out for a little too long and the last few levels weren't all that good because of a massive difficulty spike. Also there’s quite a bit of platforming and I don’t like platforming in FPS games and I know I’m not alone in this. The AI was probably good for its time but by today's standards not so much. There’s some sections where the player needs to escort an NPC somewhere usually to unlock a door and the path finding is terrible. There’s a reason that what's seen as the gold standard for AI in an FPS game is F.E.A.R not Half-Life.\n\nThis was a fun game despite the age and rust. You can even bring the game up to a modern resolution thanks to Valve updates on Steam. Pro tip! When you first boot up the game go into the options menu and go to video. Then select \"Widescreen\" and \"1080 x 720\" Then go to mouse and disable auto-aim. The audio balancing could use some tweaking too. Go into the audio tab, turn MP3s up to maximum, and turn Sound Effects down a tic. It can be hard to hear characters talk thanks to the old and scratchy audio. Which is a problem in a story driven game with so subtitles.\n\nHalf-Life mixed up its enemy variety, weapon variety, and location variety in a way that gives it some really good pacing. Enough to keep me playing from start to finish and I enjoyed it enough that I can see myself playing it again in the future. Even though I still didn’t like it as much as classic Doom. I can’t wait to dive into the modding community for this game but first I have some expansion packs to play first, GG.","timestamp_created":1607244510,"timestamp_updated":1607244510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81710284","author":{"steamid":"76561199074694536","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":57,"last_played":1654329718},"language":"turkish","review":"Öncelikle bu oyun hikaye oyunlarının en iyisi ve ilk örneğidir.

someone who has never played any of the Half-Life titles, the very positive rating on Steam and the praise for the series online gave me very high expectations for this game, and I'm afraid I was a bit disappointed.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there was lots I did like about the game. I found the story and universe to be excellent, and the mechanics were quite fun, for the most part. It was very exciting to find and use new weapons, especially as they moved farther and farther away from traditional weaponry. The game also had a lot of good level design, and there were lots of areas with multiple paths and lots of secrets, which was pretty cool.\n\nThere were a number of issues that prevent me from recommending this title though:\n[list]\n\t[*]The visuals in this game are extremely dated. Textures are low quality, models are very blocky and have low detail, and the UI is small and hard to see. This alone didn't ruin the experience for me as I knew this would be the case going in, but they still leave a lot to be desired.\n\t[*]The momentum in this game was very frustrating and took almost the entirety of the game to get used to. You accelerate very quickly, and all of the movement feels as though it's on ice, as you continue to slide after releasing the keys. Given that there is a fair amount of platforming required in this game, this was pretty infuriating, and I often found myself sliding all over the place.\n\t[*]The game is pretty punishing. It's very easy to take damage very quickly, and it often seems a bit too unforgiving. The explosion radius is often much larger than it looks, and explosions do a lot of damage. Additionally, falls that seem harmless do a surprising amount of damage, and it is very easy to get killed by fall damage (which makes the previous point about the momentum worse as well). There were also a number of areas which contained hidden enemies or dangers that were very difficult to avoid, which made it feel like mandatory damage.\n\t[*]Most of the levels were very well designed and I had no issues, but I wasn't a huge fan of the ending of the game. I found it too difficult to determine what I should be doing or where I should be going. Based on what I've seen elsewhere though, the final chapters are generally considered to be the worst part of the game.\n[/list]\n\nI must give this game the credit it is due. When it came out, it was very revolutionary, and it had a huge influence on many of the games we play today. However, it hasn't aged well, and the outdated visuals, the frustrating momentum, and very unforgiving nature of the game make it difficult for me to recommend. If you're picking it up for nostalgia or you'd like to play a piece of gaming history, then I'd say go ahead, but I wouldn't recommend this title otherwise.","timestamp_created":1607153321,"timestamp_updated":1607153321,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.451127827167510986","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81641347","author":{"steamid":"76561198109692504","num_games_owned":568,"num_reviews":138,"playtime_forever":488,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":126,"last_played":1607447793},"language":"english","review":"I

es sin duda, uno de los FPS más entretenidos de la historia de los videojuegos, es un juego que marcó un antes y un después junto con Doom (1993).\nEs un juego con una muy buena historia, que tiene la fortuna de tener una secuela mejor que la primera, cosa que es muy interesante, ya que las secuelas de algunos videojuegos, tienden a repetir la fórmula del primero, pero no le añaden mucho a la historia.\nEl juego funciona prácticamente en cualquier PC, sea Gama Alta, Media o Baja, también en PC escolares.\nLa jugabilidad es lo mismo que todos los FPS, salvo que aquí tenemos un gran arsenal de armas, que nos van dando, mientras la historia va progresando.\nLas armas tienen sus Pros, como sus Contras.\nLos enemigos van de dificultad, hay algunos que mueren de un par de disparos, y otros que necesitas 3 cargas de una Bazooka.\nEs un juego lineal, pero tiene unos puzzles muy bien pensados, la he pasado mal en algunos capitulos.\nEn cuanto al protagonista [u]Gordon Freeman[/u], pues no

Half-Life does a wonderful job of immersing the player inside of the game's universe, it doesn't bombard you with exposition and it doesn't hold your hand throughout your journey. All of the information is given to you organically through different characters talking directly to you or talking among their piers. The world building also helps make the world feel most expansive by giving the player multiple glimpses into the world beyond what the player can physically see in the game. A massive strength this game has is it's ability to tell the player what to do without literally having to tell them what to do. There is never a time where the player should feel confused on how to progress, because each puzzle or conflict is expertly crafted so that the player can figure out  what they are suppose to do by themselves based on clues in the environment. Also Gordon Freeman is hot. But the icing on the cake for me was that Half-Life has a \n\nPretty decent correlation to Minecraft; the best game ever made.\n\n-- THIS GAME HAVE GUN!!! guns are totally #evil \n-- You are unable to place blocks in this game so can not make house\n\n- Can break windows but not break blocks like in minecraft\n- No crafting system\n- smells\n\n+ Zombies just like in minecraft\n+ game looks like crap because old but minecraft looks like old game pixilated so it looks like minecraft\n+ get to kill people (just like how you can kill villagers)\n+ hot main character, steve is hot, freeman is hot. say no more\n+ game is old as flip older than my mom even (not reallly) so this game cant be a minecraft ripoff\n+ Title Half-Life has an \"A\" in the title.
