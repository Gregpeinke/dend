The gunplay is very average. Some guns have some nice kick and decent variety, but I never was extremely entertained by the combat. Also, the looting system left me searching every nook for lockpicks and money fearing that without the upgrades I'd get from these I'd be helpless in later combat. That distracted too much from the narrative and prevented me from truely enjoying the story to its fullest potential.\n\nThe city is beautifully designed and creates a visual representation of the extreme contrast between the rich and the poor in the Guilded Age, the time following the American Civil War up to the early 1910s. Rich parts of town look bright and beautiful while the ghettos are run down and dark.\n\nThe story and characters of Bioshock Infinite may be its greatest achievement after its art style. While the story kept me engaged for almost the whole game, the last few hours or so of the story became very odd. I was very disappointed, and I was hoping for a simpler resolution than the grand drama the last few hours became. Also, there are far too many plot twists. I started feeling like the game was trying to hard to draw itself out. Overall, the story is worth experiencing despite its flaws.\n\nWhile Bioshock Infinite's mechanics and ending detract from its engaging plot and aesthetic, Bioshock Infinite is still a brilliant narrative driven game that is a joy to experience.","timestamp_created":1419986947,"timestamp_updated":1419988732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13726246","author":{"steamid":"76561198055665033","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1965,"last_played":1460766588},"language":"english","review":"Definetly one of the best games I have ever played; buy everything, the DLCs, the collectables, you will definitly love it!","timestamp_created":1419985788,"timestamp_updated":1419985788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13726179","author":{"steamid":"76561197995733143","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":686,"last_played":1418656757},"language":"english","review":"Good game Good Story Not any playable parts that where shown in E3  2k false advertising","timestamp_created":1419985582,"timestamp_updated":1419985582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13724783","author":{"steamid":"76561198054210904","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1592,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1561,"last_played":1419996367},"language":"english","review":"Top 5 games that I love.

The intro to the game also makes the world feel lived-in and real.\n\nThe combat, while simple enough, was still very fun. Vigors, which replace plasmids from the previous bioshock games, can have fun uses. My personal favourite was the \"murder of crows\", where you send a flock of crows to attack and distract enemies, allowing you to finish them off while they are busy. Others were hurling fire bombs, electrocuting enemies, possessing enemies and machines to help you, etc. The guns are the ones you would expect; machine gun, rifle, shotgun, all of that. Though I must say I got a little bored of the gameplay in the final hours, it never really changes up that much. But that was only a slight falter of an otherwise fun game.\n\nAnother thing I had a problem with was that the sky-hook, which was a tool that allowed you to grab on to rails in the sky and fly around shooting enemies, was a little underused. I felt that it should have had more emphasis because I found it enjoyable. There was also one \"boss\" who was kinda overused... The fight started off very interesting, but you have to fight them three times within I'd say an hour... It runs a little dry. But that was only one hiccup throughout the game.\n\nSome people do say that the gameplay is quite \"dumbed down\" from the original bioshock games, but I actually havent played them, so I can't comment on that.\n\nNow the story... As I said, I had a friend tell me that it just wasn't possible in any way, that it couldn't link up to be made possible. Now I didn't see any problem with it, but maybe that's just me. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it and had a great time cruising through Columbia with Elizabeth. So maybe it's just a matter of opinion.\n\nOverall, it was a very enjoyable game, and I would definitely play it again, if just to see Columbia and Elizabeth again.","timestamp_created":1419975851,"timestamp_updated":1419976027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13723048","author":{"steamid":"76561198080979020","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":482,"last_played":1402170970},"language":"brazilian","review":"Ótimo jogo, bom plot, dificuldade razoavel.

Uma história complexa que te prende do começo ao fim, nada nela é previsível e ela te deixa perplexo. O jogo não possui cutscenes, tudo é jogado no ar durante o gameplay e é necessário que o jogador esteja realmente dentro do game, prestando atenção em cada detalhe pois se você distrair por um momento é quase certo de perder o fio da meada. Muita coisa é explicado através de voxofones que ficam espalhados no mapa, em falas do npcs de Columbia, em coisas que certamente podem passar desapercebidas, então esteja ligado o jogo inteiro para não perder nada pois a história é linda e fantástica. E é quase certo que você irá finaliza-lo mais de uma vez para entender bem a história ou por puro prazer. \n\nA jogabilidade é muito boa. Combina muito bem com o jogo e com o mapa, é fácil de jogar e bem agradável.\n\nO cenário de Infinite é deslumbrante. O game se passa em Columbia, uma cidade flutuante e diferente de tudo que você ja viu. A cada lugar você ve algo diferente, algo que lhe transmite uma mensagem, NPC's com uma IA excelente conversando sobre algo, é realmente fantástico.\n\nA trilha sonora é linda. Encaixa perfeitamente com os momentos do jogo e em vários instantes você se depara com músicas da época em que se passa Infinite (1912). Alem de haver composições originais da época, existem \"regravações\" de músicas mais novas para se parecerem \"mais velhas\". Aqui tem um exemplo disso:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQheaCpjH0I\n\nO game contem vários níveis de dificuldade, desde easy até o modo 1999. Cada nível corresponde bem, jogar no fácil realmente é fácil, e jogar no modo 1999 é bem desafiador.\n\nOs personagens são todos muito bem trabalhados. Todos tem sua própria caracteristica. E não posso deixar de citar Elizabeth, ela é incrivel e apaixonante.\n\nEm relação as DLC's Burial at Sea ep. 1 e 2, elas são realmente fabulosas. Voltar a cidade de Rapture foi algo estupendo. Eu diria que é obrigatório para qualquer um que gosta de Bioshock joga-las. Se Bioshock Infinite era apenas uma \"história paralela\" em relação à Bioshock 1 e 2, Burial at Sea simplesmente desfaz isso e junta as duas histórias de maneira memorável. \n\nBioshock Infinite + Burial at Sea (na verdade a franquia toda) é de fato uma das melhores experiencias que já tive nos videogames. Recomendo fortemente.\n\nMASTERPIECE.","timestamp_created":1419957148,"timestamp_updated":1575817754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":60,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.813959777355194092","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13715828","author":{"steamid":"76561198064523395","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":687,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":687,"last_played":1419804848},"language":"english","review":"THISGAMEISGREAT\n...and a little weird but it is a really fun game.","timestamp_created":1419956078,"timestamp_updated":1419956078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13715219","author":{"steamid":"76561198062165805","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":789,"last_played":1514665466},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock: Infiinte has a great story, and it's not entirely necessary to play the previous titles in the series to enjoy this one.
