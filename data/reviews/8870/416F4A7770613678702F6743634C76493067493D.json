It's better than those, but it does have some of the same problems those games had. The world is way more interesting than the actual game. Gameplay often feels tedious, like everything you do is just wasting your time and deliberately dragging out a story that should be moving faster. Enemies keep teleporting/appearing/dropping directly behind you. The narrative is heavily reliant on trying to make you feel remorse for decisions you \"made\", which either happened before the game began, or where you were forced to make because the story is entirely linear, so the impact isn't really there, like showing up to the first day of a job and having people try to blame you for stuff that happened months ago. My main takeaway is the same as from Bioshock 1 and 2. The writers aren't as deep as they think they are, and this would make a way more interesting mockumentary than it does a game.","timestamp_created":1616470312,"timestamp_updated":1616470312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88922438","author":{"steamid":"76561199019898513","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1816,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1816,"last_played":1616442737},"language":"spanish","review":"MUY

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD.

juego es un 10. Para empezar está la jugabilidad, que si bien no deja de ser un shooter, tiene los vigorizadores, que te permiten experimentar un montón y afrontar a los enemigos de diferentes formas. Además, pueden ser mejorados, al igual que las armas, y las sales, que son lo que los vigorizadores consumen. También hay ciertos objetos que te dan ventajas al hacer ciertas cosas. En eso el juego es muy divertido y cumple con creces.\nEn cuanto a la historia, no se queda atrás, dejándome con la boca abierta con cada giro de trama, especialmente su final. Con la piel de gallina. Tanto es así que seguro que vas a necesitar pasarte el juego al menos una segunda vez para entender todo y al hacerlo te darás cuenta de que te lo estaban dejando caer desde un principio, y no te diste ni cuenta. \nLos personajes son también un punto fuerte de este juego, siendo Elizabeth, nuestra compañera y protagonista junto a Booker, la que mas destaca. Durante el juego, ella puede encontrar munición, sales, botiquines, dinero, y puede traer aliados y construcciones, como ganchos en el techo con los que acceder a terreno elevado, coberturas, cajas de munición y salud al querer. Y para mi sorpresa la primera vez que jugué, no hace falta protegerla durante el combate, porque se queda a un lado y los enemigos no la atacan. Además es un encanto, y el elemento más importante de la historia.\nLa música es sencillamente hermosa y se ajusta de maravilla a la situación. Aquí no hay mucho que decir, simplemente escúchala y verás a qué me refiero.\nLos gráficos son muy buenos, y aunque es cierto que si vas al detalle y miras de cerca los objetos, puedes ver que no están muy bien detallados, este juego consigue que funcionen en conjunto y sea impresionante. No es tanto lo gráfico sinó los recursos que usa los que hacen que se vea tan hermoso. Es una maravilla visual, por mucho que no tenga gráficos de ultima generación y esas mi*rdas. \nEn cuanto a la dificultad, recomiendo empezarlo en difícil, porque la facil no la he probado pero la normal sí y si juegas a otros shooters de forma habitual, no va a tener mucha complicación. Y después está el modo 1999, que es ya otra cosa. Sigue sin ser demencial, porque me lo pasé al día siguiente de terminar en dificil, pero es un reto que recomiendo mucho. Se hubiera agradecido un modo +, que te permitiera iniciar una partida nueva con el dinero y mejoras de la última, pero eso hubiese hecho el juego demasiado fácil.\nLa duración del juego no decepciona. Es lo suficientemente larga para que valga la pena los 30€ que te has gastado en esta perlita. Antes he dicho que me pasé el juego en su máxima dificultad, al dia siguiente de terminarlo en difícil pero eso no significa mucho, porque era la tercera vez en una semana, y no jugaba a otra cosa desde que empecé(y así sigo), además ya sabía donde tenía que ir y intenté pasarmelo en el mínimo tiempo posible. La primera vez que juegues seguro que tardas mas de 10 horas, si no intentas recoger todos los coleccionables, claro.\n\nEste juego no creo que te decepcione. A mí me ha encantado, es más, ahora es mi juego favorito de entre todos los que he jugado en mi vida. Quizás tu juegues y no lo veas igual, pero no se puede decir que no es un juegazo.

The difficulty of the game can sometimes be inconsistent, you will find you can beat a good chunk of the game without any troubles, but have a few encounters where it really ramps up.\n\nThe story is a total mindfuck where i'm still trying to make sense of it, but I feel like it was well worth it to put in the time to get to the ending. The game doesn't make much sense when you're going through it, you might wonder how everything works, but there's a lot of contextual clues and hidden lore in audio tapes to piece some things together. The ending will make sense of the game, but at the same time may not, I personally looked up some ending analysis to make sense of it (not a fault of the game.. just a mindfuck of a story and my smooth brain).","timestamp_created":1616232041,"timestamp_updated":1616239128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88754513","author":{"steamid":"76561198273546994","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":922,"last_played":1616686470},"language":"thai","review":"AAAAAAAA","timestamp_created":1616231717,"timestamp_updated":1616231717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88753843","author":{"steamid":"76561198842577566","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":620,"last_played":1611932867},"language":"turkish","review":"Mükemmel bir oyun, zengin bir hikayesi var.","timestamp_created":1616230574,"timestamp_updated":1616230574,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88753072","author":{"steamid":"76561198085111236","num_games_owned":256,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":1151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1021,"last_played":1616366106},"language":"spanish","review":"INCREIBLE, NADA MAS QUE DECIR, ME TERMINE EL 2DO DLC A LAS 5:30 DE LA MAÑANA Y TENGO TODA LA MESA CHORRIADA DE SEMEN, NO ME PUEDE AGUANTAR, QUE MARAVILLA DE JUEGO, OJALA PERDER LA MEMORIA Y JUGARME TODA LA SAGA ENTERA OTRA VEZ, QUE PUTO DISFRUTE SEÑORES","timestamp_created":1616229266,"timestamp_updated":1616229266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpa6xp/gCcLvI0gI="}
