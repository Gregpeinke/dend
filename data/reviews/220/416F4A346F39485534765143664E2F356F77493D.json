Some puzzles were getting too repetitive and enemies where you hold the door or elevator usually come in waves. I also didn't like some of the early level stuff, especially the 4-wheel driving part and the scooter part. Those were getting old quite fast, Go to the enemy camp -> open the gate -> go to the next camp, on repeat.\n\nThe story was a cliche but pretty good, I like the character writing and the drama tension was perfect.\n\nOverall, the game was designed very nicely, I can see how it has a community of fans that like these series, I can also see this title inspiring other newer titles, since in 2004 this must have been awesome hit.\n\nI was looking for something like Ghost In The Shell, but I was looking for a video game. I would say this is a little more darker, reminds me a lot of different good games I enjoyed that were similar genre. This game is about beating tyranny and horrors of fascist regime, and how manipulation is lying to the public which is already held prisoners in camps like cattle.\n\nI got exactly what I was looking for.

Je l'ai fait ! Difficile de se réclamer d'être un joueur PC lorsqu'on a jamais joué et/ou terminé Half-Life 2. Des années, je vous dis, que l'on me tance pour ne pas l'avoir essayé ! Terminé ! Je suis un homme libre et insoumis ! 2017 est l'année de toutes les repentances, il faut s'y habituer. Entre celle de notre cher pays acculé de tous côtés par des repentances multiples et variées envers son histoire et toutes les minorités ethniques ou sociales puis celle de votre bon vieux Silaxe. Personnellement, il est plus sain de se soumettre aux classiques des jeux PC... Après chacun fait comme il veut de toute façon notre vieille nation est foutue, l'Europe avec. Bienvenue l'Afrique. Mais ne changeons pas trop vite de sujet, Gordon Freeman, le célèbre, l'unique, lui, refuse ostensiblement d'accueillir les hordes d'extraterrestre et le régime totalitaire écrasant mis en place dans Cité 17.\n\nLe scénario est banal. Il s'agit du classique complot intergalactique entre une société privée humaine alliant science et force militaire avec des extraterrestres promettant mondes et merveilles à la dite société. Un petit peu de transhumanisme aussi. Rien d'original, Prey l'a déjà fait, Perfect Dark aussi. J'en passe et des meilleurs. Ce qui frappe en revanche, c'est plutôt la mise en scène très caractéristique de la licence : dénuement total d'information, un personnage muet, de longs moments de silence ponctués de musiques envoûtantes (souvent très courtes) et pas de cinématique car tout se passe à travers vos yeux. Gros coup de cœur pour la musique qui accompagne le moment où Freeman récupère la combinaison HEV puisque c'est celle que l'on entend au démarrage des jeux Valve (Cs:GO ; Left 4 Dead etc.). Du bonheur !\n\nCôté technique, franchement il n'y a rien à dire. Malgré les treize années passées depuis sa sortie en 2004, le moteur Source parvient encore à faire des merveilles. C'est joli (visages, détails, variétés des éléments du décors), les lumières sont très bien gérées, la capacité d'attraper tout et n'importe quoi ne surprend plus mais fonctionne encore d'un point de vue ludique. Tout n'est pas rose non plus. De près les textures sont baveuses, les niveaux se ressemblent beaucoup. Disons que l'univers citadin est surexploité, un peu dommage. Cependant, le dernier niveau dans la tour vient adoucir cette impression. J'ai beaucoup apprécie la phase dans le rail où l'on devient subitement simple observateur. Cela rappelle évidemment l'introduction d'Half-Life premier du nom, mais quelle maîtrise ! On se sent tout de suite concerné. Beaucoup de choses sont dites dans ce jeu de manière implicite, voilà pourquoi Half-Life 2 reste une expérience hors du commun pour de nombreux joueurs nostalgiques d'autant plus si on se remet dans le contexte de la sortie.\n\nLe gameplay est une tuerie. Voilà. Qu'est ce que je peux dire de plus ? Simple, intuitif, maîtrisé de A à Z. À l'ancienne quoi ! Gameplay qui est servi d'ailleurs par un level design très bien conçu. Le seul petit bémol, c'est peut-être la propension à glisser sur place que peut avoir votre personnage. Oui, Freeman dans certaines phases de sauts glisse, dérape un peu comme s'il avait des rollers aux pieds. Sinon les armes ont une excellente prise en main mais je reste un peu déçu du nombre très limité de jouets disponibles (une dizaine). Ce reproche est valable également pour les ennemis, vous affronterez les mêmes du début à la fin (et qui étaient pour la plupart déjà dans le premier jeu). Bon, rien de méchant car l'aventure se boucle en une petite quinzaine d'heures donc on n'a pas vraiment le temps de s'en agacer. En plus le pistolet à gravité permet de varier les plaisirs et d'abattre les ennemis avec panache et originalité surtout lorsqu'on reçoit sa version améliorée dans le segment final. Enfin, jouer à Half-life 2 a posteriori est un avantage intéressant car on s'aperçoit au cours de l'aventure qu'une multitude de références aux futurs jeux sont déjà implémentées (Cs: Source, Portal notamment).\n\nHalf-Life 2 est un classique du FPS sur PC, passer à côté est un sacrilège pur et simple. C'est un peu comme se réclamer d'être amateur de philosophie et de n'avoir jamais lu Platon. Ou comme vivre grassement de ce qu'un pays peut vous offrir depuis des décennies (sécurité, emploi, loisir, liberté, histoire commune, beauté géographique, gastronomie riche et variée) et cracher dessus à longueur d'année et ne pas avoir la décence (les couilles ?) de partir vivre dans le tiers monde (là où les gens sont mieux et moins racistes paraît-il). Vous passez pour un immense tocard, un lâche opportuniste sans le savoir. Personnellement, j'avais une excuse, quand j'étais môme je n'avais pas d'ordinateur mais uniquement des consoles. Aujourd'hui j'ai, en quelque sorte, combattu certains déterminismes sociologiques. J'aurais pu brûler des voitures et crier \"nique le Congo\" mais je ne l'ai pas fait. Allez savoir... La résistance s'organise. Je recommande très fortement. Zou !

The stakes felt high, and even though the story was somewhat disappointing, I liked that it was much more fleshed out than the first game. The gravity gun was quite fun to use. While they're nothing to gawk at today, the graphics were quite impressive for 2004 and I like the design of the combine soldiers.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nI really don't see the hype surrounding this game. People say it's the greatest game of all time or the greatest single player FPS of all time. I don't even think it's the best half life game. For starters, I don't like the gameplay as much as the original half life. Defeating enemies in the original half life felt almost puzzle like, and the enemies were a lot more interesting and varied. Valve also is overly zealous with their use of physics based puzzles, some of which worked poorly. Don't even get me started on this games story.
