Есть вы, и пять ваших товарищей по несчастью, есть ваша арена, и есть ОНИ - твари самых разных форм и цветов, которых и \"зомби\"-то сложно назвать. Всего десять волн, и на последок рубилово с местной Главной Сволочью - Патриархом. Вот, собственно и всё. Между волнами - крошки времени, чтобы добежать к болтливой торговке, и по-быстрому закупиться. Кто не успел - того сожрут. Но вся эта простота скрывает очень приятную игровую особенность - в неё действительно интересно играть! Да, Killing Floor - очень неоднозначная игра, и многое сделанно откровенно плохо - но это мелочи, по-сравнению с дикой динамикой и темпом игры. Killing Floor - это мясо, но мясо очень и очень сочное. Если конкретней, то:\nПлюсы.\n+Действительно хардкорно. Если вы допустили ошибку - вас сожрут. Местные голопопые вас даже и не думают жалеть - прут толпой, кусаются больно. Так что всем любителям динамичных и жарких перестрелок понравится.\n+Интересные карты. Это понимаешь не сразу, но карты действительно здоровские. Тут вам и большие, открытые пространства, и лабиринты метро, всякие лесенки, тупички, переулочки... В-общем карты очень даже не плохи.\n+Много видов врагов. Все они очень разные, и приятно страшные на лицо. Кроме обычных голозадых извращенцев, тут вам и мясники с пилами, и какие-то крикуны, ползучие жуки, невидимые девчушки, и Иннос знает, что ещё... Прут пачками, в волне может быть и сотня, и больше, и в комбинациях, получаются действительно интересные ситуации. Так что за врагов тоже плюс.\n+Атмосферно. Ну это производное от предыдущих двух пунктов. Когда вы, отбившись от отряда, трясущимися руками, будете заваривать дверь, и услышите сзади себя скрип какого-то неописуемого поганца - дрожь пробивает так, что никакому L4D и не снилось. Да и окружение впечатляет - церкви, кукурузные поля (куда ж без них), разбитые вагоны метро... \n+Много оружия. Каждый себе найдёт то, что захочет. Револьверы, винтовки, автоматы, даже огнемёты с арбалетами есть. Для эстетов - бензопилы и топоры, можно даже меч прикупить. Не менее радует, что оружие само-по себе достаточно по-разному чувствуется, так что простор для экспериментов есть. \n+Действительно увлекает и затягивает. Есть в Killing Floor что-то манящее, не смотря на все минусы. Игра интересная, но далеко не идеальная.\nМинусы.\n-Убогий интерфейс. Да, это не критично, но именно это первым бросается в глаза, и отталкивает. Первое впечатление, так сказать.\n-Графика. Да, игра уже не первой молодости, но если та же L4D ещё очень даже приятно смотрится, то Killing Floor просто рвёт наши глаза на части. Так что графолюбам в этой игре точно не место.\n-Мало командных взаимодействий. В команде целых ШЕСТЬ человек! Шесть! И при этом, взаимодействия между ними - минимум. Да, можно полечить товарища, но аптечки есть у каждого, и гораздо быстрее полечить самого себя. Да, можно отсыпать другу деньжат, на новый гранатомёт, но на этом, собственно и всё. Шесть человек в команде могут вообще не взаимодейстовать, разойтись в разные углы карты - да, игра станет сложней, но не фатально. Слаженной работы нет, и она по-сути не нужна. Обидно - игра могла бы стать действительно шедевром, если бы не это.\n-Прокачка убога. Тут и сказать нечего. Будто впендюрили в игру в последний момент, для галочки. Никакой индивидуальности персонажей, никакой нужды в разных классах игроков в одной группе.\n-Патриарх. А верней, Финальный Босс. Дело в том, что он слишком непробиваемый, неубиваемый, и вообще... Своим вооружением рвёт на части любого игрока СРАЗУ. Становится невидимым, когда ему вздумается, орёт что-то нечленораздельное, про превосходство и силу. Одним словом - вылитый мой физрук. Очень неприятный и неотбалансированный тип, битва с которым превращается в танцы с бубном, а не в тактический и слаженный бой. \n-DLC. Их много. Их ОЧЕНЬ МНОГО. Самые интересные пушки - DLC. Персонажи - DLC. Карты - DLC. Я купил расширенное издание, и даже в нём не было трёх или четырёх DLC, что уж говорить об обычной игре. Так что или играешь в урезанную Killing Floor (которая и сама по себе не идеальна), или платишь за пачку DLC, которые обходятся ДОРОЖЕ, чем сама игра. Не очень хорошее отношение к игракам, как по мне. \nЧто в итоге? Игре есть чем вас порадовать, что предложить и чем удивить - но она очень неоднозначна и не идеальна. Будьте готовы, к ощущению сырости и недоделанности, в замен на ураганный и увлекательный геймплей.
