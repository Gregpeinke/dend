Just finished a second play through years after my first play through, and I'm still incredibly impressed with this game. The gameplay itself is pretty fun, but that's not what really draws me. The true highlight is the story. The story is so captivating and complex, it'll keep you hooked and make you desire for more. It has a good mix of science fiction and action, along with a set of twists and surprises. The burial at sea dlc's top off the story nicely (though there's some overlap with bioshock 1 and you should probably play that first if you haven't). If you play the base game, I really recommend playing those dlc's.","timestamp_created":1584319723,"timestamp_updated":1584320245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65118616","author":{"steamid":"76561198356605855","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":498,"last_played":1610378839},"language":"english","review":"oi","timestamp_created":1584317918,"timestamp_updated":1584317918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65118321","author":{"steamid":"76561198348830983","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":409,"last_played":1584417399},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩，就是win10容易闪退。没办法，老游戏了，不过不太影响体验","timestamp_created":1584317410,"timestamp_updated":1584317410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65118094","author":{"steamid":"76561198931025572","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1584587756},"language":"schinese","review":"第九艺术","timestamp_created":1584317015,"timestamp_updated":1584317015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65116662","author":{"steamid":"76561198091642498","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1963,"last_played":1584314370},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom dimaissss","timestamp_created":1584314473,"timestamp_updated":1584314473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65115716","author":{"steamid":"76561198212008135","num_games_owned":324,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1584581087},"language":"english","review":"This is an awesome game. I have never played Bioshock before and went ahead and got the bundle with all 3 games and the DLC. Atmosphere is great, lots of side rooms to explore and you're somewhat rewarded for exploring a bit. Extra vials to upgrade hp/shield/salts. Also, those record player type things as well. I like to look everywhere. The games graphics are very impressive for a 2013 game - at least that's what is listed above. The movement is crisp, aiming the carbine can get kinda annoying but it'll just take practice (for me) to get used to it. I like the skills that you get, my favorite is the Crows. Enjoyable game, if you can get the bundle while it's on sale, even better. Overall, def a must buy. No idea how far I'm in the game but it feels like it wont end any time soon.

If you loved the first two games, you will get disappointed as the game lacks any depth and removed all features that could add depth and strategy to the game (no first aid kits or Eve kits, no plasmid selection, you can't even manually save your game ffs.)\n\nHonestly, the game feels like its developers wanted to make a Call of Duty game but then had to add Bioshock elements due to the title. 90% of the game consists of mindless shooting and hey, here's some plasmids that are utterly basic and boring. Cause, you know, Bioshock had plasmids, right?\n\nNow, you may wonder, does the story compensate for those at least?  Well, won't bother with the plot holes that time-travel and parallel universes will inevitably bring, let's just say that it's not one that deserves the torment of the repetitive Call of Duty action this game brings.\n\nI am all about change and honestly didn't want another game in the Rapture universe. And Columbia could be ideal for this, if it weren't for the devs deciding to make this game linear. Forget the maps and the exploration part the first two games brought, now it's all about \"go forward-shoot stuff-repeat\".\n\nWell, sorry. I tried hard to like this game but even the shooting mechanics are dull and clunky, even though the game focused on them for 90% of the game.

Its not as good as the first game but better than the second (both of which I really liked). The gameplay is really good! Its fun to traverse the map with sky hooks and zoom around on these roller coaster type rides.The gunplay is great and there are a lot of cool weapons to use. I dont care for the 2 guns at a time system but its not a huge issue. The plasmids (AKA vigors) are the best in the series. In Bioshock 1 and 2 there were tons of boring ones that were useful but not fun to use. But in this game, they have some really neat ones that allow for fun combos. And, each one can level up and get cooler stat bonuses and effects that turn them into fun combat techniques, rather than situational perks. Also, I think the enemies in this game are the best in the series! The smother gunplay makes the enemies more fun to shoot at and interact with. (although the Big daddy replacement is really bad). The story is pretty good with good characters and a very intriguing story. You want to know whats going on and whats gonna happen. The Dialogue is exceptional and some of the best moments are when you and your companion are going up elevators and they talk about stuff. You get to learn more and more about them which makes you care about them more. However, the ending is where I have a majority of my issues with the game. It does have a cool reveal but besides that its just very confusing. It has a a lot of weird explanations and you're learning so much you have to look it up later and try to find some semblance of meaning. Its not as cool to learn this mind boggling reveal from a youtuber. They also try to give some explanation for this being a Bioshock game that doesn't really work for me and it ruins the first two games. It would have been better off if they tried to disconnect itself from the Bioshock series. This game has alot of features that go against the core gameplay elements of Bioshock. But in order to get people to buy it they have to slap the name Bioshock on there and try and add random features from previous games. For example, there are the voxophones that are basically audio logs. But you have a companion with you so the voxophone can get interrupted by the companion so you have to listen to it over and over. The only reason those audio logs are in this game is because its Bioshock. I think the game would be way better off if they called it something else. \n\nEven though I bashed the game a lot. Its really fun and it isn't like my experience is ruined because I cant listen to an audio log. I still think the gameplay and story is really good (untill the end) and I give this game an 8/10 for the gameplay and a 7/10 for the story. All in all, a very fantastic game, be sure to pick it up!","timestamp_created":1584241660,"timestamp_updated":1592613562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65061779","author":{"steamid":"76561198212594195","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1170,"last_played":1638009629},"language":"english","review":"still one of the best story rich games in 2020","timestamp_created":1584241118,"timestamp_updated":1584241118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65061045","author":{"steamid":"76561198165580860","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":85,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":85,"last_played":1467176849},"language":"brazilian","review":"rapaz, é tipo os outros bishocks, mas coloriudo explode tudo mds eu não possuo cérebro pra acompanhar tudo\n10/10","timestamp_created":1584240056,"timestamp_updated":1584240056,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65060522","author":{"steamid":"76561199028826859","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":522,"last_played":1584239172},"language":"english","review":"Great story and game play.","timestamp_created":1584239214,"timestamp_updated":1584239214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65060283","author":{"steamid":"76561198842870964","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":247,"last_played":1584599007},"language":"schinese","review":"狙击配散弹简直就是男人的浪漫。\n以前打cf的跳狙不妨拿来试试，做单机里的带狙神。\n[spoiler] 谁不是csgo里的弟弟呢 [/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1584238812,"timestamp_updated":1584238812,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65059907","author":{"steamid":"76561199000243298","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":536,"last_played":1584238791},"language":"schinese","review":"NB","timestamp_created":1584238196,"timestamp_updated":1584238196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65059812","author":{"steamid":"76561198074362082","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":2282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":387,"last_played":1588022005},"language":"russian","review":"Крутая игра.","timestamp_created":1584238061,"timestamp_updated":1584238061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65058896","author":{"steamid":"76561198148563078","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":971,"last_played":1619544750},"language":"latam","review":"16 horas para una vuelta me parece poco pero, lo disfrute bastante igual que el 1 y el 2, ( 2K ) siempre se la saca cuando se trata de combinar gameplay con historia.Muy recomendado","timestamp_created":1584236563,"timestamp_updated":1584236933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65056567","author":{"steamid":"76561198813441660","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":627,"last_played":1607091004},"language":"french","review":"dommage que c'est un jeu avec une seule fin, mais bon je m'en contenterais.\nil faut vraiment aprécié la série, comme ce n'est pas le cas pour moi(même si j'ai toute la série);

And I have no doubt that the Bioshock trilogy will go down as one of the best games to be ever made along with other games such as Red Dead Redemption 2 and Witcher 3. The graphics is simply beautiful. I can't believe that the  game was developed in 2013. The plot twists are amazing. The gameplay is top notch. It may have a few minor problems with the story but a good YouTube video will answer any questions you have regarding it.\nThe characters are well written and the voice acting is top notch as well.\n\nIs it worth buying in 2020 or any time in the future? Hell yeah!!\nAre the DLC's worth buying? Definitely, as it adds content to the main storyline. You can skip the weapon DLC if you want to.\n\nAnd finally I would like to say [i][b]\"Would you kindly play this game \"[/b][/i].","timestamp_created":1584218967,"timestamp_updated":1584220316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.615445196628570557","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65045822","author":{"steamid":"76561198360267301","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":775,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":316,"last_played":1584672994},"language":"english","review":"This game shows art in the true sense","timestamp_created":1584215982,"timestamp_updated":1584215982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50940096378326416","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65044509","author":{"steamid":"76561198089001323","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1278,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":196,"last_played":1588268660},"language":"schinese","review":"分享一下日文语音简体中文字幕的方法（由于默认语言是英文，最好先在库内右键游戏属性找到语言切换为繁体中文一次，不确定是否必要）\n\n\n1，在库内右键游戏属性找到语言切换为日文即可自动下载300M的日文语音文件\n\n\n2，找到STEAM文件夹steamapps\\common\\BioShock Infinite\\XGame\\Localization，进入文件夹JPN， 删除里面全部文件，复制文件夹INT内所有文件到文件夹JPN 内\n\n\n3，将所有文件后缀由INT改为JPN（如把文件AerodromeSign.INT 改为 AerodromeSign.JPN），如果不显示后缀可在文件夹标题下方点击查看-选项-查看，把隐藏已知文件类型的后缀名打钩去掉\n方法一（不推荐）：手动改，文件太多基本不考虑\n\n方法二：在文件夹JPN内右键新建一个文本文档, 打开后复制         [b] [u] ren *.INT *.JPN [/u]  [/b]         到文档内，点击上方文件--另存为 ,在文件名一栏内把后缀改为bat（如新建文本文档.txt改为新建文本文档.bat）,保存后双击运行该bat文件即可\n\n方法三： [spoiler][noparse] https://pa删除n.ba中文idu.com/s/1YxXPjgcWOdXxB-HE2RAU8w [/noparse][/spoiler] \n下载JPN.rar，打开后将所有文件拖至文件夹JPN内\n\n\n（4，英文语音觉得繁中费眼的可搜索下载简体中文补丁，网盘内简体中文补丁需重新在STEAM内把语言改为繁体中文后解压覆盖）","timestamp_created":1584214173,"timestamp_updated":1584305474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65044177","author":{"steamid":"76561198102873755","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":81,"last_played":1585340931},"language":"italian","review":"Bellissimo...se non fosse che attualmente non funziona per MAC OS Big sur!\n\nPlease! fix it :(\n","timestamp_created":1584213731,"timestamp_updated":1650149378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65042068","author":{"steamid":"76561198287060565","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":178,"last_played":1584809225},"language":"turkish","review":"2K.
