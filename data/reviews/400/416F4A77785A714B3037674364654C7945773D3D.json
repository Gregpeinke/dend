I'm making a note here, huge success.  This is the game that became a phenomenon and portaled its way into popular culture.  \n\nThe reason for Portal's fame and success is probably that it was so original.  Non-violent, absurdly funny, moderately disturbing, and a catchy theme song at the end, it was different from most games of the time.  \n\nThe plot involved a woman waking up in a strange laboratory with a robotic voice talking her through  series of tests involving portals and physics.  At first the voice seems eager to help, but it becomes more clear with each level that something is not right at Aperture Science, and it isn't just the question of cake.  The story is not told through dialog or cutscenes, instead it unfolds by progressing through stages and what you see and hear during the game.  There is no narration, only the voice of GLaDOS as she tells you how to perform the tests.  Yet the story it tells is a fascinating and rich one.\n\nWhile the game is based on Half-Life 2's source engine, and functions like a first-person shooter, it is not a shooting game.  The point of the game is to place portals in different areas to move across rooms or gain momentum, and moving objects around to activate switches.  It is effectively a puzzle game, but plays like a modern FPS.  \n\nThe only thing wrong with this game is that it is short.  Fortunately, they made a second one to make up for it.\n\nBut look at me still talking, when there's science to do...\n\n----------\n\nOriginal Review: July 30, 2012\n\nAmazing.  This is one of the most original and intriguing games I've ever played.  If you are losing faith in the idea of modern gaming having any kind of innovation, you need to play this.  It's a short game.  It's not a partcularly hard game.  It's not a very violent shoot-em-up game...you don't even use weapons.  What you have is a puzzle game in first person, with an amazing background plot.  This game has a lot of suspense, and there reaches a point where you realize there's a lot more going on than just a few mental exercises.  It goes from pleasantly brainy to outright horrific, until the whole concept of the game unravels into a paranoid journey into Aperture Science.  One of the most involving and entertaining games of all time.  And then, after the cake, there is a sequel...","timestamp_created":1343635049,"timestamp_updated":1387237745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5077049","author":{"steamid":"76561198044811573","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":73,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":73,"last_played":1364626800},"language":"english","review":"Although short, one of the most intriguing, exciting, and mind-boggling games ever.","timestamp_created":1343612231,"timestamp_updated":1343612231,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5681161","author":{"steamid":"76561198054018206","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1559880158},"language":"english","review":"Masterpiece","timestamp_created":1343605668,"timestamp_updated":1343605668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481481492519378662","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5424280","author":{"steamid":"76561198049547054","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":406,"last_played":1633305460},"language":"english","review":"There's nothing about this game that hasn't already been said.\nIT IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER.
