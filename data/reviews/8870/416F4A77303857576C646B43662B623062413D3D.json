Also, in some things and in some concepts I may be not right.\nStory:\nThe story of this game is perfect. It´s really interesting and mind blowing, especially the ending (which makes you understand everything but it takes you a while and real thinking). When I realized why you really wanted to save Elizabeth, my mind was blown away. Which I loved about this, that Booker, never really knew the real reason for saving Elizabeth and throughout the whole game, he thinks something completely different from what it´s really happening. This game story is amazing from beginning to end but especially in the end. Everything that happens through the game, as simple as it may seem, is important to the story, For example, the coin always being head? It is important, especially to understand the whole multiverse thing. When you understand that Elizabeth is your daughter, it just shocked me so much and the next 10 minutes of the ending was gasp after gasp for me. There is so much to say about the game plot but the most important is that it is interesting, shocking and complicated (in the good way). \nGameplay: \nReally good gameplay. I loved all the skyrailing, the air attacks, the weapons of the time (that little pistol? loved it), the tear system, the movement itself and all the related to the gameplay is really good. They may be some bad things but I would need to clear my mind and think a while to find them. The enemies are awesome, especially the big ones. Fireman, handyman and a lot others, I love them. \nHistorical context:\nI don´t know why but I have always liked the first decades of the 20 century. \nThe fancy community of rich people going along the community of starving poor worker community and all the related to these years, I just love it. I think it was perfect for the game. When the fight between Daisy Fitzroy and the masses of workers and the rich community explodes, I just enjoyed it so much.\nThe kind of rugged and strong attitude of Booker and the fancy and mannered ways of Elizabeth really complement each other and they really fit into the time. I really can imagine a man like booker being the rugged guy of the time and Elizabeth the typical young lady of the time (maybe I´m completely wrong about how they really were but these two characters really fit into my image of people like them of the time)\nI love how the steam punk was introduced to the year 1912 and they complement perfectly. I also do love the zeppelins from WW1. \nCharacters: \nI´m just going to the most important ones, being Booker, Elizabeth, Comstock and the Lutece twins. \nElizabeth: I liked the character from the first moment it appears but as the game progressed I loved her even more and now if can say it must be one of my favorite characters, in all games I have played. How she changes from an innocent girl to this deadly and corrupted woman it´s really impressive but you can realize that she always keep this strength she had. Before being corrupted by killing Daisy, she is strong anyway and she demonstrates it a couple of times and you can see that that strength is still there after she kills Daisy but is showed in different ways. Elizabeth is such a good character and I really like her.\nBooker: I really don´t know what to say about this character but it is great. I really love his strong attitude and how he never loses his control (except for a couple times). They were so much situations to make him lose control but he just didn´t. I really like Booker character. \nComstock: This is one of the few things that isn´t amazing about this game. Whenever I watch a series, play a game, see a movie, etc, I always look forward to a great antagonist or villain. Even though Comstock isn´t a bad villain or antagonist, I don´t think it´s an amazing one. The thing about this, is that I think that he doesn´t really stand out like this really great antagonist. At least the character itself. Even though the character isn´t amazing in my opinion, it´s great how it relates to Booker. The fact that Booker and Comstock are the same person, but with a different decision in their lives, it´s amazing. Both being the same person but in different universes. The relation to Booker, it´s what I think make this character great. \nRobert and Rosalind Lutece: “Lived, lives, will live. Died, dies, will die”. These two characters are just amazing. Even though they don´t appear much time as other, they really make their selves shine in the time they have. The fact each of them are just the same person but in another universe, is amazing. I really love these two characters, and they have the best quotes in the game. I really enjoyed hearing these two talk in the game and whenever they appeared, I knew something good was coming.\nGraphics: This game has really good graphics and art style. I really love how they changed from the gloomy atmosphere of Bioshock 1 and 2 to this more colorfull game. I also love the gloomy and dark one, but it is nice to see that they tried a change and that it worked alright. I really love the steampunk concept of the game.\n\nI really look forward to playing this game a second time when I have the time\nThis game really deserves 10/10. Even 11/10. \nFinally, if you make me pick which of the Bioshocks it´s my favorite, I wouldn´t pick this one, even though it´s the best. Why do I say this? Because even though it´s the best, I don´t think you can really call it a Bioshock game, because it´s really different compared to the other two, except for some moments in the story and some game mechanics.  \nThanks for reading it till the end, hope you liked, I really tried my best. Sorry, for the long post. \nPD: When I saw Rapture again, my heart just raced so fast.","timestamp_created":1482724350,"timestamp_updated":1482724737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28657552","author":{"steamid":"76561198126899980","num_games_owned":700,"num_reviews":104,"playtime_forever":289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1484578323},"language":"japanese","review":"3D酔いが酷くて、先を進めるのが苦痛で出来ないのだ...\n個人差があるのだろうが、今までやったFPSやTPSで最も3D酔いの酷いゲーム。\n\n悔しいよぅ、悔しいよぅ... ；；\n\n内容が評価できないので、お勧めにはしておきます。\n面白[b]そう[/b]だった！ orz","timestamp_created":1482723707,"timestamp_updated":1482724065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.399569034576416016","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28657059","author":{"steamid":"76561198014806643","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":3671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2712,"last_played":1416330919},"language":"english","review":"I'll try tokeep this review short.\n\nBioshock Infinite is one of my favorite games.\nIt has very solid shooter mechanics aswell as the special abilities, with which you can experiment and combine for diffrent effects.\n\nBut the true highlights are the Art Design of the Game, aswell as the fantastic story.\nI can recommend this to anyone who likes games with a good story.\n\nThe 2 DLCs: Burial at Sea Episode 1 and 2 are also really good.

Здесь акцент делается на внимание к сюжету, подробный анализ всего увиденного и услышанного.\n\nBioShock расширил мой кругозор.\nС его помощью я познакомился с философской концепцией [u]\"объективизма и нравственности разумного эгоизма\"[/u] нашей бывшей соотечественницы писательницы Айн Рэнд (Алиса Розембаум) через её романы \"Источник\" и \"Атлант расправил плечи\". Данные произведения помогают понять философию и политику города Восторга времен Эндрю Райна.\nМне пришлось обратиться к трудам Стивена Хокинга, чтобы лучше разобраться в [u]теориях квантовой гравитации и множества вселенных[/u] со своими вероятностями событий - главной изюминке BioShock Infinite.\nНу и, конечно же, я лучше ознакомился с небольшой частью истории США, чтобы понять, о каких военных событиях идет речь, в которых принимала участие Колумбия (вымышленный город) в составе США.\n\nЯ все удивляюсь, сколько нужно ума, сколько нужно всего предусмотреть, чтобы получилась такая сложная и интересная, полностью цельная история, где все взаимосвязанно без ошибок и неопределенностей. Разработчики [b]\"ПОСТАРАЛИСЬ!!!\"[/b] За это им низкий поклон!\n\nЯ очень рад, что прошел эти игры не в 15 лет. а в немного старшем возрасте. Не все вещи здесь будут понятны детям. Можно, конечно, пробежать всю великую трилогию со всеми DLC, расстреливая врагов налево и направо. Но суть не будет понятна. [u]Неторопливый, внимательный и рассудительный игрок будет вознагражден сполна[/u]. Данная трилогия поистине уникальна! Её просто не с чем сравнивать.  Где вы найдете такую смесь: концепция нравственности разумного эгоизма, квантовая гравитация, теория параллельных миров, проблемы социального неравенства, революции и гражданских войн, вопросы религии и атеизма. В конце концов прекрасная сказочная история, [spoiler]в которой, я вас предупреждаю, к сожалению, печальный конец...[/spoiler] Приведите мне пример?

I've enjoyed the series as a whole, as it was my introduction to shooting games that attempt to focus on the narrative more than anything else. I love the world, love the characters, and love the ideas they are all supposed to represent. That said, Bioshock Infinite, and its predecessors, are not perfect games, and should not be treated as such. As much as I respect these products, none can escape constructive criticism.\n\nAs a result, I will be as honest as possible about the faults of this video game.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nALL THAT IS BAD...\n\nBioshock Infinite is eager to introduce the player to its creation, quickly bursting you through the clouds to view the vast achievement of a city in the sky. Right away we are introduced to its heavily religious, nationalist, racist, and revolutionary themes. Much like Rapture, the city itself represents an ideaology and the culture that surrounds it. \n\nWorldbuilding, on the surface, is excellent. The city looks alive, it looks like it stands for something, and is almost a convicning idea. Once you enter it, explore it, and meet its inhabitants, however, it's clear that that a majority of its beauty does not exist on the interior. Bioshock 1 had the convenience of being in the middle of a massive failure, but Infinite chooses to start before the terror has begun. As a result, in many sections you meet townsfolk, NPCs who deliver lines as you approach them. You cannot interact with them (other than kill them, without consequence, in certain parts) and they only exist to give you brief anecdotal information on themselves and the city. They are, in fact, tools for the worldbuilding process. They, sometimes without subtlety, hint at going-ons and certain aspects of Columbia's society.\n\nThe first time playing this game, I had no issue with this. I stood back and listened, absorbed as much as I could. Second time through, I had a vastly different opinion. The NPCs are actors, bad ones at that. They deliver a few lines and then sit quietly until you move on to the next group of people. The game tries to trick you into believing that you are interjecting a conversation and doesn't do it well. Animations for these people are scant and static; once they stop speaking they often, conveniently, go into a resting pose and patiently wait for you to ignore them. They are lifeless exhibits, contrasting highly with the visual life that Columbia's architecture possesses.\n\nThis is a problem in many video games that lack a true open world. NPCs are not given a schedule of actions per day, instead designed to fulfill a single purpose and hopefully never be seen again. Many games divert this by letting NPCs walk about and do various meaningless tasks, but Infinite does not even attempt that. Nearly all of them are stationary, existing for a single quip as you pass by. It really takes you out of an otherwise immersive experience.\n\nA secondary issue with the world is the vigors. They exist as one of the ties to the original Bioshock world, but do not feel nearly as integral to its society. In Bioshock the plasmids were largely responsible for the downfall of society, as crazed addicts would commit atrocious acts for more ADAM. There is extensive context for them existing and they feel very important to the story. Infinite, however, does little to explain the vigors. They exist with little to no consequence, only appearing so that the player can get away with possessing a few cool powers. They are overshadowed by Elizabeth's abilities, a far more important aspect of the game's universe, and her existence made me question why the vigors are necessary. The powers are entertaining to use, but I found myself thinking that they would make sense solely in Elizabeth's hands. If the game had implemented plasmids instead, perhaps letting Elizabeth open \"tears\" to find them, the powers would make more sense. In Columbia, these powers feel vastly out of place, so this could have been a reasonable solution to overcome that. Instead, we are left with vigors, abilities you will use extensively even if the game rarely speaks of them.\n\nThe disappointment of the vigors goes hand in hand with Infinite's combat. Bioshock isn't known for having great gameplay, but there was a certain amount of entertainment in its complexities. There were multiple ammunition types, several traps that could be used, and a many genetic upgrades that could provide interesting perks. Infinite throws most of this out. You are limited to two weapons at a time, and all of them use only a single ammunition type. Upgrades are scant and aren't noticable cosmetically. Traps are, for the most part, useless to set up with the introduction of the skyhook system. There isn't a single element of planning or wits. This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if the gameplay itself was vastly different. Unfortunately, it feels mostly the same. Many units are spongey and no weapons feel like a proper threat. The departure from the weapon wheel forces you to scrounge around mid-battle for ammunition, creating many fights that become disjointed and frustrating rather than frantic. Combat, especially in the later levels, is a mess in this game. It gets quite frustrating and is often meaningless. I think Bioshock Infinite would have better as an adventure game instead of an action game.\n\nMy main criticism of the game is that has a very thin sheen of quality. Every screenshot of this game will likely look grand and wonderful. If you look closely, however, you will notice flaws like these. Graphically, it's incredible, but there is a lack of attention to detail. Looking closely, you'll notice that fruit baskets have a single flat texture of produce and that many NPCs are stuck in a repetitive animation. It gives you the feeling that you are not inhabiting a real world. Instead you're stepping foot on a stage, experiencing a profound performance that amazes you until you look behind the curtain and realize none of it was real.\n\nALL THAT IS GOOD...\n\nMany have properly disected Infinite's story, but I do feel it is the main selling point of the game. Even if the convenience of Elizabeth's power can be used to lazily cover up plot holes, the game does its best to explain itself and leave you with a good understanding of Columbia the main characters' relationship. A majority of the value in this game can be credited to the voice actors for providing very convincing and engrossing performances. They bring the characters to life in ways that the game sometimes does not. \n\nWhile it does not possess the same impact of its predecessors, I'd say Infinite is the better game. The pacing of the plot is far better, as there is little meandering and the stakes are always being raised. With the relationship between Elizabeth and Booker hitting highs and lows throughout, we are given another reason to see the plot through. The story elevates itself above being just a voicepiece against extremism and turns into a far more personal tale. In this, I feel Infinite is more successful (and, unlike Bioshock, the ending doesn't suck).\n\nCONCLUSION...\n\nIt has more faults than many would like to admit, but it is far from being a bad game. It's a journey I feel most people should take, as the world and the characters are worth learning about. It's marred by repetitive and meaningless combat, but these aspects are far from being terrible. Even if Bioshock Infinite is not a perfect game, it's one that many should attempt to play. It's not often you get to explore a vast city in the sky, after all.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nPOST-NOTE...\n\nThe \"Burial at Sea\" expansion is quite good.

This is exactly the reason i choose Bioshock Infinite. Bioshock infinite manages to put down a really good atmosphere just like part 1 and 2, it's kinda like this 1800's overly happy/goodlife style. And except for 1 or 2 horror atmospheric parts i really enjoyed walking through the flying and colorful world of Columbia. The scenery in this game is so amazing and i found myself often just standing still and enjoying the view.\n\nOn to something different: The story and it's characters. Both are really interesting and well done. The story keeps itself interesting by introducing new things all game long. And by looting the world you'll find basic things like salt's, ammo, health etc. but also voxophones, these are audiofragments which expand on the story and give you more background information.  Someting i liked alot about Bioshock Infinite was the fact you travel with Elizabeth almost the whole game. It's something different, and although she doesnt really do much other than provide you with supplies and a bit of talking, it's better than traveling alone. However something you might need to do is search online for a explanation of the ending, because it's a really complex ending. There's alot of video's and sites explaining it, so it shouldn't be a problem finding something about it.\n\nOverall Bioshock Infinite is a amazing game, great story, great characters, great mechanics and a wonderfull world to explore. It's definitely a game that will keep you to thinking for a long time after you finished it.","timestamp_created":1482491765,"timestamp_updated":1482491981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":50,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.777869522571563721","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28553584","author":{"steamid":"76561198100565561","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":1396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1316,"last_played":1482482247},"language":"french","review":"Un troisième épisode excellent pour une serie que j'adore.\n\nBravo.","timestamp_created":1482482466,"timestamp_updated":1482482466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612885773181915283","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28550866","author":{"steamid":"76561198272304566","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":937,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":662,"last_played":1658282234},"language":"english","review":"This game is linear but doesn't feel that way, good thriller, mystery, and shoot 'em up all in one.
