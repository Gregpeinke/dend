thought I'd show respect to the original after many hours of Black Mesa, and damn does Half-Life still hold up well.\n\nOf course graphics are outdated but it doesn't even matter; I played on Hard, and while it was certainly frustrating at times, the gunplay and diversity of weapons just feels too good. I think I regularly used every weapon throughout the my 6.5 hour playthrough, which is kind of insane when in most FPS games one weapon is almost always the best choice. The level design is (generally) great and the spatial consistency of moving throughout Black Mesa feels amazing. It doesn't feel like I've just teleported to the next chapter, but of course the lab experimenting on alien lifeforms is directly connected to waste management. It just feels right.\n\nThere are a [i]few[/i] bad sections in Half-Life though, like On A Rail and Zen, that dampened by enjoyment—but then right after I'm in a completely new location, with unique challenges to overcome that keep the game constantly fresh.\n\nThis is by no means a long game, but it sure is fun while it lasts... just don't pick hard unless you're somewhat masochistic.","timestamp_created":1649038894,"timestamp_updated":1649039430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113311455","author":{"steamid":"76561198428460254","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1542,"last_played":1656611002},"language":"english","review":"VERY COOL","timestamp_created":1649038211,"timestamp_updated":1649038211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113309758","author":{"steamid":"76561198881565413","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1651355871},"language":"english","review":"my first play through was on hard. very angering. if you think this isnt a psychological horror game/rage game, then play on hard mode","timestamp_created":1649035062,"timestamp_updated":1649035062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113308591","author":{"steamid":"76561198314467808","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":56,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15,"last_played":1659181284},"language":"english","review":"Your name: Gordon Freeman.\nYour mission: Find out what the hell is going on.","timestamp_created":1649032788,"timestamp_updated":1649032788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113308589","author":{"steamid":"76561199190298414","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":213,"last_played":1654485561},"language":"english","review":"Classic FPS greatness","timestamp_created":1649032785,"timestamp_updated":1649032785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113306530","author":{"steamid":"76561198449333838","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":3888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3462,"last_played":1654107490},"language":"english","review":"I LOVE THE FUNNY SCIENCE DUDE HE MAKE ME GO BOING BOING BOING","timestamp_created":1649028876,"timestamp_updated":1649028876,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113305671","author":{"steamid":"76561199098134876","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":510,"last_played":1642777881},"language":"english","review":"gordon freeman has sexy ponytail 10/10","timestamp_created":1649027196,"timestamp_updated":1649027196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113302784","author":{"steamid":"76561198803605771","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":43,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1654613819},"language":"turkish","review":"Klasik oyunları sevenler için birebir.

Half Life changed the FPS genre so much and for the better.\n   First off this game doesn't just drop your into combat and give you a single line explaining the bad plot that's just used to give you a reason for shooting people without mercy.  Half Life starts with a scene were you have no weapons or enemies, gives you an explanation for what is going on while also showing you around Black Mesa and giving you an idea of what is happening without it being told to you directly (one of the many examples of Half Life being amazing at environmental storytelling) and, giving the general mood of the game all while letting you figure out the main motion controls.\n   Never forget that Half Life also had some of the most strategical gameplay of any FPS at the time.  Grenades, trip mines, satchels, and snarks are some of the most obvious examples being able to draw out enemies, time attacks perfectly without aiming, kill enemies without even being there, having other creatures do the dirty work for you, clearing out mine fields, and a million other uses but every weapon has unique uses.\n   Of course the enemies are all different and interesting.  From long range attacks to being able to avoid your            weapons these bad guys are creepy, cool, and delightfully challenging to fight.\n   You can't forget the incredible pacing in this game.  The story never seems to pass by super quickly or drag on to long (other than a few parts) and keeps you interested for the entire time.\n   I don't have the time or words to express my love for this game so I will simply tell you to buy the game.  If you're anything like me you'll love it.","timestamp_created":1648873331,"timestamp_updated":1648873331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.623006284236907959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113191643","author":{"steamid":"76561199078195565","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":339,"last_played":1656897564},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1648860206,"timestamp_updated":1648860206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113185528","author":{"steamid":"76561199226821229","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":499,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1659883454},"language":"english","review":"epikness","timestamp_created":1648849527,"timestamp_updated":1648849527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113183259","author":{"steamid":"76561198367997121","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1284,"last_played":1649492247},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life is such a masterpiece.\n\nIt's an old game, but it's still absolutely great. It has received 50 Game of The Year awards, and is (in my opinion) one of the best games ever made.\n\nAlright, it runs on the GoldSrc engine, which means that the graphics aren't exactly great; But I love them! The graphics have a charm to them that I don't find in a lot of other games...\nThe sound design is also brilliant. Whenever you're in a vent, all the sounds have a bit of a reverb added to it which is very immersive. The NPCs have conversations with each other (kind of), which makes the world and characters feel alive [i](that is until the 'incident' happens)[/i].\n\nSince it is over 20 years old, you might think that the game is pretty dead. Well, you'd be wrong. I myself, as well as many others, are still mapping and modding for this game to this day. You can easily make a map by setting up the right tools which takes less than 15 minutes, and have fun for many, MANY hours.\n\nThe atmosphere is creepy, but somewhat relaxing. You can walk around for a while without meeting anyone (since most of them are dead), which made me feel extremely lost and helpless.\n\nGreat game,\n9.99/10","timestamp_created":1648846005,"timestamp_updated":1648846005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113183145","author":{"steamid":"76561198439742567","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":4579,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3411,"last_played":1658318801},"language":"english","review":"just yes. immortal classic","timestamp_created":1648845850,"timestamp_updated":1648845850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113182523","author":{"steamid":"76561198303417947","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":924,"last_played":1646488589},"language":"english","review":"Pretty good, and cool and I liked the music.","timestamp_created":1648844857,"timestamp_updated":1648844857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113182359","author":{"steamid":"76561198089688857","num_games_owned":325,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":141,"last_played":1612280044},"language":"english","review":"Playing this in 1998 was amazing, but It hasn't aged well.
