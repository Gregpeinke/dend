I have <see above> hours on record and only have one perk maxed. This being the case I still can't consistantly beat the hardest difficulty! The perks match the difficulty of servers well and you may be on the medium difficulty for months, some times winning and sometimes losing. This will definitely keep you interested though!

Killing floor is an awesome (zombie?) themed survival game. Its definately a good time killer if your playing solo but truely a masterpiece with a few friends. Killing Floor has a mysterious semi-hidden storyline that reveals itself through hints found in maps and the objective modes. With such a strong mdding community on the Steam Workshop its hard to get bored of Killing Floor! Gor those of you that want your own content, Killing floor uses Unreal 2004 engine which is very easy to learn if you want to make your own maps! I would deffinately recomend Killing Floor to anyone who was curious.

Hopefully killing floor will have aspects that would make this game better wich on my opinion would be:\nLooting System with level up, More custumisation on guns and characters, collectables, sharper gameplay, smoother graphics, better shop system, and last but not least Inovation. i wanna se something creative in Killing floor 2, something like Jetpacks for sale (Virtual money) or more types of grenades, more control over what you wanna play, like\nthe monsters you wanna restrain or money you spawn with, money per kill.

floor is a co-op survival horror game similar to 'COD Zombies' or 'No More Room in Hell'.  In this game you and a group of up to 5 friends survive against waves of Zeds (zombie like creatures).  The game has no story, it is strickly multiplayer but despite this I enjoy it. The twenty dollar price tag is a little high for this game.  I give this game an 8/10 for its fun co-op gameplay.","timestamp_created":1425776546,"timestamp_updated":1425776546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14778807","author":{"steamid":"76561198142427493","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":57581,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6046,"last_played":1548471766},"language":"english","review":"the best horror co-op ever","timestamp_created":1425748879,"timestamp_updated":1425748879,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14777972","author":{"steamid":"76561198159999147","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":653,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":103,"last_played":1498778709},"language":"english","review":"Love this Game!!","timestamp_created":1425745491,"timestamp_updated":1425745491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14777962","author":{"steamid":"76561198112411026","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":116729,"playtime_last_two_weeks":38,"playtime_at_review":59723,"last_played":1660082568},"language":"russian","review":"Come with me?","timestamp_created":1425745470,"timestamp_updated":1425745470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14776283","author":{"steamid":"76561198053900594","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":4585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4062,"last_played":1527329158},"language":"russian","review":"Игра похожа на л4д, но в отличие от нее, эта игруля зацепила.\nБолее оригинальные монстры, особенно во время  ивента хеллоуин или как он там - собственно во время него я игру и купил - монстры были в стиле цирковых уродов и это очень приглянулось.\nЕсть прокачка 7 навыков - под каждый вид оружия и это позволило потратить на нее несколько десятков часов.\nГрафика конечно устарела, но выглядит неплохо.\nЖду вторую часть.","timestamp_created":1425738681,"timestamp_updated":1425738681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14770263","author":{"steamid":"76561198127862328","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1532,"last_played":1500797857},"language":"russian","review":"Killing floor Это симулятор убегания от зомби когда у тебя кончились патроны но ты не убежишь-ОНИ ТЕБЯ ДОГОНЯТ загонят в угол и тебе капут\n","timestamp_created":1425708594,"timestamp_updated":1425708594,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14769638","author":{"steamid":"76561198137942253","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1007,"last_played":1426876954},"language":"english","review":"ten ata ten","timestamp_created":1425704330,"timestamp_updated":1425704330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14767976","author":{"steamid":"76561197972295893","num_games_owned":266,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":933,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1480802691},"language":"english","review":"i love thes game it is cool","timestamp_created":1425693419,"timestamp_updated":1425693419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14767899","author":{"steamid":"76561198042096916","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8125,"last_played":1430698585},"language":"english","review":"Excelente jogo.
