Te das cuenta de cómo comprendes, pero no siempre compartes sus puntos de vista.\n\nLos puzzles son muy entretenidos, y no hay nada más gratificante que exprimirte el seso por un rato para luego de repente que se te encienda la bombilla y dar con la solución.\n\nLas bromas pesadas de GladOS son increibles, siempre andas deseando acabar la prueba para ver que sobrada te va a soltar.\n\nLo mejor: Los comentarios son brutales, y el doblaje en español (pese a que pierde un poco de gracia con respecto al original) es una maravilla. \"No te odio\" -Torreta incapacitada. \"¡Soy diferente!\" -Torreta defectuosa. Las pruebas crecen en complejidad pero también en creatividad, y no es prueba-prueba-prueba-prueba durante todo el recorrido. Las alusiones al primer Portal son constantes, y es muy divertido ir recordando viejas situaciones.\n\nLo peor: A veces se hace tedioso, y empiezas a ver portales hasta en el retrete. El juego en sí no es especialmente largo, pero sí que puede llegar a hacerse pesado. \n\nNota curiosa: el 25% de las personas que tienen el juego comprado en steam aún no han empezado a jugarlo.
