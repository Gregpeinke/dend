This game was one of the first FPSs I had experienced. I bought an old cd-rom copy from a sweaty street vendor at a Flea Market. I said, \"$5.00, worth the shot.\" Played it, expecting it to be some trash game from my parent's lifetime. I was only Half-Right. \n\nFor it's time, Half-Life really pushed boundaries. The FPS genre would be undoubtedly different today, if it hadn't been for Doom, Quake, and Half-Life. Doom mainstreamed the conventional FPS design, Quake elaborated upon this with an updated engine (particle physics, lighting improvements, 3-dimensional characters with actual polygons) and brilliant game-play experimentation (rocket jumping, low gravity, multi-platforming). Half-Life built upon the Quake engine to create something that many players were probably craving the most--story-driven game-play. \n\nIt might seem conventional now, but most FPSs of the time were scarce on story-building. Many argue that if it weren't for Half-Life's experimentation with \"cinematic\" story-telling, the Call of Duty franchise would not be the hulking franchise that it is today.","timestamp_created":1576482700,"timestamp_updated":1576482700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59947789","author":{"steamid":"76561199005902401","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1168,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":186,"last_played":1577661676},"language":"turkish","review":"2288","timestamp_created":1576482676,"timestamp_updated":1576482676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48888888955116272","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59946010","author":{"steamid":"76561198409091893","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1640417897},"language":"english","review":"idk

Это же легендарная игра, классика, шедевр, можно продолжать дальше, но это так.\nВ эту игру я начал играть ещё далеко до появления моего первого компьютера, ходили к соседям, в клубы. \nВ далёком 2001 году я познакомился с этой игрой благодаря клубу и кс 1,5. Мы все играли как умели, лазили по ассауту, меншену, ацтеку, дедасту. В один прекрасный день я спросил своих братьев по оружию, а почему мы никогда не заходим играть в hf? Напомню, что в игре есть переключение между Кс и Хф. Зашли, создали уровень, побегали, удивились оружию ну и в целом через недельку забросили обратно на Кс. Но я начал проходить сюжетную игру Хф и с тех пор переигрывал в неё больше 50-ти раз. Участвовал в спидране, личный рекорд на тот момент был 84 минуты. Спустя столько лет, находясь далеко от дома, имя на руках МакПро, я увидел возможность установки Хф на МакОс. И сейчас прохожу заново это великую игру.\nПо делу: игра объемная, куча уровней, куча врагов, присутствуют, как бы щас назвали \"мини игры\", где-то нужно обойти, где-то подождать, где-то рискнуть. Помню, что по началу её прохождение составляло 15-20 часов. Играйте в Хф! Я уверен весь мир знает эту игру. Как и её ничуть не великое продолжение - Хф2. Всем играть!
