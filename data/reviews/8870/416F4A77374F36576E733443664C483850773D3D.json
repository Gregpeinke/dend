Son univers graphique est superbe et fonctionne très bien. Encore plus que dans les deux premiers Bioshock, l'histoire est l'élément qui vous fera basculer dans une adoration bien méritée de cette perle ! \n\nOn peut regretter la courte durée de l'aventure, mais elle est rejouable et cela permet de remarquer de nouveaux détails de l'histoire et de revivre une expérience de jeu  plutôt exceptionnelle.

''Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt' Its all a bit vague at the beginning but as the story progresses you will see what it was all about in the beginning. Next to all this, when you travel to the cloud city of colombia people recognize you as some sort of antichrist and they are all gunning for your head. On colombia there is racism and hatred going around plenty. You have to choose a side. You come across Elizabeth the girl you need to save early on in the game. But she is being held hostage in a tower guarded by a giant birdlike creature with the name Songbird. Well you can find the rest out for yourself. to keep it short. the story is good. A bit predictable but with enough twists to keep you guessing whats really happening till the end. Storywise this game has its plottwists but it is well voiceacted and carried out great so im not complaining. \n\n[b] Gameplay: [/b]\n\nThis is a first person shooter. You can play trough the game in 10 hours or so if you ignore everything around you and go straight for the story. People like me take a bit longer because im trying to collect every damn thing there is to collect. (which I failed to do too lol). \nThe gun handling is okay I guess but what stands out the most are the vigors. you can create traps and lure your enemy into them, you can lauch enemies into the air, push them away and set them on fire. It was fun finding good combinations with the vigors to devastate your enemies. The variety in weapons was not that great. You have  like 10-12 weapons in 2 different variations. But they basically do the same, the only thing that differs are the names. But I didn't mind that. I just chose the 2 weapons I enjoyed the most playing with. And kept those for the rest of my playtrough.\n\nAlso there are a couple of enemy types you will encounter on your trip to Colombia. They offer enough variety in gameplay. You will have to adapt to the enemies that are thrown at you. The hardest gamemode was a more of a challange than the rest. It keeps you on the edge of your seat so to speak.\n\n*SPOILERWARNING*\n[spoiler] As it turns out her father Comstock locked Elizabeth up in that tower to contain her. Elzabeth is a gifted girl who can open 'tears' to other places and worlds. Prophet Comstock thinks you are the Antichrist. As it turns out you are actually Comstock but from another world or something. [/spoiler] Yeah its all kind of messed up in Colombia but it was a fun rollercoaster in the end.\n\n[b] Conclusion & Final verdict [/b]\nShould you buy this game? \nIMO yes. if you love a entertaining story with enough twists and turns, some good gameplay and great voiceacting you will surely enjoy this game. Its not at all like the 2 other bioshock games. If you want that rapture thing back, well its not really here. You should get the 2 DLC packs for this game. Its a refreshing take on this franchise and after all I had a blast playing trough this game. \n[b] Its all I wanted and expected out of a game like this and therefore my final verdict for Bioshock Infinite is a great 9/10 [/b]\n\n[h1] Do I recommend this? If it wasnt clear for you yet, do yourself a favour and buy this already. [/h1]\n\n[quote]Want more recommendations? Come see our reviews on our favorite upcoming games!

As a huge fan of the first game, I was worried that this game wouldn't live of to the orignal Bioshock. Boy was I wrong. This game lives up and surpasses the orginal, in some places. You play as Booker Dewitt, as you try to rescue a girl from the floating city Columbia. Now since Columbia is all floating blue skys, it loses some of the clustaphobia from the first game. It is alot more action based and less survial horror. You almost always have a weapon and Salt(Eve) to cast. Enemies are more plentiful and the game play is a little more straight forward. But it is refined. It is very elegant and easy to use. You don't need to be a FPS pro to handle this game. But there is still some challenge for those who want it. But the main driving factor of this game is it's story. And man does it deliver. I don't want to say any spoilers, but this story comes through with leaps and bounds............and tears.WINK.

Before Steam, I've played it twice and now I've played it three times. It's a little hard to put what I feel about this game in words, but here's my attempt. I think what makes BioShock Infinite so great is wide range possibility of interpretation. It can be as simple as story of people who messed with physic, but it can also be story of nation or humankind at its best and worst. Feel free to pick your own interpretation. I already picked mine.\n\nColumbia is so surreal and yet realistic enough to be a world where one can step upon. The whole playing system is also very interesting, even for me. I'm very far from hardcore (I was, back in my younger age) and I get tired by playing game very quickly, but BioShock Infinite kept me engaged and kept me coming back for more. Of course there's violenc, action, fighting, and all, but it's displayed so appropriately to the point it was enjoyable, even for someone who prefer slow, peaceful game like me.\n\nBut I think the reason why one must play BioShock Infinite is because it's something that offer you a higher thought in life. It's a little like adventuring through psychology course mixed with physic one. What are time and space, anyway? What is memory? Are we doing the right thing? Are we going to the better direction? Who are benefiting from what we do? What are we do things for? These questions' answer might never see the light of day, but at least they were born.\n\nNow here's something a little spoiler-y and maybe don't read it if you haven't finish the game; at the very end, we found out that what happened in the game was simply a result of choices so small of receiving baptism. I go with Booker all the time, that it is true a drunk in a water can't atone our sins, but he didn't exactly turn out to be the best person or even a decent one, even for just his daughter. \n\nI believe that a simple choice can give birth to an entire new world. I chose to play BioShock Infinite and it changed mine in the most annoying, satisfying way possible.","timestamp_created":1435835863,"timestamp_updated":1435835924,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16839464","author":{"steamid":"76561198031756335","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1525046910},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom o jogo!

The movement is slow, the weapons are mostly uninteresting, the upgrades don't feel that potent and you have to frequently use weapons you don't like due to limited ammo.\n-Music.  I had a really hard time with all the old 1920s-ish music that was playing everywhere.  I kept hitting “F” to turn off sonograms whenever I found them.\n-Controls.  The key-bindings were a bit odd IMO, but very easy to change to whatever you prefer.\n\nPros:\n-Fantastic story.  Good ending.  Great setting.\n-Graphics look good but aren't too taxing.  Holding up well a couple years on\n-Save system.  Totalbiscuit hated the save system because you cannot manually save.  Normally I find this very upsetting but this game saves so often that it just removes the hassle of having to stop what you are doing to save.  Further, if you die you will re-spawn with a little extra health, ammo, and salt; and the enemies you had killed stay dead.  So you won't get stuck.\n-Price.  Get it on sale cheap.

Bu gerçekliğin beni rahatlatan bir tarafı vardı. Sonuçta, milyonlarca insanın milyonlarca ömür tükettiği bu gezegen üzerinde, son nefesini verirken kimin ne kadar eksik, kimin ne kadar fazla yaşadığının bir önemi kalmıyordu, herkes ölüyordu, hayat devam ediyordu. Hep düşünmüşümdür, yaptığım şeyleri yapmasaydım, daha iyi bir insan olsaydım, buna rağmen bir bedel ödemem gerekiyor muydu? Belki süreç geçerken ödediğimiz bedeller karşılığı aldığımız küçük mutluluk anlarının adına yaşam deniyordur, en azından ben buna yaşam diyorum ve öğrendiğim tek bir şey varsa; eğer silahı önce sen çekmezsen, asla çekemezsin”\n\nBooker DeWitt \n\nBir oyuncu olarak, yaşamınızda çok nadiren karşılaştığınız, sizi tamamen dünyasının bir parçası haline getiren ve oradan çıkartmayan oyunlar oynarsınız. Aslında buna oyun demek ne kadar doğru bilemiyorum. Bir yerden sonra hikayesi, görselliği, sesleri ve yaşayan dünyası ile içinize işleyen bir sanat eseri gibidir bu yapımlar çünkü.\n\nBioShock Infinite, kabına, ismine ve onu karşılayan çoğu tanıma sığmayan bir hikaye fakat bundan önemlisi BioShock Infinite “derdi” olan bir oyun. Ken Levine ve Irrational Games ekibinin bir takım sıkıntıları var dile getirmek istedikleri, bu insanları yapımcı olarak, üreten olarak yaşamla ilgili rahatsız eden şeyler var ve bunun sonucu parasal kaygıların ötesinde söylemek istediklerini korkmadan ifade eden bir yapım olarak ortaya çıkıyor.\n\nBioShock Infinite, oldukça sevilen ve benzer konseptte üretilmiş BioShock serilerinin devamı niteliğinde fakat bu hikayesel bir devamlılık değil. BioShock nasıl System Shock serilerinin ruhani takipçisi ise, BioShock Infinite’te, temellerine sadık fakat BioShock oyunlarıyla farklı bir evrende geçiyor. \n\nInfinite’in hikayesi, daha önce BioShock serilerinde olduğu gibi alternatif bir dünya tarihini kapsıyor, özellikle Amerikan tarihini alıp, değiştiren ve güzeller güzeli uçan şehir Columbia’yı bu akışa entegre eden Infinite ekibi, gerçekten çok başarılı bir dünya çıkartmış.\n\nInfinite’in dünyası, Ayn Rand’ın Objektivizm felsefesini kendi içine katıp yoğuran, korkutucu, büyük, olasılıkların sonsuz olduğu fakat bir o kadar ışıl ışıl bir dünya. Amerika’nın karanlık tarihini olduğu gibi alıp, ırk, din, cinsiyetçilik ve bunun gibi pek çok tabu olan konuyu korkusuzca işleyen Irrational, bu konuda ayakta alkışlanmayı hak ediyor doğrusu. Gökyüzünün ötesinde uçan mucize şehir Columbia’ya ilk ayak bastığınız vakit burasının bir cennet olduğunu düşünmeye başlıyorsunuz, insanları, yaşamları ve kimlikleriyle gerçek anlamda yaşayan bir yer Columbia. \n\nİlk defa kendimi bir şehrin içinde böylesine kaybettim. Yeryüzünden yukarıda, bambaşka bir gerçeklik içerisinde varlığını sürdüren Columbia, yapıları, mimarisi, heykelleri, sanat eserleri ve teknolojisi ile sizi girer girmez büyülemeyi başarıyor. Infinite’in en önemli yanı bunu size verirken, birden bire almayı bilmesi. “Burası fazla iyi, fazla güzel, burada ne gibi bir macera yaşayabilirsin ki?” diye sorduğunuz vakit, Columbia’nın Columbia olması için yapılan seçimlerin karanlık sonuçları ile karşılaşıyorsunuz. Infinite ilk etapta Amerika’nın kirli geçmişi ile dolu sandıktan “ırkçılık” konusunu çıkartıyor ve çat diye önünüze koyuyor, bu geçiş öyle hızlı oluyor ki, oyuncu olarak durumun alenenliğinden rahatsız oluyorsunuz, oyunlarda bu tarz konuların işlenmesine alışık olmadığımızdan, bu tarz bir rahatsız olma reaksiyonu ile ilk kez karşılaştım.\n\nInfinite’in işlediği tabular, belki sahip olduğu muhteşem görselliği olmasaydı bu kadar dramatik gelmezdi, ilk BioShock’a selam veren girişinden itibaren, oyunun dudak ısırtan görsel tasarımı ile birlikte karşımıza çıkan parıl parıl Columbia, işlediği konularla öyle büyük bir tezat oluşturuyor ki, Irrational, Infinite’in oldukça karanlık konseptlerini karşınıza çıkarttığı zaman, bu insana iki kat daha ağır geliyor.","timestamp_created":1435796940,"timestamp_updated":1435796940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588365674018859863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16834709","author":{"steamid":"76561198030417614","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1070,"last_played":1435790646},"language":"english","review":"just plain stupid.","timestamp_created":1435791093,"timestamp_updated":1435791093,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16834166","author":{"steamid":"76561198106985267","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":819,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":819,"last_played":1435788297},"language":"czech","review":"Hra nabýdne ze začátku nádherné scenérie, které se však po čase stanou okoukané a nudné.

Per quanto riguarda il gameplay è ottimo, non il migliore (in alcune parti può stancare poichè è molto lineare) ma comunque ottimo, è davvero divertente massacrare nemici con vigor (delle specie di poteri speciali) e con le molte e fortunatamente diverse armi da fuoco. Anche il design dei nemici e dei personaggi è fantastico (vedi Songbird, Boy of Silence, gli Incendiari...). Ma probabilmente la cosa che più vi terrà attaccati a questo titolo è la storia, complessa e piena di colpi di scena, ed è carino anche rigiocarlo, una volta finito e capita la verità su tutto, per riscoprire nuovi dettagli e collegamenti.

Примерно такая же задача стоит перед любым обозревателем BioShock Infinite.[/quote]\n\nГлавное, чем выделяется BioShock Infinite на фоне большинства громких новинок последнего времени, — это удивительная цельность и единство всех элементов игры. Здесь нет ничего лишнего — ни «приклеенной» RPG-составляющей, ни надуманных сюжетных поворотов. Геймплей, сценарий, графика, музыка в синхронном звучании создают поистине потрясающую стимпанковскую атмосферу. С первых минут игры сразу становится ясно, — BioShock Infinite — это оркестр, в ктором всё так, как должно быть.\n\nПо началу Сценарий BioShock Infinite кажется в меру банальным и не слишком выдающимся — вы - детектив, Букер Девитт отправляетесь в летающий город Колумбию, чтобы найти и вернуть на землю загадочную девушку Элизабет. На деле же сюжет оказывается чем-то абсолютно немыслимым и неподдающимся не каким объяснениям.  — ткань повествования разорвана, последовательность событий нарушена, и лишь концовка даёт вам такие долгожданные ответы на ваши вопросы. Хотя, конечно, концовка задаёт больше вопросов, чем даёт ответов[spoiler]Кен Левин верин себе[/spoiler].\n\nСюжет BioShock Infinite никого не оставит равнодушным — после финала вы будете обдумывать каждую главу только что пройденной игры в поисках ответов или вас будет ждать кратковременный серфинг по фанатским форумам.\n\nВ русской версии игры озвучка персонажей осталась оригинальной. Оно и к лучшему — монологи героев, как, впрочем, и сами персонажи, крайне выразительны. Одна только Элизабет заслуживает отдельной похвалы. Это миловидное, женственное создание — словно героиня диснеевских сказок: столь же добрая, приветливая и веселая. Одиноко запертая в высокой башне, Элизабет мечтает лишь о Париже и танцах. \n\nНо геймплейные \"функции\" девушки не заканчиваются на \"красивых глазках\". За время пребывания в башне Элизабет успела прочитать не мало книг и теперь она с легкостью открывает любые двери и сейфы, ваша задача только снабжать девушку отмычками. Так же, \nв трудную минуту элизабет может подкинуть патроны, деньги или бутылку соли. Последние, кстати, имеет функцию маны, которая понадобится вам, для того, чтобы например СКАСТИТЬ ФАЭРБОЛЛ ОМГ. Ну или закалдовать вражескую туррель и она станет вашим союзником.\n\nНелишними в схватках оказываются и сверхспособности Элизабет. Девушка умеет открывать дыры в параллельные вселенные, а также извлекать из них предметы высокой стратегической ценности. Мы можем приказать Элизабет поставить «дружественную» турель или создать для нас укрытие. Все это положительно влияет на динамику игры.Via stopgame\n\nНо и это ещё не всё. Самое увлекательное и денамичное занятие в BioShock Infinite - это погони и перестрелки. Но какие погони в BioShock? На аэрорельсах — местной транспортной системе. Сражения здесь достигают высшего уровня крутости эпичности. Ведь нет ничего веселее, чем проехаться на рельсах, расстреляв парочку слабых врагов, а попутно приземляясь, раскрошить смачным ударом крюка чью-то несчастную голову.\n\nЭто изуметльная игра. Мы на долго её запомним, как отлично поставленный, наикрасивейшей FPS(!) с потрясающим сюжетом, которому позавидовали бы Джеймс Кемерон и Кристофер Нолан вместе взятые.\n\n10/10 Игра года 2013.","timestamp_created":1435744405,"timestamp_updated":1435747138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601893067359924316","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16821558","author":{"steamid":"76561198096327786","num_games_owned":308,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1094,"last_played":1505860806},"language":"english","review":"Where to start. I picked up the Bioshock series during the summer sale, and I decieded to play Inifinite first. That was the best choice I've mde in gaming since getting a PC. I sat down at around 10pm at night. I had meant to play for only 20 minutes. That was all. 20. Needless to say, I stoped playing at 5am when I realized there was sun coming through my window. It only took me a few more hours the next day to finish it. This game, is not only the prequel, but it's fun and thirlling play. This game is extremley story drivin. My friend asked me to explain the game to him, and my response was \"That may take a few hours.\" The story is so deep, and so emotional that it's just something that NEEDS to be experianced. This game is truley art. It's also the first game that's has made me cry. Yes. I actually CRIED at the end of the game. There is not one thing I can point out wrong with this game. It played with my emotions like a kitten playing with a ball of yarn, and the story was so deep that it left me grasping for more sources.

This was an amazing conclusion to the Bioshock Trilogy. The ending was probably the best ending to this trilogy i could've asked for. If you have any chance to play this game through, even if you have never tried the others, DO IT. It is so worth what you pay for it. Also, the season pass price(currently $20) is so worth it. The 2-Episode Burial At Sea brings some fantastic ideas to the table about connections to the other games in the trilogy. The amount of emotion i felt while playing it was unreal. Clash in the Clouds is also another amazing addition to the game. It is wave-based combat which gives you money to either purchase upgrades for your character to help you earn more money, or to purchase bonus content in an in-game musuem.

Gone are having multiple weapons with various strengths and weaknesses that you have to balance against the current enemy types. You get two weapons. That's it. You can change them, but once you have a short range and a long range weapon why would you? 'But you have access to 8 different Vigors!' I hear you cry. Well yeah, but you can't use them that often. You will use them once or *gasp* twice an encounter and then spend 10 minutes trying to find enough soda to restore your magic level, before giving up and shelling out money at the vending machine. Why can't you carry around eve hypos? or medkits? Because the game isn't Bioshock it just wants to look like it.\n\nAnother example, the game wants you to explore. It puts audio logs and power ups scattered around the level enticing you with the siren call of Adventure, however somehow it can't provide that all important map that makes exploration fun and not a tedious excercise in furstration.\n\nThird, you play as the wrong character. Elizabeth is clearly the focal point of the story who has a deep connection with the city of Columbia. Bland Dewitt is the NPC who should get her out of the tower and then die leaving her to defend herself and change and grow as a person. But no, we are shackled to him and can only rage impotently as Elizabeth does cool things. I want to do cool things! I don't play a video game to watch people do cool things. That's what movies are for.\n\nNow maybe I'm wrong about all this and after 5 hours the game somehow wanders out of it's druken stupor and remebers what fun is. But you have ask yourself, is that really worth it? Waiting hours on end for the game to \"maybe\" become good? I didn't actually get all that far in the story I reached The Hall of Heroes and was so frustrated, bored and unenthused that I stopped playing.\n\nIn conclusion this game is not Bioshock. It wears Bioshock like Buffalo Bill does women but that does not make it so. This game might have a mindblowing story that puts everything that came before it to shame, however good story does not excuse terrible gameplay. It just means I would have to subject myself to 20 hours of godawful gameplay for 20 minutes of story I could read on Wikipedia. Not worth the trade.","timestamp_created":1435619574,"timestamp_updated":1435619676,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16788670","author":{"steamid":"76561198017488207","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":736,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":736,"last_played":1435564509},"language":"english","review":"So good.","timestamp_created":1435618551,"timestamp_updated":1435618551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16788306","author":{"steamid":"76561198061902623","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":555,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":555,"last_played":1435397232},"language":"english","review":"I was playing this game, and then it was over, what?\n\nPlot twist simulator, 10/10","timestamp_created":1435616904,"timestamp_updated":1435616904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16787698","author":{"steamid":"76561198011296582","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":6314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1652,"last_played":1656093542},"language":"english","review":"This game is awesome!","timestamp_created":1435614426,"timestamp_updated":1435614426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474452555179595947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16787035","author":{"steamid":"76561198228846924","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1047,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":935,"last_played":1435617287},"language":"english","review":"This is not a game; it's an experience in and of itself.
