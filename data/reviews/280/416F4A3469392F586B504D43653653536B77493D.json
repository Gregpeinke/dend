What could've been a great remaster and update to the original [b] Half-Life [/b] instead became a lazy, bug-filled, disgusting mess of a product. There are very minor improvements to the formula (which are nice, but honestly unneeded), and an assortment of bugs and glitches are now part of this classic game. Exactly what a fan would want!\n\nThere are pretty much no graphical overhauls save for some improved lighting and shadow work. However, shadows for guns and some turret enemies are broken, leading to weirdly shiny textures and enemies turning completely black on screen. There are many map-specific glitches, ranging from purely visual to actually affecting the way enemies/bosses behave. The first boss fight in Xen is completely broken with this \"update\".\n\nThe sound design in the game is also broken as well. The crowbar consistently makes a metallic sound when striking any object, most of the guns have inconsistent audio cues, and characters constantly scream in pain if injured in ANY sort of way. On top of this, none of the final Xen levels are different, so they are still god-awful to play, and now have bugs all over the place.\n\nThe nice additions, being ragdolls and gun physics, are completely pointless since the rest of the game is a complete downgrade. The original is much better, and the fan-remake titled [b] Black Mesa [/b] has finally released in full, so there is no point of buying this game in my opinion. I do [b] Not Recommend [/b] purchasing this title, since Valve has made it clear that they want to continue to shamelessly promote their own broken game on Steam. Overall, there are too many bugs/glitches, no substantial improvements over the original, and there is already a better option for updated [b] Half-Life [/b] gameplay in [b] Black Mesa [/b].\n\n[h2]
