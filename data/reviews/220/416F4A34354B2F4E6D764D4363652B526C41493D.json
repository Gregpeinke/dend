Life 2 una secuela mejor que el original\nSinceramente tras el juegaso que fue la primera entrega, se esperaba algo igual o superior. \n\nHistoria 3/3\nTras 20 años despues de Half Life 1, Gordon se despierta en un tren y se encuentra con una dictadura... \nBueno la historia pasa de un seudo de terror y accion, ha una historia distopica. Que decir la narrativa es genial, seremos en todo momento Gordon, ni cinemáticas ni nada por el estilo. \nEl como se va narrando es genial y divertida, aunque en ocasiones tiene ciertos toques de terror, donde veremos las consecuencias de esta dictadura hecha por extraterrestres\n\nJugabilidad 3/3\n¿Que si es divertido manejar a Gordon?  Pues no es divertido es JODIDAMENTE genial. Disparar y moverse nunca ha sido tan divertido, tambien añadir que las armas igual son geniales, desde la pistola de gravedad como los huevos esos de las hormigas leon. \nCada arma tiene sus pro y contra por lo cual uno tiene que aprender a usar bien, un ejemplo, la ametralleta pose un disparo especial con click derecho, el cual actua como un lanzagranda, por lo cual si lo usamos bien podremos eliminar hordas de enimigos en un solo click\n\nMusica y Sonido 3/3\nBueno bueno esto igual esta muy bien hecho al menos en la parte del sonido, muy trabajo y que ayuda mucho a la inmersión, la musica... Bueno algunos temas destacan mas que otro, hasta en ocasiones parece como si el juego no tiene musica mas alla del tema de combate(muy bueno por cierto) pero tiene musica en la gran mayoria de ocasiones de fondo aunque es muy dinamico. \n\nCONCLUSION\nUn Shooter que marco un antes y despues, hasta hoy en dia el juego destaca sobre otros. Muy recomendado si te gustan los Shooters o te gusts este universo, si te aburre ya jugar mil veces HL 2 tenes mods y campañas creadas por la comunidad. \n\nPuntos positivos\n-Una jugabilidad destacable\n-Armas creativas \n-G man\n-Duracion destacable(10 a 15 horas) \n\nPuntos negativos \n-No exite Half life 3 o episode 3\n","timestamp_created":1594368234,"timestamp_updated":1594368234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72417885","author":{"steamid":"76561197967395908","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":892,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":892,"last_played":1594362433},"language":"english","review":"badiya game bc","timestamp_created":1594366029,"timestamp_updated":1594366029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72417118","author":{"steamid":"76561198962492524","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":335,"last_played":1621734882},"language":"english","review":"ANOTHER CLASSIC!

This game manages to always keep the focus on what is important to gaming, the actual gameplay. You never enter a scene where you don't have full control of the camera, with exceptions to the very beginning and very end. This game manages to keep you engaged from beginning to end with its setting and atmosphere. This is a world of loss and dread and Valve was able to convey that dread so masterfully through the NPCs you encounter and the state the city is in. You feel inspired as the player to help these people and fight back the combine. \n\nThis games protagonist, Gordon Freeman, is again the silent hero that says not one word aside from some grunts when you take shots from enemies. This allows you to project yourself into Gordon and make him into whoever you want. Another feature this game has that's amazing is the gravity gun. You will be using this tool a lot, From solving puzzles, to clearing debris, and if you wanna get a certain achievement you have to use it to fight as well. The gunplay is also a big positive in this game. The guns all sound and look amazing and the the shooting feels really refined and a big improvement from the first Half-Life, My favorite looking and sounding gun was the pistol you get at the beginning. \n\nThe story is amazing as well. Half-Life 2 takes place 20 years after the Resonance Cascade at Black Mesa. An event took place during those 20 years when you where in stasis called the 7 hour war where the combine came to earth and took it over in only 7 hours, and when the game starts you are immediately enthralled in the story and characters. Some standouts are Alyx Vance and Barney, they both bring a level charm and joy to an otherwise bleak and hopeless setting. This game is a very personal one and definitely one of my favorite games of all time. I can't decide which one is better the first Half-Life or the second, they are both equally amazing and I recommend that if you haven't played this franchise that you get them immediately","timestamp_created":1594348228,"timestamp_updated":1594348228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72405397","author":{"steamid":"76561198964373790","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2820,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1641016922},"language":"russian","review":".","timestamp_created":1594347679,"timestamp_updated":1594347679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72405029","author":{"steamid":"76561198261805956","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3127,"last_played":1652651510},"language":"english","review":"game","timestamp_created":1594347118,"timestamp_updated":1594347118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72404904","author":{"steamid":"76561198258517958","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1087,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1029,"last_played":1636128873},"language":"english","review":"gman is funny with his voice that has pause","timestamp_created":1594346957,"timestamp_updated":1594346957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72403874","author":{"steamid":"76561198080914124","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":982,"last_played":1596330326},"language":"spanish","review":"Como no voy a recomendarlo si es un juego que esta en todo","timestamp_created":1594345483,"timestamp_updated":1594345483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72401764","author":{"steamid":"76561199051063431","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":912,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":651,"last_played":1608937727},"language":"english","review":"this is bad game get it","timestamp_created":1594342645,"timestamp_updated":1594342645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72400358","author":{"steamid":"76561198311965072","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1590,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1131,"last_played":1613974579},"language":"english","review":"E?
