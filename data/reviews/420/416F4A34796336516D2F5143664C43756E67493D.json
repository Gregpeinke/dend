Nuestro objetivo principal era volver a Ciudad 17 para estabilizar el reactor o núcleo principal de la ciudadela y así ganar un tiempo precioso que nos permitiese alejarnos lo suficiente de ésta antes de su inevitable explosión –hechos que se nos resumirán brevemente al comienzo de esta nueva expasión mediante un video-. Ahora en el Episodio Dos deberemos llegar a una base de la resistencia llamada White Forest atravesando un extensísimo bosque, previa visita \"guiada\" a una colmena de hormigas león. En esta trepidante aventura estaremos de nuevo acompañado gran parte del tiempo por nuestra inseparable compañera Alyx Vance, siendo esta vez clave en el devenir de la historia (con la inevitable aparición de G-man incluida). La idea de desarrollar tres expansiones (llamadas obviamente Episode One, Two y Three) que complementaran a Half-Life 2 tenían un doble objetivo: por un lado, desarrollar aún más toda la historia tras lo sucedido en HL2 y de paso, enriquecer todo lo que rodea a este gran universo de ciencia-ficción que es Half-Life; y por otro lado, hacer más corta la espera para la siguiente entrega, Half-Life 3. A la vista de los largos, casi eternos, desarrollos de la compañía americana, nos parece sin duda una idea excelente.\nMotor Source vitaminado\nPese a que ya tenemos en ciernes nuevos motores gráficos realmente brutos como el Unreal Engine 3 (Bioshock, Gears of War, Unreal, Tournament III…) y sobre todo, el Crytek Engine 2 desarrollado para el todopoderoso Crysis que sale el mes que viene; el que desarrolló Valve para Half-Life 2, llamado Source sigue manteniendo el tipo más que decentemente tres años después de su salida. Ello es posible gracias a que es bastante escalable y paulatinamente se le han ido añadiendo efectos tales como HDR (alto rango dinámico) y ya en este Ep2, mejores efectos de luces, partículas y texturas, sombreado dinámico y Phong Shading (una variante del Vertex Shading con resultados increíbles en el suavizado de texturas como podremos apreciar en el Vortigaunt que nos ayuda). También se ha mejorado sustancialmente la física del juego (veremos algún derrumbe espectacular) y las expresiones faciales de los personajes, mostrando en conjunto un apartado gráfico poco sorprendente a estas alturas pero si muy bueno.\n\nUn cóctel perfecto:\n\nPese a que gráficamente luce a un gran nivel, el auténtico punto fuerte de la saga siempre radicó en su exquisita jugabilidad. Una combinación magistral de aventura en forma de exploración e ingeniosos puzzles unidos a brillantes momentos de acción. La perfecta curva de dificultad y el gran diseño de niveles hacen el resto. Una verdadera maravilla de los videojuegos. Episodio 2 no iba a ser menos y además no da un sólo momento de respiro. Tan pronto estamos dentro de oscuros e intrincados túneles iluminados sólo por larvas de hormigas león para poco después enfrentarnos a tres raptores (una de las novedades de esta entrega en forma de \"hermanos pequeños\" de los zancudos) en mitad de un bosque o recorremos largos trayectos rurales en un destartalado vehículo. El motor Havok de físicas también ayuda bastante proporcionándonos algunos rompecabezas realmente buenos con mención especial para el del puente semi-derruido. Tampoco podían faltar pequeñas partes de plataformeo, algún que otro susto con los zombies y una interacción con los personajes no jugables sensacional.\n\nLas partes de acción siguen siendo muy espectaculares e irán \"in crescendo\" hasta la antológica batalla final en White Forest donde se alcanza una emoción y dinamismo pocas veces vista en un videojuego (en serio, merece la pena disfrutar esa parte porque es increíble). Tampoco se queda atrás la impactante escena final justo después de la batalla y los hechos que ocurren, preludio claro del próximo episodio.\n\nConclusión:\n\nAl igual que ocurría con el anterior episodio, es inevitable plantearse si merece la pena adquirir esta expansión por sí sola -el pack Orange Box es un verdadero regalo por Steam, teniendo en cuenta todo lo que trae-. Centrándonos en el juego que nos ocupa, Half-Life: Episode Two da para seis, siete horas como mucho si se hace pausadamente y explorando todo en modo de dificultad Normal. Eso si, son seis horas verdaderamente absorbentes con momentos realmente tremendos que pocos videojuegos del género llega a alcanzar. Personalmente opino que este episodio supera con creces al anterior. Además, esta vez han tenido la ingeniosa idea de incluir una serie de logros –como matar un raptor con sus propios proyectiles o encontrar todas las balizas del camino-.","timestamp_created":1599366650,"timestamp_updated":1599366650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75519376","author":{"steamid":"76561198976088075","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":262,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":262,"last_played":1599361485},"language":"english","review":"Better than half life 2 episode 1.

record (21.0 hrs at review time)\nPOSTED: 8 AUGUST\nThis game is a classic that will be hard to beat for many years to come. Whilst the graphics are not up to x box level, the game play and interaction is totally immersive. A.I. is unsurpassed and it is not surprising that the game was voted 5 years on the trot. Some parts of the game can be very infuriating, but that is true of most games, and a trip to You-tube for hints is sometimes the only explanation you will need to evade capture. overall I would give this game and its spin offs 11 out of 10. However, and this is not the place to mention it, but, Black Mesa is far too dark to be encouraging or playable.
