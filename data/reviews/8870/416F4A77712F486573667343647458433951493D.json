different take on Bioshock[/h1]\n\nBioshock infinite might not feel like Rapture with its dark narrow corridors and art deco aesthetic on the contrary Bioshock infinite world is bright and beautiful with its 1800s steampunk aesthetic but beneath its cheerful exterior is a riveting story fit for a Bioshock!\n\nStory: 8/10\nLike a messy jigsaw puzzle at first glance but once you spend a little time trying to understand it hits you and you’re show a beautifully woven story with many complex nuances that leave open ends for you the viewer to have your own take on the events that unfold in Columbia.\nGraphics:9.5/10\nAlthough this game is nearly 10 years old it’s probably one of the most mesmerising games I have ever played and it really feels like a fleshed-out world that could in fact exist  \nGameplay: 8/10\nBioshock infinites gameplay is buttery smooth and feels amazing to play with its wide selection of guns and vigour’s that on can experiment with not to mention the lovely Elizbeth would accompanies you through the entire story without feeling like a burden and helps you when the situations get to dicey situations \nDLC Content: \nBurial at Sea ep 1/2: 9/10\nIt’s just amazing improving upon the core gameplay and my major criticism which is the lack of a weapon wheel as well as encouraging the use of traps and different weapons, not to be overshadowed by the fucking amazing story this is a must play \nClash in the clouds: 5/10\nIf you look past the ridiculous blue-ribbon challenges and the absurd leader board system it’s a fun and challenging DLC (Coming from someone who has finished both rescuer trials in Bioshock 1 and Protector Trials in Bioshock 2) but do get it on sale since it really doesn't add anything to the story\nTechnical issues (Specs Acer Nitro 5 Core I5 8th gen ,16GB ram)\n-Zero its bug free just like it should be and runs amazingly  \nPersonal Criticism (My Opinion) \nThe lack of a weapon wheel and only being able to carry two weapons at a time really discourage the player form trying out new weapons and on top of that the use of traps are non-existent or don’t seem necessary compared to Bioshock 1 and 2.\nConclusion:\nThis is a game everyone should play and its everything a good triple A company should strive to achieve so please give it a try and I’m sure you’ll love every second of it
