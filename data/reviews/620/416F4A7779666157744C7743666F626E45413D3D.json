The newly added components of the game meant that your brain needs an extra few gears to figure out the puzzles and Portal once more became a novelty. However just like its precedessor, it has no replayability values: once you get through a chamber you don't really want to go back. Being able to explore the past background of the first game is a truly wonderful idea, suddenly all the experimentation makes sense. Sort of. The coop aspect is wonderful and extremely funny if you have someone you know and talk to partnering you. Working out the timing and knowing where to go makes each session last longer and much more memorable. Ten thumbs up, just like the first game.
