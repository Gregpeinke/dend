I put quotes around that since it's really more \"showing off\" while simultaneously giving you an idea of where you are and how advanced the technology is, as well as you can move during it (which I didn't know until accidentally hitting a movement key). I like it. But afterwards, it did take a long time to start get through story stuff and get to the action. The first weapon you get, the crowbar, felt very powerful. It swings fast and I used it to kill a guard early before he could shoot me back, which I then I got a gun for. But when past that, the crowbar took way too long to do any meaningful damage, or they are headcrabs... and the crowbar does not work well on headcrabs.\n\nBut most of the other weapons feel pretty good. I don't like how the crossbow feels so stiff to use, but it's super powerful and silent, so I forgive it. You move pretty fast in this game too, which I first thought would be counter-productive to the game's seemingly slow pace. But after a short while, I grew to appreciate it. I also like the puzzle-combat style of the game (is that even a style? idk I kinda made that up just now). You can use a variety of weapons and strategies for almost every situation, some better than others of course. It reminds me of Metal Gear a lot, and I really like Metal Gear.\n\nI was having a lot of fun going through the game, using minimal saves and only dying a few times (except that really hard invisible agent fight. That had a lot of dying before I sat back and outsmarted them). And I then I got to the rocket. I honestly felt like that was the end of the game for a while. It felt like I accomplished the main goal (stop the aliens from teleporting in) and you got to the surface. I though the game was broken when the credits didn't show up, and I didn't find an obvious way to progress. So, with a lot of hesitation, looked it up. You had to backtrack a bit to continue. Fine, ok. Not too big of an issue and it doesn't happen a lot in the game before nor since.\n\nBut after the rocket, the game started to drag. Right afterwards is a water section, which I hate (esp because I get motion sick super easily). And this was also the start of some bullshit enemy teleporting. You are on a narrow walkway that is slippery, causing hard to control sliding. The pool of water below has a tanky, very hard to deal with, pretty fast (also scary) alien fish thing that eats your legs in less than 3 chomps. You have to jump across the gap while sliding on the puddle. You start running across the water, ready to jump, then an alien spawns behind you, zaps you, and since i was at low health, dies. That was pretty frustrating, but no huge deal. But this kept happening. Not very often, but enough and at the most annoying moments, causing it to be frustrating.\n\nAnd not too long after that chapter, the game introduces these bulky armored aliens that have a \"bee\" gun. They shoot homing bees that hurt pretty badly considering they shoot out of the bee gun pretty quickly. These destroy the \"run, think, shoot, live\" slogan to \"run, see bee, shoot, die, reload save, use boring strat, live\". You can't tell when these guys show up, so when you walk into a room to assess the situation and plan an attack / escape and one of these guys notices a slight disturbance in the force, they turn around and shoot you with 8 homing bees which usually cripple you down to 30 or lower health. You can counter them effectively when you get your own bee gun, but you need a lot of bees to kill one, they come out slower, and their homing capabilities are severely neutered. You have to shoot them within what feels like a couple of feet of them for them to home onto. This leads to a lot of long sessions of hiding behind a wall, poking the armored alien with bees, hoping he doesn't walk too much (which either lets him see and shoot you, or makes your bee-poking angle not viable), and sitting there for upwards of 20 seconds to finally play the game normally again. They only start showing up more and more, killing the strategy element of the game for me. Atleast the bee gun has unlimited ammo, which is nice since you run low on ammo occasionally (and melee isn't much of an option).\n\nI feel like the bee gun and the shitty \"teleports behind you\" enemies really start getting annoying when you reach the reactor... which doesn't help since the reactor is more \"go here and press button\" than most other puzzles, especially since the puzzling was replaced with combat. And the combat usually has 2 or 3 bee guys, and I hate bee guys since they kill the game's pace and encourages a dumb cheese strat.\n\nBut the levels were what kept me playing. They either have great puzzles (my favorites being On a Rail and the Invisible ninja fights) or have breathtaking atmosphere (the Xen planet and the areas during Surface Tension for instance). Even the reactor level looked nice and felt like it made sense, on top of a really good teleport sections.\n\nThere are a fair share of annoying bugs though (mouse settings resetting and constantly getting stuck on those flying enemies and inside pipes mainly), but being an old game, I can forgive it for a few bugs here and there. I think It's worth playing game due to it's legacy on it's own; but if you want to play this game purely for it's own merits, I'd still think it'll be a fun ride. If I wanted to be stubborn, I'd stay stop after you launch the rocket. But you will be missing out on some of the best levels if you stop at what I think would've been a great stopping point. Plus maybe the bee guys are not nearly as much of an issue on easier difficulties.\n\n6/10, really great game, and I'm looking forward to the famously incredible sequel. If it weren't for bee guys, it's be more of a 8/10; yes, I hate them that much. They kill pacing, are a pain to deal with more than 1 of at a time (which is almost always the case), and probably single handedly the reason for 75% of my saves and deaths.","timestamp_created":1625717015,"timestamp_updated":1625732471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95301761","author":{"steamid":"76561199131970604","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1660378598},"language":"spanish","review":"ta bien el juego","timestamp_created":1625716064,"timestamp_updated":1625716064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8M+OwvoCcYjG6wI="}
