Зато в этой игре есть:\n- Замечательная графика, которая хорошо смотрится и сейчас благодаря гениальной роботе художника.\n- Реалистичная физика, технологии. Весь уровень усеян объектами с которыми можно и нужно взаимодействовать, пространство чувствуется живее, нету ощущения стерильной комнаты, вы сейчас часто такое видите?\n- Большое разнообразие оружия, универсальной имбы нету, патроны заканчиваются быстро, приходится использовать практически все, конечно с возможностью выбирать.\n- Разнообразные локации. Игра ставит то узкие темные коридоры, то светлые просторные поляны. Ощущение одиночества и опасности чередуется с передышкой с компанией друзей в безопасности. Быстрый экшен, погоня на транспорте, а потом медитативное исследование локации. Игра дает обширный спектр эмоций. Идеальный баланс.\n- Враги. Они действительно разные и запоминаются. Начинаем мы борьбу с мелкими летающими дронами, а заканчиваем с огромными триногами и вертолетами.\n- Персонажи. Их мало, но все они запоминаются и все они к месту. Даже массовка - вроде парочки на диване врезаются в память.\n- Сюжет. Великий сюжет, если вы его не поняли, просто проходите мимо, никто не будет бросать вам бисер.\n\nНу и конечно самое главное, в этой игре есть ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ. То о чем забывают рассказать маркетологи в трейлерах и на громких презентациях E3/Gamescom показывая очередной фальшивый пререндер. В эту игру нужно играть и наблюдать, вас не ведут за ручку от катсцены к катсцене, не заставляют смотреть в определенную точку, можно все проморгать (как было бы и в реальности), задачка не решается QTE или миниигрой в пятнашки - но все просто и элегантно. Играть нужно внимательно иначе пропускаются детали, моменты, но если ты их замечаешь то получаешь особое удовольствие. Тебе не указывают куда идти и что делать жирными маркерами, это понятно само собой и из разговоров. Эта игра совмещает в себе все лучшее. \nHalf-Life 2 - шедевр.\n[spoiler]Эта игра не сложная, но не простая; большая но компактная; разнообразная но без лишнего; про чистых, сильных людей в грязных руинах; про апокалипсис, но дает надежду.[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1322503917,"timestamp_updated":1511997723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491565823554992676","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4971004","author":{"steamid":"76561198043843539","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":77,"last_played":1619763440},"language":"english","review":"A slightly over rated game.

The pacing was really bad, way too many segments where you're just driving, walking around empty spaces or waiting for dialogue or similiar, breaking the flow of the gameplay. The combat also doesn't feel very engaging and, unlike it's predecessor, requires almost no strategy whatsoever aside from \"shoot the head\" or \"throw grenade at this position that's very obviously designed to have a grenade thrown at\"\n\nThe source engine was and still is amazing, but from back when It first came out and even now I still fail to see the appeal of Half-Life 2's gameplay, which just feels vastly inferior to 1's in every possible way. The guns are pretty boring compared to 1's guns too. No gauss canon, no snarks, no laser mines, no nothing. Just the most generic bare minimum weapon variety any shooter could have. And the gravity gun is something you use during one chapter, ravenholm, and then almost never use again, unless a puzzle requires it.\n\nThis is by no means a bad game, infact it's very good, but honestly, I never liked it very much, and if you ask me it's probably the most overrated game of all time. There's way better singleplayer shooters out there that are similiar but more engaging. Even back then. As such, unless you want to experience a piece of gaming history, I can not recommend this game nowadays.
