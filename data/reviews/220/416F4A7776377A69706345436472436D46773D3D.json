There are a couple of segments that are probably longer than they should be (hovercraft, dune buggy) but if you can tough those out, the game is awesome. Took about 9 hours to finish.

questo gioco è piuttosto banale, ma nonostante il successo non ci avevo mai giocato, ma da un lato forse è meglio perchè, avendo accumulato una discreta esperienza con sparatutto di ogni tipo posso benissimo fare dei paragoni.\nLa prima caratteristica che ho notato, rispetto agli altri FPS, è che Half-Life 2 è un gioco INTELLIGENTE: non è un semplice sparatutto a \"rotaia\" ma bisogna interagire spesso con gli oggetti ed utilizzare la logica per proseguire nei diversi livelli.\nIn secondo luogo la storia convolgente: in pochi giochi del genere ho trovato trame così interessanti e soprattutto coerenti con i capitoli precedenti (anche se piccola nota dolente, il doppiaggio di diversi personaggio è inascoltabile).\nTerzo punto di forza sono sicuramente le ambientazioni che reggono il passo con la frenesia del gioco, molto dettagliate e curate, che spaziano da luoghi aperti, a cuniculi bui che riescono a dare un senso di claustrofobia, a strutture fatiscenti dove un uso impeccabile di luci e ombre rendono l'esperienza di gioco più realistica e convincente dove tutto può accadere in qualsiasi momento, mantenendo il giocatore sempre all'erta.\nSe non lo avete fatto:
