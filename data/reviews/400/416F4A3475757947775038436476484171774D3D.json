Even though it was released in 2007, the community still loves this game! I played it recently again and I fully understand why this game is called a \"classic\".\nThe story can be described as: You are the test subject and you have to solve several puzzles while a robotic voice comments on your progress and leads you through your whole playthrough to find something \"unusual\".\nYou are only equipped with a portal gun and the puzzles require some time of thinking. I had a lot of fun to find my way through the different puzzles. The more you progress the more difficult they get. The graphics might be old school, but it still looks good for that time. The controls and humor were smooth, so I enjoyed playing it! \nIf you enjoy puzzle games and you enjoyed the mechanics of the Half Life games, you will definitely enjoy playing this
