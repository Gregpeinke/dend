to believe this game is creeping up on 10 years old.

I would absolutely die for a new game exploring this fantastic location. \n\nI know a lot of people will compare Infinite to Bioshock 1 and 2 however honestly I dont think they deserve comparison at all. The game shares enough of the base mechanics to be a Bioshock game yet is very clearly its own entity at the same time.\nThe attention to story building and lore is fantastic, the way it slowly transitions from a beautiful metropolis to a ruined creepy city in the sky. The characters and their voice actors are immersive and interesting enough to want to explore more.\n\nIn all other games I am someone who skips cut scenes and dialogue but here I was actively seeking out all the additional recordings and interactions.\nIts one of very few games where I have watched countless videos of peoples interpretations of the detail of the game within the engaging story line which reveals itself over time. \n\nIt fits a genre that appeals to me, a fast pace action adventure game which has an immersive storyline. This factor alienated the original Bioshock fans as the element of horror and real threat is essentially removed for around 90% of the game.

I loved it when I was younger but now that I'm playing it for the first time in years, the game is really has nothing to it. When you strip away its beauty, there's not much else to behold, which btw, about an hour or so into the game, everything gets dark and ugly anyway. It's like in Regular Show when sh(i)t gets serious and all of a sudden there's a red tint on the screen. \nAnyway\nEverything that made the first two games unique was stripped away, and I do mean everything. Bioshock will probably always be somewhat notorious for its political themes which were definitely all in your face, what with Andrew Ryan being a clear reference to Ayn Rand, but it was more of a background story. Hardly even necessary to know what happened to the world around you, as it's made clear there was a civil war, but the knowing of why helps the story become fleshed out. Infinite seems to want to make the player uncomfortable rather than think. It is constantly, and I do mean constantly shoving what it would like you to think in your face. Seriously, go into a hair salon or something, and for no reason at all there's racist caricatures EVERYWHERE. The game forces you to attend a raffle and it was really cute and seemed heartwarming until out of the blue you have to choose whether or not you'll throw a baseball at an interracial couple. It doesn't matter what you choose to do. Nothing does. The whole \"racism bad\" narrative goes NOWHERE. Almost nothing you do or see goes anywhere. I'm fairly certain the game could be cut 9 hours and lose... nothing. All of a sudden, seriously, a few minutes after Elizabeth says the Vox can make a positive change for the city, she starts talking about how Daisy is no different than Comstock. ????? I don't care + what a stupid comment. I get it tho, different sides of the spectrum are bad when you go too far.\n The player isn't allowed to think for themselves. Everything the creators wanted us to ask, Elizabeth asked. Everything they wanted us to comment on, Elizabeth does, and so does Booker. \nWeapons are f(u)cking ass; you can only carry two, and to upgrade them is absolutely pointless because you'll end up having to throw it down to fight a specific enemy with a sniper or explosives. Not to mention how expensive it is for a single upgrade. The original Bioshock let you do it for FREE and it actually made a difference in gameplay.\nPlasmids, or, vigors in this game are f(u)cking useless, I will not elaborate.\nNO memorable characters except Elizabeth. Yes, even Booker is forgettable.\nYou fight the same enemies over and over and over. Every once in a while some b(i)tch will have a rocket and maybe you'll fight a robot but who cares? Just spam rockets at it.\ni dont really feel like writing this review anymore but the quantum physics and time travel and bringing things into the world that died is so fucking boring I wanted Elizabeth to just open a tear to paris and keave I mean why tf did all of this even happen.... We all saw in the tower when she opened the tear and could literally step inn if she wanted. But the creators made up some bs like \"Oh but elizabeth would miss the bird!!!\" But then elizabeth starts cryinng like a b(it)ch and begging booker not to let the bird take her back to the tower. ho you can just leave.\nim gonna keep playing tho i trying to 100% the game","timestamp_created":1654225889,"timestamp_updated":1654226312,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491746395826339722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116401915","author":{"steamid":"76561198086155789","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1454,"last_played":1654336132},"language":"english","review":"gud","timestamp_created":1654217824,"timestamp_updated":1654217824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116394287","author":{"steamid":"76561198256386906","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":4088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3973,"last_played":1654298185},"language":"english","review":"Despite being almost ten years old, this game is still an incredible experience.
