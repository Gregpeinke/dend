man chooses.A slave OBEY.[/spoiler]为了对抗哥伦比亚，必须做出一些选择，而这一切只是将自己置于无尽杀戮中自我毁灭，你唯一能选择的，则是[spoiler]在这一切发生之前消灭自己[/spoiler]。bioshock infinite有着许多法国大革命的侧影，前半部分是独裁体制下的暴政和歧视，后半部分则是暴民们腥风血雨的革命滥杀，甚至是攻占巴士底监狱的完整复刻。在这个大前提下，无论是黛西还是康斯托克，都是完成这个轮回的一部分。\n不得不说，对于世界观的创造，Bioshock Infinite中还是体现了一定程度的机心，对于康斯托克造神运动及由此产生的政教合一政体、白人至上的法西斯主义、黄祸论、拥奴论，集中谴责了社会的集体盲目性以及对至高无上力量极其人间代言人的天然崇拜以及后期民粹主义的大清洗。不过对于bioshock 1的空想社会主义的乌托邦---Rapture来说还是略显浅薄。\n\n[quote=<You Belong To Me>---Courtnee

Infinite本体剧情让我震撼于其奇妙的世界观的话，DLC海葬二部曲则如一部浪漫悲情电影一样，让我面对Elizabeth的结束戳中泪点，或者换句话说，哭的像条狗。[/b]\n没错，对于Elizabeth,集勇敢坚强和善良可爱与一身，令人怜惜而又畏惧，她有着让那些反复跑腿任务变得短暂难忘的魔力，能够与不同的场景互动，服装也会随着场景的不同而改变，并且当我进男女厕搜刮时还不忘吐槽一番，还捏着鼻子跟着进女厕，或者站在男厕外不时对在厕所内搜刮的我对话。[spoiler]突然，这时我觉得我恋爱了XD。可能，这就是鬼父吧。[/spoiler]战斗时会在补给血量亏空时给你弹药、血包，不时会掷给你金币，还不会受伤，让我复活，甚至是过度依赖。直到她被抓住后，突然失去她的我极度不适应，发疯似的跟着剧情寻找她，好像剧情会因为这样缩短一样，对于Elizabeth，我无法再要求更多。\n也是Elizabeth这个整个Bioshock中陪你度过一半时光的最重要的角色，[spoiler]算起来,她已经成功杀死了玩家2次，而她自己也选择牺牲---至少两次[/spoiler]，而在《海葬：第二章》里失去能力的她，即使未来不再清晰，但伴随着贯穿整个第二章的La Vie En Rose，一如她玫瑰一般的人生---刺痛但甜美。她也知道自己早已做出了选择，[spoiler]她抛弃了梦中的巴黎而选择葬生海底冷冰冰的金属棺材中[/spoiler]，[h1]于是，她开始在旅途中一点点讲述曾经急忙而未说的故事，那些常量，那些变量，那些故事背后的故事。Elizabeth知道这是她最后的一程，也如Irrational Games知道故事已经到了结尾。Elizabeth在冰凉孤独的深海中与“布克”不断交谈。回忆着自己最心爱的人,你的世界除我外 再无她人[/h1]\n至此，最后一个Elizabeth的使命也已经完成。命运的轮回再次归一。\n在不久的将来，命运的轮回能否不被打破？\n\n是的，我坚信无论怎样，肯定还有最后一个时空，Elizabeth和Booker永远在彼此身边，在巴黎塞纳河畔永不分离。\n\n\n[b]最后又去玩了遍Bioshock1我全程用管钳把Frank
