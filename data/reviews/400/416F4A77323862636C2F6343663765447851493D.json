This game was released on 2007, it's  2021 now, so it's been 13 years and a couple months and it stays relevant. On 13 years this game has meant a lot to many people, they grew with it, they replayed it, theyre still buying it and recommending it. Why?\nBecause they made this game with care, passion, something barely known in the AAA game industry nowadays.\nSurpassed possibly only by its sequel, Portal is proof you don't need the most complicated of engines, or the longest written convoluted story, or the most game mechanics that you can fit in a game, to make a lovable game that will be relevant for generations.\nIt has unique puzzle solving, not too complicated, not too easy, but quite clever. Experimenting with, you guessed, Portals, and physics, to achieve the solution\nAnd there IS a story, it is not a long complicated thing that you have to read online, it's pretty straightforward, but it does have some hidden details that you will have to find by paying attention to the levels and dialogue, which is also connected to the Half Life franchise, oh, and dialogue is filled with actually funny, not forced, not annoying, laugh-at-your-own-demise jokes and dark humour.\nThere aren't many characters, but the few there are you'll never forget. You'll really just be dealing with: a clever funny AI trying to force you into eating some cake, some really dumb turrets, and, quite possibly the love of your life, a cube. They are all so charming that you cannot help but to love them even when they try to shoot you dead or force you into their weird party cake-lovers cult, (must be a fetish)\nIt is not too long, but it is long enough for you to feel satisfied after completing it, wanting more. And short enough for you to feel like replaying it any time, or doing the challenges.\nGraphically speaking, it might not be the best of the best, but then again, it was 2007, this game still holds up amazingly well for today, thanks to its engine. The best part is, thanks to said Source Engine, this game will run on almost anything while still looking great, like most Source Engine games.\nAnd finally, its pretty cheap, why would you not buy an amazing cheap game?\nIf you somehow never played this before, you really should, there's plenty of reasons why this game remains relevant to this day, being referenced on many other games and inspiring them too, I just listed a few of them but you really should experience them yourself and build your memories from it, because it will remain relevant for years to come, as the great game that it is\n","timestamp_created":1611520845,"timestamp_updated":1611520845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85288494","author":{"steamid":"76561198152064225","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":728,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":728,"last_played":1560515418},"language":"koreana","review":"기믹이

Portal and Portal 2 are Valve's true classics, the former being shipped with Half-Life 2 in the famous Orange Box release that forced so many fans to adopt this industry-ending platform known as Steam.\n\nPortal was a novel experience when it first arrived, a short-ish game that was kind of a tech demo in reality but delivered an entertaining monologue inspiring some of the decade's best memes. It's an interesting case where the protagonist is not really the main character, because--while the puzzle/platforming aspect of the game is fun and innovative--the real charm of Portal is the commentary from the true main character/antagonist of the series, GLaDOS. You will find yourself messing around in the test chambers, or even just standing still and doing nothing to try to provoke the snarky AI to fire off some witty insult or obvious \"enhancement\" of the truth.\n\nThere are only two negatives I can say about the game:\n\n1. The challenge levels really aren't worth the pain unless you're insistent on collecting the achievements. I completed all of them and I would say about half of them are more frustrating than fun. The last one in particular is brutal and I only completed it because I had beaten the previous 5 and figured I had come too far to not complete them all.\n2. It's not uncommon to experience motion sickness from this game. Partly due to the reality-bending portal usage, but really it's the FOV. You might want to experiment with the FOV levels when you start the game. The default setting is not popular with many players.\n\n\nPS This game introduces the cutest enemies you will encounter in gaming. You ALMOST feel bad for defeating them.","timestamp_created":1611429857,"timestamp_updated":1611449137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85220387","author":{"steamid":"76561198839944372","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":1611427399},"language":"russian","review":"[i] \"Экспериментальный центр напоминает вам о том, что кубы не умеют разговаривать.
