You're doing yourself a disservice if you have not played this one. I'm ashamed to say I've had this in my library for years and have only just got round to it. Why???!\n\nValve set a high bar with the first Portal game ( which I played immediately before this) but they've managed to surpass it in pretty much every way. \n\nFirst up, I'm amazed by the creativity of the level design. How do these guys come up with this stuff? The levels are delightful, and with the exception of one level it was not necessary to go online for help. Regarding the core single player game and speaking as a fairly average gamer, I'd say they've pitched the difficulty nigh-on perfect. It might be the best puzzle games I've ever played. That said, I haven't got to the advanced maps. Based on my experience of the first game, these are going to be taxing, but in the most enjoyable way!\n\nIf the outstanding core puzzle game wasn't enough, Valve have managed to wrap this package around a brilliantly told  roller coaster story which keeps you wanting to play to see what happens next.  GladOS is as charismatic as ever, and the new character Wheatley is a welcome new addition to the Portal universe. \n\nOn the merits of the single player game I'[m recommending as I've yet to play co-op. Everything I've seen suggests that might be even more fun than the single player.\n\nSummary: an amazing game that is of the calbre of Half Life 2..
