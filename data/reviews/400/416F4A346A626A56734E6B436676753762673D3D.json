Well, now with the holidays sales, this was just the perfect opportunity to finally get Portal and Portal 2, and I definitely don't regret.\n\nThis first game is fairly short—I'd say 4 hours on the first playthrough, if one's not too coordination-challenged—but it doesn't make it less interesting: advanced maps as well as additional achievements become available once you've completed it once, so there's a replayability factor here. That, and GLaDOS's antics and taunts, which I always find pretty funny. And the Companion Weighted Cube. Yes, I find this adorable. Even the turrest are somewhat cute.
