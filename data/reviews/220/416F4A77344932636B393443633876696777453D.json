Krásná grafika ve skvělé optimalizaci mi na mém, tehdy obstarožním, PC nedělala problémy. Atmosféra a takový ten feeling povědomosti města a všeobecně krajiny umožnil rychlé ztotožnění se s hrou. Uvěřitelná NPC a kousaví nepřátelé to ještě umocnili. Perfektní průchod hororovým Ravenholmem, dodnes se mi ježí chlupy při tom pomyšlení. Sem tam humorné odlehčení. A když to dáme všechno dohromady? To byla prostě symfonie. \nDnes už je pro mnohé hráče mnohé z toho mnou zmíněného pryč. A pro ty, kdo by HL2 zkusili až dnes, už asi nepůjde o nic než mírně nadprůměrnou střílečku. Já si však dodnes užívám každé chvíle v kůži Gordona Freemana, toho nemluvného hrdiny. \nJe snad jen škoda, že krom dvou standalone datadisků se už nejspíše do světa HL nepodíváme.

Even though it's over 10 years old, the graphics still hold up today, and the story may be the best I've seen in a video game. It is absolutely worth checking out, and I still hope that we'll get HL2:E3 or HL3 eventually. The HL community is still going strong after almost 20 years, and with the \"Epistle 3\" story published, the fans are even more eager for a new installment. I wrote this review just to show Valve that people still care about this series, and especially this game in particular. There's a very small chance that anyone at Valve will ever see this, and that's ok. I only ask the fans of this game to keep supporting it, and to keep telling Valve what they want. One thing that I absolutely do not understand is all of the new reviews giving HL2 thumbs down claiming \"This is for HL3\". What does that really accomplish? We won't get another Half Life if we give it's best title bad reviews. If you want to hate on Dota 2 or Artifact for \"killing\" the HL franchise, then please go over there. Half Life 2 is a great game, maybe my favorite game of all time. I hope we'll see a new game eventually, but until then, all we can do is wait, and enjoy the great experiences we already have.
