This is balanced with plenty of humor, lightening the mood often enough to stave off the need for numerous breaks, but thankfully not overdoing it & allowing the gravity of situations to be maintained. For those concerned about the game's length, it's easily two to three times longer than the first in single player.\nThe addition of co-op will surely add hours to the game's replay value & there's even some aesthetic-only downloadable content for the co-op section; for those TF2 fans whose main question is \"...but will there be hats?\" the answer is a resounding \"Yes, there are several.\"\nIn conclusion, money well spent; a great game.","timestamp_created":1303385206,"timestamp_updated":1303385206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4487558","author":{"steamid":"76561198037947641","num_games_owned":957,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":13062,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7156,"last_played":1647646167},"language":"english","review":"This game is the sequel to what many people claim the second coming of Christ.
