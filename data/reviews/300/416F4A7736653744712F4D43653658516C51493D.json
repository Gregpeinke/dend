going through the server browser and seeing all the gaming \"clans\" was a trip. Here I thought gaming clans were completely extinct by now but sure enough the only populated servers on this game are owned and populated by clans. This was a heartwarming blast from the past; even if I did find out later that the age demographic for clans has somewhat changed from when I was playing CoD from 2006-2014 on console.\nSo I ended up joining a server with a bunch people who I learned were all 30-40 year old ex-military guys. I didn't talk much and decided I'd just learn how the game works and listen to them have their conversations. They all knew each other on a first name basis and talked about gun control, the guns they own, the guns they want, the \"problem\" with this country, their ex-wives, millennials, border patrol, and they shared a few jokes that you wouldn't repeat in mixed company. I played for a couple hours and started to get a hang of how the game worked then got kicked for going 40-10.\nThe game itself is OK. The gameplay isn't going to knock your socks off or anything. But the community is something to behold and I recommend everyone tries being a fly on the wall on some of these clan servers. And if you're a divorced ex-military republican guy looking for like-minded friends then look no further.\n","timestamp_created":1596640796,"timestamp_updated":1596640796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73814047","author":{"steamid":"76561198852622854","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":422,"last_played":1611846852},"language":"english","review":"A realistic game with a tight community","timestamp_created":1596634489,"timestamp_updated":1596634489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73801299","author":{"steamid":"76561198120925304","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":441,"last_played":1601237361},"language":"english","review":"takes like 5 years to get all the achievements but its alright","timestamp_created":1596612726,"timestamp_updated":1596612726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505703389644622803","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73798616","author":{"steamid":"76561198811584753","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":704,"last_played":1624220950},"language":"brazilian","review":"⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣯⣥⣤⣾⠟⡛⠿⠿⣭⣻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⣿⣽⡟⡏⢩⣦⡝⠋⢸⣶⠄⢲⡟⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣯⣷⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣶⣌⡳⣜⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⢀⡛⢌⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠁⠄⠙⠌⣸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠉⠉⠉⠉⢿⣿⣿⣿⠏⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠆⠄⠁⠄⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡗⠫⠿⠆⠄⠸⢿⣿⣿⠂⠒⠲⡿⠛⠛⠂⠄⠄⢠⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⡛⣧⡔⠢⠴⣃⣠⣼⣿⣧⡀⠘⢢⣀⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⢈⠁⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣶⣿⠄⠄⠄⣸⠆⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣼⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡀⠄⠘⡀⢠⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡌⠿⣫⣿⣦⠬⢭⣥⣶⣬⣾⣿⢿⣿⡟⠄⢀⣿⣶⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠘⣉⠛⢻⣛⣛⣛⣻⡶⠮⠙⠃⣉⠄⠄⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡆⠸⣿⣶⢾⣿⣯⣤⣄⣀⣾⡟⠄⠄⠄⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⠟⠿⠿⠿⠿⢿⣷⠄⣿⣿⣎⣹⢻⣿⣿⡿⡿⠁⠄⠄⠄⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⣠⠘⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⠁⣀⣀⣀⠄⠘⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿","timestamp_created":1596607634,"timestamp_updated":1657951038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73758536","author":{"steamid":"76561199019717213","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1800,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1728,"last_played":1628108203},"language":"english","review":"Throwback, simple, fun.","timestamp_created":1596558205,"timestamp_updated":1596558205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73755368","author":{"steamid":"76561198153304376","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7408,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7257,"last_played":1598992651},"language":"polish","review":"Spoko gierka","timestamp_created":1596554193,"timestamp_updated":1596554193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73736542","author":{"steamid":"76561198233039404","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":761,"last_played":1646088518},"language":"english","review":"i like vimeo game it hads lots of violins","timestamp_created":1596527054,"timestamp_updated":1596527054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73722432","author":{"steamid":"76561198421599763","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":54387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":49009,"last_played":1658886153},"language":"english","review":"Awesome Game\n","timestamp_created":1596495421,"timestamp_updated":1596495421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73720415","author":{"steamid":"76561198253742027","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":94,"playtime_forever":577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":482,"last_played":1605945087},"language":"english","review":"This game is very good. It is a Half life 2 mod set in 1994 at the start of World War 2. You can play as one of two sides, that being the Allied teams or the Axis powers. Both sides have many classes to pick from, each with their own guns and ways of defending themselves. Gameplay in this game is straight forward, shoot the enemy until they die. Its as simple as a FPS can get. You can also interact with the world around you, opening doors, and moving objects to better hide yourself. The replay ability in this game is good, I wouldn't say its amazing, but from the help of the community always adding new material to the game, like maps, guns, and types of matches you can enter, it is a overall very good, entertaning game. It is worth full price, that being 9.99 or I think 4.99 on sale. I do have one gripe that I don't belive it mentions it having a singleplayer.

It's got some realism to it, but it's not super realistic either, which I find to be about perfect. It's basically a similar thing to Team Fortress. You have two teams (US Army & Wehrmacht), and on each team you can select between 6 different classes. Each class has a different weapon:\n\nRifleman, which has an M1 Garand on Allies & a Kar98k on Axis.\nAssault, which has a Thompson on Allies & an MP40 on Axis\nSupport, which has a M1918 BAR on Allies & an STG44 on Axis\nSniper, which has an M1903 Springfield on Allies & a Scoped Kar98k on Axis.\nMachine Gunner, which has an M1919 .30 Cal on Allies & an MG42 on Axis\nand Rocket, which has a Bazooka on Allies & a Panzerschrek on Axis.\n\nThere's also secondaries in the game. Most classes have a pistol, M1911 or P38, all classes have some melee option, and some of the classes also have grenades. The Rocket class also has it's own secondary, the M1 Carbine for Allies & the C96 Schnellfeuer.\n\nIn the game there are a few maps that come with the game, with a few different gamemodes, plus plenty of custom maps people have made for the game. One of the gamemodes is what I would call \"Control Points\". There are usually five points on a map, and you can go and capture any of them. Different points can require a different amount of people to capture, but it's usually one or two. Once one team captures all of the points, they win the round. The second gamemode I would call \"Detonation\". The point is to plant bombs and diffuse planted bombs on certain points. One way this gamemode is done is where one team is defending, and the other is attacking. The attacking team has to plant and the defending team has to diffuse. The only map like this in the regular game is dod_jagd. The other way this gamemode is done is where both teams have to plant and diffuse bombs, such as in dod_colmar. I hope that anyone who sees this game gives it a change because the player count is dwindling slowly, and it's a really good game.","timestamp_created":1595533842,"timestamp_updated":1622812296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73173587","author":{"steamid":"76561198800843568","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":98,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":98,"last_played":1595523139},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun ölü arkadaşlar Fazla Aktiflik yok \n","timestamp_created":1595529742,"timestamp_updated":1595529742,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73173407","author":{"steamid":"76561198341988028","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1607369540},"language":"spanish","review":"Un clásicazo\n\nshooter rápido y casual al mejor estilo Counter Strike pero de la 2da Guerra Mundial\n\nLo único malo del juego es las pocas facciones existentes comparadas a su antecesor DOD 1.3 que traía ingleses, y paracaidistas alemanes, más armas y variedad de cosas.

Fora isso, é bem diferente.\n\n[h1] RESUMO: Se der, compre em promoção e não se arrependerá. O jogo é bom, mas para os padrões de hoje, não vale os R$ 20,00. Sorte minha que comprei por 10% desse valor na última promoção da Steam [/h1]\n\nO jogo possui uma comunidade fiel e experiente, a maioria dos jogadores são maiores de 18 anos (pelo menos é o que acredito), jogar nos servidores TZ (Tolerância Zero ) e DTB (Dominated Brasil) é como estar em um bar, a maioria se conhece e conversa assuntos variados, mesmo não participando, você se sente parte da roda. Ambos os servidores são 99% brasileiros, conversam em voice e possuem baixo ping.\n\nPor contar com uma comunidade antiga (muitos deles jogam desde o Day of Defeat da GoldScr) os jogadores possuem uma habilidade maior com as mecânicas do jogo e com as armas, além de conhecerem bem os mapas, o que dificulta o aprendizado de novos players. A classe de bazuka é extremante irritante. Ainda assim é possível matar o tempo jogando, conversando e se divertindo.\n\nOs mapas, mesmo os oficiais, não são muito balanceados. Acredito que em uma tentativa de mostrar o avanço de tropas em áreas dominadas e/ou tentando inovar as mecânicas do FPS, tenha sido criado mapas muito desbalanceados, há mapas com corredores únicos para se avançar no terreno, sendo um dos times quem possui o domínio destes desde o início da partida. O problema dos mapas oficias com certeza vêm desde o Day of Defeat da GoldScr, já que o Day of Defeat: Source é apenas um remake para a Source, como o Half-Life: Source (só que um port bem melhor do que o do Half-Life).\n\nAté o momento não encontrei nenhum bug no jogo, parece um jogo sólido nessa questão.\n\nHá também mapas criados pela comunidade como o Victoria que são extremamente divertidos e interessantes, outros caóticos que contam até com fantasmas e camas que voam.","timestamp_created":1594907100,"timestamp_updated":1594907540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550172984600067139","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72779533","author":{"steamid":"76561199044767621","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1632685254},"language":"turkish","review":"Çok iyi fizikleri felan da Adamlar hakkari dağ komandosu gibi oynuyo mk","timestamp_created":1594895642,"timestamp_updated":1594895642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":21,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61538463830947876","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72778331","author":{"steamid":"76561198999859743","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":4953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":366,"last_played":1655834044},"language":"russian","review":"Кажется я выучил польский и немецкий","timestamp_created":1594893498,"timestamp_updated":1594893498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6e7Dq/MCe6XQlQI="}
