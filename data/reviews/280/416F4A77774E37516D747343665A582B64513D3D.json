You know the answer we know the answer to this and is a pure AAA game when the games where made with true passion and love.\n\nWell lets talk a bit about this version build, well has a LOT OF BUGS, but none of them where gamebreaking to be honest, at least for me I just needed to reload the last save to fix them, like \"Ghost Apaches\" where I couldn't hit any rocket lol, not working trampolines and many others you may know, but what I really liked about this build was the rebuilt and reworked models and the implemention of the Source Engine capabilities and features where sooooo good and for me made the immersion of the game much better you felt it and I really liked it was a new experience for me also re-living the moments I had when I was a kid and I played it back in 1998-99 I felt like a kid again lol rejoicing the moment hehe pretty good.\n\nThe difficulty of the game was average, sometimes hard, sometimes easy, but pretty balanced. I like that. \n\nIf you like this game you should try Black Mesa too it's a great remake too, and what more what can I say about this...\n\nWell... you should get this game. I recommend get the original ALWAYS and not this version, unless you want a new experience after playing the original first or Black Mesa if you want, your choice.

When I first read they were rebuilding the original Half-Life title using the Source engine I thought it would be a proper remaster.\n\nLike everyone else, I was a little depressed when I found out it was the same old blurry 90's game just on a newer engine. The physics were improved as well as the superb lighting and shadows you get from the Source engine. Oddly though, the one thing that did get new textures/meshes etc was the water. So you end up with this old school crappy 90's texture right next to brand new 2004 era water textures/meshes which made no sense at all.\n\nI can look past all that above and just respect the fact that I can play the classic game on a newer engine with slight improvements here and there but...there is more to this story than just what we have read so far.\n\nThe game is absurdly buggy. It is like Valve gave up. The notion to fix the problems this game brings went right out the window with the notion to finish Half-Life 2: Episode 3.\n\nReally folks, you are much better off just buying the original. Valve did a great job updating the GoldSRC engine to play well on modern systems and the original Half-Life even has modern widescreen resolution support and everything.\n\nDo yourself a favor and do NOT buy this \"remaster\" and get the original instead.

While the orange box was a great investment, I made the mistake of buying this botched version of Half Life and not the original up until recently. The gameplay is very unstable, far more bugs than the original, doors/switchs sometimes are unresponsive, some bosses dont behave as they should and the enemy AI is broken. The only upside I guess is the graphics, they look a little bit better and updated, but that hardly makes up for this broken mess.
