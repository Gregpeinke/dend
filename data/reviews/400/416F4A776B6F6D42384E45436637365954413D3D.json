Undoubtly a game worth getting but would recommend waiting until it is on sale. The game is far too short to be worth $10 (mind I got it and its successor for $5 in a bundle during the Winter Sale of 2015). I see no cons in this game.

I may even say it will never age - after all, the game is 8 years old, and it's still graphically competent by today's standards since it never really strives to be anything more than what it is, and that's actually pretty admirable. It's not, by any means, superficial is what I'm saying; what's there needs to be there, and what IS there satiates your needs for pitch-black comedy, solid gameplay and all that.

Portal is an innovative masterpiece. It blends in first person shooter and puzzle mechanic incredibly well. \n\n[h1] Pros [/h1] \n-Graphics look amazing mainly because the setting doesn't require much detail.\n\n-Gameplay with the portal gun is incredibly fun, and the physics are really accurate from what I can tell. The puzzles while not incredibly difficult, do require you to think before you act. One of the few games that really requires you to use your brain.\n\n-The atmosphere my god it really gets to you. The location you're in the entire game is a secluded lab, all with a plain color scheme. It really helps give you that claustrophobic feeling of being trapped. Glados, the robotic voice that accompanies you on your journey and guides you while serving as a sort of comedy relief, also gives you a sense of dread. Mainly because you don't know what her intentions really are. Especially near the end of the game, you start to feel even more trapped and helpless, and I found myself actually nervous on what would happen. \n\n-The story is kept very vague to you throughout most of the game. You don't know who you are, how you got to where you started, or what is at the end of all the tests. You just keep trudging forward because you want answers. It does a very good job of making you feel clueless, so nice job Valve.\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \nReally the only downside is that the game is fairly short, and you could finish the storyline in 2-3 sittings (or one if you're truly dedicated). However there are bonus maps to play on, and speedruns are always fun. Not to mention there's a commentary playthrough which I highly recommend trying out, and it has the team talk to you about what went on when designing the game. \n\nI bought this game as a five dollar bundle during a Steam Sale that came with Portal 2, which I'm very excited to get to. So I have no regrets buying it. So if you don't want to pay 10 dollars for this, at the very least purchase it when it's on sale. This game needs to be in your library.

It's a Valve game. It's classic. It's fun. It doesn't lower your IQ. It's at times challenging, it can take me a couple minutes to figure out a test chamber challenge and then it could take me a hour to figure another one. \nI give this game a 10/10. Why shouldn't it get that much? No bugs or glitches, the game play isnt dry, the puzzles keep you on the edge of your seat and it's most importantly, fun. \nDo I recommend it?... no...
