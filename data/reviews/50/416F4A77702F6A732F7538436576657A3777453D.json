When people say this is one of the best expansions ever made, they're not joking.\n\nI didn't really like the original base game of Half-Life despite its innovations and advancements, because the frustrating bits completely ruined the immersion and experience for me. But Opposing Force has very little if not zero frustrating parts, and is overall much more enjoyable.\n\nOpposing Force is incredibly immersive, and I actually felt the tension and connection to our silent protagonist the whole time. I think the story here is told in a much better way than the base game, but to properly enjoy it, you must have played the original game first.\n\nWell, there's not much to say here, it's more Half-Life, with less frustrating bits and more refined good parts. You can do a lot more here, actually; there's lots of new weapons to use, lots of new enemies to fight, and you can even command allied squads sometimes! The level design here is great, with tons of areas where you have to actually think to progress, but not as difficult and frustrating as Half-Life.
