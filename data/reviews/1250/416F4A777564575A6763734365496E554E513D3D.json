You gotta survive wave after wave of different \"specimens\", or try to complete a specific set of tasks alone, or with friends, to fight the boss at the end of the waves, the Patriarch. Not like you wanna play this game alone, though, it's quite unforgiving if you don't know what you are doing.\n\nThis game is NOT, I repeat, NOT noob friendly. I got to meet lots of players that got this game just because they pre-ordered it for TF2 items. (Lame, right?) They would start a game on normal, and they would get clot bombed in a few minutes. After that, they would start to flame this game, about how much it sucked just because they are ASS at this game. Personally, it kicked my ass a lot, but I still loved this game. Something about it's gameplay never gets old.\n\n7 classes, all of them with their specific roles and playstyles. \n\nAmbient wise, this game is pretty good. You get tons of maps, both official and custom made, so you can go around looking at something different all the time.\n\nNow, one of my favorite aspects about this game, other than the gameplay, other than the ambient, other than everything else: The motherfucking soundtrack. Being a huge lover of metal myself, this game does it right, it does make you feel empowered and ready to kick ass, and that, combined with the delightful sounds of killing your enemies and popping skulls, is pretty much an orgasm.\n\nThe graphics might be kinda dated, characters might look a bit stiff, some details are simple, and stuff like that, but hey, graphics aren't everything, right sunshine? \n\nThis game has a steep learning curve, even for normal difficulty, now, if you are talking about Hell on Earth....Jeez, it's so fucking hard, yet so  rewarding.\n\nThis is one of the games that I would definitely recommend without thinking much about it. It's not that expensive (Unless you wanna get all DLC), and if you are willing to learn how to play this, this game is definitely worth your money. What are you waiting for?

В основе обеих игр лежит одна и та же идея: борьба команды вооруженных людей с напирающими отовсюду зомби. Правда, по сравнению с хитом от [b]Valve[/b] детище Tripwire выглядит неряшливым и потасканным, зато в нем есть прокачка персонажей, зомби-невидимки и товарно-денежные отношения.[/b]\n\n\n[h1]Как все начиналось?[/h1]\n\n[b]Killing Floor[/b] выросла из любительской модификации [b]Unreal Tournament 2004[/b]. Поэтому говорить о заимствовании идей у [b]Left 4 Dead[/b] не приходится – концепцию командного зомби-шутера создатели игры выработали сами. В прошлом году они обратились в студию [b]Tripwire Interactive[/b] с предложением включить их творение в качестве мода в шутер [b]Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45[/b]. Однако руководство компании сочло [b]Killing Floor[/b] достаточно перспективным для превращения в самостоятельную игру.\n\n\n[h1]О чем это?[/h1]\n\nИ успей эта игра появиться до [b]Left 4 Dead[/b], отзывы могли бы быть куда восторженнее. Просто сейчас нам есть с чем сравнивать. Суть [b]Killing Floor[/b] заключается в борьбе группы из шести человек против монстров-зомби, которые заполонили улицы Лондона в результате неудачного правительственного эксперимента. Для истребления нежити солдаты используют огнестрельное оружие и бензопилы, причем со временем каждый боец приобретает определенную специализацию. Правда, сами герои совершенно безлики – до колоритной команды [b]Left 4 Dead[/b] им бесконечно далеко. \n\n\n[h1]Как играется?[/h1]\n\nВпрочем, в разгар яростной схватки, когда уши закладывает от рева и визга, о характерных чертах персонажей думаешь в последнюю очередь. Голову, как правило, занимают куда более простые мысли: как пробиться через стену наседающей кровожадной плоти и где, черт возьми, друзья-напарники! Довести страсти до точки кипения помогают два в общем-то простых решения. Авторы убрали прицел, а перезарядку сделали нарочито неторопливой. В итоге – пока виртуальный герой мучительно долго возится с новой обоймой на той стороне экрана, холодный пот и дрожь начинают пробирать игрока на этой.\n\nКроме огнестрельного оружия в арсенале бойцов есть старая добрая бензопила. Тот, кто пользуется ею достаточно часто, со временем становится настоящим берсеркером. А вот самый меткий стрелок приобретает звание снайпера. По такому принципу – чем больше практики, тем лучше результат – развиваются все шесть видов способностей, дающих преимущества при использовании того или иного оружия.\n\n\n[h1]Как выглядит?[/h1]\n\nВыглядят разборки с мертвечиной, мягко говоря, неоднозначно. Видно, что авторы старались придать игре пристойный вид, но движок [b]Unreal Engine 2.5[/b] все равно не дотягивает до современных стандартов. Ну а раздражающе красный уродливый интерфейс вкупе с отталкивающими задниками и вовсе оправдать ничем нельзя – здесь разработчики допустили явный и грубый просчет. Вдобавок игра умудряется периодически подвисать, запуская тем самым своеобразную лотерею: если вам повезет, вы продолжите бой, если нет – отправитесь изучать детали рабочего стола [b]Windows[/b].\n\n\n[h1]Что еще любопытного?[/h1]\n\nКроме оружия ближнего и дальнего боя, у каждого игрока имеется портативный сварочный аппарат. С его помощью наглухо блокируются двери, хотя это, конечно, не панацея. Тем не менее сварочные работы дают дополнительный повод для слаженной работы отряда. Пока один игрок возится с дверьми, другие его прикрывают. Стандартные правила командных шутеров тоже никто не отменял. Держаться ближе к товарищам, занимать круговую оборону – без всего этого просто не выжить в [b]Killing Floor[/b]. К тому же нужно делиться деньгами и лечить друг друга.\n\n\n[h1]Плюсы[/h1]\n\n[i]Хорошо реализованы принципы командной игры[/i]\n[i]Интересная задумка с прокачкой и специализацией персонажей[/i]\n[i]Попадаются любопытные разновидности зомби[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Минусы[/h1]\n\n[i]Устаревшая графика и жуткий интерфейс[/i]\n[i]Нельзя играть за зомби[/i]\n[i]Killing Floor – это не Left 4 Dead[/i]\n\n\n[h1]ВЕРДИКТ[/h1]\n\nТаким образом, в своем жанре проект занимает далеко не последнее место. Однако оригинальность концепции, когда-то казавшаяся благом, обернулась для [b]Killing Floor[/b] проклятьем. Чрезмерная близость с вышедшей ранее [b]Left 4 Dead[/b] навсегда усадила проект [b]Tripwire[/b] на скамью запасных.","timestamp_created":1422211457,"timestamp_updated":1422211457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532501399517059326","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14165311","author":{"steamid":"76561198018318792","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":40787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32341,"last_played":1591996463},"language":"french","review":"Amateurs de bonne boucherie, d'armes efficaces ou extravagantes, ayant le sens du coop ou du \"jme casse c'est foutu\", chacun en a pour son compte.

Fighting hordes of lab experiments gone wrong? Making it rain money?\n\nWell Killing Floor might just be up your alley!\n\nA co-operative horde combat first-person shooter, Killing Floor is pretty basic in it's gameplay. Aside from the new Objective maps which have recently been added, most games play for ten waves with the final eleveth wave being a fight against the boss and creator of these experiments, the Patriarch.\nObjective maps are fairly new and require guarding/welding control panels, reaching location X from Y, survival and fetch quests. It's not much of a difference from standard gameplay bit it is a bit of welcome variety.\n\nDifficulties range from Easy to Hell on Earth & Suicidal. Aside from creature health scaling and stun being removed from certain weapons (Crossbow / katana / fire axe) there isn't much difference. \n\nPerks are your different class selections and can be changed between rounds without penalty. \nClasses include: Medic, Sharpshooter, Support, Commando, Firebug and Berzerker.\nEach class plays a very specific role and it is incredibly important to play according to your class strengths if you wish to survive.\nSupport, Commando and Firebug are primarily for taking out weaker hordes of foes.\nSharpshooter, Berzerker and Medic provide excellent heavy support in taking out Scrakes, Husks and Flesh Pounds.\n\nWhile each class gains damage, ammo and recharge bonuses for weapons within their class, you are not limited to them. Medics can take shotguns just like support and sharpshooters grenade launchers. You might not be limited in your choice, but it is generally adviseable to stick within your class weapon range. \n\nIf you can manage to get a skilled team together that understands class roles and movement this game can be a absolute blast.","timestamp_created":1422127547,"timestamp_updated":1542829952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540440797805786133","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14148852","author":{"steamid":"76561198094348220","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1452206497},"language":"english","review":"I must say I'm generally impressed with this game.

That doesn't make it a -bad- game at all though. It's a first person shooter, and feels well..it feels like the mod it originally was. There's no story beyond 'someone made horrible monsters and you're there to clear them out'. It's up to you and a number of other players to murder waves of monsters that get progressively stronger with a myriad amount of weapons.\n\nGraphics are a bit out of date, but the atmosphere is good. There's a pleasant variety of maps(with a ton of custom mods as well, since the game's creators seem very mod-friendly), and even six years after release there's almost always a near-full server to jump in on. \n\nAudio is good. Some power-rock I muted(I play off of my own library, since there's no loss either way). Enemies sound right, with hilariously over the top, faux-british accents on the players in the form of taunts, begging for money, and commands for those without a headset.\n\nAs I said, Killing floor is not a fantastically complex game. Enemies come right at you with no strategy, and you shoot them until they die.\n\nThis game is cathartic. You log in, and for twenty minutes or so shoot everything that moves and isn't a player. There's no objective beyond survival, and you can do it however you want. Want to heal other players? Slice zombies up with a sword? Spray hundreds of bullets with a machine gun or blast a crowd to bits with a shotgun? You can do it, and it feels intensly satisfying.\n\nThe game itself has a few bugs here and there. Mostly clipping and audio issues, but the game is just so fun i honestly could care less. The development team also put time into reskins for holidays and even occasionally puts in new weapons and maps(some DLC, some not) in a fairly decent rate, which is rare for a game that doesn't have any subscriptions and has extra DLC options. This may slow down or stop since Killing Floor 2 was announced, but it's still nice to see.\n\nConsidering its age, it might be best to hold off for a sale instead of the twenty dollar buy-in price, but it's definitely worth it. this won't be a game you sit down and play for twelve hours, and come out feeling changed. But you will find yourself booting it up for an odd hour or two for the fun of it for quite some time.\n\nAll in all a very good, successful expansion of what was originally a mod for another game.","timestamp_created":1421781766,"timestamp_updated":1421781766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14085593","author":{"steamid":"76561198046607528","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":4324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2736,"last_played":1459035082},"language":"spanish","review":"sin duda este es uno de esos juegos que nunca te vas a artar de jugarlo y viciaras horas y horas y subir de nivel y mejorar  exelente juego  ya no espero que este a la venta el 2","timestamp_created":1421779160,"timestamp_updated":1421779160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14082938","author":{"steamid":"76561198044716170","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":4830,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3889,"last_played":1466251457},"language":"english","review":"Some people hate this game because of the 'bad' graphics and the fact its from 2009. I think this is a great game. Its even good 6 years later. Some people says thats they are EA with all the dlcs. But i dont really think so. The game comes on huge sales all the time they gotta earn a little extra. And if you dont like the dlcs.. Why even buy? Its not that they are that good.. Its just reskins for the people who wants that.  I Would recommend that you buy this even if Killing Floor 2 is out.

Он повернулся и посмотрел на вас, вы увидели отблески огня в его глазах. В конце коридора, за углом, послышались чьи-то шаги. Поджигатель крепко взял в руки огнемет и не спеша пошел в конец коридора, временами озаряя всю комнату яркими вспышками огня. Прошло мгновение, и его силуэт скрылся за углом, вы тяжело дыша перезарядили свой MK23, как за углом послышались крики и яркие всплески огня, после чего последовало два глухих удара, и тишина...он умер. Вы навели оптический прицел арбалета в конец коридора, осталось двенадцать мутантов и вы были готовы к встрече с ними. И тут с резким криком из-за угла вылетает Отбивальщик, с яростными криками он разрывает в клочья оставшихся мобов и резко бежит на вас. Вы навели прицел, и метко поразили его тремя стрелами выпущенными точно в голову, издав еле слышный стон он замертво падает у ваших ног. Победа! Но стоп, впереди нас ждет Патриарх! \n[spoiler]Кевин Клемели (Патриарх) — директор и создатель компании ‘Горизонт’, который ответственен за вспышку в Лондоне. Он был нанят правительством для создания супер-солдат — солдат, которые не чувствовали бы страха и боли. Лондон был использован как место экспериментов — первые тестирования были проведены именно в этом городе. Кевин звал своих клонов ‘детьми’ и ‘семьей’, потому что они остались единственными компаньонами для него.[/spoiler]\n- Но ведь он совсем один, да что он может! - крикнули вы кидая несколько фунтов поджигателю.\nСпустя три минуты...\nВы понимаете что остались одни, ваши боевые товарищи погибли смертью храбрых, кругом валялись их обезображенные тела, сердце начинало биться все чаще и чаще.\n- Черт это ведь игра, успокойся! - сказали вы сами себе.\nВдруг в пяти метрах от себя вы услышали шаги, навели прицел, но было поздно, резким рывком Патриарх оказался рядом с вами, и нанес удар, разорвав бронежилет на вас в клочья!\n- И это все? - закричали вы.\n- Давай паршивый выродок, я тебя не боюсь! - вы навели прицел точно на голову, и вдруг услышали звук. Это был пулемет, авиационный мать твою пулемет! Спустя две секунды все было кончено. \n\nЭто лишь малая доля того, что вы увидите в Killing Floor от студии Tripware Interactive.\n\nБлагодаря постоянной поддержке игра обрела армию преданных фанатов, а анонс Killing Floor 2 был знаковым для меня в 2014 году. Я ничуть не жалею о потраченном времени и деньгах на покупку DLC, все это стоило того. Ведь в этой игре вы найдете много отличных людей, а словосочетание \"командная игра\" обретет для вас новый смысл. Проведя в игре порядка 200-300 часов и прокачав все перки, вы поймете что это лишь начало чего-то большего, а игра вовсе не тир по глупым биологическим мутантам, а огромное количество возможностей по тактике ведения боя не даст вам заскучать. Здесь всегда есть куда расти, а благодаря различным сложностям и разнообразию ситуаций, даже наиграв энное количество времени нет гарантий того что вы сможете выжить. А если вы сильны духом, а ваши яйца крепче стали( не знаю как там у девушек), стан Патриарха высшая стадия мастерства, один из тех моментов когда ты понимаешь, что права на ошибку нет, в венах начинает закипать кровь, сердце готово проломить грудную клетку, именно такие чувства вы будете испытывать кидаясь на Патриарха с ножом.\n\nЕсли вы любите кооперативные шутеры, неравнодушны к мутантам, а ваши руки не растут из жопы, добро пожаловать в Killing Floor.","timestamp_created":1421684312,"timestamp_updated":1421697192,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":173,"votes_funny":90,"weighted_vote_score":"0.859117984771728516","comment_count":22,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14065816","author":{"steamid":"76561198127404674","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":139,"last_played":1430734416},"language":"russian","review":"офигеный шутер советую качайте 10 из 10\n","timestamp_created":1421674458,"timestamp_updated":1421674458,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwudWZgcsCeInUNQ=="}
