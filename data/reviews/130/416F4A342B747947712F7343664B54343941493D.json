It is fun as the series always is, but a classic example of a completionists-only product. You have the usual: Black Mesa implodes, some areas with aliens, some areas with headcrabs, some areas with spec ops, lots of circular puzzles to flip switches and raise water levels, that kind of thing.\n\nComparing this to the other expansion, Opposing Force, it's like night and day. If I were being brutally honest, I don't think we needed anything else to follow Opposing Force. Blue Shift is nice to have, but I wouldn't ever recommend it or tell someone to spend their time on it. The kind of people who want to play it won't need a recommendation, and it will remain a niche addition to the series.","timestamp_created":1630792073,"timestamp_updated":1630792073,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602973341941833496","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98793605","author":{"steamid":"76561198190017439","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1306,"last_played":1620256735},"language":"english","review":"While it is my least favorite of the original 3 half life games, I still had a great time with it.

The most interesting/fun fact about the expansion for me is that Gearbox (Borderlands) developed it in 2001 under the supervision of Valve which is just a cool piece of history in my mind.\n\nThis expansion has some solid combat, enjoyable puzzles, and a good story with a unique perspective. The only knock that I have towards this game/expansion is that it is more Half-Life and in my mind you would think there would be more guns or some gameplay changes to justify it as an expansion.","timestamp_created":1630790646,"timestamp_updated":1630790646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98788051","author":{"steamid":"76561198189284883","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1622314098},"language":"english","review":"classic part 2","timestamp_created":1630783841,"timestamp_updated":1630783841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98786913","author":{"steamid":"76561198194433086","num_games_owned":358,"num_reviews":99,"playtime_forever":145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":145,"last_played":1630781730},"language":"spanish","review":"Tan complicado era agregar la traduccion?\n\nIgual la mejor expansion sin duda.","timestamp_created":1630782256,"timestamp_updated":1630782256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540922284126281738","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98768569","author":{"steamid":"76561198081145379","num_games_owned":640,"num_reviews":97,"playtime_forever":149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1630759371},"language":"spanish","review":"[h1] ¿Lo único bueno?\nQue es corto y se acaba rápido.

I'd say totally worth it if you get it on sale for a dollar or less. there is a co op feature so you can play with your friends. no final boss like in the base game and opposing force though. But some of the puzzles took me a little time to figure out. I would say its the worst of the bunch due to its length and a few other small details but i'd suggest it to anyone whos a halflife fan and wants more from that world just adjust your expectations on it being just like the others in all aspects. happy to have played the series","timestamp_created":1629319413,"timestamp_updated":1629319413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97804925","author":{"steamid":"76561198796620197","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1654104563},"language":"spanish","review":"Es Half-Life, ta bien","timestamp_created":1629298674,"timestamp_updated":1629298674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97802862","author":{"steamid":"76561198050956337","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1548094777},"language":"hungarian","review":"A mai napig szuper kis kiegészítőnek érzem.","timestamp_created":1629296322,"timestamp_updated":1629296322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97787306","author":{"steamid":"76561199135119504","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1629197023},"language":"russian","review":"Классное DLC к первой части.
