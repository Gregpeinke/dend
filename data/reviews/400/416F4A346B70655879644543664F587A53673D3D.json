Portal размывает все представления о физике и гравитации. Чтобы пройти эту игру нужно постоянно думать как пролететь над препятствиями прыгая сквозь пол, стены и потолок, постоянно перемещая порталы.\n\nКак и все игры из Orange Box, Portal собран все на том же модифицированном Source. Но за счет геймплея, как и все остальные игры с того замечательного сборника, воспринимается совершенно неповторимо и незабываемо.\n\nПорталы нельзя открывать где угодно, одновременно их может быть только 2 - синий и оранжевый. В начале игры можно вдоволь побаловаться с этой технологией, создавая бесконечные коридоры и ямы, открывая порталы, напротив друг друга, на потолке и полу или на стенах.\n\nПовествование ведется в духе half life, никаких вступительных сцен, роликов и заставок, прагматично сразу же от первого лица. Постепенно, казалось бы, обычные научные эксперименты обрастают интригой.\n\nСуперкомпьютер обладающий искусственным интеллектом ГЛэДОС заслуживает особого внимания. На мой взгляд один из лучших образов ИИ в играх. Чего только стоит тот самый знаменитый уровень с кубом-другом, породивший столько шуток и мемов. [spoiler]ГЛэДОС так настойчиво и убедительно призывает не одушевлять его, тем самым наоборот создавая почву для сомнений. К концу уровня уже действительно было тяжело принять решение избавиться от него. В итоге пришлось, а жаль, разработчикам стоило сделать хотя бы тайную возможность сберечь куб.[/spoiler]\n\nКонечно еще один несомненный плюс связь с half life. По мере прохождения можно наткнуться на занимательные слайды с упоминанием Черной Мезы. Кроме того и в Episode Two упоминают Aperture Science.\n\nИз саундтрека особенно выделю финальную композицию - «Still Alive».
