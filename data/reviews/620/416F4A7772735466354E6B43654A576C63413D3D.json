As you journey through the massive Aperture facility, it becomes clear that Portal 2 does not merely come after Portal. Instead, it radiates outward from its predecessor, simultaneously illuminating the world that gave rise to Portal and continuing the adventure that began there. The sense of novelty is diminished, but the thrill of exploration and puzzle-solving is still intoxicating, and it's amazing how Portal 2 manages to tell a better story with disembodied voices and spherical robots than most games can with full-on humans. Your return to Aperture Science is a joyful one in this immensely appealing, laugh-out-loud funny, and thoroughly satisfying sequel. Immensely clever writing, new characters are hugely entertaining, and the cooperative campaign creates intriguing situations! The only bad thing about this game that I could come up with would be the frequent load times. Valve cuts no corners and finds ways to make you care about everything from the major characters to the cubes used to solve puzzles. From the beginning of the single-player story to the end of the co-op mode, Portal 2 is a novel, unforgettable experience.","timestamp_created":1485272811,"timestamp_updated":1485272811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29464527","author":{"steamid":"76561198169265238","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":97,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":97,"last_played":1485294969},"language":"turkish","review":"oo miss","timestamp_created":1485272603,"timestamp_updated":1485272603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29464477","author":{"steamid":"76561198147058350","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3077,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":666,"last_played":1592404212},"language":"english","review":"Good game, especially fun with community test chambers!","timestamp_created":1485272425,"timestamp_updated":1485272425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29463871","author":{"steamid":"76561198083037318","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1404328568},"language":"french","review":"Un des meilleurs jeux solo auxquels j'ai joué.
