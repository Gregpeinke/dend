Unfortunately however, this aspect of HLOF has arguably been all-but retconned out of the Half-Life continuity as its own self-contained story, and it is unlikely that its protagonist Adrian Shepherd will appear in a future HL title.","timestamp_created":1657315806,"timestamp_updated":1657315806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118471925","author":{"steamid":"76561199219105829","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1260,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1260,"last_played":1657312430},"language":"russian","review":"Не смотря на ущербную графику эта игра очень хороша и стоит своих денег.Увлекательный сюжет страшные мутанты КАЙФ","timestamp_created":1657312841,"timestamp_updated":1657312841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118471703","author":{"steamid":"76561198420105541","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":505,"last_played":1657305528},"language":"english","review":"Best valve protagonist ever.

Cuenta también con varias mejoras.\n\nUna de las mejoras ha sido sin duda la cantidad de armas. Hay muchas más armas que en el original y al igual que en Half Life, terminas usándolas todas más o menos por igual. Eso está bien, porque no hay arma que se sienta innecesaria. \n\nLos enemigos ha sido algo que ha cambiado también. Hay mucha más variedad de enemigos, aunque hacia el final sólo aparecen dos tipos distintos. Pero sólo ha sido un cambio, ya que algunos del juego original no aparecen, y los que lo hacen salen solo un momento y ya no vuelves a verlos. No lo considero algo negativo, ya que ahora ya se siente lo suficientemente distinto como para poder destacar por su propia cuenta.\n\nLa linterna también es algo que ha cambiado, y ahora tendremos unas gafas de visión nocturnas, las cuáles usaremos mucho más a menudo que la linterna en el original. \n\nEn cuanto a otros aspecto en los que ha cambiado, podría poner que puedes contar con la ayuda de otros soldados que te encuentres por el camino. \nAhora, si hay algo que me veo obligado a comentar, es que para los que no entiendan inglés, les va a costar un pelín más enterarse de todos los diálogos. No es que haya muchos, solo un poco al principio y al final, pero al no haber subtítulos en ningún idioma, puede costar pillarlo todo.\n\nEn resumen: Opposing Force es un juego excelente, digno título de la saga, que al igual que el original, ha envejecido como el buen vino.","timestamp_created":1657202212,"timestamp_updated":1657202212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118386722","author":{"steamid":"76561198178933754","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":188,"playtime_forever":329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":67,"last_played":1657438519},"language":"english","review":"I'm on vacation, running bootcamp on my Mac and this is the only game that I can get 60fps on.\n\n10/10 tho.","timestamp_created":1657199787,"timestamp_updated":1657199787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.62512737512588501","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118384111","author":{"steamid":"76561198966569682","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1657196182},"language":"english","review":"I know it only took me 3.5 hours to complete, but I feel that this game was far too long.\n\nI enjoyed the references to the main game, but other than that it was pretty miserable.\nI'm happy I bought this as part of a bundle.","timestamp_created":1657196410,"timestamp_updated":1657196410,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118380621","author":{"steamid":"76561199185715824","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1657144162},"language":"polish","review":"Fajnie zagrać w Half-Life, ale z innej perspektywy niż ta Gordona Freemana","timestamp_created":1657191386,"timestamp_updated":1657191386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118375071","author":{"steamid":"76561197969350622","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":822,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":822,"last_played":1657174387},"language":"english","review":"\"Come in, Cooper.

Give us targets, or get below!\"\n\nOpposing force was the first of the expansion packs to be released in November 1999 after the dust settled from the impact of half life in 1998. In saying that, Opposing Force had an  expectation to be of considerable measure to its larger counterpart, in which it equally created an impact in its own right.\n\nWhen it was released, it immediately attained critical acclaim, becoming the \"benchmark\" in future expansion packs for years to come. It was proceeded in 2001 by the last expansion called \"Blue Shift\" which ended the original Half-Life saga for that era.\n\nTo the connoisseurs of HL or colloquially the veterans will know that the infamous green Lambda symbol and the grunt that represents this is immediately recognized. However to those new to the series, Opposing force is essentially, the story of the Soldiers who are sent to Black Mesa upon the catastrophe. You play as Adrian Sheppard, the protagonist apart of the HECU on an undisclosed mission. \n\nNot only is this game a continuance of the original, it is by extension a masterpiece. OPFOR certainly entwines itself into the original half-life and the path of the Freeman. You will find, during game play that this comes to fruition in certain important scenes. OPFOR does not deviate excessively and still sticks to HL authentic roots. The protagonist does not talk, Levels are similar, puzzles that need to be solved to progress, the game still continuing the chapter sequences, no cut-scenes and scripted sequences to continue the story line.\n\nOPFOR however does  deviate in a few areas, new aliens, new weapons and player models. Race X was introduced to the game, which throughout the story you will be introduced to them in a classic HL way. Secondly a much variety of new weapons are also introduced, very extensively which in my opinion reflects the employment of the protagonist.In relation to the player models, introduces changes on security, scientists and the soldiers. For example, as an ode to the original, you can interact with a soldier mechanic who can weld doors open.\n\nI do applaud the creativity of the levels, the enemies (not only the aliens but the covert ops), the weapons, the short and sharp music and the nostalgic sequences that are entwined together to give context to two simultaneous stories. You will also find, true to the HL experience being \"alone\" the majority of the time. You often find yourself coming across your stranded colleagues who are lost or separated, which brings unity, to help you fight on.\n\nThe game has been met with extremely positive reviews upon all outlets, however obviously some criticized the shortness of the game and perhaps other minor things. I do find this arbitrary, as a HL aficionado, you wouldn't even notice it. After all it is an \"expansion\". Whatever disadvantages this game has to a harsh, focused eye, certainly are outweighed by the advantages.\n\nThis game truly belongs to sit aside, some of the greatest games of our generation. It has much sentiment to me and every time I do play it,  I reminisce about the golden days of gaming in the 90s. Im sure many who had this opportunity will agree and definitely will recommend this as a must play for the HL universe.\n\n","timestamp_created":1657183641,"timestamp_updated":1657183641,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118360001","author":{"steamid":"76561198192645869","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48,"last_played":1658111244},"language":"english","review":"I love it\n\n","timestamp_created":1657158555,"timestamp_updated":1657806771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118357770","author":{"steamid":"76561198182224837","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":2467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":2466,"last_played":1659428876},"language":"english","review":"FUN\n","timestamp_created":1657155150,"timestamp_updated":1657155150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118356077","author":{"steamid":"76561198834111217","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":18,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1643658753},"language":"turkish","review":"Half - Life şefkat tepe edition","timestamp_created":1657152580,"timestamp_updated":1657152580,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118354581","author":{"steamid":"76561199228279669","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":488,"last_played":1657426632},"language":"latam","review":"A","timestamp_created":1657150853,"timestamp_updated":1657150853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118345612","author":{"steamid":"76561199157138496","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1639074126},"language":"english","review":"just like fullmetal jacket, first boot camp, than fucking chaos","timestamp_created":1657139580,"timestamp_updated":1657139580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118339749","author":{"steamid":"76561198400745879","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":76,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":76,"last_played":1618184713},"language":"english","review":"half life but mountain doo color LOL!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1657132974,"timestamp_updated":1657132974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118338611","author":{"steamid":"76561199231243866","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":655,"last_played":1641776955},"language":"english","review":"yeah. its pretty good","timestamp_created":1657131684,"timestamp_updated":1657131684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118337706","author":{"steamid":"76561199013376973","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":243,"last_played":1657130653},"language":"english","review":"game is good but gaben is picketina","timestamp_created":1657130686,"timestamp_updated":1657130686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118336568","author":{"steamid":"76561198800195091","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":424,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":424,"last_played":1657129320},"language":"english","review":"This is basically better Half-Life, I would give it a higher score than HL1 but at the same time, the 2nd to last mission is just brutal and it's much shorter.

I was minutes from beating the game when the entire thing crashed and refused to start back up even after multiple reinstalls. It was only after uninstalling and wiping all of its data from my computer completely was I able to finish, but even be warned all the same. \n\nThat being said, this is a fantastic little side story that serves as a highlight reel to the original while also providing ample challenges along the way. While there are some more archaic environmental designs and puzzles to be found here, the mid to late game encounters are vicious and thrilling in how they stretch you to the limits of classic half life. What's new here is a collection of new xenos and new xenos weapons, along with some new human gear to boot. The new aliens fit right at home and their weapons are suitably unsettling and lovable in equal turn; the electric beetle, which serves as the stand in for the hivemind in other games, is a far more efficient and deadly weapon in exchange for a slow recharge. My personal favorite is the alien grenade launcher, which is basically a chill bro you feed on occasion and sometimes pet in between pulping the occasional black ops soldier. \n\nThe combat arenas are tense and multifaceted this time around and expect a lot from the player, but be warned that there are scant few healing stations in this game--in my full playthrough I think I may have encountered 4 working ones, and maybe 3 HEVs. I felt like i was pretty thorough when exploring but I easily could have missed some--however prepare to always be on a knifes edge this time around, and making use of the squads you come across. It takes little time before you're squaring up against dozens of high accuracy black ops soldiers and xenos abominations, and with that comes some fast and hard damage. I played on hard which probably didn't help, but even on the brink of death you're never without options. The gluon gun is replaced this time around with what can best be described as a slightly underpowered BFG, and because it's got a slow cook before the burst makes it a fantastic tactical weapon against the twitchy soldiers you face off against. That's one of about a dozen or so entirely unique weapons, but none rival the Magnum, which was my steadfast companion from start to finish. The ammo isn't rare this time around and can carry you from beginning to end if used wisely, but its stopping power is only just enough most of the time. \n\nSadly, I can't say the same of the shotgun and classic assault rifle, which both suffer from powercreep. As almost everything new has way more health, save for the assault rifle's grenade launcher--and there are stronger equivalents found later on. I love the Half-LIfe shotgun but you'll be lucky if the double blast takes out an enemy half the time in this, and I find that a shame.\n\nThere is some interesting optional lore bits here and there, but this game is best approached as a more actiony follow up to the original. The less said about the constantly looping soldier dialogue the better--when its not some esoteric platforming puzzle, Opposing Force shines in combat. The last boss fight is at least serviceable and climatic, and in gameplay serves as an interesting bridge between the original Nylanth and Black Mesa's variation. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the same otherworldly flair that OG Half Life's final boss has, even if it's a technically inferior fight, and is ultimately forgettable compared to the nightmarish sewer dwellers you have to fight in pitch darkness earlier on. \n\nAll said, and unmissable expansion that brings a lot to the table, and is worth any Half Life fan's salt to experience--just pray you don't suffer the gamekiller bug I experienced at the very end.","timestamp_created":1657074713,"timestamp_updated":1657074713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118288783","author":{"steamid":"76561198181856595","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":131,"playtime_forever":629,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":629,"last_played":1586476093},"language":"english","review":"You are the nice army man.

Yeah the Barnacle is that feeling... IN F**KING HALF LIFE!!!!, sadly its very underutilized in the game, but the moments where you get to use it are always fun.\nJust remember to release before you hit the surface youre pulling yourself towards, it lets you keep much more of the momentum and makes it all much more fun\n\n-The Deagle: \nIve already talked about it, its the revolver from HL1, only better it has 2 firing-modes, with and without laser, with the laser its pinpoint accurate but has a slower firing rate, thats the mode your gonna wanna use, the without-laser-mode lets you shoot faster but you wont be able to hit the side of a barn from inside that barn, so dont bother with it.\n\n-The Sniper Rifle: \nIts pretty much a crossbow but with the GIGANTIC advantage of instant hits, instead of slow travelling bolts, you might say \"But what about those fish enemies?\" \nThe glock can fire under water and also you can just hit the fish, make him angrily swim around the surface and then just punt him with the shotgun everytime he comes up, the 2 fish at the underwater tunnel can be beat with the shotgun too by ducking under water waiting for them then quickly standing up and punting them with the shotgun through the hole in the glass, so no crossbow needed, Sniper Rifle-MasterRace.\n\n-The M249-MachineGun: \nThe Greatest gun in the game it probably shares the top spot for highest DPM guns in all Half-Life games with the Gluon-Gun it just shreds through enemies on all difficulties and it has a sound effect more satisfying than the Mac-10 in Counter-Strike 1.6.\n\n-The Displacer-Cannon: \nThe nuclear option in this game, i dont like it as much as the Gauss-Gun or the Gluon-Gun but its still very useful and interesting, its primary fire will oneshot any enemy on all difficulties but takes some time to charge and travels slowly, make sure to click before you turn around a corner when you know there will be an enemy there and save the ammo for the biggest and baddest enemies. \nThe secondary fire teleports you to Xen which isnt that useful since no one would go there voluntarily ever.\n\n-The Spore-Launcher: \nIs flat out the most adorable weapon in the history of gaming you reload it by actually feeding it (NAWWWWWWWWWAHFIOAFIFHPIOAFNJ!!!!!) I! WANT! ONE!\nIt has 2 firing modes, the primary is kind of a rocket launcher which does extreme damage but has pretty slow flying projectiles.\nThe secondary is kind of a bouncing grenade, i dont like using that cause the projectiles always seem to find their way back to my stupid a*s...\n\n-The Shock-Roach: \nIts OppForces version of the Hive-Hand it has 10 rounds instead of 8, but recharges them slowlier and has only a primary fire.\nYou could compare it to the Glock damage and accurarcy wise but it has the added advantage of freezing the enemies for a time, remember to never use it under water or you will end as 200 pounds of BBQ-Shephard.\n\nIm not going to go in on the Story here, since I want those of you, who havent played it yet to experience it yourselves, but its really good and i love how much it adds to the things we saw in HL1.\n\nI really cant overstate how much id recommend this game to anyone who enjoys shooters, definetly a 10/10 case for me.","timestamp_created":1657047060,"timestamp_updated":1657129007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118262182","author":{"steamid":"76561199116799540","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":766,"playtime_last_two_weeks":418,"playtime_at_review":347,"last_played":1660393856},"language":"english","review":"Cool Military dude","timestamp_created":1657031387,"timestamp_updated":1657031387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118253302","author":{"steamid":"76561199022509191","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":603,"last_played":1657020141},"language":"english","review":"Shepard","timestamp_created":1657020833,"timestamp_updated":1657020833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5631142258644104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118248620","author":{"steamid":"76561198382431666","num_games_owned":365,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":335,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":335,"last_played":1656914186},"language":"english","review":"There's a reason they call it (opp)osing force","timestamp_created":1657013648,"timestamp_updated":1657013648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118245615","author":{"steamid":"76561199257111762","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1658082059},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшее дополнение","timestamp_created":1657008732,"timestamp_updated":1657008732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118245202","author":{"steamid":"76561199231036506","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":631,"last_played":1657259339},"language":"brazilian","review":"se quiser passar raiva pode comprar,recomendo muito bueno","timestamp_created":1657008080,"timestamp_updated":1657166458,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118238960","author":{"steamid":"76561198303030426","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2915,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1393,"last_played":1657350669},"language":"english","review":"\"Come in, Cooper.

The events take the same place and time in Half-Life, but now you experience the event at Black Mesa through the eyes of a 22-year-old U.S Marine, Corporal Adrian Shepherd, which is one of the enemies in Half-Life. You and your unit have been sent to Black Mesa Research Facility to neutralize it after a scientific mishap occurs and causes an alien invasion, but you and the marines are pushed and heavily beaten by a second alien race, and the black ops send by the government after your units failure to neutralize the Black Mesa Research Facility. Nothing must go in and out of Black Mesa and it must remain a secret from the people.\n\nI must say, this is an exceptional expansion pack that brings a lot of new mechanics, commands, monsters, and weapons to the table. It's amazing.\n\nThe expansion pack consists of a Training Room, and 3 modes: Easy, Medium, and Hard.\nThe Training Room is a must to play before actually playing the game. It has a different and fresh approach to the player unlike the Training Room in Half-Life and Half-Life: Blue Shift. It will show and explain how to perform the new mechanics and commands in the game, also you will be introduced to a few of the new weapons here. Recommended for all players, whether they are new to the gaming world or gamers that are 1st time playing this expansion pack.\nNow the modes:\n1. Easy mode: Excellent for getting to know this expansion pack. Although it's easy mode, it's really easy to die to a lot of stuff, and probably you will be dying a lot; Difficulty: 4/10;\n2. Medium mode: Enemies deal more damage and can sustain more damage. Difficulty:6/10;\n3. Hard mode: Enemies are like a sponge and attack rapidly. You take damage a lot and very easily. Having in mind that health packs and Health stations give less health and you have non-stop encounters you will have a hard time. Difficulty:10/10  Unless you are a masochist freak and played Half-Life on hard mode then this hard mode would have the difficulty 8/10).\n\nWeapons: The legendary crowbar is replaced by a slow attacking wrench that deals quite the damage. The new weapons are remarkable and fun to use. Unlike Half-Life having the 44. Magnum, here you have the Deagle which has the same impact. This expansion pack has a larger arsenal than Half-Life and many of the weapons are powerful and can deal serious damage to enemies even on hard mode. Personally, my favorite weapon and a weapon that made me laugh is the Spore Launcher. It's an alien weapon that eats Spore Fruit and uses it as ammunition. When you reload it, it makes a funny yummy sound that makes me laugh. It's really powerful and 1-2 shots of almost everything. It can be used underwater.\n\nMultiplayer: It has multiplayer, but sadly all the servers are empty.\n\nOverall, an excellent expansion pack and worth having and playing it.","timestamp_created":1656868723,"timestamp_updated":1656868723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118133684","author":{"steamid":"76561199229909131","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":451,"last_played":1659043997},"language":"english","review":"","timestamp_created":1656858863,"timestamp_updated":1656858863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118123855","author":{"steamid":"76561198059713483","num_games_owned":376,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":28257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28257,"last_played":1627715404},"language":"english","review":"it's

En uno de los primeros capítulos del juego, estaba rompiendo unas cajas para ver si encontraba suministros. Por supuesto, para no tardar tanto, mantenía pulsado el boton de ''disparo'' con la llave inglesa. ¿Qué puede salir mal? Pues el hecho de que, en una de esas cajas, había un lanzacohetes, y claro, en estos juegos, cuando coges un arma nueva, se selecciona automáticamente. El resultado es que el pobre Shepard se lanzó accidentalmente un cohete en la cara. Aquí el problema no es que me suicidara de una forma tan tonta. Aquí la pregunta es: ¿Qué sentido tiene que, en una etapa tan temprana del juego te den un arma tan poderosa como un lanzacohetes?\nLa guinda sobre el pastel llega en el capítulo de Fuego Aliado. En este capítulo, llego a un lugar donde se encuentra un médico, además de unos Black Ops, que resisten una cantidad ridículamente alta de balas, pero bueno. Resulta ser que, por alguna extraña razón, el médico, al rato, me ataca sin que yo le haya atacado a él. Lógicamente intento defenderme, pero si le mato, el juego me tira una pantalla de Game Over. Básicamente el juego se me ha bugueado y no puedo continuar, porque si no le ataco, él me mata, pero si le ataco, Game Over.\nEn resumen, esta expansión, aunque tiene buenas ideas (como el tema de las cuerdas o las radios y los compañeros militares y sus roles) no llega al nivel de calidad del juego base. El juego en general está mal diseñado, como si Gearbox no entendiera las cosas que hizo bien Half-Life.\nLo único salvable es el momento en el que el alien de la raza X mata al guardia de seguridad. Esa escena es impagable.","timestamp_created":1656775569,"timestamp_updated":1656775865,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118064920","author":{"steamid":"76561199097832051","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":261,"last_played":1657688164},"language":"english","review":"absolutely better than half life and even black mesa","timestamp_created":1656771702,"timestamp_updated":1656771702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118055930","author":{"steamid":"76561199002419752","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":360,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":360,"last_played":1656760933},"language":"english","review":"Pretty good although Hunt down the Freeman was better...","timestamp_created":1656761048,"timestamp_updated":1656761048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118050566","author":{"steamid":"76561198180667505","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":552,"last_played":1656753800},"language":"english","review":"N","timestamp_created":1656753883,"timestamp_updated":1656753883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ498CO34EDdvCpwgM="}
