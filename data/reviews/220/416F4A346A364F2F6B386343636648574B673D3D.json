The perilous adventures of Gordon Freeman continue in this sequel to a best-seller in 1998. Both of these games introduced state-of-the-art physics and graphics for their time period.\n\nHalf-Life 2 was also the first Vavle game created with the latest iteration of the Source Engine (as of 2004). Half-Life 2 provides hours of fun as Gordon Freeman fights his way through the Combine soldiers with an entire arsenal of weaponry, including a prototype weapon, the Zero-Point-Energy Field Manipulator, or more commonly known as, the Gravity Gun.\n   \nHalf-Life 2 was a huge success, and in the 2 following years, Valve released Episode 1 and 2, which added even more action as our favorite theoretical physicist battles many more Combine threats, and forces him to rely more on the abilities of his HEV suit and the weapons on his back.

Zaskawiwała ona wszystkich swoją grafiką, fabułą jak i ścieżką dzwiękową. Dzisiaj po prawie 10 latach chciałem odświerzyć sobie pamięć i zagrałem w ją. Moje pierwsze wrażenia- mimo iż jest ona jeszcze na starym silniku graficznym nadal zaskakuje grafiką jak i fabułą oraz dzwiękiem. Cóż by tu dalej mówić- gra warta kupna- jest tania ciekawa i ładna. Szkoda jednak, że Valve póki co nie zbiera się do wydania 3 części tej wspaniałej gry.","timestamp_created":1405544047,"timestamp_updated":1511445829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11278129","author":{"steamid":"76561198119746088","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":918,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":724,"last_played":1436989119},"language":"english","review":"One of the most the most fanstastic PC gaming experiences you could ever wish for!","timestamp_created":1405543750,"timestamp_updated":1405543750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11275753","author":{"steamid":"76561198121735818","num_games_owned":366,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1598,"last_played":1515510150},"language":"english","review":"Fun game.

Akward jumping off of thin platforms is a bad design flaw. You do it mildly in the beginning, but then towards the end, it becomes a chore. Aside from that, the melee combat is too simplistic. For something that relies heavlily on close quarters combat, with creatures constantly jumping at your face, a slingle attack button does not cut it. \n\nPros\nAside from that, the engine still holds up. Mainly because of the art style and facial animation. The weapons are unique to the level, which helps mix up the gameplay challenges. Levels also have a personality of their own. I havn't really played other games with worlds like City 17. I think the haunting atmosphere is what sets HL2 apart from most shooters. \n\nI played this game with several periferals over the years. The keyboard and mouse, Xbox 360 controller, ps3, ps4 dualshocks,  mini keyboards with gyro mise and now the Rift. \n\nVR\nThere are a lot of wow moments. The ones that stand out most are the Alien scenes where you feel like their eyeballs are popping out of their heads when closing in on their personal space. Also when you kill a crab creature its fun to stare into it's mouth. There's a scene that reminds me of War of The Worlds where you are fighting tall stalky insect looking creatures. You get a sense like you are playing in a 50's scifi movie. Lastly, the mission where you get your last upgrade for the gravity gun had a cool 3d effect. The orbital balls that shoot out of your gun look amazing and ad to the immersion. \nI also thought it was cool to look down cliffs. I sometimes would commit suicide just to scare myself. I made my mom try it and she pannict and tried to take the Rift off her face. \n\nIf you wanted to nitpick the VR, I guess you could run into problems with feeling sick at first, maybe the 720p is a bit blurry when zoomed into your face, screen door effect is there but never bothered me. \n\n........\nFor improvements in Half Life 3 or reboot, I'd like to see fixes on the core gameplay. The melee system needs to be more robust. Put in a hp, lp, hk,lk system. For platforms, we need a parkour system where it's easy to pull yourself up ledges. The suit should also give you powers like rocket boosting/ jetpack. Maybe the suit should have gadgets that a secret agent would use. If you ever get lost, the suit could also act as a compass. Lastly I would like to see puzzles return. This is something that helped mixed up the shooting sections. \n\nOverall score 8.5/10\n\nLevel design: 9/10\nCore gameplay: 7/10\nMission structure: 8/10\nCharacters: 9/10\nReplayability: 9/10\nVariety: 8/10\nCreativity: 8/10\nProduction Values: 9/10\nPeripheral Use: 9/10\nCustomizable options: 9/10\ntimelessness: 8/10","timestamp_created":1405480534,"timestamp_updated":1405480628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11265426","author":{"steamid":"76561198087152303","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1415316167},"language":"english","review":"Meh.","timestamp_created":1405473624,"timestamp_updated":1405473624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11264987","author":{"steamid":"76561198070236315","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1448030467},"language":"english","review":"I might get kicked off of Steam for doing this, but I honestly just did not like this game.

Despite being about 10 years old, nothing about the game seems very dated, and offers the perfect balance of FPS action, dialogue, emotion, puzzles, and story, as well as a high re-playability value (Not to mention an excellent and unique soundtrack). Each chapter brings new challenges, weapons, environments, feelings, and enemies that couldn't possibly be replicated anywhere else, and held at a very reasonable price. If I am not mistaken, a purchase of Half-Life 2 also comes with Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, which is a single chapter cut from the game (the stand alone price for Lost Coast is $40, DON'T FALL FOR IT).\nA side note from myself:\nIf you are new to the franchise, I would recommend at the very least watching a few YouTube videos about the first game Half-Life before you play Half-Life 2, even though the plots are very different and you could still understand the context without it, I think the foreknowledge does nothing but add to the richness of the gaming experience packed in this wonder of ones and zeros.","timestamp_created":1405109737,"timestamp_updated":1405109737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11187985","author":{"steamid":"76561198055347766","num_games_owned":309,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":828,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":242,"last_played":1586627995},"language":"english","review":"They could not make half life 3 because Gordan Freeman's voice actor died.\n10/10","timestamp_created":1405108427,"timestamp_updated":1405108427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492140054702758789","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j6O/k8cCcfHWKg=="}
