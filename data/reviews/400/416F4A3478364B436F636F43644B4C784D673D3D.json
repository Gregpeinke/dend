Rounding out at roughly 2 1/2 hours total, this game is an amazing journey. Mechanics is the word that comes to mind when reviewing this game.\n\nVisuals:\n\nSimple surroundings (square rooms, bland halways, same elevator....) won't turn any heads or break any rules....that is until you start walking through walls...again and again. Portal animations are done well including being able to watch yourself run through the portal you're running through. The character model animations are a little stiff, but since there isn't any 3rd person option this doesn't really play a major role. Trust me when I say that you'll be to busy making yourself dizzy running through portals to worry about watching yourself...run through portals.\n\nGameplay:\n\nSimple until you get to the more reactionary parts of the later game. Dying isn't a punishment as you start back at the begining of the smaller puzzles while the larger ones have checkpoints (sometimes multiple) so you don't have to waste time from the start. This game focuses on simple mechanics (4 or 5 i think) and then extrapilates them (in different combinations) into a 2 1/2 hour experience. This more often than not has been done poorly by previous games but when parred with a comical (homicidal) mainframe, it makes for an enjoyable romp.\n\nSound:\n\nFoot steps sound normal as does the landing sound after jumping or falling. No death sound is used (you won't miss it...) though one was used for the multiple security drones you encounter (and will inevitably oust.) The star in this game (concerning sound) is by far the mainframe computer out to kill you for her experiments. Her dry (logical) take on your circumstances (and your hopeful demise) is ALWAYS well timed to break up any transition as well as giving the player a well timed laugh. I found myself playing the game again just to hear what she had to say...again....\n\nOverall:\n\nI love this game. It's something that my children have attempted to play and enjoy (though the later levels are beyond their skill level) and one I've loved playing again and again. I can't wait to play it again if for no other reason than to listen to the credits again.\n\n\n\n\nThe cake is a lie.\n\n\n\n\n\n.....or is it?","timestamp_created":1418871446,"timestamp_updated":1418871446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13424578","author":{"steamid":"76561198124369851","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":915,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1625255624},"language":"english","review":"I loved Portal because it was so fun to solve all those puzzles and I loved that sarcastic, funny A.I.

But to talk about this game it is a great game and one everyone needs to play at least once in their lives. From the get go the game makes you feel alone immediatly waking up in a small cell room greeted by the intellectual AI that is GlAd0s. Since everyone and their unborn child knows that this is a first person shooting puzzle game, i guess that's what it would be called, the puzzles at first seem really easy which they are but then get more difficult as the game goes on. I honestly found the last two or three the hardest and spent some time trying to figure them out. There's not much of a story, the second installment of the series, Portal 2, has more of a story driven game. You play as the character Chell, she doesn't talk... not once which I love because it's just you trapped doing tests and listening to an AI who wants to kill you. This especially helps with the feeling of being alone because the more the game goes on the more alone and trapped you feel. On top of that I found that this game was very creepy mainly because of GlAd0s and what she says the constant hate and sarcasm just makes me love this character more and more honestly more than Chell as a whole. It's not hard to complete the game, it should only take about 6-8 hours of completion on your first run if you have no idea what to do. But after beating the game more than once it's actually really easy to beat it even under 2 hours. If your one of those gamers who love to speed run games than you would enjoy the time chambers. This is just a mini game where you try to beat your best time on each puzzle no more no less. The other mini game is one where you have to take as little amounts of steps you can on each puzzle, it's the same as the time trial but with steps, the less steps the better. I have no real complaints about the game althought that it is very short for a game going from 6 hours to less, I also wish that there were more puzzles to go through were this has at least twenty puzzles but many of them are short lived. I give this game a rating of 7/10. It's a great game with the only problem being the length of the game.","timestamp_created":1418497169,"timestamp_updated":1418497169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13347185","author":{"steamid":"76561198019547124","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":411,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":411,"last_played":1405259862},"language":"greek","review":"Valve has done an extremely amazing work with this game...","timestamp_created":1418487977,"timestamp_updated":1418487977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13346544","author":{"steamid":"76561198083991751","num_games_owned":459,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":51,"last_played":1632149168},"language":"english","review":"A awesome puzzle game with a quite good story and nice levels.Plus,the boss fight at the end is thrilling!","timestamp_created":1418485593,"timestamp_updated":1640788639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13345488","author":{"steamid":"76561198083732711","num_games_owned":449,"num_reviews":148,"playtime_forever":928,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":315,"last_played":1506622145},"language":"russian","review":"Очень полезная игра она развивает память и ты даже используешь там физику.
