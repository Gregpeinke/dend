It actually fixed many of the issues I had with the original as well as get even better in other areas. It isn’t perfect but it is a damn fine game even  almost seventeen years after it’s initial release at the time of writing this. In the original Half-Life I found climbing ladders to be a chore because you sped up them too fast as well as took a lot of fall damage when you shot off them and landed. Well in Half-Life 2 you climbed ladders at a normal speed and fall damage was much better and more in line with what I would expect. I had also criticized the difficulty curve which I would say was far improved in the sequel. I didn’t feel at any time that things got much easier or harder, it was very consistent. On top of those fixes the voice acting was far improved. As well the sound effects were fantastic as were the physics and graphics for it’s time. The game offered an incredible atmosphere and world and many ways to interact with it. The battle scenes were fantastic with parts of buildings exploding and comrades coming to join the fight. I never minded that Half-Life took place in one facility but for those who did you traverse over a varied landscape with many locations and places the story takes you. Speaking of story the game was just as good as the original with a great cast of returning and new characters. As for non technical  issues there was really only one: the controls on the air boat you drive was very loose and was a pain to control at times. There was the same enemies and weapons as before as well as several new types of both. \n\n\tI played Half-Life 2 on Linux. It never crashed on me. There were a few technical issues. One was texture pop in with grass. Another was the AI for comrades was just terrible. They were constantly getting in my way and blocking me in when indoors or in tight spaces which caused my death a few times. There was also one instance when driving a buggy where I had to park in a garage of a house and this proved to be impossible because the car wouldn’t fit. I got half way in which not only qualified as parking to complete the objective but I lost a bunch of health when I bumped the side of the garage going in. There were 4 AA settings; 6 AF settings; a V-Sync toggle; 9 other graphics options and an FOV slider that went from 75-90. You could change the difficulty level at any time as well as manually save at any time. Performance was fantastic which wasn’t surprising given the game’s age. \n\nGraphics Engine: Source\nGraphics API: OpenGL\n\nGraphics Settings: All Highest; 8x AA; 16x AF; blur off; V-Sync on; multi core rendering on; HDR full; 90 FOV; 1920x1080\nGPU Usage: 11-40 %\nVRAM Usage: 1064-1398 MB\nCPU Usage: 4-13 %\nRAM Usage: 2.5-3.3 GB\nFrame Rate: 129-144 FPS\n\n\tHalf-Life 2 took the good parts of Half-Life and expanded on them while fixing what little warts the original had. It had a few stumbles along the way but nothing serious and in no way did they impact the fun of the game. It is a great game and worth every penny of it’s current asking price of $11.49 CAD. Just like the original it has several memorable moments and characters that stand the test of time. I finished the game in 12 hours and 56 minutes on the hard difficulty setting. \n\nMy Score: 9/10\n\nMy System:\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 580 8GB Gaming X | Mesa 21.2.3 | Samsung 970 Evo Plus 500GB | Manjaro 21.1.6 | Mate 1.26.0 | Kernel 5.14.10-1-MANJARO | AOC G2460P 1920*1080 @ 144hz","timestamp_created":1635025958,"timestamp_updated":1635025958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":28,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.732483565807342529","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101517834","author":{"steamid":"76561199028260435","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":4024,"playtime_last_two_weeks":69,"playtime_at_review":3180,"last_played":1660083380},"language":"russian","review":"ЛЕГЕНДА ИГРОВОЙ ИНДУСТРИИ","timestamp_created":1635024694,"timestamp_updated":1635024694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101517733","author":{"steamid":"76561198335217787","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":839,"last_played":1635024249},"language":"english","review":"This was a lot of fun and had lots of mechanics I haven't seen before.

难以逾越的巅峰 [/h1]\n在你心目中FPS游戏史上最重要的时代是哪一年？也许很多人都会想到神作井喷而出的2007年，像《使命召唤4》、《光晕3》和《孤岛危机》等大作以前所未见的精美画面和极具代入感的表现方式彻底改变了很多玩家对FPS的认知。但不可否认的是，这些游戏的影响力远远无法于1998年的《半条命1》相提并论，在那个主流射击游戏依然在模仿《毁灭战士》的年代，《半条命1》展示了一个生动的游戏世界，并以各种富有创意的关卡射击和互动讲述了一个有趣的故事，而不仅仅只是老套的找钥匙开门。《半条命1》可以说是为所有现代FPS游戏的发展打下了扎实基础。而2004年又是一个神作井喷的年代，像《孤岛惊魂》、《毁灭战士3》、《光晕2》，而从这些神作中依然能脱颖而出的，那就是V社精心打造的《半条命》续作——《半条命2》。\n《半条命2》在04年可谓是革命性的存在：紧张刺激的战斗、逼真的物理效果以及惊艳的次世代画面，不仅让当时的玩家们大受震撼，而至今也成为了很多玩家心中最经典的FPS游戏，即使放到现在其乐趣也丝毫不减。\n《半条命2》的剧情设定在《半条命1》的20年后：黑山事件发生后，联合帝国入侵地球，在7小时内便彻底征服了全人类。而我们的主角戈登·弗里曼依然27岁，是博士，被Gman从冷冻中唤醒后与人类抵抗组织联合，一同战胜这群外星殖民者。在剧情方面，《半条命2》依然延续了主视角互动的设计理念，游戏从来不会夺走你的控制权，或是用动画打断剧情的连贯性，而是让你自己探索并理解这个游戏世界。但本作的叙事风格还是有很大的变化，在《半条命1》中的黑山保安和科学家就像一群背景板，他们偶尔会帮你开个门或护送你去什么地方，但大多数情况下你还是能无视他们，或是为了找乐子而把他们全都弄死；而《半条命2》中的NPC们则拥有不同的丰富性格，让他们成为了有血有肉的角色，比如艾利克斯、伊莱博士、克莱纳博士、巴尼等，并通过角色之间的对话和互动来塑造剧情。在《半条命2》中几乎没有任何一个角色的演出会令你感到枯燥乏味，得益于真实合理的台词设计以及优秀的面部捕捉和配音，每一个角色的形象都鲜活有趣并深入人心，就连反派布林博士的身上都有一种独特的魅力，让他并不是那么让人讨厌。\n在流程方面，《半条命2》的核心玩法依然和前作没有区别：一边解谜一边对抗各种异形生物和人类敌人。不过《半条命2》的关卡设计明显更加丰富，从一开始你在17号城市用一把小手枪抵抗国民护卫队的进攻，然后驾驶摩托艇穿过运河，再来到被僵尸占领的莱温霍姆小镇，利用有限的资源艰难求生。最后你又回到17号城市，带领反抗军击退联合军的进攻，摧毁一架又一架三角机甲。总之，《半条命2》的每一关都会展现出新的元素和场景风格来带给玩家新的惊喜，保持新鲜感，而非像《半条命1》那样大部分流程都是在冷冰冰的工业风格场景中探索。不过也有一些玩家认为《半条命2》的战斗不如前作有趣，《半条命1》的场景都比较狭小拥挤，同时又有多条路线供玩家采取各种战术，玩家的移动速度也比较快，打起来就给人一种古早高速射击的感觉。而《半条命2》的场景都更加开阔，相对比较接近现代的掩体射击游戏。\n在敌人类型方面，前作的狗眼、牛乌贼、异形步兵、黑衣刺客等全部被删除了（据说因为一个黑客泄露导致整部作品被推翻重来），大多数情况下你的敌人基本都是联合军，他们不像《半条命1》中的HECU那样成群结队地朝你冲锋，而是零零散散地分布在各地，进攻欲望也不算太强，整体打起来还不如像《半条命1》中调戏HECU那样有趣。除此之外，本作中的武器也明显减少，这样一听可能《半条命2》是一部略显令人失望的续作，但实际上这些遗憾都被游戏中的一个新元素弥补了——那就是物理效果——把油桶扔向敌人，利用吊索到达高处，利用塑料桶让平台从水中浮起来等等。《半条命2》并不是第一款加入物理效果的游戏，但当时却没有任何一款游戏能像它这样将其运用得如此成功，从战斗到解谜，再到环境表现，物理元素被完全融入了游戏所有方面的设计。到了游戏中期你会获得一把重力枪，这把武器允许你最大程度地操控周边的环境，场景中所有的物品都会成为你的武器和工具：抓起一个刀片把丧尸拦腰劈断，或是把木板垫在沙地上防止惊动蚁狮，甚至将敌人扔过来的手雷在爆炸前扔回去，这些操作都带给玩家极大的满足感——你在干掉敌人后并不会认为自己枪法更好或血量更多，而是智高一筹。这种不拘泥于固定形式的游戏设计让《半条命2》玩起来更加有趣，整个地图就是一个巨大的物理实验场。\n尽管《半条命2》拥有大量略显复杂的机制，但游戏很少用文字或对话这种刻板方式来向你解释这些机制，而是通过引导和展示让你观察并学会：在第一关，一个护卫队员会让你把罐子捡起来，你可以把罐子扔进垃圾桶或扔到他的脸上，由此你会对游戏的物理机制和AI行为有了一个初步认知；当你第一次看到藤壶时会发现它吃掉一只鸟，由此你也会学会藤壶的攻击模式；当你来到沙地上，两个NPC会提示你不要踩在沙子上，如果你不听劝，他们便会立即向你演示这种行为会造成什么后果。如此用心的设计几乎也很难在现在的射击游戏里见到了，特别是一些10后的射击游戏，各种乱七八糟的文字信息充斥着屏幕，恨不得手把手教你玩，总之这十几个小时的流程真是一次非常愉快的体验。虽然《半条命2》的大部分关卡设计都如此美妙，但还是有几个比较让人想跳过的情节，那就是载具驾驶关卡（水障碍区和17号高速公路），尤其是水障碍区，这一关的时间属实拖得太长，一边穿越障碍一边躲避直升机的追击，而战斗几乎也跟弹幕游戏一样，大概类似于《半条命1》的Xen。只能说每个游戏都并不是十全十美，不过它们依然无法掩盖《半条命2》的光芒和成就。从一个FPS爱好者的角度来说，《半条命2》在当年可谓是有着非常独特的创意和先进的设计理念，并影响至今，而且也绝对是一部对得起《半条命》之名的神作。","timestamp_created":1634997709,"timestamp_updated":1634997709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.63409954309463501","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101495523","author":{"steamid":"76561198431211991","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":658,"last_played":1637632291},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo
