Good art design and environment\n- Very nice graphics even in 2020 when i played it. There are sometimes bad textures but overall sharp and excellent graphics very authentic as previous parts\n- Motion capture of Elisabeth is perfect. So much details but after all she is main character so its justified. Nothing more funny when she goes to unlock door with bouncing moves :)\n\nBut then the CONS\n- Shooting mechanic is simply bad. There is absolutely no rewarding feeling after shoot out. Maybe after bigger challenges later in the game and only in 1999 mode. But even that there is tactic for every encounter to complete easy almost without dying. Exception is that Siren -.- but there is tactic for her also i just realized it in 2nd playthrough. \n- Story is 2nd. Its starts excellent with slow narrative and solid background but then goes into infinite literally and you lose track of it in the middle almost.\n- Characters except Elisabeth are complete crap honestly. There is no single new unique character that can remain in memory. Comparing to BioShock 1 this is small child game character based.\n- Even if design is nice and graphics there are no unique locations all are visually similar and not unique.\n\nOverall its nice game but its not masterpiece like BioShock 1 in any way. Even if i don't compare it to any game and you play it without previous experience this game is not exactly something you should admire really.","timestamp_created":1586805118,"timestamp_updated":1586805118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67247599","author":{"steamid":"76561198055025143","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":901,"last_played":1605525729},"language":"polish","review":"Kupiłem tą grę na przecenie myślałem że mnie nie wciągnie.Początek gry był przeciętny ale potem akcja się zajebiście rozkręca.","timestamp_created":1586803976,"timestamp_updated":1586803976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67246972","author":{"steamid":"76561198165509303","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":852,"last_played":1587831524},"language":"english","review":"One of the best story lines I've ever played through.","timestamp_created":1586803329,"timestamp_updated":1586803329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67238378","author":{"steamid":"76561198070754663","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1010,"last_played":1587156964},"language":"russian","review":"Это просто ШЕДЕВР!!!","timestamp_created":1586793915,"timestamp_updated":1586793915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67233733","author":{"steamid":"76561198293194039","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":692,"last_played":1586788560},"language":"english","review":"Good Game","timestamp_created":1586789087,"timestamp_updated":1586789087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67232733","author":{"steamid":"76561198323540493","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1822,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1822,"last_played":1586787729},"language":"schinese","review":"玩完回味无穷","timestamp_created":1586788059,"timestamp_updated":1586788059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67229952","author":{"steamid":"76561198079385051","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1100,"last_played":1586785003},"language":"french","review":"J'ai fait le jeu une fois et je n'avais pas tout compris.

The story has a lot of holes in it and in the end doesn't really make sense. The whole idea about parallel worlds is interesting but needs to be done well. Unfortunately here it really isn't. Most of the stuff just simply has to be accepted. If you start asking questions you won't get a lot of (good) answers.\n\nAlso there is one boss in the later parts of the game (a certain lady) that is just frustrating especially on higher difficulties. If that boss is not rushed down quickly through pretty cheesy tactics it can cause a lot of headaches as it can revive a lot of enemies around you, is quite a the bullet sponge and can regenerate health while being pretty quick to get away. In general some the enemy encounters seem to be designed just around quantity instead of quality.\n\nAnyway I still enjoy the game for what it is.

The story is incoherent and riddled with inconsistencies. While it starts out okay it rapidly becomes tedious and many of the sections are simply shoot-fests. The method of story development is a mix of new and legacy methods from earlier Bioshock products that make zero sense in the new setting. The survival resources management, weapon upgrade crafting and scavenging have also been bolted onto the new setting that makes little sense. Finally the grand finale reveal that the story builds up to is actually the reverse of what should happen which is a bit of a downer, not in an emotional sense but on an intellectual level.\n\nIt is a very attractive game, the sidekick is well rounded and well developed with good emotional development but the presentation lets down that work. The characters are cardboard cutouts that have none of the humanity of earlier characters such as Ryan or Atlas.\n\nThere is no real stealth mechanic until Bioshock Infinite: Burial at Sea pt2 and even there it's not as good as say Deus Ex: Mankind Divided as an example, however that [articular DLC is a dedicated stealth episode and should and could have been done better\n\nThe game is more gonzo in the action and platforming aspects which is okay when you become used to it however it never approaches the level desperate fighting found in the earlier products, instead getting killed is just annoying and tedious.\nThe combat is very 'samey' and goes on for far too long, many players find that they only use two weapons rather than a mix for all purposes. In the Burial at Sea DLC the scarcity of ammunition forces you to use a slightly greater mix of weapons but that simply feels forced. The weapons have none of the beauty of the strange additions to the Bioshock weapons, upgrades in Bioshock: Infinite make no visible differences, and if you drop a weapon and pick it up later it magically has the same upgrades. It's slightly jarring which takes you out of the story. The combat is a different feel and this will depend on the player's preference but the sliding on rails thing got old quite quickly.\n\n[Spoilers Section.]\n\n- The ending is disappointing, and I say this as someone who counts \"Angel Heart\" as one of their favourite movies. Dewitt gets killed by the rather facile horde of Elizabeths at his decision point in his life where in another dimension he becomes Comstock, the evil antagonist for the game. However he is killed where the actual Dewitt you play *renounced* becoming the bad guy and living with his guilt, so in effect he's being punished for doing the right thing and then going through hell and developing a character arc to save Elizabeth. \nAlso, the choice of the baptism is odd (I'm an atheist so I'm not saying this on religious grounds) because surely the time to intervene with Dewitt would be *before* he gives away Anna and therefore none of the choices can be made, or even before Wounded Knee or The Boxer Rebellion where Dewitt does the terrible things that haunts him his whole life. This glaringly obvious mistake spoiled the whole game for me and ruined the development of the character.
