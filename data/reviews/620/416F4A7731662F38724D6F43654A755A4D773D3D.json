Valve makes PC games. So it's perfect.\n\nPROS \n\n+ Entertaining campaign\n+ HOLY POOP WORKSHOP SUPPORT\n+ Beautiful mechanics\n+ Feeling of success after each puzzle never fades\n+ Learning curve is perfect\n\nCONS \n\n- Can be a tad time consuming and mentally straining. \n- Certain puzzles seem some what repetitive. With thousands of maps, however, this is un-avoidable.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe fact that this game has Workshop support should be enough of a reason to go and pick it up, however, it is on sale quite frequently.

And the atmosphere... creaking giant metallic structures and dripping water... Superb music too (heavily Alien/Aliens/Alien3-influenced). The scripting and voice acting for Aperture Science CEO Cave Johnson is also very funny. Stephen Merchant I'm not so sure about, but Portal 2 really is a wonderful game and an incredible achievement. And no shooting involved at all! Just brain power and skill.

It's story and puzzles are out of the park. If you only buy one game, ever, it should be this.\n\nStory:\nThis game takes place in a run-down version of the aperture labs seen in the first game. But, unlike it's predecessor, you are helped along by a sphere named wheatley. As you try to escape, you end up waking GLaDoS, the antagonist from the first game, and you are thrown back into full testing. It's now up to you alone to escape.\nThis game's story is very deep and intricate, with nods to the Borealis in some easter eggs, and even the direct mention of black mesa. It has characters with immensly deep and suprisingly dark backstories, and is a game I contemplate still to this day.\n\nPuzzles:\nThe puzzles are much more difficult than the first game, and less hand-holding than before. It introduces some nice new testing elements, as well as makes new use of the old ones. The puzzles never end, either, thanks to the \"Perpetual Testing Initiative\" (Level editor + Custom levels on the workshop). The co-op puzzles double the fun, and difficulty, resulting in a massive need for teamwork. \n\nGraphics:\nThe game is suprisingly beautiful, for running on a game engine from the turn of the century. It's lighting and shadows outmatch other popular games, and they don't kill your system. My computer can run this game at medium settings, and my graphics card is an Intel Integrated Graphics HD 4000 (Planning on building a PC soon, using a laptop). It's still a good looking game, and will probably hold up for a while.\n\nAudio:\nThis game's music is always there, whether ambiently in the background, or boosting your pulse as you run through broken halls, death on your tail. The music is actually availiable free on their website, 3 full albums with all of the music included in the game.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThis game's co-op is brilliant, with customization of the two robots \"Atlas\" and \"P-Body\". Using the ping system to coordinate, you don't even need a microphone to communicate with someone random you meet. It even has a bit of story to the game, with the last level group revealing a large secret. The custom levels recentley updated to allow multiplayer, so this dosen't end for a while.\n\nIn conclusion, the game has a ton of nice features, content, and is really worth the $20 USD, if you are a first time player. I'm planning on getting a few more copies when it goes on sale to hand out to my friends that don't already own it, and play through with them. I love this game, and it's what got me back into gaming.","timestamp_created":1418907339,"timestamp_updated":1511379732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570469796657562256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13429002","author":{"steamid":"76561198117088069","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":509,"last_played":1451747057},"language":"japanese","review":"Portal2をプレイするとこのゲームの事しか考えられなくなるなどの重大な障害が残る可能性があります。\n研究チームによると、Portal2をプレイしてしまった際の対処法は、\n「Portal2をプレイしてはならない」だそうです。\nゲームについては調査中だが、中毒性に富み、\n睡眠とはきわめて相性が悪いことがわかっています。","timestamp_created":1418906309,"timestamp_updated":1418906309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13428843","author":{"steamid":"76561198128246025","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2819,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1555354960},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel ist einfach genial.","timestamp_created":1418905164,"timestamp_updated":1418905164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13426905","author":{"steamid":"76561198006392241","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":452,"last_played":1490159624},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game.

Olha, possivelmente o jogo da Valve que mais marcou a minha vida. Chegando mesmo a ganhar do Half-Life 1 e 2.\nEle é considerado como um jogo de Puzzle, mas é muito mais que isso, é um jogo de ação e aventura, comédia, suspense e raciocínio lógico. Com uma historia muito bem detalhada que preenche o espaço do enredo do jogo e uma gameplay divertida e que te faz insistir a jogar mais, possivelmente um jogo que eu tenho orgulho de zerar. Cada personagem tem sua personalidade e voz, menos o personagem principal, que se mantém calado pra manter a atmosfera do jogo. GLaDOS é a deusa das vilãs, ela é incrível e tem muito carisma, e... mesmo sendo um robô, sentimentos. O jogo é realmente difícil  e você vai quebrar a cabeça e uns 2 ou 3 teclados pra zerar ( Hahaha e.e ), se você pensa em compra-lo, saiba que não perdera um centavo com essa obra de arte que é Portal 2. E eu lhe desejo boa sorte.\nMinha nota final: 10/10","timestamp_created":1418872502,"timestamp_updated":1418872502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13422922","author":{"steamid":"76561198072638102","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":79,"playtime_forever":8288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4080,"last_played":1587749621},"language":"english","review":"I'M IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!!!\n+ Cake\n+ Space\n+ Portals\n+ Multiplayer\n+ Workshop for custom levels","timestamp_created":1418858271,"timestamp_updated":1418858271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13422068","author":{"steamid":"76561198048268849","num_games_owned":411,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":776,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":655,"last_played":1420234721},"language":"english","review":"I strongly considered being contrary and writing a negative review for the hell of it, but no.
