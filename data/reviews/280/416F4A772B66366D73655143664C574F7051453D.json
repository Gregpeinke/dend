I honestly cannot believe how overhyped and overrated Half Life is (at least the first game and its expansion DLC) by the fans, critics, and general gaming community. Sure, it might've been innovative and amazing back in 1998, but several years after - let alone several decades, it's a pile of donkey shit. You might tell me to not judge it by today's standards and this is a remake in a newer engine; however, Valve had the balls to re-release an already mediocre title to another engine without even fixing most of the gameplay problems on top of corrupting the port with many frustrating bugs that can be game breaking. \n\nAlso, I can compare it with older games at the time like Sonic Adventure and Ocarina of Time that are waaaaayyyy better than this dog turd that have aged much better. I chose to play this over the original GldSrc version (which is just heavily modified Quake engine) since Source is more optimized for newer hardware and OS, and the lighting/shadow makes it much easier to fucking see where I'm going or where to avoid or touch. I'm not really a big fan of the physics of HL:S though after playing Blue Shift and Opposing Force I'm glad it actually makes the movement and platforming much easier. The amount of bugs in this game range from hilariously bad to making it impossible to progress unless cheats or other exploits used. There's too many list in a paragraph so I'll briefly summarize it here:\n\n>Scientist sitting in chair in Anamolous Materials is floating on thin air somehow.\n>Tentacles of barnacles appear to be shortened but they touch you from Apprehension.\n>Killing some scientists will make you stuck in a room and won't give you game over.\n>Rifles and other weapons/ammo get stuck in mid-air after soldiers and grunts die.\n>Enemies can't damage you if you crouch then move in a very specific way to glitch.\n>Giant tentacles of squid monster in Blast Pit and Surface Tension cannot damage you.\n>Some shots completely doing no damage despite aiming at point-blank close range.\n>Getting stuck randomly or if going through tight obstacles unless using noclip.\n>Elevators not coming down in We Got Hostiles if re-exploring visited areas.\n>Memory leaks of the game causing crash to desktop after loading new area rarely.\n>Boxes and crates can kill you or break if pushed or pulled within random ways.\n>Ninilath not transitioning to final chapter with G-Man after it has green sparks.\n>Infamous graphical glitch making Surface Tension and Residue Processing unplayable.\n\nThat's just some of the major ones and some I remember at the top of my head, there's plenty more that people have even created their own wikis for it. Despite being ported to a newer engine, the graphics look fucking terrible and only the models of characters, weapons, and some map props got slightly higher-resolution and \"glossy\" textures. In fact the entire game suffers from being super glossy or dark as hell (GldSrc is even worse with the gamma) with textures that would make other games from the fifth generation look photorealistic. Hey, at least the sound quality is pretty damn good and I can easily get over 160fps at all times at 900p ultra settings (AA disabled) with no fps drops unless I spawn a hundred NPC's shooting a monster at once. \n\nJudging by the base game itself and not this port, Half Life has a non-existant plot other than a few characters and scripted events showing the progression of the story. At least in the L4D games characters would talk way more with tons of lore scattered in the campaign while the Portal games had GlaDos and Wheatley providing significant and funny commentary in the test chambers. Yet critics and fans have the guts to claim that Half Life has a very immersive and interactive story and gameplay experience. The weapons are so retard (ed) as well, with the accuracy, recoil, fire-rate, reload time, range, and other stats being the worst I've ever witnessed in any video game! Controls for the gunplay are so bad that I'd have an easier time going against veteran players in CS 1.6 and CSS.\n\nI wouldn't mind it if the enemies were easy to kill, but even they too are messed up in which they are extremely overpowered and can effectively use the weapons so they don't suck. If you think mastering the combat in Counter Strike or Insurgency was bad, then you haven't tried Half Life...let me vent out my feelings right now and tell you that I FUCKING HATE THOSE GODDAMN JUMPING HEADCRABS!!!!! Many of the puzzles in this game range from being very common sensical to being hard unless you've played Zelda or Resident Evil before, to being so fucking confusing and pathetic that only a walkthrough guide or video playthrough can assist with. The chapters Surface Tension and Lamba Core are too damn long while Forget About Freeman and Xen are too short.\n\nI can go on forever but we all get how crap this port and the original are so let's mention the few last positive aspects about Half Life. Unlike the original, you can choose whichever chapter you want and don't need to reload a saved game just for console commands to work. The water is pretty realistic in the Source remake while the original didn't have the above bugs, had Steam Cloud to save progress, and supported multiplayer. Also, the game is very easy and smooth once you beat it allowing subsequent playthroughs to be fun speedruns that you'll enjoy more than the first time you played Half Life. I would recommend the GldSrc version for most ppl (as it's huge mod support can make it superior to HL:S) but just save up money and get the remastered fan version Black Mesa instead.","timestamp_created":1534030393,"timestamp_updated":1534030623,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456373512744903564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44074944","author":{"steamid":"76561198802501852","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":100,"last_played":1542239983},"language":"english","review":"Half life 3?","timestamp_created":1534009496,"timestamp_updated":1534009496,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44028869","author":{"steamid":"76561198108559320","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":521,"last_played":1579404871},"language":"russian","review":"Мало отличей от HL1.

И я немного запоздал с этим.\n\nHalf-Life не зря занял место в истории. Это интересная сюжетная линия в хорошей игровой оболочке для 1998 года.\n\n[h1]Увлекательная теоретическая физика[/h1]\n\n[i]Завязка вкратце[/i]\nПосле краткого введения в то, где вы находитесь, что сейчас происходит и момента \"Oh my gosh! Что мы натворили?\" вам предстоит разгребать то, на что не хватит никакой лопаты. С голыми руками... [Так, одну минутку] Прихватив монтировку наш молчаливый протагонист физик-теоретик должен найти способ остановить вторжение, пережить волну зачистки со стороны военных, опробовать кучку уникального оружия на подопытных воргигонтах и выяснить, кто же такой G-man.\n\nВ начальных главах Гордон узнает, что есть люди, которые знают, как остановить произошедшую катастрофу. Но они находятся, мягко говоря, не рядом. Путешествие из точки А в точку Б будет не из легких, будет состоять из нескольких кругов, но костюм сидит хорошо и не жмет в районе паха, что главное.\n\nПроблемой становятся солдаты подразделения HECU, которых отправили, видимо, не помочь остановить вторжение, а убить всех людей в белом и умереть от монтировки. И монорельс. Я ненавижу главу с монорельсом и это где-то на уровне вертолетика из GTA: Vice City по степени раздражения.\n\nВ итоге, набрав советов от усатых белых ученных, десятки врагов впереди и десятки трупов сзади, мы в конце-концов отправляемся крушить обитателей Зена.\n\n[h1]Black Mesa и окресности[/h1]\n\nЛокации в игре сделаны отлично. Переходы плавные и мир практически цельный.\n\nИсследовательский центр Black Mesa - кладезь научного прогресса, спрятанный под землей. И для игры того времени размеры научного комплекса действительно впечатляющие. Продуманные коридоры с иногда незаметными деталями, которые придают окружению атмосферы, могут даже запутывать некоторых людей. Вот что делает отсутствие казуальной карты в уголке экрана.\n\nЧем дальше протагонист будет заходить внутрь комплекса, тем больше подробностей о его (пока что и нашей) работе мы сможем узнать. Основной совет: смотрите по-сторонам. Иногда там спрятаны приятные детали (или не очень приятные, зависит от количества крови).\n\nВпечатлил и мир Зен. Не менее детальный. Уникальный, красивый и опасный. Чуть более скучным показался промежуток между ними, на поверхности Земли, но в целом он не разочаровывает.\n\nИ отдельный пунктик за озвучку. Она так хорошо вписалась в игру, что нет слов, которые могут описать мои чувства к ней.\n\nСтрогая рекомендация к покупке этого тайтла относится либо к покупке оригинальной версии игры, либо полного комплекта игр от Valve. Source версия местами забагована и не имеет, кроме улучшенного освещения и воды, вообще никаких преимуществ. Если выбирать между оригиналом и ремейком для прохождения, то в 100% случаев выбором будет оригинал. Или же попробовать свеженькую Black Mesa.\n\n[quote][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/11769719/]Больше подробных обзоров на странице куратора Dreams of Genesis[/url][/quote]","timestamp_created":1532768900,"timestamp_updated":1532768900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":44,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.816730022430419922","comment_count":19,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43790603","author":{"steamid":"76561198214882603","num_games_owned":599,"num_reviews":108,"playtime_forever":2374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1574511212},"language":"schinese","review":"1.不跟黑山起源比，光是一代高清版也好过它，建模什么的都是早期版本的，不过会反光，跑步贼快，但这个更接近我的童年\n2.跑得快更容易失足而死","timestamp_created":1532757625,"timestamp_updated":1533002418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578086018562316895","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43785460","author":{"steamid":"76561198430727843","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":543,"last_played":1532728610},"language":"spanish","review":"7/10","timestamp_created":1532728678,"timestamp_updated":1532728678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43783201","author":{"steamid":"76561198323285605","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1615503600},"language":"english","review":"Kinda desapointed to be honest.

Я рекомендовал ваши услуги моим… э-э-э… работодателям, и они, согласившись со мной, уполномочили меня предложить вам кое-какую работу. На мой взгляд, вы имеете безграничный потенциал.»\n— G-Man[/i]\n\nПервая игра [b]Valve Corporation[/b]. Прародитель таких легенд, как [b]Counter-Strike[/b] и [b]Team Fortress[/b]. Чего только нельзя сказать об этой части великой франшизы [b]Half-Life[/b]. Без банальностей здесь никак. Пожалуй, именно с этого начал свой поход по нашим кошелькам [b]Гейб Ньюэлл[/b].\n\n[b]Half-Life[/b] предлагает своим игрокам уникальный по меркам даже современного игропрома стиль повествования. Почти всё происходящее вы наблюдаете от первого лица с полной возможностью взаимодействия, то есть на протяжении всей игры вы не встретите ни одной катсцены. Всё сделано на движке игры и работает исключительно на скриптах. Именно эта особенность позволяет максимально погрузить вас в атмосферу случившейся катастрофы на базе [b]Чёрная Меза[/b]. По сути, вы начинаете ассоциировать себя с главным героем - учёным [b]Гордоном Фрименом[/b]. \n\nСам сюжет максимально прост. Есть пришельцы. Есть выжившие работники базы. Вторым нужно спастись от первых, попутно сделав так, чтобы инопланетные гости не смогли выбраться с [b]Чёрной Мезы[/b]. На этом всё. И это, пожалуй, было верным решением, чтобы сделать чистый шутер от первого лица. Вся суть в атмосфере. Она поистине ужасающая. Первую встречу с [b]хедкрабом[/b], наверное, запомнит каждый. Когда это маленькое чудо из темноты набросится на тебя... Это непередаваемое ощущение. Пятки в зубы хочется закинуть и скрыться от ПК как можно дальше. Кругом учёные превращаются в зомби. На тебя нападают огромные щупальца (да-да, я про тот самый уровень). \n\nТолько ты думаешь, что большую часть самого страшного кошмара вы пережили, что тебе на помощь пришли военные, как выясняется, что они здесь, чтобы зачистить весь комплекс. Чтобы свидетелей не осталось. И так постоянно. Игра шокирует тебя на каждом шагу.\n\nК сожалению, в определённые моменты ощущается, что разработчики искусственно пытаются увеличить хронометраж.

Да в принципе ничего. \nМожно пофантазировать какой он была бы, если бы разработчики смогли реализовать все свои желания в игре. Например, на одном из этапов разработки в игре был пришелец, который поедал поверженных врагов и атаковал Гордона, выбивая оружие у него из рук. Кроме того, авторы хотели сделать так, чтобы от мощного удара главный герой терял очки и был вынужден мириться с туманом перед глазами, но тогда реализовать эту идею оказалось слишком сложно. Также, в файлах игры остались не использованные в финальной версии поведенческие скрипты для вортигонтов. Например, увидев убитых товарищей, пришельцы могли обратиться в бегство. Был и другой вариант развития событий — вортигонты умели оживлять павших союзников.\n_______________________\n[10] «Спасений земли при помощи Фомки» из [10]\n*Для лучшего усвоения пилюли ностальгии, советую сыграть в обычную (не SOURCE) версию игры. \n*Для современного игрока советую дождаться полного завершения ремейка этой игры – «Black Mesa». \n","timestamp_created":1530713012,"timestamp_updated":1530713012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43291052","author":{"steamid":"76561198193289119","num_games_owned":1163,"num_reviews":170,"playtime_forever":576,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":122,"last_played":1530377258},"language":"polish","review":"Odnowiona wersja gry Half-Life.
