1 was probably the first game I ever played and strongly got me into PC gaming. Alongside Team Fortress Classic and Counter-Strike, I was so eager to swap from using a family PC to having my own PC just to simply play this game - that's how amazing it was, and still is! For its age, it has a really fantastic feel to it and an engine that has adapted for uses even today (such as Sven Co-op and other MODs).\n\nThe best thing about Half-Life of course is, as mentioned just now, the MODs that people create for this game. The GoldSrc engine is the only engine I see still being used very frequently nowadays and has such a great potential for newbie developers or even professional developers. Personally I have probably done everything possible with the engine, including map making, media (video/audio creation), modelling and more - it's a really great way to learn how to make your own MOD or possibly even your own game.\n\nThe actual game itself (Half-Life, its story and the multiplayer) is also incredible. The story is unique (and with the newer Half-Life games in the series, it's still unique!) and the multiplayer is addicting - especially on the MODs (TFC, CS, etc)!\n\nI simply can't recommened this game enough - it's genuinely one of the best games out there!","timestamp_created":1448318285,"timestamp_updated":1473308236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5144004225730896","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19229466","author":{"steamid":"76561198105564790","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":85,"last_played":1451495937},"language":"russian","review":"С момента выхода \"Half-Life\" прошло уже 17 лет, но до сих пор эта игра получает восторженные отзывы от игроков с каждого уголка Земли.

И прежде чем голосовать против отзыва - трезво оцените игру, сравните с тем что было сделано за последние 10 лет.\n\nС моей стороны глупо плевать против ветра - 96% отзывов положительны, но прожженые стулья вопиют и требуют выговориться. Этот крик не столько об игре сколько о своем негативном опыте.\n\nВ детстве я прошел в Doom-ы, Duke Nukem, Hexen, но в основном играл в  стратегии и RPG, причем пошаговые (патамушта я тормоззз). Из современных шутеров прошел несколько раз первого STALKERа, а недавно, с большим удовольствием - Dead Space. Я никогда не играл ни в Марио, ни в прочие приставочные платформеры, где надо постоянно прыгать. Я насобачился более-менее стрелять, но метко прыгать с разбегу для меня просто мучительно. \n\nHalf-Life замучает вас бесконечными прыжками. Прыжками на коротенькие выступы, на скользкие полы и как апофеоз - на движущиеся островки. Нужно очень метко прыгать а еще очень местами - очень осторожно ходить. Шаг влево-вправо - и привет.\nЭто шутер или просто объемный платформер? \n\nУтомительные, абсолютно бесконечные  коридоры офисных зданий и производственных помещений. Какой-то симулятор уборщика только с дробовиком. Режим игры такой. 10 минут беготни - одна минута беспорядочной стрельбы по монстрам, которые появляются из-за угла. Да и невозможно просто выйти за угол и перестрелять всех, никакая реакция вас не спасет - вы даже оружие не успеете переключить. Надо перед каждым поворотом записаться, выйти, посмотреть кто где стоит, загрузиться и идти, заранее зная куда стрелять или кидать гранаты. Мне кажется это нечестным по отношению к игре, но игра заставляет вас быть нечестными. Это вообще нормально? Как пел Свиридов - \"секретный ход системы save and load\". \n\nВ современных играх к игроку относятся гораздо более щадяще, понимая что есть скорость реакции. В Half-Life нет даже уровня сложности. Ты должен играть отлично. Или перепроходить каждый кусок по тыще раз (счетчик моих часов в игре не точен - я просто пару раз забывал выйти из игры).\n\nДа, и можно было много простить игре если бы не омерзительная, унылая блевотно-говеная, безнадежно устаревшая графика. И эти идиотские, скучнейшие коридоры. \n\nСюжет в игре есть, но встреченные NPC расставлены для мебели и в половине случае их можно просто убить и тебе ничего за это не будет. Ни сопереживания ни интереса они не вызывают. Чего-то там себе бубнят и все.\n\nБез подглядывания в чужую проходилку вы просто не додумаетесь до некоторых шагов. \n\nКороче. Для 2015 года эта игра слишком сложная, бесит иногда просто до бешенства. Я прошел ее чтобы освоить классическую игру - слишком многое я бросал, не доделав до конца. Ну такой некий challenge. \n\nПрошел. Освоил.
