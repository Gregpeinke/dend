First of all this is a great addon to the original, much better than Episode One. Episode Two leaves a massive cliffhanger at the end which is why the internet went crazy for Half Life 3. It would be good but I can still live without it. \nPrior to purchasing the Orange Box in 2015 i had no idea what Half Life was other than it was what Garry's Mod was a mod of. After playing Half Life 2 and nearly perfecting it I was exicted for the two episodes that followed. Half Life 2 now sits at the top of my favourite games list and as a result I do not regret in any way, buying Half Life 2.

(tem vezes que da até raiva por que o desgraçado do gordon não fala)\na mecanica do jogo se mantem a mesma, somos capazes de andar, correr(por tempo limitado), nadar, interagir com itens  do cenário e atirar.\nHalf Life 2 é um excelente game da saga HL, com personagens e historia marcantes,em termos de técnologia ele óbiviamente esta ultrapassado mais a experiencia do jogador com o decorrer do game é o que realmente importa, um ótimo jogo do genero fps e da plataforma steam, um final que além de partir o coração humano(quem zerou e não teve ''aqueles feels'' no final provavelmente não demonstrou emoção com a morte de Mufasa em rei leão ou a execução de micheal ducan em ''a espera de um milagre) é mais aberto que oco de pai de família, dando a compreensão de porque é necessario/obrigatório um episode 3 ou simplesmente um HL3.\neu não sou de dar nota em jogos nas minhas análise pois alem delas não serem suficientemente explicativas e bem elaboradas, cada pessoa conta um argumento própio ou falta explicar determinada coisa, mais se HL episode 2 assim como seus antecessores merecem uma nota é 9,9 de 10, um dos melhores games que já joguei na steam e f#da-se o metacritic :)","timestamp_created":1434248891,"timestamp_updated":1434248891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16373380","author":{"steamid":"76561198020678205","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":551,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"I really like this game.

Кроме лесных территорий, игрок пройдёт заброшенные шахты, гнездо муравьиных львов и ракетную базу — все эти локации так же будут отличаться своей масштабностью.\n\nВо втором эпизоде нет такого сосредоточения на кооперативной игре, как в первом: хотя сюжетно игрок проходит всю игру вместе со своей напарницей Аликс Вэнс, во многих игровых событиях она по тем или иным причинам не принимает участия. Кроме Аликс, игроку предстоит сражаться бок о бок с дружественными вортигонтами.\n\nВ Episode Two был немного изменён инвентарь игрока: фонарик теперь работает на независимой от HEV-костюма Фримена батарее.

Most got familiar with it through Orange Box bundle, with the first Portal and Team Fortress 2.\n\nThere isn't much to say, it's has the same game philosophy. Just only longer than Episode One for sure.\n\nOnly this time they bothered to make one new enemy to vary things up. Combine Hunter. Quite a noteworthy, it's mobile and tough. Rushes at you, shoots you with sticky explosives.\n\nThe storyline also finally picks up and starts to get exciting even for non-HL2-crazy-fans-who-read-wikia-anyway. On bad side, it ends with cliffhanger that isn't planned to ever get resolved, at least so far.\n\nAnother thing to note is that it varies gameplay with turret-defence in the first third of a game. Turret-defence genre was very popular back during heydays of Half-Life 2 modding, every second made map was it. It's more of distraction there and will not screw you up if you aren't so good.\nAs final challenge, you will have to destroy waves of enemies, coming toward your base. It's fine-tuned one, has tension but isn't impossible. They also use this moment to demonstrate their apparently new feature that allows for more complex physics simulation when it comes to destruction and it does look impressive when whole house blows up. It works like pre-done animation for objects, so it's not exactly interactive or interesting thing by itself.\n\nBest part of the game got to be the middle part, where you once again will get to drive a venichle, letting you occasionally stop and explore nearby objects or buildings. I always liked that part in Half-Life 2 and this doesn't dissapoint. It even goes futher, as in one the of chapters you will have radar installed on it, that would notify you of nearby supplies. Jolly.\n\nThere are Developers Commentaries, yup. Where you will learn how amazed Alyx voice actress was to have no script. And a bit more of game-design related thigns here and there. Should have been more. But eh.\n\nSo, another solid FPS. Of solidness.

Оплот зла уничтожен, но праздновать триумф рано: на руинах возникла огромная воронка расширяющегося портала. Если захватчики смогут открыть окно в свое измерение, то землян уже ничто не спасет. Последняя надежда на выживание — данные, украденные Аликс из главного сервера Цитадели. У Фримена остаются считанные часы на доставку бесценного груза повстанцам из Белой Рощи.\n\nСобственно, этому и посвящен весь второй эпизод. Опасная прогулка сильно напоминает Half-Life 2Краткая информация об игре, хотя уличных боев нет — действие вышло далеко за городскую черту. Полюбовавшись минут пять на симпатичные елки, мы ныряем в катакомбы (в их роли выступают «Шахта Победы имени 50-летия» и психоделичный улей муравьиных львов; по крайней мере, таких подземелий в HL2Краткая информация об игре мы не видели), возвращаемся на поверхность для забегов по радиоактивной жиже, рассекаем воздух на полуразобранном «мускул-каре», решаем пазлы гравипушкой, дважды попадаем в засады, кормим вражеский вертолет его же минами…\n\nВ общем, старые яйца в тот же профиль. Правда, с парочкой свежих монстров и большим разнообразием знакомых ситуаций и декораций, в отличие от Episode OneКраткая информация об игре, где единственной новинкой были «зомбайны».

Прогресс не стоит на месте, и то, что вчера срывало овации, осенью 2008-го вызовет недоуменную ухмылку.\n\nОднако именно в техническом плане Episode Two выше своих предшественниц. Физический движок научился сращивать математические расчеты с заранее созданной анимацией, что наглядно демонстрируют крушение железнодорожного моста в первой главе и взорванные домики — в предпоследней. Графический — освоил мультиядерные процессоры, «motion blur», глубину резкости кадра и честные «мягкие» тени от фонарика (но их почему-то отбрасывают не все объекты).

I have not played with the new graphical mod but even without it this game has some of the most amazing looking graphics I have seen in a video game. This is partially due to its technical achievements but also due to many of the great environments we are taken to. HL2E2 has great new puzzles and is hugely important to the overall story. As I played the game I was brought to new places and met interesting people. Cool new mechanics were introduced and I was on the edge of my seat until the very end. \n\nIt is hard for me to put into words exactly how amazing this new installment in the HL series was. Know that it is one of the greatest video game experiences to date and it blows HL1 HL2 and HL2E1 out of the water,\n \n10/10 If you play one video game make sure it is Half Life 2 Episode 2.","timestamp_created":1431660742,"timestamp_updated":1431660742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530201315879821777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15829181","author":{"steamid":"76561198145640129","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":2168,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1203,"last_played":1643017664},"language":"english","review":"gordon where  half-life 3?  or half-life 2: episode thee where are is it i want win oh and half-life 2 episode two i win and episode one i am win and Jast i am win and too half-life 2 but now     NEW GAME NAME: Black mesa THE GAME AMAZING I LOVE THE GAME but the game are half-life 1 not so looking real but there game black mesa are crash gordon are go in city 17 that was hard but was amazing i have very much see  you boss of steam look like i have secret why half-life 3 i have secret Jast the boss not have money to buy half-life 3 gordon are friends  the boss of steam i was have a tiny secret i don't want to say it but if who want see half-life 3 say for me i have 100 secrets and.. oh i was have say say and say but gordon you good bye\n\nHi, I’m Sorry about my Bad Grammar, So If You didn’t Understand, I will Fix it for you,\nWhere is Half-Life 3 (Or Half-life 2: Episode Three), where is it, I want to Play it, Oh, and I Completed Half Life 2 Episode 2, and Episode 1 too, I Just Completed All If the, But when I Went to Valve’s Games List, I Saw Black Mesa, a brand new game, I Love It, It’s amazing, But it’s a Copy of Half Life 1, Expect the Graphics are Different.\nThe rest I didn’t Understand so I will Stop.\nGood Bye and have a Great Day","timestamp_created":1431630630,"timestamp_updated":1561890003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15825831","author":{"steamid":"76561198222694868","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":29,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3,"last_played":1431616817},"language":"english","review":"Is a good game","timestamp_created":1431615907,"timestamp_updated":1431615907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15821884","author":{"steamid":"76561197976316985","num_games_owned":541,"num_reviews":74,"playtime_forever":136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":136,"last_played":1411679099},"language":"english","review":"this was a vast improvement over epsisode one and is infamous in having one of the worst unresolved cliffhangers in videogame history.\n\nvalves reluctance to make a 3rd game of ANY series means that when you finish episode 2, you will be gagging for the next installment and dissapointed that its been almost 10 years without a peep from valve.\n\nits worse than the fade to black at the end of the sopranos.... \nstill, pay money for it","timestamp_created":1431592663,"timestamp_updated":1431592663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15808723","author":{"steamid":"76561198009671381","num_games_owned":2506,"num_reviews":307,"playtime_forever":419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":419,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"It's a good game.I recommend you buy and play it.","timestamp_created":1431497567,"timestamp_updated":1431634926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15806385","author":{"steamid":"76561198127939301","num_games_owned":285,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1443823024},"language":"english","review":"WE NEED HALF LIFE 3!
