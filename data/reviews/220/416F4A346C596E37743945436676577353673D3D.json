It was also the THIRD. I arrived at my grandma's house at 3:33. She has THREE houses on her block. I went up to the door, which had THREE chips on it, and knocked THREE times. After THREE seconds, she said: \"Be right there!\"- it had THREE words in it. She came up to the door and took off THREE locks on her door. She invited me into the kitchen for cookies, while all of her THREE cats ran past me, one of which had THREE spots on him. She told me to sit down next to the table, which had THREE chairs. She handed me the platter with THREE cookies on it, and said that her THREE cats took THREE of the cookies THREE times. So we sat down for THREE minutes, and talked about THREE subjects: Major companies, Games, and Numbers. After that, we sat in my grandma's living room, and watched THREE different channels. After a while, she started to get thirsty, so I generously got up from one of the THREE sofas, went into the kitchen, and opened the fridge. I spilled THREE drinks, but I got more for my grandma. When I came back into the room, she was watching a commercial for a product that said: \"If you don't get it in THREE days, it's free! Only $33.33!\" I sat down and started reading a magazine for children- the THIRD issue. It was on how to add. 1+1-1+1+1=3. That didn't seem appropriate for a children's book, so I went on the computer in my grandma's bedroom, and found out the company had been in buisiness for only THREE years. Now it made sense. It was time for me to leave because I was going to a party with THREE of my friends. My grandma gave me THREE seashells as a present, which I thanked her THREE times for. So then I left out the door, walked to my car, and drove away.\n\n\nSo, what I'm trying to say is that I had a great time at my grandma's house.\n","timestamp_created":1449543784,"timestamp_updated":1449543784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19558702","author":{"steamid":"76561198214147040","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":86,"last_played":1475968868},"language":"english","review":"Terrible.

Before I could ever play it, I saw the trailers from 2004. I was only 8 or 9 years old at the time and only had a PS2. I was finally able to play HL2 some time later and this IS the greatest game ever made! Now I don't know what was available at the time this was released. But this has a great story that makes you feel like you're part of the world. Great gameplay, part of this has to do with not having gigantic HUD blocking half the screen, Or stupid cover mechanics.  and the thing that really shocked me at the time was how well the characters words synced with their lips. The first time I was able to play was when I bought the orange box in 2008.. (When new games were $50 and not f*king $60) I had the whole trilogy (minus hl1 series) I beat HL2. I wanted more, so I played EP1, not as great but it's still pretty good. I played EP2, now I really can't decide which one is better HL2 or EP2... HL2 was definitely a longer game with more areas. But EP2 steals the cake when it comes to leaving a gaping HL2 hole in my heart. It's been 8 years and no news.. I don't really care but the more I think about it the more I want a sequel lol.","timestamp_created":1449426456,"timestamp_updated":1449426517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19530108","author":{"steamid":"76561198102861548","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":803,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47,"last_played":1464951713},"language":"english","review":"Played and enjoyed it\n\n+Fun and Enjoyable\n+Large Playtime\n+Goes up to episode two so their is more to explore\n+Get to beat the shit out of combine.\n\n-No Half-Life 3","timestamp_created":1449421547,"timestamp_updated":1449421547,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51557469367980957","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19528814","author":{"steamid":"76561198119910186","num_games_owned":343,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":1157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":97,"last_played":1571611939},"language":"russian","review":"https://steamdb.info/sub/66300/ \n\nО,Заебись так заебись :)","timestamp_created":1449418134,"timestamp_updated":1449418134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509325683116912842","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19524776","author":{"steamid":"76561198144846210","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":591,"last_played":1467392902},"language":"turkish","review":"Kesinlikle herkese tavsiye ederim oynama süresi olsun akıcılık olsun gayet tatmin edici.","timestamp_created":1449405907,"timestamp_updated":1449405907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19522892","author":{"steamid":"76561197962084587","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":776,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":776,"last_played":1449365955},"language":"spanish","review":"De los mejores juegos que he jugado, ahora entiendo porque se pide tanto un HL3.

Now you feel like you're just wandering aimlessly around some city without even knowing why.
