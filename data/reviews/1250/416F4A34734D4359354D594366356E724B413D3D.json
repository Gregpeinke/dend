Every single kill is a shot of adrenaline as you pump your shotgun and take aim at the next freaky mutant victim. When played with a bunch of friends, it becomes a real challenge without becoming too repetitive. Plus, with above-average graphics, stellar performance and special events through out the year, there's really no excuse for those Clots to keep their heads.","timestamp_created":1403549825,"timestamp_updated":1403549825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533492803573608398","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10721766","author":{"steamid":"76561197988279880","num_games_owned":272,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":39972,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36006,"last_played":1631562873},"language":"english","review":"Definitely one of my favourite mutiplayer game ever","timestamp_created":1403548868,"timestamp_updated":1403548868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10721553","author":{"steamid":"76561198130780264","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":624,"last_played":1418480168},"language":"russian","review":"Это просто охуенная игра больше и сказать нечего\n","timestamp_created":1403548636,"timestamp_updated":1403548636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10721121","author":{"steamid":"76561198050536542","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1040,"last_played":1573778942},"language":"english","review":"soo much fun","timestamp_created":1403548060,"timestamp_updated":1403548060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10720436","author":{"steamid":"76561198073563488","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":2848,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1346,"last_played":1545929399},"language":"english","review":"This is a surprisingly addictive coop, fps, wave-based, zombie survival.\n\nUnlike most games Killing Floor simply acknowledges that it is a game. There are multiple types of zombies with their own unique abilities, but not anything special. The game has a good variety of guns and maps, and a perk-based leveling up tree. The amount of achievements is off the wall. With over 250 of them, it's very hard to get bored of this game.\n\nNow, the only down side to all of these happy notes. DLC. $8 a pop for nothing but a retextures. $8 for a 4-pack of player models, that do nothing but change the way you look. $8 for a 4-pack of golden weapons that are the same as their in-game equivalents. The only thing that may be col is the community weapons pack, but even for a crossbow that shoots rotary saws... Not worth $8.\n\nBUT, that's not an in-game problem, SO BUY KILLING FLOOR NOW!","timestamp_created":1403547246,"timestamp_updated":1403547246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543859660625457764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10720204","author":{"steamid":"76561198006307552","num_games_owned":265,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3307,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2746,"last_played":1607557399},"language":"english","review":"Tons of fun!
