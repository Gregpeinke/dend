It's not fond of alt-tabbing... Or loading with a gun out... Or jumping on barrels...\n\nBUT, it is still very playable, and very interesting. And, moreover, it evokes a lot of powerful feelings in the playing. I felt genuinely nervous and on-edge traipsing through the halls of Black Mesa once again. Not having the luxury of HEV, though dropped armor makes up the difference... But that dropped armor can't be relied upon in the same way that HEV felt in the original Half-Life.\n\nAnd a trip into Xen before the end of the game? Pretty exciting.\n\nJust as well, we get a further look into the life and struggles of one Barney Calhoun before the events of Half-Life 2. Which is nice. I'd been sitting on these titles for a very long time, and I'm glad I've finally started to play them.\n\nLikely worth their full price. But definitely worth the pennies paid on Valve holiday sale.","timestamp_created":1602867176,"timestamp_updated":1602867176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77652789","author":{"steamid":"76561198142607100","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":352,"last_played":1659588261},"language":"english","review":"epic","timestamp_created":1602862288,"timestamp_updated":1602862288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77628708","author":{"steamid":"76561198114316590","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":532,"last_played":1600932241},"language":"spanish","review":"Entertaining

The level design is decent enough, fairly straightforward save for one or two environmental puzzles near the end that come off as poorly communicated to the player (hint: barrels can somehow connect detonation fuses), but elsewise this is a fairly streamlined, condensed greatest hits collection that is lesser than the sum of its parts, but is still an overall enjoyable experience.  Even after playing through twice on normal and hard, I found very little memorable, save for the comically bizarre deaths of all the other Barry Calhouns in the game.
