recomend this game to all my friendsº 8/10 or 10/10 on sale\nvery fun multiplayer/solo is infuriating\ngameplay is tight but very old school\n4 or 5 levels of difficulty great learning curve\nbeginner is a fair challenge and alot of fun, for me normal jumps in difficulty pretty sharply on beginner i can kite and live but in normal i always get cut off as soon as i start kiting so i have to kill the ones behind me and then switch to knife to run away then turn back to my crowd and hope im in a good position and after a couple seconds theres some more behind me so its a crazy amount of juggling if you lone wolf\nwith a team in normal but its still kinda hard so anything can happen which makes it a new game every time\nits CoD zombies but it feels lesser for some reason, the gameplay is like counter-strike but its on the unreal engine\na very old feel with this game even tho its from 2009\nthe DLC is not neccesarry just adds more veriety alot of meat on the bare bone of the game you lost\nfinishing: if you think youre gonna like this game stop debating and get the full bundle on sale. i regret playing it safe and buying only the bare game because the weapons that come with the game are enough and you will survive but i actually have fun with this game and now i would like to look cool while having fun in game so idk about you but i wish i would have just spent 17$ the first time. the second one is coming out tho and this game will soon be dead so at the very least spend 5$ for the bare game and hold back the tears for the

To start Killing Floor has a massive selectment of maps either Developer made or even Community made. You will never play every single map that Killing Floor has to offer but this means that you will never get tired of playing the same stage over and over. As a player of a 6 or less team you can choose from various perks that will define how you play the game, like being a sharpshooter, medic, or demolitionist. Each of these perks can be leveled up to 6 increasing how much damage is done when using said perk or how much of a discount on that perks weapons when shopping at the trader. Using your teams unique skills and strategy you will generally try and find an area in the map that is the most defendable whether that's because your back is to a wall or that you can weld doors in that section. Then you will have to fight the waves of the dead that each have their own specific talents as well, some will scream dealing damage directly to health and some will brandish chainsaws going into a rage and charging you as soon as you try to damage them. At the end of every game you will fight the Patriarch or in gamer terms \"the boss\". Weilding a minigun/rocket launcher in one had and using his talons on the other he is one big S.O.B. that you will want everyone on the team together to take down. \n\nIn summary, If you can appreciate the zombie survival genre then Killing Floor is a must buy that you will never grow tired of. With lots of customisable options such as your character, perk, and map you'll always find a different playing experience everytime you head to a new stage.","timestamp_created":1414451059,"timestamp_updated":1414451059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50189894437789917","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12662444","author":{"steamid":"76561198075196740","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6024,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1608,"last_played":1651722830},"language":"english","review":"Great Game!

The multiplayes is plenty of players all the time. I freaking hate the MP FPS, but this one is by far THE BEST handsdown. \n\nIn resume: a game that cost you around 5 USD, that gives you HUNDREDS of FREE MAPS, MODS and constant support from tripwire, seasson events like the halloween and christmas event makes KF the best multiplayer online coop FPS right now, you cannot have a better game at this  price point which gives you so many hours of fun.\n\n(Sorry for my grammar english is not my native language)","timestamp_created":1414345386,"timestamp_updated":1414345386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgb3jpskCdrCeMA=="}
