In this game, you play as Chell, a woman trapped in the Aperture Science enrichment center with only GLaDOS, an  Android incharge of the facility, for company. GLaDOs gives Chell the Aperture Science handheld portal device (better known as the Portal Gun) to run some tests with.\n\nEach level comes in the form of a test chamber. You must use the Portal Gun and other objects around you to open up the exit door and move onto the next. There are about 17 main story test chambers and some bonus challnge maps for when you're done with that. \n\nThe Portal Gun can be used to put Portals on walls, floors and ceilings.  You can go through the portals so you dont have to walk long distances or fall into deadly toxic pools. You can also transport items through the portals and get them where they need them to be.\n\nIn terms of Lore, Portal has plenty of it (Well, a fairly good lore, it's not as much as FNaF, but something like it) As you go throughout the enrichment center, you can find secret rooms with drawings and writing on the walls. These are speculated to be from a guy called Dougg Ratman, the test subject before you. The walls will have creepy things written on them like:\n\"THE CAKE IS A LIE\"\n\"SHE IS WATCHING\"\n\nNo review is complete without some cons, and I'll show you those now:\nCON #1: Too many time based challenges. Where you have to rush from one place ot another with a clock ticking in the background. It's stressful, especially in the final boss fight.\nCON #2:A bit short. I personally dont mind short games. I like 'em quite alot. But for people looking for a longer experience, I reccomend you play the sequel, Portal 2, instead.\nCON #3: Too many sections where you're just standing around waiting for something to happen.\n\nOverall, Portal is a mostly enjoyable puzzle game with unique physics, interesting characters and mysterious lore. I reccomend it to anyone who likes puzzle games or people looking for a just generally challenging experience. Due to its length, I'd also reccomend Portal to speedrunners, because with plenty of different ways to escape Aperture Science and short length, it's right up your street.\n\nP.S. You get cake at the end. ;-)","timestamp_created":1458399559,"timestamp_updated":1458399559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21924441","author":{"steamid":"76561198032638033","num_games_owned":327,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164,"last_played":1457046490},"language":"english","review":"Pros:\n- Semi challenging puzzles\n- Great atmosphere (creates the story)\n\nCons:\n- Very short and subtle story\n\nGet it on sale!","timestamp_created":1458397973,"timestamp_updated":1458397973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21921704","author":{"steamid":"76561198118045320","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":841,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":841,"last_played":1451608709},"language":"turkish","review":"+","timestamp_created":1458388486,"timestamp_updated":1458388486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21920230","author":{"steamid":"76561198197678345","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1458470725},"language":"schinese","review":"玩了一个下午（虽然才两三个小时），快速通关了，说实话其中有些关卡（后面几关以及复仇反击战）很有意思，可以说脑洞比较大，不过难度还行，就只有一个地方不知道是我的问题还是什么的，在第一个火箭筒那里那个管道怎么也上不去。最后用了几个硬盘一样的东西叠起来才过（这也行orz）。总的来说这游戏很好玩，玩过了和做了一套理综卷一样充实满足。对对对！最后通关了还有一首歌，未知女声留给你的，请签收（第一次看到游戏通关了还有带歌词的歌好感动。）。最后最重要的，win10可玩，自带中文。","timestamp_created":1458382885,"timestamp_updated":1458382885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21920149","author":{"steamid":"76561198205262939","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":352,"last_played":1468694045},"language":"german","review":"Portal stammt aus dem Jahr 2007 und hat ein Stück weit Videospielgeschichte geschrieben. \n\nDie Handlung umfasst etwa 4 Stunden Spielzeit, wobei der Spieler stets unterschiedliche Testkammern durchläuft und deren Rätsel löst.
