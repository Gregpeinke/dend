Purists would call it streamlined. For the uninitiated, Left 4 Dead is a fast-paced multiplayer FPS where four survivors must work together to survive a zombie apocalypse, fighting hordes of fast-moving Common infected and Special infected with unique abilities. It's a fun game with friends and has proven to be popular ever since its initial release in 2008, with L4D2 maintaining a community of thousands of players even today.\n\nIn this original iteration, only the Hunter (fast pouncer), Smoker (long-range snarer), Boomer (kamikaze horde summoner), Witch (extremely dangerous if angered) and Tank (guess) appear.\n\nThere are four modes in L4D: Campaign (play through one of a number of 'campaigns' in the story with other people), Versus (like Campaign but additional people can control the Special infected), Survival (the hardest mode, where you must hold out for as long as possible against the Infected and set time records), and singleplayer (Campaign with bots on your computer).\n\nGameplay is directed by an AI system named The Director, who spawns items & enemies, and changes the level depending on the status of the survivors. The harder the difficulty, the more contempt it has for you.\n\nThe presentation, as befitting most Valve games, is stellar. The campaigns are presented as movies, with 'credits' after the end displaying gameplay stats and a separate music Director controlling the incidental music. It does a good job of creating a zombie-film like atmosphere. Overall, like its sequel, co-op in this game can be very fun.\n\nOnly thing of concern is the community. It's not abysmal, and it's probably not even as hostile as L4D2's Versus, but it's pretty small and you'll run into some toxic players, given how cooperative and intense this game can be. (Of course, given the smallish community you may also run into friendly veterans.) If you want to play Expert at all, be prepared to do some janky metagame stuff to fit in - killing players who are below 50 health when they reach the safehouse so they respawn at 50 being one example.\n\n\nNow you might be wondering: with all of the official L4D campaigns ported over to the sequel, why should I play this? Well, there [i]are[/i] a number of differences that make L4D unique and worth at least one playthrough, even if it lacks Workshop mod support.\n\n\nRegarding weaponry and equipment:\n\n* The weapon animations are simply better than the sequel's. Fortunately, there are mods for L4D2 that improve on this, even porting the original L4D1 animations over.\n\n* The pistols are M1911s instead of the SIG/Glock of L4D2. There are also L4D2 mods that port the M1911s over to the newer game.\n\n* There are less guns, which means more meaningful weaponry choices. Tier one only has the pump shotgun and Uzi; tier two has the auto shotgun, M16 and hunting rifle. The shotguns function the most different: if you reload them from an empty magazine you must rack the chamber before firing. This makes a difference on the harder difficulties.\n\n* The melee in non-versus games does not suffer from fatigue; you can keep doing it as long as you need. This is helpful when there are no melee weapons to choose from!\n\n* There are only pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails; and no adrenaline shots, defibrillators or ammo packs. Which, again, can make for more of a challenge.\n\n\nRegarding your enemies:\n\n* Less Special infected (no Jockey, Charger or Spitter) make for a different and some say harder experience, not in the least because the SI that remain are more dangerous here.\n\n* The Common infected appear different and more true to what Valve had in mind.\n\n\nRegarding performance:\n\n* The game runs better than L4D2.\n\n* The HUD is streamlined and looks better.\n\n\nRegarding aesthetics and other stuff like that:\n\n* There are different achievements in L4D; for example you do not get achievements in L4D2 for beating the original campaigns on Expert. If you want credit for doing so, you'll want to do it here.\n\n* L4D2's campaigns and aesthetics are action-horror oriented. L4D's are more horror-oriented. While this is largely carried over in the L4D2 ports of the original campaigns, the optimal experience is playing them in L4D.\n\n* For those who enjoy glitches, there are a number in the original campaigns that have not been fixed. The Jesus Rock in Death Toll's finale is a prime example.\n\n* You can see your legs when you look down.\n\n\nBasically, Left 4 Dead distills the formula to its essence and consequently makes this first entry into the series a classic. I suppose this right here is why it's still being played in a nutshell.\n\nNot to say that Left 4 Dead 2 isn't bad, because apart from the weapon animations and its larger but more toxic community it's really not worse - just different. If you want a different Left 4 Dead experience, or you want to ease your way into the franchise by picking it up at the source, I'd recommend this.","timestamp_created":1310246257,"timestamp_updated":1641763995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597238898277282715","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"540206","author":{"steamid":"76561197971844533","num_games_owned":478,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":953,"last_played":86400},"language":"portuguese","review":"quem diria que matar zombies era tão divertido?","timestamp_created":1310242294,"timestamp_updated":1310242294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"130858","author":{"steamid":"76561197962808676","num_games_owned":1682,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2726,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2661,"last_played":1540162891},"language":"english","review":"Hella good drunk fun","timestamp_created":1310239464,"timestamp_updated":1310239464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5014760","author":{"steamid":"76561198044204138","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":107,"playtime_forever":1,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1312095600},"language":"brazilian","review":"Reinventou os jogos de zumbi.","timestamp_created":1310227062,"timestamp_updated":1385413328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"373682","author":{"steamid":"76561197969935747","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8516,"last_played":1501593004},"language":"english","review":"just awesome zombie killing co-op fun times!","timestamp_created":1310213257,"timestamp_updated":1310213257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70089","author":{"steamid":"76561197961095168","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2420,"last_played":1402802122},"language":"english","review":"Have friends?

The graphics are awesome, the music is amazing and the characters are fun.\nLeft 4 Dead is a co-op game and when I say co-op I mean it. If you do not go into it with a team mentality in mind you WILL have a ton trouble getting through the levels. However if you a good sport and stick with your friends this game will be an blast.\nThe levels are interesting and beautiful with a lot of detail to them while giving just enough hints to get the players going in the right direction. The music gives the game great atmosphere also giving players hints at what enemies are going to come at them. Because of the enemy AI system you are gaurenteed to never play the same level the exact same way twice.\nThere is also a PVP though playing as the zombies is incredibly difficult at first because there is no way to practice as one before playing against other people. You can also play L4D single player as the bots work decently. \nAll in all  L4D is great.","timestamp_created":1310163215,"timestamp_updated":1310163215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5081808","author":{"steamid":"76561198044858547","num_games_owned":3226,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1605380730},"language":"english","review":"An instant classic","timestamp_created":1310159251,"timestamp_updated":1310159251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485294133424758911","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1592255","author":{"steamid":"76561197995193849","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4768,"last_played":1633723969},"language":"english","review":"*****","timestamp_created":1310137205,"timestamp_updated":1310137205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kOiQhbECf7uJBg=="}
