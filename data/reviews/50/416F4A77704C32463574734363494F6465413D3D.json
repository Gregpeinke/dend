The story follows one of the HECU marines that gets rescued by the Black Mesa staff after his aircraft was shot down. The expansion features many new enemies and additional weaponry.

It follows corporal Adrian Shephard who is assigned to the black mesa facility to eliminate Gordon Freeman. The tutorial of the game is a nice change of pace compared to the previous games and is a nice way to get acclimated with the numerous situations you will encounter in the field. The game has some nice nods to the main Half Life game with brief shots of freeman and visiting familiar locales. The gameplay is identical to the original Half Life but the game also adds a large amount of new weapons to make it stand out from Half Life. There are also quite a few new enemies that really increase the difficulty making it one of the hardest of the series. The game is a decent length compared to Blue Shift but nowhere near as long as Half Life, but it offers plenty of fun throughout it. Overall the game is a great addition for any Half Life fans or even if you are a fan of older shooters.","timestamp_created":1498447751,"timestamp_updated":1498505896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32797710","author":{"steamid":"76561198015122587","num_games_owned":1696,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":606,"last_played":1498443225},"language":"english","review":"And finally I beated this game for the first time ever, what can I say about it? So damn good!!! hahaha\n\nI'm going to be honest at first was really lame lol was a hard transition from Half-Life to Opposing Forces, because I started to playing it after I finished Half-Life and it felt so different starting from the first weapon: \"The Pipe Wrench\" and I was like: Oh man... really? I miss the Crowbar... then the knife it was really attempting to be another game with the same name as the base game I didn't liked that. \n\nBut after progressing into the game and making it through the levels and some where familiar it started to take the shape I wanted from it and started to become the Half-Life game that meant to be. And I started to love it and was that I really loved it it felt like when I played DOOM 3 and DOOM 3: ROE the transition was rough because both are similar but way too different. \n\nBut you get to love it and you not replay the same game, because it has their original levels made for it and some re-used for the game to match the storyline and they did perfectly, bows to Gearbox!\n\nThe difficulty was pretty the same as the base game I liked it, well balanced and well made. Kinda short but what you can expect but you'll not get lost with it has a lot of surprises!\n\nAnd that's all overall it was a great expansion for a great game. I recommend it after you played the base game first you'll not regret it! \n\nMODS I used in this game: \n-Spanish Translation for HL: Opposing force and Blue Shift.\n\nHope you enjoyed reading this.\n\nThank you!","timestamp_created":1498445886,"timestamp_updated":1498445886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32796659","author":{"steamid":"76561198255203623","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":14,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1498442026},"language":"spanish","review":"Al parecer todavía hay 3 servidores en multijugador que funcionan, no sabía que este juego seguía vivo.

It introduces creative new weapons (You can use the ceiling-tenticles as kind of a grappling hook!), creative new enemies, and it even introduces a new gameplay mechanic; climbing ropes, and it was handled fairly well too. The level design is also a little different from Half-Life's. You're still in Black Mesa, but the game throws totally new areas your way that you wouldn't expect to see in Half-Life.

Among the most memorable are the Race X aliens, the displacer cannon, and the barnacle grapple. With its length being approximately half of the original game, and considering the large amount of new content, \"Opposing Force\" packs quite a punch. I'd even argue that the game is slightly more interesting than \"Half-Life\" - because I think it doesn't really contain any dull moments (remember \"On a Rail\" from the original game? :P).

Not much longer than blue shift, at least for my amount of playtime, it certainly offered much more in trms of story and variety; at least in a mechanical sense. However, my biggest issue with this particular one is that most of the common enemies, especially nearing the end, turned in to massive bullet sponges who pumped out tons of damage. I suppose this was to further encourage more use of the big power weapons (SAW, alien rocket launcher, etc.) and that would be keeping your squads alive but ammo for these weapons was somewhat limited for the amount of enemies there were and the AI for the squadmates is braindead; they sometimes just don't follow you or they run off to fight the enemieson their own, even if mortally wounded, and get themselves killed while you've taken cover and tried to gt your medic to heal you (who has also run off to get himself killed and won't heal you because he's currently running to fight alienes for the sake of freedom). Weapons like the MP5, Spas-12, Glock, and the Deagle (to some extent) quickly became null against the beefy enemies that you'll be constantly assaulted by. Even the humans enemies took way more damage than they really should have (at least 3 shotgun shells point blank) as compared to in the other two titles of the original half-life \"trilogy\" (Half-life, Half-life: Blue Shift, and Half-Life: Opposing Force). I can't say it's bad, all my complaints are above, and I still think if you liked the original Half-Life that you should give this and the other spin-off title a go just out of respect for the franchise. If I had to give it a score....I'd say something like...7.5 or 8/10.","timestamp_created":1496189948,"timestamp_updated":1496189948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32062435","author":{"steamid":"76561198083903947","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":380,"last_played":1495820299},"language":"russian","review":" ГОДНО","timestamp_created":1496150133,"timestamp_updated":1496150133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32018599","author":{"steamid":"76561198342540320","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1493444808},"language":"koreana","review":"2017년에 해도 재밋다.... 눈이아픈것만 빼면...","timestamp_created":1495973853,"timestamp_updated":1495973853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603938817977905273","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31961225","author":{"steamid":"76561198051083217","num_games_owned":2534,"num_reviews":593,"playtime_forever":480,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":480,"last_played":1495757565},"language":"english","review":"Not as good as blue shift.

Это тот же Half-life, но с новым видением мира, сквозь стёкла противогаза бойца H.E.C.U., с новым геймплейными добавлениями, с хорошим сюжетом, раскрывающим новые части вселенной Half-life. \nЭто - эталон качества, как и дополнения, так и игры, в жанре FPS, поэтому, сразу перейдём к плюсам и минусам:\n\nПлюсы:\n+ Геймплей одиночной игры. Он вдумчив и многогранен. Никакого тупого мочилова, только напряжённые схватки, и частенько вам придётся напрягать свою голову для решениях головоломок, хотя особого нечего сложного нет. Как уже сказал, схватки напряжённые, очень интересные, будем воевать - где нам только не придётся! - в секретном исследовательском комплексе, в горах, в мире Xen и т.д. Помогать нам в этом будет обширный арсенал из всевозможного оружия, и наши союзники - однополчане, которые имеет свои роли (медик, который может вас вылечить, сварщик, который прорежет автогеном вам дверь для дальнейшего пути и т.д.) и персонал этого несчастного исследовательского центра. А против вас будут и люди, из секретного подразделения Black Ops, и аж две расы пришельцев!\nВообщем, геймплей на твёрдую пятёрку с плюсом, геймплей разнообразный и напряжённый, не дающий заскучать.\n\n+Мультиплеер. Живой и тоже разнообразен, в зависимости от общества и режима сервера, на котором играете. Хотите - будет вам скоротечный, мясной драйвовый дефматч, хотите, будет тактичная, с определением собственных ролей в атаке и обороне, захват флага. Это круто.\n\n+ Сюжет. Завязка такова: солдаты из подразделения Hazardous Environment Combat Unit летят на задание в комплекс Black Mesa, в котором случилось что-то страшное (Каскадный резонанс то бишь), но по пути туда попадают в передрягу - и вертолёт сбивают, и главному герою - 22-ух летнему капралу Шеппарду, очнувшимся без оружия, одному придётся своими силами выбиратся из места ставшему адом...\nА дальше сюжет подаётся нам внутренне, через других персонажей, через саму игру - одна из главных особенностей Half-life. Сюжет хорош, интригует, и даёт нам много информации о вселенной Half-life.\n\n+ Атмосфера. Действительно, она есть, немного другая, нежели в Half-life - здесь она более боевая, но ни чуть не хуже. Притом здесь остаётся прекраснейший саундтрек.\n\n+ Технические добавления. Так как OpFor - это Ад-дон, дополнение, то всякие добавки тоже нужно отметить. И отметить тут есть что: кучу нового оружия, новых монстров, новых технических и графических фишек, всё это не даёт соскучиться - однозначно плюс.\n\n+ Большое количество пользовательских модификаций.\n\nМинусы: \nЛично для себя не обнаружил.\n\nПримечания:\n• Русского языка нет. (Есть русификаторы)\n• Достижения и коллекционные карточки Steam отстутсвуют.\n• По скидке игра стоит ~32 рубля.\n• Время прохождения варьируется. Вы можете быстро пробежать игру за 4-5 часов, а можете отлично провести часов эдак 12-13. Ну а мультиплеер может отлично вас затянуть. А если и не затянуть, то у вас всегда будет возможность хорошо провести в нём пару матчей.\n\n\nИтог:\nHalf-Life: Opposing Force - это детально проработаный аддон, да что там аддон - отдельная игра, повторюсь - эталон качества FPS и дополнений.\nВсем рекомендую к употреблению. 10\\10.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat is Half-Life: Opposing Force? This is the same Half-life, but with a new vision of the world, through the glass of the gas mask of the fighter H.E.C.U., with new gameplay additions, with a good story, revealing new parts of the Half-life universe.\nThis - the standard of quality, as well as add-ons, and games in the genre of FPS, so, immediately move on to the pluses and minuses:\n\nPros:\n+ Gameplay of a single player. He is thoughtful and multifaceted. No blunt mochilov, only intense bouts, and often you will have to strain your head for solving puzzles, although there is nothing much complicated. As already said, the fights are intense, very interesting, we will fight - where we just do not have to! - in a secret research complex, in the mountains, in the world of Xen, etc. To help us in this will be a vast arsenal of all kinds of weapons, and our allies are fellow soldiers who have their roles (a medic who can cure you, a welder who will cut through the autogen to you door for further ways, etc.) and the staff of this unfortunate research center. And against you will be people from the secret division of Black Ops, and already two races of aliens!\nIn general, the gameplay on a solid five with a plus, the gameplay is diverse and tense, not giving boredom.\n\n+ Multiplayer. Live and also varied, depending on the society and the server mode on which you are playing. Do you want - will you be fleeting, meat drive defmatch, want to be tactful, with the definition of their own roles in the attack and defense, capture the flag. That's cool.\n\n+ The plot. The plot is as follows: the soldiers from the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit are flying to the Black Mesa complex, in which something terrible has happened (Cascade resonance, I mean), but on the way they get into trouble and they shoot down the helicopter, and the main character - the 22-year- wit the old corporal Sheppard, waking up without a weapon, one will have to get out of the place with his own strength ...\nAnd then the plot is given to us internally, through other characters, through the game itself - one of the main features of Half-life. The plot is good, intriguing, and gives us a lot of information about the universe of Half-life.\n\n+ Atmosphere. Indeed, it is, slightly different than in Half-life - here it is more militant, but not nearly worse. Moreover, there remains the most beautiful soundtrack.\n\n+ Technical additions. Since OpFor is an Ad-Don, an addition, then all sorts of additives should also be noted. And note there is that: a bunch of new weapons, new monsters, new technical and graphic chips, all this does not let you get bored - definitely a plus.\n\n+ A large number of custom modifications.\n\nMinuses:\nI personally did not find it for myself.\n\nNotes:\n• There is no Russian language. (There are crackers)\n• There are no achievements and collectible Steam cards.\n• At a discount, the game costs ~ 32 rubles.\n• The travel time varies. You can quickly run the game in 4-5 hours, or you can perfectly spend 12 hours. Well, multiplayer can perfectly tighten you. And if you do not tighten, then you will always have the opportunity to spend a good pair of matches in it.\n\n\nOutcome:\nHalf-Life: Opposing Force - this is a detailed addon, but what is the addon - a separate game, I repeat - the standard of quality FPS and add-ons.\nI recommend it to everyone. 10 \\ 10.","timestamp_created":1494269927,"timestamp_updated":1514808063,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.582433938980102539","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31606420","author":{"steamid":"76561198081290128","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":375,"last_played":1469955166},"language":"english","review":"8/10","timestamp_created":1494170200,"timestamp_updated":1494170200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459882587194442749","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31594912","author":{"steamid":"76561197994506042","num_games_owned":526,"num_reviews":184,"playtime_forever":511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1493859191},"language":"english","review":"Don't know what to make of this one. On one hand, yeah, you're basically doing everything again, but this time with a green HUD. On the other, this is an extension of an amazing game. So, what's different? Actually a lot.\n\nFor one, the tutorial. Actually kind of sets the mood; putting you through boot camp, and full metal jacket boot camp too. And then you actually get into game. You gotta meet officer chunk. The living meme himself, proto-paul blart mall cop. This time he's on your side and he's ready to fight. Of course, after he's done shoving his hand in a vending machine.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the funhouse ends, and its time to dive face first into what you really came here for: the Black Mesa vent crawling simulator. This one is significantly longer than Blue Shift, and it kind of follows the same structure as the first game, with some welcome deviations, of course. At this point, I feel like I must've explored a million miles of the facility, and that it must be bigger than the entirety of civilization, despite it only having a small lunch area, and one lobby.\n\nIf I could point to any game between the three of them as being the weak link, I think it'd be this one. Feels a little less cooked than the others. I don't know. The NPCs are useless, same as before, but the difference is this time instead of just being in your way, they're necessary for progression AND in your way. Woooo! The gun selection is slightly larger this time around, too. You get a few new toys, and a reskin of a toy you already had. (Looking at you, magnum pistol.) \n\nWhat else is there. Did I mention NPCs are useless? You actually need their help at crucial points in game. No joking. You need everything to fight the new alien super elite. And they're packing heat too; enough to shred you and your fellows like paper. This game gave me the most trouble out of the three. And that's no small feat considering the difficulty curve on the original Half Life. These new aliens are tough.\n\nThe cherry on top is the last area leading up to the ending. It's underwhelming. I didn't even know I was walking in on the final boss before he just appeared to challenge me to a dangerous game of Uno. What he didn't count on was me being smart enough to immedietly beat him in two minutes, completely nullifying his presence as a final boss. I prefered giant floating fetus, honestly.\n\nWould I count this as necessary? Not really. It's a Half Life game, so it's still a million times better than any regular FPS though. I'd consider the time well spent, even if this time around I was a little more disillusioned. The memes were spicy.

Instead of playing as Gordon Freeman from the normal game, you play as Adrian Shepard, one of the many soldiers invading the Black Mesa base in order to destroy Freeman, and end the alien infestation.\n\nMuch like the normal game, this game has no cutscenes, and mostly keeps you in control the whole time. Decisions you make can be based off of what you want to do, not what the game wants you to do. \n\nA lot of the gun fights in this game are intense as hell, so expect a ton of heavy fire from the enemies in this game. Thankfully, this expansion adds a whole cake load of new weaponry that wasn't in the normal game. There are so many weapon choices, you can get overwhelmed sometimes at how much scrolling you'd have to do mid-combat. That's only a minor issue. All of the weapons play beautifully, and are pretty dang creative. \n\nWith new weapons also comes new enemies, and this game throws quite a bit of new enemies into the game. You'll only see the enemies from the normal game near the beginning, but later, the newer enemies make more prominent appearances. \n\nThis game's tutorial stage is also something really cool. Even if you know how to play an FPS, you should still check out the tutorial. It makes the game's story feel a little more fleshed out.\n\nThe few nitpicks I have are the aforementioned over saturation of weapons you get, and I also think that some of the chapters in this game just feel like a repeat of a normal Half-Life chapter, just with different complications and locations. Also, platforming is still an issue, but it shows up much less often than it did in normal-life. \n\nOverall: 8.5/10\nOne of the best expansions, and a good example for making a good expansion pack. This doesn't dissapoint. \n\nI recommend you play normal Half-Life first. It enhances the flavor of this game.","timestamp_created":1493777640,"timestamp_updated":1493777640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpL2F5tsCcIOdeA=="}
