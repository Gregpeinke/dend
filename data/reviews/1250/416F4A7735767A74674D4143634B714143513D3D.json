Тем не менее, со временем модификация была выпущена в виде игры, которую вы видите перед собой.\nСтоит сказать пару слов о сюжете: его нет. Ну, то есть, формально он присутствует и может быть рассказан в паре предложений о том, что из под контроля корпорации Horzine вырвались орды клонов, созданных по заказу британского Министерства Обороны, и теперь мутанты вырезают Лондон и окрестности, а вы - один из тех людей, кто им противостоит.\nЭто не Left4Dead - зомби здесь не слепые и найдут вас, даже если вы будете сидеть абсолютно неподвижно. Безопасных мест на картах нет, есть лишь те, где монстрам сложнее зайти со спины.\nК минусам игры стоит отнести устаревший движок, наличие багов на новых картах и очень высокий порог вхождения.\nПро сложность стоит рассказать отдельно. Все игры от Tripwire Interactive отличаются высокой степенью хардкорости. Добротно сделанные модели оружия, конечно, несколько отличаются от реальных образцов по убойной силе (пистолет Т-9 наносит урона больше, чем автомат системы bull-pup!), однако, прицел появляется перед глазами игрока только в том случае, если таковой имеется у оружия и нажата кнопка прицеливания. Монстры прут со всех сторон, и новички по началу пытаются спрятаться или убежать, броня не очень крепка, а непрокачанные навыки не дают практически никаких преимуществ. Одним словом, если вы привыкли играть в игры, где без вас битва за планету не сдвинется с мёртвой точки, то эта игра не для вас. Выжить в одиночку здесь крайне сложно, а поначалу - просто невозможно.\nИменно командный дух в первую очередь добавляет баллов этой игре. Во-вторых, к плюсам следует отнести регулярно выходящие обновления, добавляющие в игру новое оружие, скины и карты. Начиная с зимнего обновления 2014 появились (официально) карты, на которых нужно не просто покрошить монстров в мелкую капусту, а выполнить определённое задание. В игре можно прокачивать навыки и получать огромное количество достижений Steam.","timestamp_created":1375126612,"timestamp_updated":1405099413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522293031215667725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1326220","author":{"steamid":"76561197991454757","num_games_owned":1045,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":13569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13385,"last_played":1485664734},"language":"english","review":"ZOMBIES ZOMBIES ZOMBIES ZOMBIES ZOMBIES!

Unlike other cooperative \"zombie shooters,\" this game does not reward the soloist; instead often resulting in other players seeing the message \"[this guy] was killed by [this thing]\" and occasionally sparking a \"rage quit.\" But this does not mean the game is not enjoyable; in fact quite to the contrary. The necessity of teamwork really brings the entire game together and gives you lots of reasons to experiment and work with the different classes.\n\nOf the seven classes available, you will often see the server divided into four or five of them; with at least one medic if the team is to survive. Each class not only benefits the player but forms a perfect synergy with the others and creates a real squadron feeling to the entire game. While the game rewards a balanced team where everyone plays to their strengths; it also works to the contrary and punishes those who don't work together or are glad to abandon their team-mate's sides.\n\nWeapons are widely varied and mostly benefit from their specific perks (Commando class users benefit from perks boosting the effectiveness of Assault/Battle Rifles; for example) but aren't exclusive to those classes. A demolitions user isn't limited to just explosives; while a medic can just as happily carry a shotgun, which benefits the players greatly. While classes do help, it isn't uncommon to see people branching out with their weapons in order to keep the benefits of one class while levelling their progress towards another (you don't need to be a specific class to earn progress in it). There are a wide variety of weapons available, including fire axes; handguns; crossbows; grenade launchers; shotguns; assault rifles and even medic guns which allow the user to heal players from a distance by firing medical darts with the guns secondary fire and EVERYONE has access to that most sacred of crowd control methods: the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch (okay, maybe I exaggerate... Maybe it's just a standard fragmentation grenade, but one can dream?).\n\nIn terms of maps, in addition to the original maps included in the release; subsequent FREE map releases have increased the map count from the original five to the current twenty-eight official maps; which means the game has at least 560% more content than it did, not counting the new weapons or events which run every so often. Games can range from the confined corridors of the Biotics Lab, to the open streets of West London, even stretching as far (and obscurely) as the Evil Santa's Lair!\nThere'll be at least one map which ought to bring you some enjoyment; although each map is designed in such a charming way that the tactics can be transferred from one to the next; so long as you find the right spot to use the old tactic.\n\nEnemy variety is something which is important, but this game doesn't offer hundreds of unique enemies, or procedural spawning. It's not that they aren't good ideas, but rather that they're just unnecessary in this game. The enemies come at you wave after wave and while they start spawning undoubtedly tougher enemies, they still give you that bit of cannon fodder to distract you. The cannon fodder though, should be taken seriously in every case. Even the clots (most likely the first specimen you'll ever encounter; at least for your sake I hope so) can take down an experienced player if they don't pay attention. Every enemy has a special ability, which can range from the nuisance of the clots grabbing you and stopping you from moving to the Fleshpound's \"rage mode,\" which can reduce even the most dedicated Macho Man Randy Savage enthusiasts to a quivering pile of diuretic mound of man-flesh in only a few unstructured (and oddly effeminate scream filled) seconds.\nBut no specimen is above being pulverised by a well-oiled machine, which can come from even the most ragtag band of misfits.\n\n\nAll in all, this game hasn't changed much from it's 2005 release as a standalone mod for Unreal Tournament 2004; but this is in no way to it's detriment. In fact, it retains the wonderful charm of the mod but with the added bonus of so much free content (yes, there's paid DLC; but considering how much free stuff has been added, I can't say that they haven't earned the right to release it) and the wonderful balancing of every aspect of the game; the game still earns regular playtime from myself (having been a player since I first downloaded 1.0 back in 2006; back when it was much grimier) and will continue to do so. If your computer was good enough to run Unreal Tournament 2004 back in the day; I fail to see a reason why you'd NOT wish to purchase this title.\n\nOh and to top it off, if achievements are your thing; get ready to sink a tremendous amount of time into earning all 252 and counting!","timestamp_created":1375015619,"timestamp_updated":1389386007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2604269","author":{"steamid":"76561198009902056","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6344,"last_played":1383328059},"language":"english","review":"Good, fun co-op shooter game cant go wrong for the money just need to make killing floor 2.","timestamp_created":1375009964,"timestamp_updated":1375009964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5166605","author":{"steamid":"76561198045859613","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":112,"playtime_forever":459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":429,"last_played":1412679523},"language":"english","review":"It's like crawling with your lips.","timestamp_created":1374997886,"timestamp_updated":1374997886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"985051","author":{"steamid":"76561197983692596","num_games_owned":736,"num_reviews":309,"playtime_forever":745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":659,"last_played":1373935039},"language":"russian","review":"С друзьями поиграть от нефиг делать можно пару вечеров, дальше она тупо надоедает однооброазием, унылостью.

El juego básicamente consiste en sobrevivir a oleadas de monstruos hasta alcanzar una oleada final dónde enfrentarse a un jefe final. Y así una y otra vez. Existe otro modo por objetivos, pero en esencia es lo mismo. \n\nEl juego es sencillo y simple en su planteamiento, pero muy divertido y adictivo a la práctica. Hay mucha variedad de armas y de personajes que escoger. Además hay diferentes tipos de soldados cada uno con ventajas y atributos especiales que los hacen más apropiados para determinadas situaciones y el manejo de diferentes tipos de armas. \n\nSu modo online funciona perfectamente y es fácil encontrar servidores y jugadores pese a llevar muchos años en el mercado. \n\nAsí pues y cómo resumen, aconsejo comprar este juego a todos los que busquen un juego simple y sencillo que les aporte grandes dosis de diversión. Además es un juego que frecuentemente está de oferta, y suele ir acompañado de contenido extra, cómo armas, escenarios o skins. \n\nUn saludo a todos.","timestamp_created":1374615112,"timestamp_updated":1419888310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6718305","author":{"steamid":"76561198073247752","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":3504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2148,"last_played":1488038754},"language":"english","review":"cool game :)","timestamp_created":1374610789,"timestamp_updated":1374610789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5009061","author":{"steamid":"76561198044152207","num_games_owned":1093,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":4006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3783,"last_played":1391112922},"language":"polish","review":"Ta gra to masakra i to w bardzo pozytywnym znaczeniu,Mimo swoich estetycznych walorów i grafiki wciaga na całego co dokumentuje ilość graczy która w nią gra.","timestamp_created":1374604433,"timestamp_updated":1374604433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1666411","author":{"steamid":"76561197996130104","num_games_owned":487,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":31029,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3408,"last_played":1659206430},"language":"english","review":"BEST GAME EVER! :D","timestamp_created":1374596092,"timestamp_updated":1374596092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2752141","author":{"steamid":"76561198012095057","num_games_owned":414,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":17292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15479,"last_played":1651724473},"language":"english","review":"Looking for a fast pace first person shooter where you can interact with a team of players or go solo for 10 action packed rounds of SURVIVAL?

game will show you what real team-work is.Because alone you don't stand even a tiny chance to survive,and death of one teammate often results in death of whole team.You'll need to search for a good defensive positions,block the doors,or on the countrary,stay constantly on the run-depending on circumstances.\n  Also,there's money and ammo managment-if you want big gunz,and if you want them actually loaded with ammo-you need to earn them,and SURVIVE,before that.An option to drop cash for teammates really helps here.And you can heal yourself,but if someone heals you-the process will be faster,so keep that in  mind too.\n  Knowing maps is crucial-it's not Quake or Counter-Strike of course,but there's plenty not-so-obvious-stuff here too.\n  And,when you'd think that everything is nice and you're going for the win-there's a Final Boss of the map.This mofo can among other things, turn invisible and heal,be a sure Doom-bringer for anyone closer than twenty meters away,and also he brings a really fitting soundtrack  with him,to get you in kick-ass mood :)\n\nWell,if you like challenges,massacres,decapitations,and tactical-team-FPSers-give it a try,you'll most certainly like it.If not-well,try it some more.This game isn't one to be awesome at first site.You'll need to taste it good,before making judgement.Also,of course competent team and a headset is required.Got both?Well,then,Happy Killing
