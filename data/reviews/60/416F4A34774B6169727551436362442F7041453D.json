Las escenas del espacio y de las naves espaciales son increibles, mi parte favorita hablando de eso fue cuando Lobao encontro a los guardianes de la galaxia, esa panoramica fue genial. volviendo al tema el espacio se ve estupendo(aun mas si lo juegos en HD).\nLa banda sonora tambien es buena ya que participa la orquesta de Star Wars, La banda Brazileña Cheiro de Calchina( la que le da la voz a los personajes del juego) y Metallica lo cual genera una gran experiencia audivisual.","timestamp_created":1538705978,"timestamp_updated":1589392456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568251192569732666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45105306","author":{"steamid":"76561198350558471","num_games_owned":430,"num_reviews":224,"playtime_forever":232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1552602573},"language":"spanish","review":"[h1]Ricochet / Rebotar[/h1]\nUna modificacion del Half Life lanzado en el 2000.

There is no jump or duck function; instead, platforms have jump points that kick you from platform to platform. Scoring a direct hit and kicking another player off a platform into the void is worth one point, as is a decapitation. If your disc bounces once and then hits a player, that's two points. Two bounces is three points, and I imagine this pattern continues, though I've never managed more than two bounces.\n\nThis game is great for fast-paced action, although as other reviews have pointed out, not many people play anymore.

Combat system is exquisite. There are many beautiful things I can say about this game, such as:\n-Very big community\n-Very nice community\n-Amazing power ups that you can use to your advantage\n-Memorable characters\n-Astonoshing graphics\n-Great variety of maps\n-Amazing gameplay mechanics\n\nThe game is very difficult, probably even more difficult than Garfield Kart, but you will get better with practice. It is amazing with friends, so you should convince others to get it as well. You don't need friends to play though, for there is a big community of bots. The bots are not toxic, making for a great community. I did have some difficulties, for you have to change mouse settings in the options in order to look around, other wise arrow keys are perfectly fine (I don't prefer them). The character models have great personality, with voicelines such as, \"AAAAAAAAAH.\" That's it, but that voice line means a lot to me. The map is very bright and colorful, but not to the point where it is overwhelming. There are bumpers that you can ricochet your discs off of, which gives this game its name. I almost forgot to mention the discs, the main weapon in this game, which you use to bump your friends off the map, granting you a point. There are very little cons. Actually, there is only one con, and that con is there is no ricochet 2 yet. Everyone asks valve for half-life 3, even though this amazing concept of a game deserves a sequel. I wish valve gave this game another chance, for it is full of life. My friend and I have a clan in this game, called {KROCK}, which everyone should join, because we know this game will be an e-sport in a couple of years, so we need to make a team with very experienced players. Ricochet is a beauty of a game. It makes me want to sing Einen Jodler hor ich gern by Takeo Ischi (created originally by Franzl Lang).
