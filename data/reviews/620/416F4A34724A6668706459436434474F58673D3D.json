[/h1]\n\nPortal 2 es uno de los juegos más completos que puedan existir. Ofrece una historia interesante, narrada adecuadamente, con sus matices, y que amplía el universo de Aperture Science, compartido por otro famoso juego de la empresa. A su vez presenta puzzles bastante complejos, un diseño de niveles inmejorables, una ambientación exquisita y una musicalización muy competente y de estilo definido. \n\nEn duración es lo justo, ni muy largo ni muy corto. La dificultad está bien repartida a lo largo del juego, al igual que los diferentes momentos trascendentes de la historia. Agrega a la maravillosa mecánica de portales muchísimos elementos que la enriquecerían aún más. Los geles azules, blancos, naranjas, las plataformas de luz, los lásers, los trampolines, los rayos de gravedad, etc. Se hace difícil pedirle que agregue más cosas. \n\nEl apartado artístico es algo que no se puede no mencionar. Se trata de cómo el poder del tiempo arrasó con las ambiciosas instalaciones. Como la vegetación ahora estaba surgiendo. Todo está en ruinas, sucio, destruido. Una increíble industria que lo único que queda es aquello automatizado. Ahora se cuentan leyendas, de lo acontecido en el primer Portal. Conoceremos en esta nueva aventura de Chell, a la vieja Aperture Science, a su creador, sus orígenes, sus planes, e incluso quién es GLaDOS. La iluminación mejora notablemente, haciendo muestra de las capacidades del nuevo Source. El doblaje (por lo menos en inglés) es fantástico, dándoles un toque de carisma único a todos sus personajes.\n\nPero aún hay más, Portal 2 ofrece un modo multijugador, integrado al universo y la coherencia del juego y con unos niveles muy bien pensados para resolver en pareja.\n\n[b] Definitivamente su precio vale por el juego. [/b] Son muchas las cosas que este juego ofrece: Puzzles, plataformas, acción, una historia interesante, multijugador, mecánicas originales, y una experiencia por lo menos para mí muy valiosa.","timestamp_created":1470528419,"timestamp_updated":1511414743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24750725","author":{"steamid":"76561198276752923","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":712,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":534,"last_played":1613342325},"language":"english","review":"By god, this game is such an amazing improvement over the likes of the first Portal game.

There is a multiplayer section on Portal 2 where one of you must be Atlas (person who is hosting) and the other must be P-Body (guest in the game) and you solve puzzles together whilst listening to commentary from GlaDOS.

The voice acting and dialogue in this game is amazingly entertaining and funny, I found myself chuckling multiple time during the game due to the character dialogues! The level design in this game is also great as there were some levels which left me stumped for quite awhile and it took me quite alot of brain power to solve them and that gave me a great feeling after doing so!\n\nThis game features a co-operative mode which allows players to play with people in your friend list or complete strangers through match-making. There are some form of customization options such as hats in the co-operative mode that can be unlocked through completing the game. There was supposed to be more customization options available in a shop but it has since been discontinued. Trading is also unavailable which is pretty unfortunate as it would be great for players to exchange or sell cosmetics.\n\nThere is also a level creation tool in this game which allow players to create their own Portal 2 levels and share it online with others by uploading it to the workshop! Several interesting extra content includes a portal 2 comic which serves as a prequel to the game and a super 8 (a pretty old movie by now) interactive game demo.\n\nOverall, Portal 2 is a very entertaining game with great puzzles, characters and voice acting. I would give it a 9/10! A must buy if you enjoy action puzzle games!","timestamp_created":1470156120,"timestamp_updated":1470156120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.585687398910522461","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24672680","author":{"steamid":"76561198119106137","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":115,"playtime_forever":6926,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6391,"last_played":1639786924},"language":"english","review":"portal 2","timestamp_created":1470155172,"timestamp_updated":1608657358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24672349","author":{"steamid":"76561198292164035","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":6623,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1505,"last_played":1612054154},"language":"spanish","review":"Si has jugado al Portal uno no te tengo nada que decir basicamente que te lo compres porque tiene mas fabada comprimida y un mega apreton de historia.
