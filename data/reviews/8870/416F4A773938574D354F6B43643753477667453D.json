С точки зрения FPS Bioshock Infinite очень быстро надоедает, и даже наличие огромного выбора оружия и скиллов проблему не решает. Хочется поскорее узнать продолжение сюжета, а тебе одну за другой суют одинаковые перестрелки с одинаковыми врагами, давая разнообразие разве что в локациях. Возможно, кому-то понравилось бить врагов сотней разных способов, но мне — не не совсем. Тем более, бить их было особо не за что — это не какие-то злые-злые монстры из Quake.\n\n2. Соглашусь, что сюжет очень интересный и нетривиальный, но его уровень уж точно не на \"игру века\" — подозреваю, что в 2013 году компании Irrational Games попросту первой удалось столь успешно использовать потенциал sci-fi и не дать игроку заскучать. Пройдя игру до конца, я почему-то не могу избавиться от ощущения, что меня где-то очень крупно обдурили. Концовка, которую все хвалят, при всей своей внезапности показалась слишком скомканной и не такой глубокой, как вся остальная игра — пройдя столь долгий путь, игрок был достоин получить нечто более правдоподобное, что-то, чему хотелось бы верить. Вместо этого нам довольно коротко рассказывают в чём была соль и выкидывают в главное меню. Разработчики не использовали потенциал до конца — гораздо большего эффекта можно было бы достичь не просто \"вылив на игрока ведро воды\", а дав ему чуть больший комментарий. \n\n3. Тематика игры помогает прятать сюжетные дыры и по большей части лишает смысла выборы игрока. Когда выборы моральные, это особенно неприятно.\n\nЕсли говорить в целом, то игра очень продуманная и детализированная. Удовольствие от процесса игры, от манеры повествования сюжета получить можно, от концовки — другой вопрос.\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1554483505,"timestamp_updated":1554496026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49971383","author":{"steamid":"76561198377098465","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":557,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":557,"last_played":1554323908},"language":"turkish","review":"Bu oyuna diyecek çok sözüm yok.

Plentiful supplies detract somewhat from the survival/horror feel of Bioshock 1 and 2, although this makes it feel more viable to experiment and have some fun with Vigors. I feel like the horror aspect is still there, just delivered in a different sort of way to a traditional horror game - the core of the story feels very real (despite the outlandish fantasy/sci-fi aspects) and is most definitely horrifying.\n\nThe attention to detail with Elizabeth really impressed me - the way she interacts with the environment, the quality of the voice acting, and her actual usefulness. Most followers/companions in games just get in the way or inconvenience you, or at best are a disposable distraction for enemies - Elizabeth actually felt like part of the journey.\n\nThe easter eggs were also some of the most satisfying things in the game, particularly the music based ones. Collectible audio logs make a return to provide further background information and insight into the characters and lore of the game.\n\nThe Burial at Sea Episode 1 and 2 DLCs are fairly short but provide a more traditional Bioshock experience and a stealth experience respectively. Solid additions to the game, with an interesting plot. Clash in the clouds provides a wave based survival - it was quite fun and challenging although for completionists 'blue ribbon challenges' can be kind of obnoxious.","timestamp_created":1554463008,"timestamp_updated":1554463008,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525691688060760498","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49964591","author":{"steamid":"76561198276298135","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":711,"last_played":1550685475},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game, nice addition to the Bioshock collection.\nThe story is really good, characters are charming and well written.\nReally recommend getting this game\n10/10","timestamp_created":1554454916,"timestamp_updated":1554454916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49964499","author":{"steamid":"76561198866088098","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1075,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1075,"last_played":1554453811},"language":"english","review":"I just replayed this game a few years after my first play through and still adore it just as much.

I felt the need to voice my criticism after reading the uniformly positive reviews (other than people mad about Epic Games). I keep seeing people talk about how “deep” the game is and how it made you emotional, but by the half hour cutscene at the end of the game, I was laughing at how corny the dialogue was.\n\nI’m just going to point out a few of the more obvious problems with the narrative.\n\n-The player is presented with meaningless choices which have no impact on the story beyond a half second of a cutscene.\n\n-The use of “tears” in the mid to late game as a method of retconning and getting the story out of holes is arbitrary and unearned. Whenever things seem tense, suddenly a deus ex machina appears to make everything you just did meaningless and change the motivation of characters to whatever fits the situation.\n\n-The plot twists in this game are all either completely arbitrary or completely obvious.\n\n-Why does a society that stones an interracial couple at the beginning of the game allow a white woman to marry an asian man? And why does said white woman still follow the explicitly white supremacist cult? How could one gunsmith make enough guns to supply the vox populi with, not only rifles and submachine guns, but huge robot soldiers, zeppelins, and flying shuttles with rocket launchers? Why was a gunsmith with sympathies for the rebels allowed to operate until the exact moment the protagonist shows up, and why would an apartheid society allow a non white person to have, let alone manufacture, guns?\n\n-The politics of this game are infuriatingly bad. Daisy Fitzgerald, enemy of the state and leader of the vox populi is portrayed in propaganda from Columbia as a psychopath who wishes for nothing but destruction, then you meet her, and it turns out they were right, at least in the game’s opinion.\n\t\nThis “twist” comes when she kills the industrialist Fink, who the game has just been telling us is bad for the entire preceding act. He is a slumlord, a white supremacist, and basically a slave owner. Then he eats a bullet and my reaction is supposed to be “oh, i guess daisy is actually bad”. This after I just spent the last 20 minutes killing dozens of henchmen. The only remotely unjustified thing the vox populi or Daisy Fitzgerald do is try to kill a kid who I guess is Fink’s son. The game turns on a dime and soldiers I was just fighting alongside are now shooting at me.\n\nWhat message am I supposed to take away from this? Oppressed people shouldn’t fight back or they’re just as bad as the people oppressing them?\n\nI guess this the kind of deep political insight we should expect from the videogame industry, but it would’ve been cool if there was some way to make some kind of meaningful choice.\nThe ending of the game really feels like they just ran out of ideas and started shoving a bunch of random shit in, hoping people would think it was deep just because it was convoluted and people talk weirdly.\n\n-Why in god’s name are the iron sight are on the Z key?","timestamp_created":1554434628,"timestamp_updated":1554434798,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517967462539672852","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49950630","author":{"steamid":"76561198009848628","num_games_owned":372,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":324,"last_played":1530428664},"language":"english","review":"2K sucks","timestamp_created":1554391856,"timestamp_updated":1554391856,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.448548823595046997","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49949328","author":{"steamid":"76561197989387890","num_games_owned":356,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2118,"last_played":1393910334},"language":"english","review":"It's a good game.

Infinite is the third Bioshock game in the series.  This game made several changes to the original games formulas, many of which were good changes but not all worked out so well.  You play as Booker DeWitt a down on his luck Private Investigator who is sent to the flying city of Columbia by a mysterious benefactor to accomplish one goal, “Bring us the girl, and Wipe away the debt.”\n\nThe controls and combat are tight and fluent.  The world is very open and has several different ways of approaching combat such as laying traps with your vigors (plasmids in Bioshock), using the environment to attack your enemies, or using a variety of weapons.  However now you can only carry two weapons at a time which is annoying since the older games let you carry more, but you have access to all your vigors.  The story is on par with the original Bioshock and full of different characters that each have their own stories to tell.\n\nThe Burial at Sea DLC is also fantastic.  Burial at Sea takes place in the City of Rapture and ties into the main story very well.  It mixes items and characters from the two games in a way that works really well and doesn’t feel forced.  There’s also the Clash in the Clouds DLC which is where you face off against waves of different enemies.  It’s not the most fun DLC pack but there’s still fun to be had in it.\n","timestamp_created":1554087974,"timestamp_updated":1554087974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49886140","author":{"steamid":"76561198045393413","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1735,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1735,"last_played":1544993307},"language":"english","review":"This game was my introduction to shooters and big budget games.

[/h1]\nНачнем с того, что я проходил эту превосходную игру не один раз, и все что касается технической стороны здесь выполнено на высшем уровне. [b] Графика [/b] даже в 2019 году смотрится прекрасно, стиль, выбранный разработчиками безумно красивый, Колумбию не хочется покидать, настолько эта игра красива. [b] Механика стрельбы [/b] выполнена очень качественно, каждое оружие ощущается по-своему и чувствуется очень хорошо. На легком и среднем уровнях сложности вы можете пройти игру практически не применяя энергетиков, и должен сказать, при таком подходе вы рискуете потерять львиную долю удовольствия. Что касается сложного и секретного уровней сложности, то вы будете применять все что видите, чтобы не умереть от первого попавшегося механика. [b] Саундтрек [/b] достаточно атмосферный и приятный, хотя я все равно предпочитаю играть со своим плейлистом, наслаждаюсь игровым саундтреком я разве что в Ведьмаке и Скайриме.\n[b] Сюжет. [/b] Это самое главное во всей франшизе BioShock. Эта серия игр рассказывает нам законченную историю, которая не оставляет никого равнодушным. Неоднократные сюжетные повороты не дадут заскучать, диалоги прописаны на уровне, слушать их одно удовольствие. Кстати о локализации. Я крайне рекомендую скачать русификатор от CGInfo, который сделал команда любителей, однако это одна из лучших локализаций которые я встречал в своей жизни, переведены все надписи в игре, что значительно повышает уровень погружения. Озвучка просто бесподобная, актеры отыграли своих персонажей очень близко к оригиналу, в особенности Анна Молева в роли Элизабет. Кстати о ней. Никогда еще я так не привязывался к игровому персонажу, за которого я даже не играю! Разработчики очень грамотно интегрировали её в геймплей, BioShock Infinite во многом обязан своей атмосферой именно Элизабет. [spoiler] В тот момент, когда Комсток наконец ловит Элизабет и начинает мучать ее, вопли нашей спутницы вывели меня из себя, я не мог слушать ее крики, мне хотелось как можно скорее её спасти. Именно в тот момент я встретил единственный баг за все время, проведенное мной в игре, и я просто физически не мог пройти дальше, а сердце продолжали разрывать ее истошные вопли. [/spoiler] Настолько сильное погружение я испытывал лишь в Биошоке и в Ведьмаке 3. Когда игра завершилась, мне не хотелось ни в коем случае расставаться с персонажами, с Колумбией. Здесь на помощь несомненно пришли два ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНЫХ для покупки сюжетных DLC: Burial at Sea: Episode 1 и Episode 2. Завершая эти дополнения, я уже стал чувствовать завершенность истории, и тогда я уже смог отпустить персонажей, и продолжать жить и играть в другие игры спокойно.\n[h1] Итог: [/h1]\nЕсли вы еще по какой-либо причине не прошли это чудо, немедленно покупайте и погружайтесь в эту превосходную антиутопию. Если вы не играли в предыдущие части BioShock, то не переживайте, если вы пройдете сначала Infinite будет только лучше. После основной игры пройдите BioShock 1, а после него пройдите Burial at Sea. BioShock 2 хоть и является ни чуть ни менее прекрасной игрой, к основной истории которую повествует эта «игро-книга» не имеет никакого отношения. И пока весь мир боготворит Кодзиму, я боготворю Кена Левина.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1554055476,"timestamp_updated":1554055476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49877719","author":{"steamid":"76561198820996471","num_games_owned":312,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1386,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1591809801},"language":"schinese","review":"充满质感","timestamp_created":1554048588,"timestamp_updated":1554048588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49874376","author":{"steamid":"76561198120840346","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1419,"last_played":1561788068},"language":"schinese","review":"要啥自行车，去巴黎就完事了。","timestamp_created":1554038419,"timestamp_updated":1554038419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49873233","author":{"steamid":"76561198171530723","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":110,"last_played":1486824599},"language":"schinese","review":"别看了，买罢，不亏，单推伊丽莎白，懂？","timestamp_created":1554034607,"timestamp_updated":1554034607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49872207","author":{"steamid":"76561198262677125","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":167,"playtime_forever":920,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":83,"last_played":1558727532},"language":"italian","review":"Vorrei fare i complimenti a chi ha programmato il gioco....
