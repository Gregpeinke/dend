It perfectly combines pulse-pounding combat with challenging puzzle solving, and was a milestone in making video games more realistic and immersive. Instead of using cutscenes to push the story along, Half-Life uses scripted sequences that happen right before your eyes, and by the conversations you hear around you. If a person(scientist, guard, etc.) is in danger, you can decide to save him or not, although he might come in handy later! Though the story mode is long, it's one of those games that when you complete it, you'll put it away for a few months. However, included is a multiplayer deathmatch mode, and it's a blast to play with friends! No doubt about it, Half-Life is a must-buy, and is a game that everyone should play at least once.","timestamp_created":1391554587,"timestamp_updated":1391554587,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8975015","author":{"steamid":"76561197995175490","num_games_owned":516,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":2288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":876,"last_played":1633066565},"language":"english","review":"This game is one of the best games of all time","timestamp_created":1391535095,"timestamp_updated":1391535095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8972327","author":{"steamid":"76561198053311374","num_games_owned":711,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":144,"last_played":1392827438},"language":"russian","review":"15 лет назад  вышла первая часть Half-Life.

Поясню: это я для пафоса сказал.\nДанная игра не заслуживает звания \"культовой\". Мало того, если она и имеет право существовать, то только с одной целью: чтобы люди знали, какими НЕ должны быть игры. Своего рода антипример.\nЭто моё мнение. Вы считаете иначе - ваше право. Говорить мне, что я \"Не уважаю вашего мнения\" - значит, не уважать мнения моего. А оно, товарищи, не менее ценно, чем ваше. У вас есть право на ваше мнение, а у меня есть право на своё. Мало того, у меня есть право вашего мнения не уважать (как и у вас, впрочем), и принуждать к обратному меня не в праве даже сам Создатель Бога. Большинство, между прочим, тоже моё мнение уважать наотрез откажется.\nТем более, я могу своё мнение аргументировать.\n1. Игра не учит ничему хорошему. Как говорится, ни уму, ни сердцу. Она глупа, бессмысленна, и потому служит не к развитию человека, а лишь к отуплению. Это сущая пустышка. В ней нет содержания. Никакого. Никакой мысли, идеи.\n2. Сюжет - полная чушь. Что там? Пришельцы? Какой-то эксперимент? Что это? К чему? Зачем? Какой-то бред. Делирий человека, решившего закосить под научную фантастику, и оплошавшего по всем пунктам. Ничего светлого, ничего доброго. А зачем это надо тогда? Ради бессмысленного \"ЭкшОна\"? Ну, примитивны же вкусы того, кому одного этого \"экшОна\" хватает для удовлетворения своих эстетических потребностей.\n3. Отвратительные враги. Особенно те, что свисают с потолка. Когда я увидел это, меня чуть не стошнило. В прямом смысле! Меня перекосило настолько, что я ощущал уголок своего рта у себя на темячке. А этот звук, когда толкаешь тележку, и происходит авария! Хуже, чем если поскрести пенопластом по стеклу!\n4. Сам геймплей выбешивает. Чувствительность мыши почти не настроить, ничего не понятно, всё кое-как. Я навсегда запомю ту дверь, которая заклинила и в которую пришлось ломиться. Впрочем, может, дело в моём компьютере. Всё же игра не для семёрки делалась.\n5. Про поездку в этом... кхем... ужасном вагончике, я думаю, не надо и рассказывать.\n6. Г-н Ньюэлл сам говорил, без стыда и смущения, что игры этой серии разрабатывались ради прибыли и только. И именно по этому тянут с 3-ейчастью: не выгодно, видите ли. А разве можно делать игры так? Думаю, нет. Игра - это тоже искусство, а не обувь и не молоко можайское, 3.5% А искусство и коммерческий подход несовместимы. Зарабатывать играми можно и нужно, но не это, я считаю, нужно ставить на первое место.\nРезюме: игра бездушна, как и вся эта наштампованная серия. Valve можно похвалить за Portal, за Steam, в конце концов. Но точно не за Халф-Лайф. В общем, спасибо, Гейб, за Стим, а за Халфу тебе кол с минусом. Играл я через силу, и, в прямом смысле слова, чуть не довёл себя до нервного срыва. Было чувство, точно меня пытаются накормить личинками сколопендры.\nЧто скажете? \"Лол\"? \"*Фейспалм*\"? Ну, конечно. Умные люди либо согласятся, либо промолчат, оставшись несогласными. А у дураков на большее, чем подобные идиотские фразы, мозгов не хватит. Над этим я лишь от души посмеюсь.\nЯ никому ничего не навязываю. Хотите - играйте. Хотите - восхищайтесь (Хоть я свято убеждён, что восхищаться там нечем). Но я в ЭТО играть не рекомендую. Согласиться или нет - ваше дело и ваше право.","timestamp_created":1391032695,"timestamp_updated":1391383352,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":97,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.287240207195281982","comment_count":97,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8901678","author":{"steamid":"76561198066239721","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":884,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":878,"last_played":1564174234},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game, I like it better than first halo and this game was made before it!","timestamp_created":1391016305,"timestamp_updated":1391413596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8898394","author":{"steamid":"76561197982863674","num_games_owned":449,"num_reviews":232,"playtime_forever":544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1658017147},"language":"english","review":"The best in the series imo, and a really great classic.","timestamp_created":1390992342,"timestamp_updated":1554114310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8895201","author":{"steamid":"76561198049011529","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":792,"last_played":1433206305},"language":"english","review":"Can't wait for HL2 to come out!","timestamp_created":1390959653,"timestamp_updated":1436563637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8892206","author":{"steamid":"76561198084114354","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":534,"last_played":1433436080},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life is a game for which so much can be said but so little need be spoken.

The player is faced with challenging puzzles, tense shootouts and a real test of platforming skills in a brilliant if not somewhat repetitive environment.

life.The game that started it all.Even though it was made back in 1998,it is still a gem.I don't vote games by their graphics,but by their gameplay.This was an immersing,wonderful and addicting experience for me.I lived another life.In this game.The game has everything a gamer asks for: Immersing Gameplay,Indulging story,A Nice Selection of Weapons,and graphics that were thrilling in the year it was made,but are all old now.Even now this title holds up till today,shining its glory as the first game that Valve ever made,and a game that changed Gaming itself.Now I will have a look at the main aspects of a good game.\n\nWARNING: A little bit of spoiling ahead.\n\nGameplay: Excellent.Either you are blasting monsters from an alternate dimension or just trying to pick off those squad men who just don't seem to put you in peace.There were a few places where it did get a little bit boring,but that was because I couldn't wait until I would experience something new.The terrain in the game is nicely made,even though it is pretty old due to the date it was made.The places you travel through are pretty different,you won't be bored of seeing the same old place over and over again.The game itself is nicely balanced;except that they could have put less ammo in the game,so you wouldn't always have a gun loaded. 9/10\n\nStory: A nice story is told throughout the game,and that is guaranteed to keep you hooked until the last moment of the game.Even though it doesn't have any cutscenes,it tells its story just wonderfully.It keeps you in first person mode all of the time,so it makes you \"live\" the character all the way through the story.All the stuff that is happening in the game seems kind of logical,as if could happen in real life.The characters are well done as well,for they act as normal people would act.They are as they should be,they speak,fight,help you and do other stuff.And there is a wierdly acting character which stands out in the game;but I will let you figure that out for yourself.There aren't the same scientists all over and over again,but we can't say this with security guards.The enemies are widely assorted and won't make you think that they are dumb,but play as they are real and trying to get you.No dull moment will get you in this game,so don't be afraid of experiencing any in this game.  10/10\n\nWeapons: There is a wide assort of weapons to fit you in this game,but do not expect too much.There are the main weapons you would except from a game like this,and maybe a little bit more due to an \"Monster Invasion\" going on all around you.The game has its own signature weapon: A Crowbar.But that is also the only melee weapon that you can use in this game.While you progress through the game you will find weapons,but there aren't many,so every weapon you get,you make use of,because all of them are unique.As I won't spoil much here,I will just tell you that there are weapons from the pistol even to such weapons like a rocket launcher,and a few of alien techologies are found in the game as well.You will find yourself exploring all around you to get some ammo for your favourite weapon,because it gives you tons of ammo for a wide selection of weapons,and the ammo that you need may not be findable anywhere.When you shoot a gun it feels like you shoot a gun,meaning that you will find the gun bouncing back in your hand when you shoot it,and you can hear the sound for gun firing is well done as well.But when shooting a rocket launcher you will not bounce back,but if you move while shooting it the rocket will go wrong and hit another spot,depending on which way you moved.Even if you don't have any ammo,you get to use a alien techonlogy which has unlimited ammo.Even though it recharges over time,it doesn't take much of it and it has special abilities.  8.5/10\n\nEnemies: From the headcrab even to the final boss,the enemies are nicely balanced.You are slowly introduced to each enemy and its tactics,so you know what to use on it and what to do.You probably won't find yourself facing a unnormally big army of enemies if you aren't well armed.Once you learn the tactics the enemies use it is easy to defeat them,just keep a look out for them,or otherwise you might find yourself in quite a pickle.I wouldn't say that the enemies are hard.You can use the terrain to your advantage as well.Luckily,one group of your enemies is fighting another,so you can use that to your advantage as well,if you find the right moment.*wink*.But I wouldn't rely on such stuff,I would just get myself a nice arsenal of weapons and go defeat that crowd of motherfuckers.There are a few weapons which have unlimited ammo,and I feel that is unbalanced.Don't go prancing around as a pony as well,you will get your ass kicked.There are flying enemies,crawling enemies,walking enemies and big enemies.The crawling ones are easy,just keep a look out for them so they don't get the jump on you.The Flying ones need the right weapons,like a zoom in crossbow,for they fly around and shoot at you and when you get close to them they just fly away.The walking ones are easy enough,just keep a shotgun on your hand and you will be OK.But the big ones need a plan,a strategy and a assault of weapons. 9.5/10\n\nGraphics: From Black Mesa labs to even Alien fields of doom,this game is amazing.It now has its own HD models,so a few things look better when the models are turned \"ON\".Any computer will be able to get this game running,so why not jump in it already?And as this game was made in 1998,don't expect modern graphics.But that couldn't stop you from playing this game,could it?The terrain is kind of blocky and the characters as well,but if you look past that point get ready to indulge into a game that made gaming as it is today.And the graphics aren't that bad,everything is quite understandable.They have made the graphics the best way they could,and I don't blame them because I don't vote a game by its graphics.And if you can't stand the graphics there is a Source version of the game,made by Valve as well.There is a version made by fans as well,but I wouldn't recommend that because it is modified a bit.But the original is the best in my opinion as it is the completly unmodified version of half life,and the best out there.Of course,that is if you look past the graphics.There are even little details specified in the originl game,but they won't be seen so good and will be kind of blurred.But be sure to keep your eyes lit,for there are many levers,buttons and things like that throughout the game,that blend in with the enviroment. 8.5/10\n\nOverall look: Even though this game is dated,it is definently not dead.Be sure to pick this game up on a sale,or even buy it at its full price,because this game is worth every cent you pay for it.I loved the game,it really got me pulled in and the story was just stunning.I loved every place I came upon to in this game,seeking new adventure and traveling on into the deep unknown.This game is filled with interesting moments and is guaranteed to keep you aroused until the very ending.This is a great classic and everyone should play it,it is an experience not to be missed.It changed gaming as it is now,and was a hit in gaming and it still is.A wonderful game.

For being such an old game it is very good! It took a very long time to get through the whole game and the story was quite extensive and very interesting! I played this game simply because I  love the Portal series so very much! Since Portal and Half-Life are linked together I figured I would get more of an explanation as to how the two game link and while portal was never hinted to, for obvious reasons (it didn't come out for another 7 or so years, duh!), I could see how the stories linked on the simple basis of the apocolypse. I'm excited to find out the rest of the story in Half life 2!\n    The controls are useful and it is very nice that you can save at any point rather than just key points, this is an extremely helpful feature, especially for the ever frustrating jump climb! :P The gameplay is fun and flows pretty smoothly. I have no big problems with the run/jump style. The Story was phenomenol and I really enjoyed it! They put a lot of work and effort into building a great story line.\n     The Dialogue is pretty good. You never hear Gordon speak, only scientists, guards, etc. which at times is quite comical. The Level Design is also phenominal. They did a lot of work on putting out as many unique levels as possible and they did a great job. The AI is not too much of a problem and I think it was quite advanced for its time. The enemy wont shoot at you if they cant see you which is actually quite nice. They sometimes get into a more strategic formation to face me which is also good work. \n     The World Design, along with the level design, is phenomenol. The story is linear, but with good cause. It is a story, not an RPG choice adventure. VALVe tells the story via game and I really like it! The Graphics are absolutely lesser than now, but I love it! The nostalgia is great! I really appreciate the old game made available for current PCs because a lot of the modern games can only be supported by super computers and its really nice to be able to play a quality game on a netbook, crappy PC, etc. Finally, the sound goes along with the nostalgia and I love the 8-bit sound effects and voices and music. The music is few and far between, but that just makes it all the more appreciated. \n     This is definitely one of the video games you need to play. Please support this amazing company, they created Steam and many wonderful games, like Portal and Half Life. Buy this game!\n\nThe Review outline style was taken from Game Developers Tycoon. Please also consider that game for it is great! :D\n","timestamp_created":1390097017,"timestamp_updated":1390097017,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8759627","author":{"steamid":"76561198103490293","num_games_owned":239,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1520290151},"language":"english","review":"I will admit for a 1998 game it's actually not that bad I still prefer Half-life 2 but there are still some glitches in the game I give it a 7/10","timestamp_created":1390081063,"timestamp_updated":1390081063,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8759594","author":{"steamid":"76561198012764995","num_games_owned":376,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":8,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1586407118},"language":"english","review":"WOW HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET OVER THIS WAIST HIGH OBSTACLE?

And finally the time has come to remedy that problem. Even though HL already celebrated its 15th birthday, it still is a fresh experience. I'm not a big fan of most FPS, mainly because they rarely give a unique experience, not even with the great graphics of these days. They often lack story, likeable characters or special atmosphere, and consist solely of shooting everything.\nIn some respect, HL also suffers from these problems, the story itself isn't really elaborated (though much more is hinted at) or unique and there is little character development (I quite like Gordon, however :). But as for the atmosphere: HL is somehow very charming. The layout of Black Mesa facility is quite silly sometimes, but it's really enjoyable to roam it's endless corridors. I also like most of the enemies, and alternating alien and human foes gives much variety to gameplay. Scripted events are great, as well and the pacing is just excellent (especially in the first half).\nThe \"jumping puzzle\" parts of the game are not common in contemporary titles, but had been present in the past and, to be honest, fighting off enemies while standing on flying platforms and hopping from one to the other is quite exciting. The use of space and room in the game is usually clever, you have to concentrate quite hard not to  fall off the edge of a small floating island while shooting and finding an adequate hiding spot is vital in many situations. Some issues arise from this however, firing from behind shelter, using the alien gun with the enemy-seeker darts for example, makes some foes easier to kill than probably intended by the creators. The physics of the game has its own problems as well.......\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game, I think it lives up to its fame, even today!\nAnd now, it's time to install Half-Life 2... :)","timestamp_created":1389874388,"timestamp_updated":1390123551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8725875","author":{"steamid":"76561198020266376","num_games_owned":1330,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":851,"last_played":1389861332},"language":"english","review":"A timeless FPS.
