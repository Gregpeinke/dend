Everything you know or, at least think you knew about the world we're living at, is all lies. In each of the games you start as a \"normal\" character, with a casual personality, that during the game change and become a new character with a different personality. The game is about mental games with your brain. You gain new  powers and new abilities the more you're progressing in the game. In each game, the story change alot on each move you make. The whole idea of BioShock game series is really cool in my opinon and so are the action scenes in it and the story of each game. I highly recommend on playing the game, but from the first to the last, one at a time to understand better the story of the games.

Elizabeth is the best ally in video game history. The vigor powers are fun as ever.\n\nThe story is quite good, but it broke my brain as I tried to fully understand it. I actually had to check on the wiki after I beat the game just so that I could understand it a bit better, and even now I'm not so sure. Not going to spoil anything, but let's just say it's pretty mind blowing.\n\nThe amount of action is also really good. It's realistic for the setting and not too over the top, but there are some pretty intense moments.

Dieses Spiel ist unfassbar Klasse. Die Story ist echt sehr interessant, aber auch meiner Meinung nach, ein wenig verwirrend. xD Das heißt aber nicht, dass ich sie schlecht fande, im Gegenteil, die Story war echt fantastisch und fesselnd. Die Waffen haben mir auch gut gefallen, aber von den Effekten (Plasmiden?) her, nur wenige. Es waren dafür aber auch viele neue dabei. Aber das ist ja Geschmackssache. Die Grafik ist super schön. Einfach atemberaubend. Große Klasse! Man hat beim Spielen dann auch so die Momente, ich jedenfalls, wo man es einfach nur genießen möchte. Das man fast die ganze Zeit eine Person bei sich dabei hat, finde ich ultra cool. Vom Shooter her hats mir auch sehr gut gefallen. Einfach ein mega hammer Spiel und meiner Meinung nach, der beste Bioshock-Teil. Es war auch nicht direkt wie Bioshock 1&2. Man konnte manchmal garnicht mehr aufhören zu spielen, weil es ein so mitgezogen hat. Mir hat es wirklich sehr gefallen, aber ich fande die automatischen Speicherpunkte nicht so toll. Ich hätte lieber nach meiner Entscheidung speichern wollen, aber gut, ist auch kein wirklicher Kritikpunkt. Man gewöhnt sich daran. Ich kann es Leuten empfehlen, die einen Erkundungsdrang haben und auf der Suche nach einer aufregenden Story sind. Natürlich die auch die Shooter Games mögen.

Par où commencer:\n\n\n- le scénario: c'est LA raison pour laquelle j'ai pris le jeu. Et pourtant, j'en ai vu du gameplay dessus, mais franchement entre y jouer et le voir, y a une sacrée différence. Si certains préférent les Bioshock précédents, Infinite demeure un très très bon cru, avec certes des détails qui peuvent nous faire chipotter pour tel ou tel truc, mais franchement le jeu à quand même l'ambition de nous sortir une histoire complexe et poussée. De plus, les DLC sont excellents eux aussi.\n\n- les graphismes sont très bons, et on peut facilement les monter sans avoir besoin d'une machine de compétition. Sur ce point, rien à dire, c'est bon.\n\n- la bande son est excellente et nous immerge dans un univers à l'ambiance US des années 1900 et des brouettes.\n\n- le gameplay: alors bon, comme dans tout jeu, il y a forcement un élément qui fait office de vilain petit canard... eeeeet en effet, si le scénario est excellent, le gameplay ne va pas plus loin que devant le pas de la porte des FPS. Pourtant, on se retrouve dès le début confronté à une \"énigme\" (oui, entre guillemets). Et ensuite, bah... FPS FPS FPS FPS. Les pouvoirs semblent se répétés (stun, contrôle, stun, attaque, stun...). Une fois que l'on a compris plus ou moins les mécaniques de jeu, on avance facilement: suffit de maxer une arme (voir 2) et idem pour les pouvoirs (ou je n'ai jouer qu'avec un contrôle et un stun, pour dire).\n\n\nAlors, que dire de Bioshock Infinite? C'est très simple: si le gameplay n'est pas passionnant, l'ambiance et le scénario font bien plus que de rattraper ce manque, ça l'explose! J'ai adoré l'histoire (fin du jeu+ personnages principaux+DLC qui fout des claques). Mon seul et unique regret est un gameplay trop poussé sur le côté FPS, un côté énigme/réfléxion aurait été le bienvenu. Enfin, je vous le conseille vivement.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                 ... quoi, comment ça, je suis trop subjectif?","timestamp_created":1420139390,"timestamp_updated":1420139390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13765411","author":{"steamid":"76561198146621591","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":855,"last_played":1588784427},"language":"english","review":"Playing this again but this time on the pc made me remember how much I love this game.

But it is a very mediocre game gameplay wise and also as a sequel. It is VERY simplified. It is just a linear passage with a few rooms branching off that always leads to a dead end just so you can get another piece of gear that you will never use or some money. In the other Bioshock games there were so many branching paths, all connected to each others and rarely had something to stop you (for example, needing Incenerate! to melt some ice) so you could go anywhere you wanted to go. But in Bioshock Infinite its just arena after arena with hit scan bullet sponges with almost no variety. Just tear open Medkits, hide behind them and spam Devil's Kiss and Hand cannon till all enemies are dead.\n\nThe Enemies:\nThere is almost no variety in the game. Vox and Comstock troops are barely different, just the clothing. Their AI is: go out, spam shots, hide in cover again while still shooting. Only 2 enemies use Vigors, the crow people and the firemen and unlike the other enemies  they have good AI but inside they are just bigger bullet sponges. The Handymen? The so called replacements for Big Daddy? Get ready for him because you will see them like 3 times in the whole game and all they do is spam attacks on top of you until they die. Boys of Silence appear 4 times in ONE section of the game, while also being able to avoid them.  Motorized Patriots have a good design and are a bit fun to battle. The other machines are just turrets and a nice helicopter styled machine called Mosquito, and saddly you can't hack any of them. Songbird, the epic giant enemy that pressures you through the whole game? *SPOILERS* You don't fight him.\n\nMechanics:\nLet's start by the obvious. The guns haven't improved and are now even worse. You can only hold up to 2 guns and there is now way to upgrade that. You have to switch your current weapons with others on the ground and maybe you wont even see your old weapon again in 3 areas. It's a horrible idea. Just find 2 guns that you have upgraded and that you \"enjoy\" using and only use them for the rest of the game. The upgrades to the weapons are even worse. Bland and boring \"+25% damage\" \"-30% recoil\" \"+20% spread\", at least in the other Bioshock games there was always one unique upgrade for a weapon, like the Tesla upgrade for the shotgun.The melee weapon however is pretty awesome since it allows you to execute low healthed enemies and lets you ride skyrails.\n\nGear. Worse version than tonics because of 2 main reasons: Only a maximum of 4 gear pieces at a time and 2 gear pieces you want to use might want to use can be on the same category, so you can only use 1. In the other Bioshocks you could have more than 15 tonics at the same time and it could even be of the same type! aka you could have Hacker's Delight and Hacker's Delight+ for a stacking bonus.\nTalking about hacking it's gone. Replaced by Possession Vigor that uses all your Salt in seconds and it's only temporary. Great idea.\n\nElizabeth can sometimes throw you money, health, ammo or salts but it's usually in the middle of battle so enemies can just get up and shoot at you right after you grab the item. It's a nice feature but not great. She also seems to make this stuff out of thin air. She also allows you to open tears.\nTears. They could have done so much with them, but instead it's just \"Hold F to summon ______!\". No clever traps or making cool stuff like a giant hole in the ground so enemies fall in it. It's just either cover, a turret for you or some items.\n\nThe removal of Medkits and EVE Hypos (in this game it would probably be called Salt Drinks or something like that) changes the game drastically. You now always have to be behind cover and you rely on finding food and health kits. It is good and bad because it now is not very unique and it also makes you have to always go wandering around for containers in the middle of battle, however food is actually useful now and it isn't cheap beating bosses by simply buying 5 medkits and going 1v1 on him. Still in Infinite you can just get revived and all you lose is some money, so you can cheese bosses that way if you want. This also brings another point, the shield system is just overused and unoriginal since it doesn't do anything special than protecting your precious health.\n\nSkyrails are really fun, especially striking down on your enemies from the skies but all they are used for is to circle around a big arena. They are also quite rare, usually used for moving on from an area to another place.\n\nLast mechanic that im going to talk about is the removal of Adam and Power to the people. Adam, if you didn't know, was a way to upgrade yourself and get new Plasmids in a vending machine. It was hard to get since you had to Rescue/Harvest Little Sisters aka kill Big Daddies. Now since we are in Columbia we don't have Adam so to upgrade and buy some vigors we have to buy them with our money. Boring. And the worse is that it costs so much damn money you can't even get the half of those upgrades in a playthrough. To upgrade yourself (more health, salt or shield capacity) you need to find these weird potion things that slightly upgrade one of those at your choosing. Most of them are in those little rooms in branching paths so you better explore.\nNow, the removal of Power to the People makes a new vending machine appear. It SELLS the upgrades, making money even a bigger problem and even more impossible of getting all the vigor upgrades and most of the weapon upgrades. But hey if you spend 3 hours farming Return to Hall of Heroes you might be able to get them all.\n\nPlasmids I mean Vigors:\nNot much to talk about. Most of them are from the older games with the addition of putting traps on the ground with also slight changes (Devil's Kiss is Incenerate! but with the option to put a trap on the ground and now you have to throw the bomb instead of it being an instant fire-y explosion on the area you want). Others are a mix of old ones with new things (Undertow is similiar to Telekinesis with alot of changes and the option to throw enemies that are alive and to stun them) and others are original. You also can switch them anytime you want by holding Q, which is quite nice but you can only hold up to 2 at a time. Why change the name even though Rapture and Columbia are just a submarine ride and a magic jet elevator ride away? Who knows.\n\nLast one, the Story:(If you didn't guess, spoilers)\nIt can go from explaining the city flies with Quantum Physics  (proven to actually be possible) to shooting a GHOST with BULLETS. But now seriously the overall story is great but the ending is just really bad, trying to fuse the whole story together with the magic tearing and a million universes and ends up with Elizabeth drowning you because in another universe you are Comstock. Well there are so many multiple universes that anything can happen, for example Elizabeth being female Hitler or Booker being a god, but Elizabeth still decides to drown you for some reason. It's like fixing a great book that is cut in the middle with a bunch of duct tape. The loss of multiple endings also annoys me. You can do anything you want and you still get a normal ending. For example, in Shantytown there were a bunch of poor people beating a vending machine for money so they could buy food and I could tear open a giant crate filled with bags of food a few meters away from there. I instead exploded those 6 poor guys with my RPG. Elizabeth didn't even say anything.\n\ntl;dr: Behind Bioshock Infinite's beautiful graphics its just a mediocre shooter with the name Bioshock on it's title. Simplified to the max with everything downgraded, it's just not worth 30 euros.
