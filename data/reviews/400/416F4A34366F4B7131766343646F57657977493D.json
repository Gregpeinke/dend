é com certeza o jogo de quebra cabeças mais clássico já feito!\nportal é uma experiência bem única, e embora diversos outros jogos tenham tentado copiar sua fórmula, apenas aqui temos tanto carisma, característica que faz a obra ser mais que um jogo onde o único objetivo é passar por diversas salas de teste. aqui o objetivo é entender uma história complexa em que chegamos atrasados: as instalações onde você se encontra, os enigmas, e até a vilã do jogo, tudo já estava lá antes de você chegar, e seu papel como jogador é entender o que está acontecendo. para isso é necessário ter muita atenção aos diálogos, cenários e e mecânicas. tudo conta um pedaço dessa história, sem jamais recorrer a diálogos expositivos. os enigmas a serem solucionados são um show a parte, e embora sejam bastante fáceis, tem um carisma e estética únicos. a trilha sonora também faz sua parte, mesmo não estando tão presente. graficamente o jogo não impressiona, mas esse claramente não é o objetivo. em resumo portal  é uma história incrível sendo contada da maneira mais criativa e imersiva o possível. tudo funciona muito bem, e glados, a vilã do jogo é simplesmente uma das melhores antagonistas já criadas em um  vídeo game.\na nota final é 10/10, um clássico absoluto onde basicamente tudo é planejado e executado com maestria. é um jogo indispensável, e provavelmente o melhor puzzle para se
