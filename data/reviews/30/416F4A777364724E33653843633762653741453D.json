All the original sounds and visuals are intact. Will really bring back some great memories and you'll have fun doing so. \n-Select users and servers are real gems. Some good people left playing the game are very welcoming.\n-Cheap. For $5 can't really go wrong.\n\nThe Bad\n-Online community is on life support. Few servers available and those that are are filled with 75% bots\n-The human players you do come across are crotchety old men who like to blather and complain\n-Grenades are way overpowered and you'll find yourself exploding for no reason\n-Too many servers use crappy custom maps filled with garbage addons and mods. Would be great to play more stock maps for the nostalgia.\n\nBuy this game if: You used to play Day of Defeat back in the day and are feeling nostalgic. It's a lot of fun for $5, and your rose-tinted glasses may be enough to overlook the game's faults.\n\nDon't buy this game if: You've never played it before and/or you're looking for a new experience. It won't be worth it. There are so many objectively better games out there that this game can't hold a candle to.","timestamp_created":1586226102,"timestamp_updated":1586226102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66788757","author":{"steamid":"76561198004984076","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1362,"last_played":1618365270},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bom","timestamp_created":1586222272,"timestamp_updated":1586222272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66695446","author":{"steamid":"76561198019757497","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":12764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10127,"last_played":1643211138},"language":"french","review":"Still good on 2020 :p","timestamp_created":1586113252,"timestamp_updated":1586113252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66668837","author":{"steamid":"76561198985152383","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":165,"last_played":1596355402},"language":"russian","review":"Олды поймут что это за игра\n","timestamp_created":1586089216,"timestamp_updated":1586089216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471014469861984253","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66543015","author":{"steamid":"76561198082484511","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":691,"last_played":1648145455},"language":"spanish","review":"todo","timestamp_created":1585960583,"timestamp_updated":1585960583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66529375","author":{"steamid":"76561198126235094","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37,"last_played":1630704482},"language":"english","review":"Fokking geggjaður","timestamp_created":1585945448,"timestamp_updated":1585945448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66484162","author":{"steamid":"76561198261930396","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":3387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1733,"last_played":1657918392},"language":"english","review":"no","timestamp_created":1585903161,"timestamp_updated":1585903161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66436093","author":{"steamid":"76561198001181135","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1343,"last_played":1641880730},"language":"english","review":"it's awesome. always has been. \nthat's all","timestamp_created":1585845889,"timestamp_updated":1585845889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66400443","author":{"steamid":"76561198928938759","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3913,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":850,"last_played":1634177119},"language":"english","review":"I fully recommend this game .

На каждый класс в игре есть свой набор вооружения, подобранный так, чтобы сохранять игровой баланс сторон. Классы одной игровой стороны располагают одинаковым табельным оружием (нож/лопата, пистолет/револьвер и гранаты) и различаются основным оружием, дающим название классу.\n\n [h1] Игровые режимы [/h1]\nВ игре присутствует несколько игровых режимов,а именно:\n- Завоевание - [b]Игроки противоположных команд должны захватить и удерживать флаги[/b]\n- Уничтожение цели - [b]Атакующей команде необходимо уничтожить определённые цели на карте[/b]\n- Захват цели - [b]Игра в данном режиме представляет собой вариацию Захвата флага, в которой целью является не флаг, а объект (грузовик, самолёт

These games may have helped to set them, but the double-edged sword is that they are the very basic forms of what is available to us now, therefore making them pretty much useless for anyone besides avid fans to come back and experience. Unlike single-player games of the same era, although games have evolved on that front as well, there are many factors that make those experiences unique and worth coping with outdated controls and graphics in order to witness a good or even great game in its original state. With a title such as [i]Day of Defeat[/i], your only option is to play solely multiplayer, and you have to rely on other people being active on servers you want to play on, otherwise there really is no experience left for the player to take advantage of. Since time only moves forward, eventually this game will lose all value solely based on the fact it will lose its entire base, and in turn, be mostly forgotten. This is expected of a multiplayer experience, but this game has failed to make an impact in the same way many other multiplayer games have, and those games usually have a single-player experience that tags along to give a timelessness to the game, unlike [i]Days of Defeat[/i].\n\nA main problem with this game I don't see with something such as [i]Team Fortress Classic[/i] is that I struggle to see the value of playing this game even at the time it was released. There are things about it I do appreciate and enjoy, such as the premise, style, and design, but ultimately the bad and frustrating issues outweigh the good by a baffling margin. A huge problem is the player base itself, those who have either mastered the game or figured the best way to oust fair players are the only ones really playing this game nowadays, not new players that dilute the waters to create a more balanced experience for all who wish to give this game a shot. The shooting is rather basic as well, this was released before mainstream implementation of aiming down sights, and since there are many players camouflaged and well versed in the game's strengths and weaknesses, it makes it that much harder to get into this game as a newer player. The maps here seem more simplistic and unpolished than in other games of the same time, making traversing them and attempting to best the enemy team a boring and difficult affair in the worst way possible. You'll be luckier than most if you are able to hone your skills and restrain from giving up on this relic of the past like many have before.\n\n[i]Day of Defeat[/i] is one of those very forgettable games that no one really mentions when you talk about [i]Valve[/i] and their more than impressive line-up of releases. At least with a fair amount of these sorts of titles, I can see the value that they held when they came out and that they aren't up to today's standards based solely on the fact that they set those standards decades ago, but [i]Days of Defeat[/i] feels like an outlier that really was just an alternative to the truly excellent games the industry was releasing at the time, not a main attraction.\n\n[b][RATING: 4.6/10][/b]","timestamp_created":1581981492,"timestamp_updated":1627205928,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496338337659835815","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63380099","author":{"steamid":"76561198825252340","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":793,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":75,"last_played":1586708062},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра,всем советую!","timestamp_created":1581502186,"timestamp_updated":1581502186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63291612","author":{"steamid":"76561198060336660","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":15,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15,"last_played":1581356447},"language":"english","review":"Like Counter-Strike except World War 2 and re-spawns.","timestamp_created":1581356467,"timestamp_updated":1581356467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63190692","author":{"steamid":"76561198146401083","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1581120965},"language":"french","review":"Good enough better than source source slow down gameplay and you die fast and have a lot of choke point it's like if on R6 litterally everyone rushed and had 3 speed OP so this game is better at doing this thing","timestamp_created":1581211528,"timestamp_updated":1581211528,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63129595","author":{"steamid":"76561198124114652","num_games_owned":339,"num_reviews":215,"playtime_forever":892,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":866,"last_played":1582653832},"language":"english","review":"day of of the cat and and and and","timestamp_created":1581121236,"timestamp_updated":1581121236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63126959","author":{"steamid":"76561198261859818","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":1907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1305,"last_played":1629329618},"language":"english","review":"a humble ww2 shooter made on the gldsrc engine at the end of its lifetime, making it one of the best looking gldsrc games released. the gameplay isnt newbie-friendly and takes some learning and matches can be even slower paced than counter strike but scoring grenade kills and landing headshots with long range rifles from a rooftop is a satisfying feeling that doesnt have a  modern equivalent","timestamp_created":1581116009,"timestamp_updated":1592457028,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495739728212356567","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63106383","author":{"steamid":"76561198238114412","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":588,"last_played":1610410284},"language":"dutch","review":"In februari 2020 heb ik na 20 jaar dit spel opnieuw aangeschaft. Vroeger veel gespeeld; ik zat zelfs in een clan met enkele fanatiek spelende Vlamingen. Ik ben echter vergeten hoe die clan noemde of wat mijn naam toen was. Ik heb nog een aantal games gespeeld, maar met uitzondering van enkele stadsmanagement games ben ik er toch een hele tijd uit geweest. Ik had niet verwacht dat ik dod nog zo leuk zou vinden. Bij wijlen druist de adrenaline bij het spelen van deze game door mijn lichaam. Ik geraak zelfs mijn bed weer uit voor dit spel. Het blijft even spannend dan vroeger. \n\nDay of defeat is en blijft achter 20 jaar een unieke shooter. Het grote verschil tussen dod en de rest is dat de dod maps geconstrueerd zijn als een gang of balkvorm, terwijl de meeste andere shooters een vierkante vorm hebben. Daardoor is het bij uitstek een spel voor de vaak vergruisde 'campers'. De balkvorm zorgt voor een stellingenoorlog waarbij de tegenstander langzaam achteruit wordt verdreven. De tactiek is om van cover naar cover te springen en zo de vijand te verassen en de linie stelselmatig achteruit te duwen. Zijgangen aan beide kanten van de balkvorm breken echter de linie open en kunnen voor verassende wendingen zorgen en de linie doorbreken. Tegenover de balkvorm staat het vierkant, waarbij je constant moet bewegen om niet in de rug geschoten te worden. Persoonlijk haat ik de vierkante speelvorm, omdat het de spelerstalenten beperkt tot wie er het beste kan schieten. In dod geldt dat natuurlijk ook, maar daarnaast is er ook het inzicht verwerven in de map dat in dod veel belangrijker is dan in andere shooters.  \n\n(Er zijn natuurlijk campers en campers. Campers die achter de linie campen zonder het team vooruit te helpen en op die manier enkel spelers neerschieten die zich moeizaam een weg hebben gebaand achter de linie, vindt ik ook frustrerend. Campers die vooraan de linie een super goeie spot hebben weten te veroveren vindt ik daarentegen een leuke uitdaging om uit te schakelen.)\n\nEen tweede belangrijke troef van dod is het vlaggensysteem waarbij je het spel pas wint als je alle vlaggen hebt veroverd. Nu, zo speciaal is dat niet, maar wat het speciaal maakt is dit systeem in combinatie met de balkvorm. Er is dus een doel. De linie schuift dus langzaam op van vlag naar vlag. In dod moet men dus een plein, straat of gebouw als het ware veroveren om verder te kunnen. Wederom, zou dit in een vierkantvorm plaatsvinden, dan zou dit weer aan heel wat tactiek ontbreken. \n\nTen derde  en in combinatie met de twee vorige troeven zorgt het systeem van respawning voor balans in het spel: het winnende team moet immers een grotere afstand afleggen naar de linie dan het verliezende team, waardoor het winnen van het spel steeds moeilijker wordt naarmate je meer vlaggen verovert. Het is ook leuker om direct na dat je bent neergeschoten revanche te kunnen nemen. Of van class te veranderen naarmate de tactiek verandering verreist. \n\nIk begrijp niet waarom ontwikkelaars van shooters zo de kaart van de anti-campers hebben getrokken met open maps. Want uiteindelijk is er niets leuker dan revanche te nemen op een camper die jou heeft neergeschoten. En het feit dat je maar 4 euro hoeft te betalen voor de beste shooter ooit... \n\nGeschreven door: Poor Equipment (vooralsnog mijn in-game nickname)\n\n(Misschien een goede gelegenheid om eindelijk eens die map te maken, die ik al 20 jaar in mijn hoofd heb, dod_rivier.
