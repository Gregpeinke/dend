At first when i bought this game i thought it was an okayish game but when i know my loadoat and was focusing on achievements i find this game fun to play, however i perfer more of Left 4 Dead than this. This game also gives a lot of realism with the fact that you have no crosshair and your character doesnt have experience with a gun but as you level up you get more comfortable with your weaponary.  Its a pity that this game was programed with simple programing actions in the unreal engine but its an exception.  This takes place in Europe and dont be thinking this is all about nazi zombies its modern zombies, and also its more gentlemen like if you say euros (Europian money) instead of dollars (American money)  because every time you kill a zombie you get euros so stop saying its dollars.

Eventually I warmed up to it and got used to the money managment and perk strategies. The game can be very fun when you get a good group cooperating together. The only part I would change is to add a shove/melee to the guns so that you can still push them back if you have too many on you at once.\nEdit: I have changed my overal opinion of the game mostly based on the community. Many online players are rude and no longer play to have fun. I would like to say this is a minority of players, but it has been steadily increasing to most servers. It also starts to become a slow and boring grinding game once you get up to level 4-6 on your skill perks.","timestamp_created":1331022279,"timestamp_updated":1502769461,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5605004","author":{"steamid":"76561198052735269","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":76,"last_played":1373919554},"language":"russian","review":"–ú–Ø–°–û!!!","timestamp_created":1330948064,"timestamp_updated":1330948064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1115530","author":{"steamid":"76561197987075355","num_games_owned":2665,"num_reviews":109,"playtime_forever":23,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1383541591},"language":"english","review":"Just kill zombie-ish creatures in survival mode?
