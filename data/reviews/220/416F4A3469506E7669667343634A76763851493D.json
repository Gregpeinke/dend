Satisfying gun-play, excellent grenades, much better enemy AI than in the first game\n+ Incredible atmosphere achieved through non-repetitive level design [spoiler](Ravenholm, Bridge in Highway 17, Nova Prospect and Citadel stand out)[/spoiler] and a fantastic OST that alternates between action packed techno/dnb/industrial tracks and ambient ones. \n+ Iceberg theory story-telling thats typical for Valve games. Almost nothing is spoon-fed and most of the lore is given through visual cues.\n+ Fairly likable and enjoyable characters. [spoiler]The main antagonist is convoluted and his motivations are reasonable. Although towards the end he turns slightly comically villanous.[/spoiler]\n+ Very few scripted moments and even less interruptions for gameplay. A compact experience from start to finish.\n+ Game is very clean and almost impossible to get yourself soft-blocked in.\n+ [spoiler]Ravenholme is a legitimately solid horror experience. Poison headcrabs/zombies sound design is haunting and unnerving and the game devs knew exactly how to place them for maximum effectivity [/spoiler]\n+ Quicksaves are a life saver.\n\n- [spoiler]The boat, car, nova prospect [/spoiler] sections are just a tad bit too long and you will likely feel somewhat relieved to switch to a new location\n- Some weapons become completely invalid far too quickly [spoiler](pistol, smg, crowbar (entirely invalidated by the gravity gun). [/spoiler] The variety also isnt the best, considering half of the weapons are your basic FPS stuff. Certain weapons have way too much ammo (pistol, smg) while others have too little (rocket launcher - 3, crossbow - 10, assault rifle - 90) \n- While there are almost always clever alternative ways to kill your enemies. Simply strafing and shooting is so effective that the reward for trying to find them is minimal. \n- The hard difficulty is not very hard and unless you never play FPS games, I recommend starting off with it even on your first playthrough\n\n9/10 must-play title that holds up today","timestamp_created":1628286302,"timestamp_updated":1628286302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97069621","author":{"steamid":"76561199099014551","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":283,"last_played":1654881909},"language":"spanish","review":"ta bueno","timestamp_created":1628285228,"timestamp_updated":1628285228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97069613","author":{"steamid":"76561198330449209","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":978,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":928,"last_played":1650116267},"language":"english","review":"really fun","timestamp_created":1628285206,"timestamp_updated":1628285206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97068696","author":{"steamid":"76561198909203653","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":304,"last_played":1628283972},"language":"english","review":"jh","timestamp_created":1628283993,"timestamp_updated":1628283993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97068488","author":{"steamid":"76561198452026868","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1013,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1002,"last_played":1632244497},"language":"russian","review":"Эмммммм, а где третья часть.
