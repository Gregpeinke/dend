Game actually is pretty immersive for the most part until the peaceful protesters take over and start shooting you for being straight. It's right around when the ghost gets introduced that I stopped caring. Regardless, gameplay can be fun but the fact that they nerfed the RPG mechanics from the first two games is nonsense and better suited to Skyrim or Assassins Creed or Witcher or some other Low IQ gamer bug catcher. I also can't bang my daughter Elizabeth so everything I do means nothing because I am not being rewarded with female snatch. Still, the luger is excellent and shooting crows at people is akin to using a dying star to catapult our civilization past the fermi paradox, but I don't know.

Çok aşırı eğlenmedim dedim çünkü hikâye başta tam ilgimi çekmeye başlamıştı ki birden durgunlaştı. Oyun bir yerde sanki “Git bak bakayım ben orada mıyım?” şeklinde görevler vermeye başladı ve bu da beni sıktı. Fakat bir yerden sonra aniden açılan oyun bizi hikâyenin içine çekmekle kalmıyor, hikâyeyi bize bire bir yaşatıyor.\n\nİncelememin devamı için içeri buyurun efendim: https://doftec.wordpress.com/2020/11/05/bioshock-infinite/","timestamp_created":1604658684,"timestamp_updated":1604658684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78813538","author":{"steamid":"76561198113604199","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":5055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5035,"last_played":1618170641},"language":"spanish","review":"me gusta elizabeth","timestamp_created":1604658620,"timestamp_updated":1604658620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78812064","author":{"steamid":"76561198433610853","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1066,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1066,"last_played":1604545794},"language":"schinese","review":"好","timestamp_created":1604656158,"timestamp_updated":1604656158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78811756","author":{"steamid":"76561199042345745","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1077,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":816,"last_played":1605243969},"language":"english","review":"This is a great game in terms of narrative pacing, game-play and characterisation.

When I first encountered her, I was thinking to myself \"oh boy, here we go with an entire game's worth of an escort mission\", but she was extremely well done. Providing support with supplies, getting out of the way when a fight is going on, etc; all make her a joy compared to other characters I have had to look after.\n\nThe skyrail is great as well. The thrill of leaping through the air and zipping through the skies is an exhilarating rush, even for someone who is somewhat afraid of heights such as myself. I'd love to see something like that again. And stepping out of those doors to view New Columbia is just as wondrous as it is the very first time you see Rapture within the first game.\n\nSo, seeing as both of these parts are mentioned, you likely are wondering why I didn't have fun with this game. Unfortunately the problem lies with everything else.\n\nThe gameplay is atrocious, as it doesn't seem to involve much beyond shooting cookie cutter enemies as they come marching around the corner. Once this is done, you go ahead and explore the limited area before... You come to another area where you need to shoot cookie cutter enemies again. \nYou can try to use plasmids (now called vigors for some odd reason), but you'll find that they are pitifully weak compared to the previous games. No longer is there joy in using interesting plasmids to dominate your enemies, now you have endless opportunities to make traps!.. Which are not nearly as effective as using the guns.\nRinse, repeat several times before you complete some arbitrary objective (but don't worry, because that objective will likely be undermined several times by *insert character here* ruining your progress and making you have to divert yourself to progress the story all over again!).\nExploring the environment doesn't give much either, as it will either give you food, coins or audio logs that only serve to give little splashes of mundane flavour about characters we will never meet.\n\n\"No problem\", the internet says, \"as the real catch of infinite is down to the story!\".\n\"Isn't a game supposed to be fun to play though?\" I ask them, \"If I wanted to read an interesting story, shouldn't I just read a book or watch a movie which is primarily around the story and visual appeal?\"\nRegardless of how that discussion went, it became clear that the story was the big appeal. The downside of this was the sheer fact that I had been spoiled of the ending and story several times over by people who claimed that it was the bees knees.\n\nAnother problem was, I think the story sounds incredibly stupid.\nBumbling your way through a story, only for the ending to be some abstract philosophical idea that is the most cliche idea centering around alternate dimensions (Spoilers ahead for anyone who wasn't seen or heard of it yet), because the concept of Booker being the bad guy in EVERY dimension is not exactly new material.\n\nSo, if I hate the gameplay and think the story could be way better (at the very least, it's not appealing to me), then what exactly is left for me? Zipping on the skyrails? One would be better off playing The Spiderman PS4 or the grind sections in Ratchet and Clank for those.\nBut for the love of all that is holy, stop claiming it is an amazing game. You can find the ending interesting, but that does not make it any better than other games who do both gameplay and story far better.","timestamp_created":1604648964,"timestamp_updated":1604648964,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.637094795703887939","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78805071","author":{"steamid":"76561198422535898","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":119,"last_played":1553226858},"language":"schinese","review":"真的很不推荐，开始以为如梦如幻的游戏，全是一张脸和画面循环，然后各种绕圈爬升，真不推荐，我很久以前玩过2小时，现在看到都怕","timestamp_created":1604642431,"timestamp_updated":1604642431,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.438246995210647583","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78804008","author":{"steamid":"76561198351791207","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1098,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1098,"last_played":1604639914},"language":"latam","review":"\"Booker... ¿Tienes miedo de Dios?\"\n\n\"No. Pero tú sí que me das miedo.\"\n\n―Elizabeth y Booker DeWitt\n\n\nJuegazoooo, si señores me enamore de Bioshock y toda su saga, jugue los 3 y me los 2 primeros me parecieron un juego que todos tienen que jugar pero este.... es una obra de arte.

Графика идеальна.\nГеймплей лично мне не очень понравился, из-за постоянных перестрелок, но я брал игру не ради геймплея,  а ради сюжета.\nИ хотя это моя первая Bioshock, но с самого начала игра уже заинтересовала сюжетом. С самого начала я \"влился\" в эту игру в единое целое. И при встрече с Элизабет я не мог оторвать от нее глаз, настолько она мне понравилась. Я не мог оторваться от мысли о том \"А что же будет дальше?\". И ежедневно я садился играть с мыслями что эти несколько часов пройдут идеально.\nВ игре много неожиданных поворотов, которые полностью взрывали мой мозг. Ах да, в сюжете достаточно моментов чтобы поставить на паузу и подумать о том, что же сейчас произошло.\nВ общем плавно заканчиваю расхваливать Bioshock Infinite и просто скажу, что игра сильно превзошла мои ожидания и я доволен этими 10-ю часами, проведенными в ней. Нельзя сказать что игра короткая, но она и не долгая.

I played it originally for PlayStation 3 but an just awed at how the graphics are improved for PC. Even by today's standard Infinite, and especially the DLC, look amazing and detailed. Irrational games builds a world to enjoy that I have not experienced since the first Bioshock. The setting, scenery, music, and voice acting completely put you in the moment.\n My one negative with this game is the repetitive combat. Many times it feels like endless waves of enemies come at you for no other reason than to make the game longer. A small complaint, as the combat is satisfying and the vigors are impactful and fun to use.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nThe graphics style used by this game ensures that it will look great for many years to come.\n\nMusic: 10/10\nThe music in this game is perfect. Dark, disturbing tones vibrate into your head while exploring dangerous areas and light, airy music floats across as you travel across the nicer areas of Columbia. Irrational games have nailed the sounds from the time period.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nThe sky hook is innovative and fun to use, but can be frustrating trying to control when new to the game. Combat can be repetitive in parts, but as a whole does not detract from the game too much. The guns are satisfying and have different uses. Ammo can be hard to come by so Elizabeth will keep you stocked if you run low. I only ran into one or two issues with her AI throughout the entire game which I consider a great achievement, as companion in games generally annoy me to death.\n\nOverall: 9.9/10\nFor me, this is what I want a video game to be. The story, setting, and gameplay all come together in what I can only call a masterpiece. I never thought a game would eclipse my love for the first Bioshock, but Irrational games seems to have done it. If you are a fan of story-driven (if a bit confusing) games, look no further. I would recommend this game to any type of gamer as the adjustable difficulty setting lets you set your own challenge. The only warning I would give is that this game has some highly disturbing parts, which is nothing new for this series.
