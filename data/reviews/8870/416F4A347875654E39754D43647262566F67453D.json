All the superpowers and gunplay of the first two, with an extra twist of quantum craziness.\n\nBioshock Infinite is similar to its two predecessors, yet quite different at the same time. It's still first person, but instead of playing the classic silent protagonist, you're now in the role of Booker DeWitt, a jaded private eye tasked to \"bring back the girl and wipe away the debt.\" You still get plenty of cool powers by drinking strange glowing fluids, but they're called Vigors instead of Plasmids. Most of all, the story is a linear experience that still immerses you in the history and struggles of the place you find yourself in, granting context to the strange and often distressing idiosyncracies that define life in Columbia.\n\nThe game uses quantum mechanics and multiverse theory liberally, explaining everything from why the city of Columbia stays up in the air to what Elizabeth's unique powers do. Elizabeth is the young woman Booker has been tasked to retrieve, and operates simultaneously as the \"princess in the tower\" and \"deus ex machina.\" As such she is naive but possesses astounding potential, able to actualize other possibilities by opening up \"tears\" much like someone might open a window or a door. Thankfully, rather than being a game-length escort mission, Elizabeth contributes significantly to the fight by tossing Booker supplies when he's low and actualizing cover and turrets on a whim. As a result, there's actual value that she provides to the player, further reinforcing the connection between Booker and Elizabeth through the games mechanics. \n\nHowever, there are several major changes that set Infinite apart from Bioshock 1 and 2. Combat is more vertical than before thanks to the addition of skyhooks and rails, allowing you to zip around the level and reach areas in the more open environments around Columbia. Upgrading is now entirely based on money, rather than requiring ADAM to upgrade your powers. You can't hack like before, so hostile turrets either need to be destroyed or possessed to avoid getting gunned down. \n\nAs for the use of voiced characters, particularly in the protagonist role, it's a a mixed blessing. On the one hand, there's actual dialogue between the main characters, and the story is stronger for having those moments between Booker and Elizabeth. On the other hand though, the narrative dissonance is more noticeable than before as well, particularly when Booker goes from providing insightful commentary on the conflict to scavenging corpses and garbage for any stray bit of food or coin he can find. \n\nThe narrative is excellent on its own and is made even better with the Burial at Sea DLC, which helps officially connect Infinite to the stories of Bioshock 1 and 2. The quantum silliness in Infinite sometimes make it difficult to keep causality straight, but it's fascinating seeing the \"constants and variables\" between Rapture and Columbia explained in depth. \n\nUltimately, Bioshock Infinite is a worthy conclusion to the series, taking the frantic fights and heady story of its predecessors and adding in some new mechanics so the experience feels fresh. Definitely worth a play for anyone that enjoys first person shooters with strong narratives.","timestamp_created":1529374069,"timestamp_updated":1529374069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.699289023876190186","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42831726","author":{"steamid":"76561198190714323","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1770,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1436,"last_played":1535491381},"language":"english","review":"this game right here is some good shit, I fucking loved it","timestamp_created":1529370676,"timestamp_updated":1529370676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42815184","author":{"steamid":"76561198066538172","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":816,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":716,"last_played":1594996615},"language":"english","review":"BioShock Infinite is a really good game. Like the best single player FPS since BioShock 1 (which was the best since Half-Life 2). While this one is not as good as the first game in its series, it is better than the second.\n\nIn some ways, it improves on both its predecessors. The graphics are, of course, fantastic for the year it came out. The story is also brilliant. The main characters are interesting and have depth and development. The previous games in the series don't have characters as intersting as Booker DeWitt and Elizabeth. Also, despite the game being very linear, Columbia feels less constricted and claustrophobic compared to that of Rapture. Some of the weapons are better than any of the weapons in previous BioShock games. The carbine and crank gun in particular are great. However, these two weapons are obviously superior to all other weapons in the game, and I found myself only carrying those two (although you don't acquire them until later in the game, so you'll have to make do with what you have before getting them). One final way in which it improves on its predecessors is that some of the vigors are better than some of the plasmids. Vigors like Murder of Crows, Bucking Bronco, and Charge feel more creative than some of the plasmids.\n\nHowever, there's also a few ways in which the game is actually worse than its predecessors. As previously mentioned, the game is very linear. In the first 2 games, you have an arrow telling you where to go because otherwise you could get lost in the somewhat open world. There is no arrow in Infinite, but you'd never need one in the first place. While the aesthetic and time period of Columbia is really cool, because it isn't as much of an open world, I end up liking Rapture more.","timestamp_created":1529342433,"timestamp_updated":1529342433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42815119","author":{"steamid":"76561198009966841","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":1715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1715,"last_played":1529338033},"language":"english","review":"It's honestly a great game, and the aspects are many.\nFirst the graphics. They still sound pretty up to date so far in 2018. \nSecondly, the scenario. Stunning environments, captivating people (either in their neutrality or hostility) and many explorable sites (note here: this is NOT an Open World Game). You should go from point A to point B, as  the previous Bioshocks. \nLet's also not forget the Story, whose plot-twists and philosophical contexts add a lot into captivating you until the end of your adventure. It will surely make you think, and rethink.\nThis Game erased the prejudice I had with the first two Bioshoicks, which I found slightly boring and claustrophobic.\n\nAs for the negative points, I would start with the replayability. There is none.\nWhen you finish the game, there's no point in going back there again just for the sake of doing everything, killing the same people, casting the same spells and repeating the same tracks.\nAnother flaw is how they portrait conservatives into crazy fundamentalists, which I think is too fancy and biased; on the other hand, they do the same with the Vox Populi, which is clearly a Left leaning group with nothing more than terrorism pumping up through their veins. \n\nThis game had a potential to be even better by making this game an Open World, with so much to show and to explore (and also RE-EXPLORE). I felt it could have been something epic if the player were able to explore/invade Columbia's houses, steal things, make hostages, and scape from authorities. But that's just a glimplse of what could have been and improvement for this amazing game.","timestamp_created":1529342215,"timestamp_updated":1529342215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42811543","author":{"steamid":"76561198146119543","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":448,"last_played":1539111749},"language":"english","review":"Really enjoyed the game and the DLCs, great atmosphere and characters.

But it's not supposed to, this game is a colorful theme park ride and you just have to accept it for what it is.\n\nGameplay wise it's your average console shooter. Low field of view (even with the slider all the way to the max it's only 85 degrees), sluggish movement speed (even if you always sprint your strafing speed is very slow). Half of your health pool is the so called \"shield\" that constantly regenerates, so you're supposed to play your typical game of \"pop a mole\" where you take pot shots at the enemies, throw some fireballs or lightning bolts and then hide behind cover as your shield recovers. While the game is only about 15 hours long the combat mechanics lose their appeal long before that mark.\n\nI still recommend this game, because it's a lot of fun to simply walk around this world and see what's what.

They took a main character in the story and used her to totally reinvent game mechanics that I hadn't even realized needed to be improved until I played this game. What I mean is, most other RPGs I've played use a potion or bandage system for health/mana/whatever; this game just has Elizabeth toss you whatever you find yourself needing as she follows you around. She can also revive you, so even dying feels smooth. They basically cut a bunch of the typical RPG BS out and replaced it with an actual character that talks to you in the elevator, and it lets you focus on the fun stuff, like sending a flock of murderous crows into a room of bad guys so you can shoot them in the face while their eyes get pecked out. Speaking of which, I loved all the new bio weapons - really creative stuff. \n\nThe story and atmosphere were both quite good. Also, voice acting and audio were excellent.

The player takes on the role of Booker deWitt who is sent to the floating city of Columbia in order to find and rescue a young woman named Elizabeth. This game not only amazes me with its stunning graphics and entertaining gameplay bua also the way in which it encompasses a variety of different themes and historical references. \n\tThe aesthetics of Bioshock Infinite conveys it takes place in the early 1900s and has a unique look to the environment and characters. From the moment the player steps foot into the fantasy city of Columbia, he/she will notice the game’s cartoonish, retro-futuristic feel not just by the visuals but also by the futuristic technologies that they city has, such as the complex animatronics robots and the city’s ability to levitate above the clouds. The player will notice how much attention to detail there is not just in the game’s objects themselves but also throughout the game environment, both indoors and outdoors. While walking through the streets of the city, the player may notice how detailed the old-fashioned buildings look as well as all the propaganda posters painted on the building’s walls. I recommend taking the time to explore the city’s streets and alley’s not only to appreciate its depth to detail but also since there might be hidden treasures in it for the player too.\n\tFor almost every video game out there, the game’s genre will correlate to the type of gameplay that the player experiences. Although Bioshock Infinite is labeled as a first person shooter, it definitely has a role-playing aspect behind it as well. Because Booker deWitt is the type of person to go into battle guns ablaze, this type of characteristic translates to a very fast-paced style of gameplay for the player. Because of this characteristic,the gameplay is not too suited for players who enjoy the stealthier type of combat. For example, if the player was trying to sneak into a room with enemies patrolling throughout it, there would be almost no way that the player could discreetly take down enemies without alerting the other opponents, as the game’s mechanics simply do not allow this. On the other hand, the combat gameplay still offers a good variety of ways to take down enemies which prevents combat from being too straightforward and boring. For example, the player is granted the ability to summon objects such as automated turrets and weapon crates into the game environment to assist them in combat, as well as the ability to ride the overhead grappling rails and perform aerial takedowns on opponents. On top of that, the player can use Booker’s special abilities during combat such as summoning a murder of crows to attack enemies or even zapping opponents with a lightning bolt which further enhances combat and keeps it entertaining.\n       Another important aspect of Bioshock Infinite is its narrative and how it affects the player’s experience. Since this game is strictly single player its narrative/story is structured through the gameplay and cutscenes. Character development is a major element of the narrative and is usually shown through cutscenes that involve an emotional connection between Booker  and Elizabeth. Additionally, the story of the game is told through objects in the game environment. Throughout the game, the player will come across kinetoscopes which he/she can activate to see a short “vintage” film about the history of the city or a character’s background. Along with the kinetoscopes are the audio recordings from background characters which describe particular events or give information about a character/group. Finding these kinetoscopes and audio recordings not only enrich the narrative of the game but also make the exploration experience more interesting.\nLastly, I want to add how the developers incorporate cultural/historical references into the narrative and game environment. As part of the storyline, the city of Columbia is split into two factions, the first being the “Founders” or the white natives of the city who believe in their superiority to the second group, the Vox Populi, who consist of the the underclassmen of the city. The player learns early on in the game through posters and signs about the division between these two factions and the hatred they have for each other. This can easily be compared to the time period in much of American history when white people thought they had privilege and superiority over African-Americans. Furthermore, the rebellious Vox Populi is inspired by historical movements concerning African-American rights and racial equality. Overall, I think including these historical/cultural influences adds depth to the game’s narrative and role-playing aspects.\n       All in all, Bioshock Infinite is a great single player game due to its aesthetics, gameplay, and storyline elements. If you are a player who enjoys action-packed gameplay but still values an emotional, in-depth storyline, this game is for you.\n\n- Eric Baker","timestamp_created":1528870967,"timestamp_updated":1528871100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42690188","author":{"steamid":"76561198314162310","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":579,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":579,"last_played":1528812948},"language":"schinese","review":"“Booker...Are you afraid of God?” \n“No, I`m afraid of you.\"\n\n\n这是一款被称为第九艺术的游戏\n\n\n我去过天际省，到过亚楠镇\n畅游中世纪，流连诺拉村\n在陶森特当过猎魔人，也在纽约2.0打过外星人\n当过勇者除过魔王，也受过苦打过薪王\n然而这一切，全都比不上那穿过层层乌云，出现在眼前的天空城\n以及在沙滩上，跳着舞的伊丽莎白","timestamp_created":1528860462,"timestamp_updated":1528860462,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":124,"votes_funny":17,"weighted_vote_score":"0.848164975643157959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42689310","author":{"steamid":"76561198000546657","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":3489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3133,"last_played":1528831242},"language":"english","review":"Looks good, runs good, the Burial at Sea is what really makes this game.

One difference from bioshock to bioshock infinite is that Bioshock focuses on the city of rapture more, but infinite has a stronger emphasis on the characters and their stories. You become so immersed and wrapped up in the world and connected with the characters that it's very emotional when the game ends. For at least a week after finishing the game (and playing through the bind boggling ending) all I could think about was this game and it's story. The gameplay is satisfying, the graphics are beautiful, but the story and lore is out of this world. As soon as I finished the game I played it again on 1999 mode. I craved more from the bioshock universe and purchased the dlc's and played them. Absolutely worth it, especially on sale, i got infinite and the dlc's for around $14.

This time authors had a surprise for you, instead of diving deep into the floor of the ocean, Bioshock Infinite takes you to a city flying above clouds - Columbia. \n\nCity has a rich backstory and life in there is filled with very sharp social commentary on racial and class segregation. However, sunny Columbia with its open skies feels very thin, plastic and even narrower than underwater close quarters of Rapture. Sadly, but this city is just few parallel corridors with no ceiling. \n\nVisual style is catchy at first, but it’s quickly annoys with its cartoonish character design. It’s hard to believe, that dystopian horror trademarks were thrown away in favour of theme park with roller coasters and cotton candy - nothing “bioshocking” is left here. Same goes for characters: new people might be memorable at first, but soon you can see their one-dimensional personalities with generic or no motivation at all. Conventional “I’m a good guy” protagonist because he is good, classic damsel in distress and evil guy because he is evil. The ending twist is hardly predictable, yet 90% of the story is built on generic teen-fantasy tropes. Worst thing about all the characters - game designers force you to love them based on their looks - not deeds. And this is in game with hard commentary on racism, elitism and class segregation - message was meant to be misunderstood. \n\nGameplay has not changed mostly, running and gunning with magic, but this time on literal rails (Sky-hook transport system). To literally hold your hand on these rails, game designers gave you indestructible and immortal companion - the very same “damsel in distress” - invincible scavenger with supernatural powers: need health - here, low on ammo - catch. Who saves whom? Game has lost its stakes: dying in Bioshock Infinite became less punishing than ever. \n\nOn a bright side, artists of Infinite made outstanding job with weapons design. Still not without a grain of salt: to double up variety of items, they just added half of the guns again, but with more red on them. Writers of the story made very compelling ending twist and really clever connections to the world of “classic” Bioshock. Maybe my favourite things in the game are little easter eggs: classic 60s song, that somehow (unravels later) were known in 1912 remote flying city and used in very appropriate places of a story. Additionally, there’s downloadable content - separate short story set back in underwater before its fall. I personally was more satisfied with this shameless cash grab (yes, I said that, you have to buy two DLCs to play it) than a main game.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a huge step away from the harsh, brutal, but still meaningful and deep world of Rapture. Due to a decision to please broader young audience, Infinite, while trying to be original fresh look on a franchise, became overrated generic and inconsiderable shooter, with a goal to create mass production of cosplayers, cheap artists and porn-parodies. I won’t judge you if you love it, still I wish this was not a part of Bioshock.","timestamp_created":1528804533,"timestamp_updated":1528804553,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488812386989593506","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42673364","author":{"steamid":"76561198065176763","num_games_owned":1282,"num_reviews":1695,"playtime_forever":221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1528893625},"language":"schinese","review":"还行吧。\n\nNot Bad","timestamp_created":1528802485,"timestamp_updated":1528802485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505324780941009521","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42671372","author":{"steamid":"76561198114670793","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":620,"last_played":1532853224},"language":"schinese","review":"总结一下：我TM社保","timestamp_created":1528795336,"timestamp_updated":1528795336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42668375","author":{"steamid":"76561197965091104","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":625,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":625,"last_played":1528780522},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games of all time.","timestamp_created":1528781167,"timestamp_updated":1528781167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42667211","author":{"steamid":"76561198045284534","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1263,"last_played":1493926511},"language":"english","review":"Gameplay is meh.

This game is easily one of the most compelling games I have ever played, along with a few PS4 exlusives but we dont talk about those. Most people reading this may have already played the game and are just curious to see the reviews of this game from other players who thoroughly enjoyed it. I think that if you havent played the game, you should buy it. You will enjoy this game, maybe if it isnt all aspects, there needs to be atleast one feature from the game, so when you finish it, you will walk away with some feeling of worthiness from the purchase. Whether it be the story, the gameplay, the graphical art style of the game, or everything, you will enjoy this game.\n\nP.S.
