De game begint met een schreeuwerig doch hilarisch '2K!!!!!' logo, dat brengt altijd een glimlach op mijn gezicht. Daarna komen nog wel wat logo's, maar die sla ik altijd over, want dat boeit mij vrij weinig. Vervolgens kom je in het titelscherm, met een rustige representatie van Columbia, dat je laat geloven dat dit een zwevend Utopia is. Nou, voorlopig weet alleen John de Mol een Utopia te creëren, want Columbia is niet bepaald een feest om in te wonen met al die monsters, machines en racisten!\n\nJe speelt als Booker DeWitt. Je ziet hem eigenlijk alleen maar op het doosje, want het gehele spel is in de eerste persoon. Ik denk dat hij wel een hele stoere knul is. Maar hoe kan Booker - jij dus -  zich vermaken zo hoog in de lucht? Daar hebben de slimme whizzkids bij 2K iets op bedacht, want al snel kom je Elizabeth tegen, je weet wel, dat vrouwelijk schoon dat op elke screenshot staat afgebeeld. Ze is bijzonder handig, want niet alleen weet ze de werkelijkheid nagenoeg kapot te maken, ze kan ook uit lucht gezondheid en munitie maken! Ze gooit het dan naar jou, zodat je niet zo snel sterft door schot- en snijwonden. Daarnaast valt er nog wast te vertellen over dit personage. De subtiele maar toch ook opvallende boezem van Elizabeth was een genot om in de ooghoeken te zien tijdens het verkennen van de vaak schimmige ruimtes. \n\nTijdens het spelen moet je schieten met allerlei pistolen, maar in BioShock: Infinite kun je ook van die kruidendrankjes verzamelen, een beetje zoals die van Madam Mikmak in de stripverhalen van Donald Duck. Als je die drinkt, gaat Booker eerst uit z'n dak, maar daarna kun je er vijanden goed mee verzwakken. Het ene drankje is de andere niet, maar er zijn er genoeg om iedereen tevreden te stellen. Het brengt natuurlijk ook een unieke 'combat' met zich mee, al blijft het doel natuurlijk gewoon om iedereen helemaal verrot te schieten.\n\nBioShock Infinite is een game vol met plottwists en politieke parallellen. Dit zorgt tijdens het spelen van de game voor een unieke en interessante ervaring. Racisme en geloof zijn twee onderwerpen die de game in je gezicht probeert te duwen, leuk als je daar op zit te wachten. \n\nAls je geen kast hebt staan van de plaatselijke buurtsuper, is deze game goed te spelen. Het ziet er ook prachtig uit. De omgeving is een realistische presentatie van een luchtstad met maatschappelijke problemen. De animaties van de personages zijn nooit verkeerd. De personages hebben ook goede models, ik vind vooral het bovenlijf van Elizabeth mooi in elkaar gezet.\n\nMuzikaal gezien zitten er leuke referenties naar het verleden, zoals de klassieker 'Everybody Wants To Rule The World' van 'Tears for Fears'. Toen ik dat liedje hoorde, gingen mijn mondhoeken naar boven wijzen. Goed,hè? Er zitten ook nog andere nummers in de game, dus dat is ook wel goed volgens mij. \n\nToch is het spel niet vlekkeloos. Er scheelt het een en ander aan het laatste gedeelte in de game. Ik wil niets verklappen, maar er zal een bepaalde baas een aantal keer worden gerecycled. Dit vond ik eigenlijk best suf, om eerlijk te zijn.  De eerste keer vond ik het een matige baas, de tweede keer was ik verbaasd en de derde keer was ik nogal geërgerd. Maar dat is toch vrijwel het enige wat deze game geen 10/10, 5/5 of Ja/Nee maakt.\n\nDus alles eventjes op een rijtje:\n\n- Prachtige Visuals\n- Leuke muziek en muziekreferenties\n- Pakkend verhaal\n- Plottwists\n- Goede combat\n- Elizabeth\n\nDus moet je deze game halen? Voor €7,49, de prijs van een aantal frikadel- en kroketbroodjes, zou ik het niet laten liggen. Koop ook meteen de Season Pass, als je niet genoeg kunt krijgen van Columbia en Elizabeth. Dit is geen advies, dit is een bevel. Ik meen het.\n\nBedankt voor het luisteren.","timestamp_created":1408881184,"timestamp_updated":1408881184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.706103503704071045","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11845375","author":{"steamid":"76561198052371996","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":762,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":536,"last_played":1408876651},"language":"english","review":"The story rendered me speechless!

Мы попадаем в летающий город  «Колумбия». Первая задача найти девушку Элизабет и раскрыть тайну появления главного героя Букера в этом мире. В процессе прохождения мы поймем, что чем дальше по сюжету, тем сложнее к восприятию. Открытие тайн и новых элементов в какой-то момент усложняет сюжет настолько, что требуется помощь другу. Мне, к примеру, пришлось пересмотреть объяснение концовок, чтобы соединить некоторые совсем не понятные вещи в сюжете. Поэтому ожидать, что такой многогранный торт из 3-х частей BioShock раскроется легко и просто не получится.  \nПроходится игра хорошо. Красивый мир и грамотные перемещения по нему. Проработанные оружия, способности и монстры - превращают экшен составляющую в возможность как прыгать на врага в открытую, так и использовать стелс. Такая балансировка способствует соединению игры и экшена. Хотя временами боевая система и уровни все таки немного не проработаны – то много динамики, то заманчивая  тишина. Субтитры включают полную аутентичность. Даже те, что не играл в первые две части с удовольствием погрузятся в этот новый и необыкновенно сбалансированный мир. Создатели, может в достаточно усложненной формуле смогли сделать отдельную игру, которую приятно проходить. Временами слишком спорные получились сюжетные линии – просто потому что они оказались поверхностные. Но эти огрехи не сильно портят общее впечатление, ибо мир неповторим.  \n\nDLC Burial at Sea - Episode 1 \nВозможность открыть тайны, и вернуться в «Восторг». Воюешь под водой, наблюдаешь за местными жителями. Открываешь ещё один вариант вселенных и опять остаешься с большим количеством вопросов, чем ответов.\n\nDLC Burial at Sea - Episode 2\nЗдесь мы играем за Элизабет. Она как хрупкая героиня – используется один стелс и комбинации головоломок. Очень спорный эпизод. С одной стороны он открывает большую часть тайн соединяя части BioShock и выявляя хотя бы заключения. Но воплощение и большое количество омерзительных и неприятных сцен, даже для подготовленного игрока оставляет отрицание. А  уже для неподготовленного детского ума – дает плод фантазии на тему экспериментов над другими. Создавали патологические садисты, которые немного перепутали зрелищность, со смыслом. Скрывать страхи за импринтом.  Хотя в плане гейм дизайна эпизод очень хороший и претендует на отдельную историю.\n\nОбщая оценка  10 из 10  \n","timestamp_created":1408877945,"timestamp_updated":1408877945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11844558","author":{"steamid":"76561198028105998","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":923,"last_played":1472607997},"language":"english","review":"It's as simple as this:\n\nBuys, bought, will buy.\n\nPlays, played, will play.\n\nLoves, loved, will love.","timestamp_created":1408873720,"timestamp_updated":1409132440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11844429","author":{"steamid":"76561198084557127","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":490,"last_played":1535379918},"language":"spanish","review":"Le lamo los cojones a ken levine.

La historia es atrapante, desde el primer momento te sumergís en la utópica Columbia, una sociedad extremadamente nacionalista, religiosa y fascista. \n\nA diferencia del primer Bioshock (el segundo, si bien correcto, es un poco inferior) en esta ocasión podemos apreciar como desciende la sociedad al caos absoluto. También contaremos con la inestimable compañía de Elizabeth, cuya AI está tan bien lograda que en ningún momento la sentiremos como una obstrucción, al contrario, ella participa durante las batallas consiguiendo munición, salud y sales (mana) y por fuera de estas, arrojándonos dinero.\n\nNuestro protagonista, Booker DeWitt, también tiene una personalidad bien llevada, con varios diálogos y acotaciones, un humor ácido muy característico y divertido.\n\nLa jugabilidad se siente cómoda, con un justo arsenal de armas y Vigors (8 en total, cada uno con sus fortalezas y debilidades, capaces de combinarse para desatar el infierno. Invocar cuervos para picotear y distraer a tus enemigos? Por qué no una parvada EN LLAMAS muajaja) en ningún momento se me hizo repetitivo. Nota importante para la Skyline, un sistema de transporte personal pero que también se utiliza en las zonas de pelea, aportando un dinamismo tremendo, con toda la acción ocurriendo muy frenéticamente. La rejugabilidad es buena, al pasarlo en cualquier dificultad se habilita el modo 1999, para los gamers más hardcore. Quizás adolece la falta de un multijugador.\n\ntl,dr: Ya seas un seguidor de la saga o un jugador ocasional, Bioshock Infinite sabe captar tu atención, te hará vivir grandes momentos y te dejará con una gran sensación. \n","timestamp_created":1408820217,"timestamp_updated":1408820217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11836334","author":{"steamid":"76561198060299881","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":273,"last_played":1416821055},"language":"czech","review":"i Like bioshock 1+2 and I lowe bioshock infinite GOTY and brutal sea For Me Like Up......","timestamp_created":1408818202,"timestamp_updated":1408818202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516778528690338135","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11836046","author":{"steamid":"76561198142548870","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1278,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":643,"last_played":1419437203},"language":"english","review":"cool storyline GREAT GRAPHICS THE HOURS OF WAITING FOR DOWNLOAD IS WORTH IT","timestamp_created":1408816722,"timestamp_updated":1408816722,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11835994","author":{"steamid":"76561198042768006","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2288,"last_played":1390232655},"language":"english","review":"The gameplay is bland, shallow and boring.

The characters are memorable, and the ending sends chills through your spine even after your first few playthroughs. Story elements are implemented in the game through audio-logs, posters in the environment and Kinetoscopes (short films). \n\nThe gameplay is extremely addictive, fast paced and fun. There is so much variety on how you want to humiliate your enemies, through the game's weapon arsenal, magical powers called Vigors (Plasmids in BioShock 1&2), you can literally 'roller-coaster' around the game's environments and smash through challenging foes with your Skyhook. \n\nOne of the main highlights of the game is your NPC companion, Elizabeth. No, this game is not an annoying escort mission as Elizabeth can take care of herself in combat. She will find cover and look for supplies (ammo,salts, health, money) and she'll throw them to you when you need them. She can also open up 'tears' in the fabric of time and space, spawning in turrets, cover, ammo and mechanical allied robots.  \n\nThe game is beautifully presented. The graphics don't particularly focus on a photo-realistic world, but a colourful and vibrant universe for you to explore. The game delivers with a stunning soundtrack that will numb you as the world of BioShock Infinite just sucks you into its immersive setting. The voice acting is superb, one of the best for its generation with Troy Baker and Courtnee Draper as Booker and Elizabeth respectively. \n\nThere is so much more to write about this game, it's an absolute work of art. Let's just say that it is worth every cent, and I highly recommend this game to anyone who is into adventure, story, mystery, sci-fi, shooters and games with a beautiful universe to them.

E' complessa, articolata, tratta di grandi tematiche (religione, politica, razzismo), insomma, estremamente interessante e coinvolgente.

E non parlo da fan della saga, personalmente i precedenti due capitoli non mi hanno entusiasmato più di tanto (si sono carini, ma nulla di più).

I like that it only took about 12-13 hours to beat and I didnt even explore that much, I think its a great time frame to beat and you have the option to play more after its over. those are the games I like.\n4) The story: it probably has one of the best endings out of any game ive ever played. The end was a masterpeice, I loved it.\n\nNow the things I didnt like.\n\n1) Powers aka (Vigor): Great power but unused most of the time. I only used two of the powers the whole time, and one of them was pretty over powered. Just seemed like a waste of a great feature in the game. \n2) Gun limitation: you could only have two of the 10-12 guns in the game at any time, this sucks cause you find vendors that can upgrade your guns and make them pretty awesome but you can only have two at any given time. Makes it hard in fights, even more so when you run out of ammo which I did a few times.\n3) Dying: you can die all you want without much of a hinder, you only lose alittle bit of money which there is a lot to be found in the game. I normally wouldnt complain about this but I think a game needs a bit of a challange.\n\nWell there ya have it, if anything just play till the end and check out that niffty little end twist, kind of a great story.","timestamp_created":1408782574,"timestamp_updated":1408782574,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11829941","author":{"steamid":"76561198120197232","num_games_owned":1397,"num_reviews":88,"playtime_forever":3007,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":700,"last_played":1593401353},"language":"spanish","review":"Bioshock Infinite: Solo dire que es una increiblemente obra maestra.","timestamp_created":1408782281,"timestamp_updated":1408782281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.644012928009033203","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11828779","author":{"steamid":"76561198097281279","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":594,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":409,"last_played":1408447741},"language":"dutch","review":"This game is prob my favorite fps/rpg!","timestamp_created":1408773466,"timestamp_updated":1408773466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526066362857818604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11828739","author":{"steamid":"76561198118778123","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":427,"last_played":1477426337},"language":"english","review":"pretty good game","timestamp_created":1408773283,"timestamp_updated":1408773283,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11828564","author":{"steamid":"76561198055993542","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":3619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":790,"last_played":1640756553},"language":"english","review":"Its ight the gun play is poor the story is cliche and the dlc is utter garbage and not worth the purchase buy the game on sale but not full price.

It has soul, characters worth remembering, music that reminds you of something buried. It gets under your skin and takes you to a place you never knew you wanted to visit. I look at it as though Bioshock is the Ocarina of Time and Infinite is the Majora's Mask. They go hand in hand and compliment each other so well. \n\nInfinite takes everything that made Bioshock so amazing and gives it some polish, more style and a story that you would have expected Alan Moore to have written.

The story is... well, the story is interestingly paced.  The first half is quite slow, and then the story's speed keeps increasing to a seemingly breakneck pace. It's almost like the developers went: \"Shit, the game is going to be released in two weeks... er, make a series of cutscenes to tell the rest of the story!\".  That said, the story is very good although I didn't find Booker a particulary compelling character.\n\nThe gameplay is... interesting. I played through the game on normal, being a normal kinda guy, and this lead to some interesting situations. One involved me standing behind a doorway through which the (melee only) enemies wouldn't walk.  The fps elements are average at best, and some of the weapons are highly situational.  I personally played 90% of the game using the carbine and shotgun, though ymmv.  The guns do feel really powerful though (that carbine), with the exception of the sniper.  The vigor system is interesting, though I didn't end up using more than 3 (shock, crow and shield).\n\nTl;dr:   Good.
