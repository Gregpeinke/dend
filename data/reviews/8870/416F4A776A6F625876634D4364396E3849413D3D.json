Wow... No deseo spoilear nada, pero uno tiene que verla de principio a fin (y prestar atención a aquellos detalles que parecen insignificantes).\nLas actuaciones de voces son creíbles y la música combina muy bien con el tono del juego.\nEl DLC es también muy recomendable. Clash in the Clouds aumenta la duración del juego tanto como uno soporte estar en las arenas y Burial at Sea le da un toque distinto al mismo gameplay que el juego te dejó acostumbrado. En estos momentos, no puedo esperar más para que salga Burial at Sea 2 y probar a Elizabeth.","timestamp_created":1389481761,"timestamp_updated":1389481761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8669755","author":{"steamid":"76561198035211077","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":81,"last_played":1404839090},"language":"german","review":"DIch hbae lange gewrtet, aber da ist es, geiles Spiel","timestamp_created":1389480589,"timestamp_updated":1389480589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8669724","author":{"steamid":"76561198043447750","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":770,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":770,"last_played":1388489618},"language":"english","review":"Fun game with great sequences that have a certain weight to them.

Sure, they could be better but they are certainly not as bad as people make them out to be. Even then, the enemies vigors and most importantly the story really makes up for it.\n\nThe enemies are most of the time not very special, they are just regular people working in the police or army. [b]The Heavy Hitters are the ones who really stand out.[/b] We have the Fireman, enclosed in a fireproof suit, using fire attacks. Or maybe you'd prefer the mysterious Crow, who can transform himself into a flock of crows to avoid your attacks and attacks with powerful melee attacks. And we also have the powerful Motorized Patriot, a creepy animatronic George Washington using his powerful Peppermill Gun to wreak havoc. All very imaginative and an absolute joy to combat.\n\n[b]The vigors are Bioshock Infinite's Plasmids.[/b] Some are very reminiscent of Bioshock's (Shock Jockey), some are completely new (posession). Bioshock Infinite uses Bioshock 2's dual wielding mechanic, a good choice. No more awkward switching! You can use your vigors in a myriad of ways, thanks to vigor combinations. Ever wanted to see an enemy assault his teammates while on fire? Now you can!\n\n[b]The absolute selling point of Infinite, however, is its story.[/b] You will never forget the adventures and mysteries of Booker and Elizabeth. Both characters are so real you wouldn't believe it. Meet unforgettable characters such as Comstock and Slate. Unfortunately, I can't say much about the story without spoiling too much, just take it from me that it's an absolute masterpiece written by Ken Levine. One word of advice though, play Bioshock 1 first, it adds a lot to the ambience. It isn't required though.\n\nIf you've decided to buy the game, remember to check every nook and cranny of every room, the Bioshock games are based on exploration, and you might just find that lock pick you needed.","timestamp_created":1389460353,"timestamp_updated":1389460448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8664376","author":{"steamid":"76561198012862329","num_games_owned":375,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":3749,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2490,"last_played":1590124315},"language":"hungarian","review":"Best game.","timestamp_created":1389458361,"timestamp_updated":1389458361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8664282","author":{"steamid":"76561198040687134","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3109,"last_played":1631392904},"language":"english","review":"Great game with a mind blowing story.

Пожалуй для меня она стала игрой года и пожалуй даже любимой игрой. Откровенно не помню когда я получал такие сильные впечатления от игры. Сюжет поглотил меня целиком и полностью.\nГротескная сатира на ку-клукс-клановский оголтелый расизм, циничную коммунистическую демагогию, заигрывания нацистов с мистицизмом — все это лишь на градус-другой абсурднее того, что существовало в реальности. Проверенная веками фабула — спасение принцессы от дракона — обернута в жесткую комедию нравов.\n\nСама игры невероятно красивая, хоть в ней и нет NextGen графики. При выполнении миссия я использовал навигатор и шел в ту сторону, которая миссией не предусмотрена. Местности и локации здесь - это проработанное пространство, не лишенное элементов быта. Летающий город в облаках, шикарные пейзажи - создается впечатление будто ты попал в какое-то из творений студии Ghibli и все это настолько волшебно что ты просто бродишь и любуешься этой красотой. Но, этот \"диснейленд\" не так прост как кажется. За большой утопией скрывается большая тьма.\n\nКак шутер - игра возможно и не вовсю оправдала ожидания игроков. Но она берет игрока не баталиями на винтажных орудиях, а сеттингом и персонажами.\n\nСюжет невероятно запутанный. По всей игре разбросаны кинетоскомы и голософоны. Кинетоскопы поясняют историю Коламбии, а голософоны поясняют историю происходящего конкретно в сюжете. Все это очень помогает составить общую картину событий. С каждым поворотом сюжет становится все запутаннее и если не прикладывать ум и внимание то можно совсем ничего не понять (или понять только лишь в общих чертах). Следить за развитием событий невероятно интересно и ты уже ждешь когда закончится очередная баталия и получишь еще один лакомый кусочек в мозаике сюжета.\n\nГлавный герой не лишен личности, но ты переживаешь все чувства вместе с ним. До дрожи в коленках, до мурашек по коже. Персонажи раскрыты целиком как очень красочные и таинственные личности. От спившегося бывалого вояки Букера ДеВитт'а до милейшей дочки Пророка - Элизабет. \nСама Элизабет это просто невероятный женский персонаж. Пожалуй она навсегда останется моим любимым женским игровым персонажем. Она мила, грациозна, любознательна и очень умна. Даже в условиях революции и сражений она сохраняет свою грациозность и всячески помогает Букеру.\n\nКогда играешь в эту игру - создается впечатление что сейчас ты слушаешь/смотришь сказку или просто интересную историю. Нет смысла играть в неё \"между делом\" или с целью полакомиться шутаном. Со свободными мыслями ты хочешь играть в неё больше и больше, хочешь узнать что будет дальше. После неё у меня нет желания в ближайшее время играть в другие игры ибо что там меня будет ждать? Очередные постреляшки, гонки или попрыгушки с Ларой Крофт? У вас это вызывает интерес? Лично у меня после того что я прошел - нет.\n\nЯ рекомендую игру всем. Не имеет значения, любите ли вы игры или нет. Просто попробуйте окунуться в это приключения и я гарантирую вам что вы будете довольны.\n\n11/10","timestamp_created":1389456038,"timestamp_updated":1389456038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8663569","author":{"steamid":"76561198015621030","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2025,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2025,"last_played":1386618732},"language":"german","review":"Super Game, klasse Action.

And all of that aside, this game is more than worth playing for it's absolutely fantastic writing.  Loved every minute of it.\n\nMuch like Bioshock before it, I felt Infinite's gunplay was slightly lacking.  While the lethargic aiming portion has been successfully resolved, I still felt like a great deal of the weapons available for use were simply unsatisfying.  The Machine Gun family is the biggest culprit in my eyes, while the Volley Gun is a close second.  There were a few weapons, however, that were always reliable, most notably the Shotgun, Heater, and Sniper Rifle.  The shotgun's usefulness felt like it tapered off towards the late game, however.\n\nVigors, when mixed into combat, helped immensely.  The gameplay started to feel more fluid and alive when I started to actively use my abilites, and Elizabeth was certain to keep me topped off.  While they ultimately felt shoe-horned in storywise, unlike the Plasmids of the first game, they were very widely varied in both ability, cost, and effectiveness.  I definitely used Shock Jocky the most, without a doubt, as it just fit better into my playstyle.\n\nThe writing is superb, however, and the game is immensely atmospheric, which makes for a satisfying experience overall.  Visuals are top notch, character art is vivid, the sound envelops you wholly, and the characters felt real and easy to invest in emotionally.  I was definitely not ready for that ending, though.\n\nAll in all, Bioshock Infinite is well deserving of the huge number of awards it received, and comes highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1389425688,"timestamp_updated":1389425688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8658205","author":{"steamid":"76561198061541146","num_games_owned":373,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":374,"last_played":1469992338},"language":"russian","review":"ЩЩЩЩИИИИИКККААААРРРННОООО","timestamp_created":1389425446,"timestamp_updated":1389425446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8658099","author":{"steamid":"76561198031124555","num_games_owned":450,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":390,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":155,"last_played":1457538641},"language":"english","review":"Nothing i can say but you have to play it","timestamp_created":1389424646,"timestamp_updated":1389424646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8657589","author":{"steamid":"76561198106537837","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":242,"last_played":1472146619},"language":"french","review":"Tout d'abord commençons par les défauts, parce qu'il y en a. Simplement, ce jeu est lent. Très lent. Je n'ai pas pu le faire tourner avec des bons paramètres alors que Far Cry 3 n'a aucun problème de FPS. Ce point est assez décevant. Mais passons au reste. Le jeu en lui même n'est pas mauvais. Il ne révolutionne pas les FPS, il ne propose pas de mode multijoueur (j'hésite entre avantage et inconvénient ; c'est vrai que ça aurait allongé la durée de vie, mais proposer un multi là où il n'y en a pas besoin est souvent une mauvaise idée et il en résulte une expérience ratée, donc mettons ça dans un point neutre). J'ai beaucoup apprécié l'univers du jeu, façon ancien temps en avance sur son temps, et il faut dire que l'éditeur a su nous mettre l'eau à la bouche avec les nombreuses vidéos et mises en scènes disponibles au cours du temps et avant la sortie du jeu : le scénario était bien introduit, avec la ville de Columbia ayant disparu. Pour autant, le scénario n'est pas excellent. Bien qu'on nous l'ait vendu parce que selon certaines personnes il l'était, il reste assez basique dans sa structure : il faut sauver Elizabeth d'un monde auquel elle ne comprend rien, le tout soupoudré de \"le racisme c'est mal / la dictature c'est mal\". Je vous ai résumé tout le jeu sans rien spoiler. Si on veut parler de l'aspect FPS (un peu important quand même), on dira qu'il n'est pas mauvais. Les armes un peu obsolètes aujourd'hui rentrent bien dans le jeu et les ennmis sont originaux (comparés à un FPS se déroulant à notre époque). Les toniques sont intéressants, bien que parfois un peu inutiles ou difficiles à utiliser ; de plus généralement vous en utiliserez un, peut être deux, les autres resteront bien cachés. Pourquoi ? Tout simplement car avant tout, votre nombre de cristaux est limité, au bout de cinq utilisations en milieu de jeu, vous n'aurez plus de quoi lancer vos toniques et en plus, switcher de tonique in-game directement n'est pas forcément facile, a fortiori lorsque vous avez une arme dans l'autre main : vous n'allez pas vous embêter à changer de tonique vous allez tirer. Un peu dommage malgré tout. \nFinissons sur le monde du jeu qui est somme toute très intéressant : non seulement il est assez beau, mais en plus assez varié. Malgré tout, les personnages manquent d'audace et on aurait tendance à croire que tous les designers se sont jetés sur Elizabeth qu'ils ont mis six mois à faire et qu'ils ont fait tous les autres modèles en une semaine sans y accorder un travail très poussé.\nEn résumé, achetez-le si vous aimez les FPS et ce genre d'univers. Ne l'achetez pas pour le scénario et, avant tout, ne l'achetez pas à trente euros, attendez les soldes. Ce jeu vaut quinze euros maximum (je dirais), pas le double.","timestamp_created":1389420623,"timestamp_updated":1389420623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56235957145690918","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8657363","author":{"steamid":"76561198055329984","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":3482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":732,"last_played":1659390767},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores jogos que já joguei na minha vida.\n\nEnough Said.","timestamp_created":1389418877,"timestamp_updated":1389418877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8656930","author":{"steamid":"76561198071972063","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":811,"last_played":1414897112},"language":"english","review":"just incredible!!! you have to play this game!","timestamp_created":1389415779,"timestamp_updated":1389415779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8656589","author":{"steamid":"76561198043398270","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3987,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1434264512},"language":"english","review":"Amazong","timestamp_created":1389413433,"timestamp_updated":1389413433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8655903","author":{"steamid":"76561198082116364","num_games_owned":418,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":905,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":857,"last_played":1554508120},"language":"english","review":"I have to say, without further adue, this game is above a decent level. However, I do have my problems with it, coming from a Bioshock 1 fan. I find the openness of the environment to be tiresome, I see many opportunities for this game to be completed easily - especially then atleast at a medium or hard mode.  As I played it, I found the plot to become more and more predictable. I felt as if the concept of Columbia being a bigger wonder than Rapture, yet not being featured as a first game in the series, was sort of confusing.

The themes of racism, cult religion and ultra-nationalism are shocking. I've never seen a game go there before. The character of Elizabeth is what makes the game great, when she is not with you things slow down to a dull crawl. When she is with you, she amazes with meaningful dialogue. And each time she tosses you a coin or a health pack the animation is breathtaking, It adds a thrill to the game.\n\nThe art direction and soundtrack and award worthy. Amazing stuff.\n\nReasons the game is annoying:\n\n1) You don't make a single moral choice through the game. The game decides everthing. It is completely linear, and so even though there is much emotional impact, you really make no choices and can't feel satisfaction or regret for the choices you made. You can't be good or evil, you are just what the game makes you. There was one scene where you come upon a KKK  rally and you can watch it before moving through. I decided to attack. Would they have attacked me if I hadn't? Probably. Did I actually make a real decision? Probably not. \n\n2) The endgame is completely out of gameplay style with the rest of the game, and skills you have built up for scores of hours now are almost useless. I didn't see that coming. It is a ridiculously endless series of attacks. My reaction: yech.

I actually never played BioShock 1 or 2 and bought this game for the sole reason that it seemed intriguing and got a lot of great reviews from both people and critics. A lot of people seem to really love this game and most people have already compared it to Half-Life 2 in terms of how good it is. So I thought that now that I've finally finished this game (on Hard difficulty mind you), I'd share my two cents on what my thoughts are about BioShock Infinite.\n\nThe first thing that really caught my attention about BioShock Infinite was the graphics. This game oozes atmosphere and pure raw STYLE from the moment you start it up. It's basically set in a sort of steampunk fictionalized 1920's, and stuff like religion and not to mention a good deal of racism is alive and well. You'll even find a lot of advertisements for cigarettes marketed to children. The graphics do a wonderful job setting you in the right mood and making the environment feel alive and vibrant and this is by far one of the best looking games this year. You'll probably benefit from buying this game on PC, seeing as it's far superior to consoles in terms of graphics, if you really care about that sort of thing, but it probably looks great on consoles too since it's more reliant on style rather than photorealism, something I tend to prefer in most cases. If you look at something like Deus Ex Human Revolution compared to Call of Duty Ghosts, in my opinion, Human Revolution wins out.\n\nAnother thing I noticed was how well paced it was. Being a sequel (spiritually anyway) I expected this game to more or less throw you right into the action and just toss everything at you at once. Instead the game gradually eases you into its concepts and introduces everything pretty smoothly. When you reach Elizabeth, who is in many ways the second protagonist in the game in addition to Booker, that's when the game really begins and you get introduced to the more heavy story elements. Before that the game spends a considerable amount of time just letting you wander around, soaking in the environment and getting familiar with the setting before it throws you into the action. Up until the point where you meet Elizabeth, you've already had the time to get familiar with the combat and basic weaponry and the game does a wonderful job easing you into more and more concepts, building them gradually like Lego blocks. It's this kind of game progression I enjoy in most games as it can be rather overwhelming when everything is thrown at you at once. It doesn't hurt that the story is really good and will definitely keep you playing for a long time. I won't really go into any big spoiler territory here but the game is long and has several great twists, especially one at the end and it does involve time travel and multiple dimensions and stuff and it's really good fuel for thought, which I'll admit is a rarity in most of today's games.\n\nBut no matter how good the story might be, the gameplay elements though tend to feel rather... uninspired. It's hard to put into words precisely but the game does feel like it's lacking a lot of things and I'll explain why. The first thing is the weaponry. You're given this skyhook thing, which you can also use to travel on skylines, which by the way is as fun as it looks, I'll give it that, and you use the skyhook as a melee weapon. However, unlike when the weapon is first demonstrated, you can't really do any finishing moves or executions using the skyhook. Most you can do is thwack people with it repeatedly until they die and it's not really that satisfying to use as a weapon and in most cases it's only usable to finish people off after stripping most of their health away with your other guns. In of itself it's a rather disappointingly weak weapon. The other weapons also feel almost dull and you're never really given anything that stands out particurarily or feels particurarily satisfying to use. I mostly stuck to the Carbine or Revolver since the two only automatic weapons, the machine gun and the crank gun (basically a minigun with a crank), feel rather underpowered and especially on Hard waste a lot of ammo and aren't that useful. I really wish you could have something like an assault rifle that felt really satisfying to use. You also have a rocket launcher and a grenade launcher, but all of the weapons feel rather standardized and boring to use and nothing really struck me as feeling radically satisfying.\n\nA lot of people have mentioned that Elizabeth is one of the best companions in a game ever, and while I can see where people come from in the sense the game is kind of an escort mission but never feels like one, she doesn't really do a whole lot other than throwing you some ammo and stuff once in a while. She's basically immune to damage and it's kind of hilarious to see her running among the enemies and them not really giving a shit about her and I can't really say it makes her an active sidekick, but it does keep her from getting annoying and she is genuinely charming and has a lot of expression and emotion to her. I just disagree that Elizabeth is really that good of a sidekick since she doesn't really do anything other than opening doors for you (which makes her basically an extended lockpick and you need to gather lockpicks ANYWAY to use her) and tossing you ammo mid-combat, which I'll admit comes in handy but again, it doesn't really make her that useful.\n\nSo yeah, the music and voice acting is also top notch, I can't really find anything bad to say about that. All in all this game isn't GREAT or PERFECT by any stretch but it's good, really good. The story however is rather linear, there are no multiple paths (even if it's hinted at) and once you've played the game once, there's not really much reason to replay it, unless you really like playing around with different Booker builds and Vigors and stuff. I don't really feel like replaying it though since the ending kinda makes the entire game feel a bit inconsequential, which is one of my biggest pet peeves with some stories, when it kinda opts for that pussy out ending of \"this never happened\", which I won't go into any spoilers about but you'll know what I mean if you've played this game.\n\nSummary:\nGameplay: 7/10\nNothing really groundbreaking, you'll either love it or just not find it that special. I belong to the latter group on this.\nStory:8/10\nA great story but the ending for me kinda ruined any replay value and it felt very linear.\nGraphics: 10/10\nAn absolutely breathtaking game. One of the few times a game has me awed at the sheer style and smoothness of the graphics. It really takes you into a whole other world.\nSounds: 7/10\nIt's pretty average. The music is largely forgetable, though the voice acting is great. The weapon sounds could definitely have been a bit better.\n\nAverage Score: 8/10\n\nRead the full review @ [url]http://alyxxgameroom.blogspot.no/2013/06/pc-game-review-bioshock-infinite.html[/url]","timestamp_created":1389382124,"timestamp_updated":1389382124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574908614158630371","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8650499","author":{"steamid":"76561198068093380","num_games_owned":272,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":28927,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22669,"last_played":1513303911},"language":"brazilian","review":"Atualização: Fim de 2017 - Esse jogo ainda é o melhor  no gênero. \n\nO jogo de se passa em 1912, em Columbia ( diferenciando dos 2 primeiros). \nGraficos perfeitos e ressaltados (assim como seu tamanho: 40GB <Com Seasson Pass , rs)\nA mecânica de jogo, a construção da ideia, o design do conceito, a atmosfera e a ambiência.

I have over 50 hours in and have not finished yet. Ken Levine is a genius, and a perfectionist, he doesn't release games that cause problems. The game works perfectly. Elisabeth is beautiful, and becomes a real person for me. The whole game is beautiful. The graphics are perfect. The quantity of different weapons are awesome. The many plasmids (special abilities) are very creative, and fun to use. I love searching around for ammunition, gold, silver, dollars, and searching corpses for goodies also. Do not just follow the (N) arrow, search the whole area first, this is a huge open world game. Every area has easy to use vending machines, where you can buy anything you need, but choose wisely. Bioshock Infinate is a real gamers Dream. I bought it on a one day Steam Sale, and later bought Burial at sea on sale. I highly recommend both. This is the best of the Bioshock series, and a must have for all real gamers. Whether you pay the full price (worth it), or get a big discount on a Steam Sale, buy this game ! I forgot to add, that the voice acting is superb, as are all sound effects in Bioshock Infinate.","timestamp_created":1389379261,"timestamp_updated":1389999931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481166481971740723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8650015","author":{"steamid":"76561198097675925","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1545,"last_played":1417885658},"language":"english","review":"Different than the other games in the franchise, yet quite similar in a lot of ways.\nEnjoyed it alot.","timestamp_created":1389378941,"timestamp_updated":1389378941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8649908","author":{"steamid":"76561198053739519","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":716,"last_played":1489526348},"language":"english","review":"It's an action-tactical FPS with brilliant characters, an amazing story and an immersive world.
