Jeżeli ktoś grał, z pewnością chwali sobie każdą chwilę spędzona z tą grą. Po pierwsze, była oparta na rewelacyjnym silniku Source, dzięki któremu fizyka zachowuje się w grze na prawdę po profesorsku. Mimo tego, że gra ma już 8 lat - wydaje się, że minimalistyczne podejście Valve, zdaje egzamin do tej pory. Smutne ściany laboratorium Aperture Science świetnie współgrają z bijącymi po oczach portalach, które de facto sami tworzymy, a ironiczny głos GLaDOS, towarzyszący nam w trakcie gry, bardziej motywuje niż deprymuje do działania.

It was interesting to go back and see the environments from Portal 2 in their original, clean and intact state. It's moderately fun to play, with none of the puzzles being nearly as complex as it's sequel, but still holding my interest well enough. GLaDOS manages to hold her charm despite her delivery and voice being a bit more stiff (I'll atribute that to all those cores hanging off her).\n\nI have quibbles, though. It's very short, with about 4 hours being the amount of time it took me to get through this with pretty much no replay value. A few of the puzzles glitched out, and I had to restart the game to make solving the puzzle possible. The ending was fairly lackluster, with her defeat coming a bit too easily. I felt very unchallenged by this game when compared to Portal 2. As a stand alone though, it's good. I'm not horribly upset at having paid 2 dollars for 4 hours of entertainment. Any more than that, though, and I would've been miffed. Just play Portal 2, you'll get the jist. \n\nI'm sorry to say I can't recommend this title.","timestamp_created":1420012650,"timestamp_updated":1420012650,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464232087135314941","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13731316","author":{"steamid":"76561198013189743","num_games_owned":409,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":753,"last_played":1499512429},"language":"english","review":"Without hyperbole, I call this a perfect game.","timestamp_created":1420006448,"timestamp_updated":1420006448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13731161","author":{"steamid":"76561198027912287","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":783,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":696,"last_played":1563738554},"language":"english","review":"Mind blown!

If you know what to do, it's very easy to beat, but it still gives a quality experience!\n\nGameplay-9/10\nThe gameplay is very unique even years after its release. This game runs in 3D as you solve puzzles and platform using the 'Portal Gun' which allows you to form two portals that are linked to each other. Go through one portal, come out the other. Although the concept is simple, they find ways to change how it's used as you progress. You start off using portals normally, then you start using momentum to launch yourself! The game continues to give new uses for the Portal Gun until you reach end game.\n\nStory-8/10\nThe story is mostly one you have to assume. You wake up and are put through tests by a voice you can hear over intercoms or something. You don't know where you are, who you are, or even why you're there, but the game is set up linear, so you go forward. Although lacking in a 'story', the dialogue more than makes up for any questions you have as GlaDos is hilarious as she bullies you throughout the game. Without spoiling it too much (although at this point who DOESN'T know how this game ends) I consider GlaDos to be a triumph over other characters like her in other games. GlaDos doesn't have much of a 'personality' until the end, but her dialogue is witty and well written in a way that makes you feel she has emotion behind her words.\n\nEnemies-?/10\nI'm not really going to rate enemies as the only enemies in this game are adorable little turrets that attempt to shoot you full of holes. Enemies aren't the main point of this game, but rather your environment that could kill you if you mess up. YOU are your own Grim Reaper in this game and YOU are the reason you die 95% of the time.\n\nSense of Progression-10/10\nThis game is very linear. It's straighter than a meeting of homophobes. However the game never really feels repetitious. The areas all share similar colors, but the challenges change and thinking it's always the same would be a major blunder on your part. You continue to learn how to use the Portal Gun as well as your own mind and mouse. Although short, I feel like I make progress with every test chamber.\n\nGraphics-9/10\nThe graphics aren't amazing by any means, but I think Valve was aware of this when they made the game. The test chambers are simple and basic, giving you almost no 'graphics' to question, making them seem amazing. Later in the game when the environments are more colorful it's easy to see why they used this trick, but the graphics are still really good, if a bit dated.\n\nOverall-9/10\nThis game stands as one of my all time favorite puzzle games. It's short if you know what you're doing (I think I once beat it in an hour), but revisiting it from time to time is always a treat as GlaDos is a welcome voice to me. Is it fast paced? No. Is it action-packed? Not really. Is it good? I would say so. This game took something simple and made it fun. If you have the money, I recommend getting this game as it's worth getting at almost any cost.","timestamp_created":1419888022,"timestamp_updated":1419888022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13696572","author":{"steamid":"76561198114338501","num_games_owned":310,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":75,"last_played":1578780994},"language":"english","review":"I played the game for a little over and hour and i managed to complete the entire main story and also all of the more challenging versions of the test chambers...the game is extremely fun and addicting but it is quite easy and is VERY short\n","timestamp_created":1419884840,"timestamp_updated":1419884840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497100234031677246","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13696565","author":{"steamid":"76561198014183527","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1419605921},"language":"french","review":"Un super jeu, malgré sa courte durée de vie dans l'histoire solo, il vaut vraiment le coup!","timestamp_created":1419884823,"timestamp_updated":1419884823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13695409","author":{"steamid":"76561197988392568","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":1314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1302,"last_played":1414627911},"language":"english","review":"A fun and original puzzle game.","timestamp_created":1419881633,"timestamp_updated":1419881633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13694902","author":{"steamid":"76561198076146507","num_games_owned":256,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":119,"last_played":1420143153},"language":"english","review":"Portal is not a bad game its actualy prety good but its short (I beat it in one sitting).\nBTW Buy Portal 2 its much better.
