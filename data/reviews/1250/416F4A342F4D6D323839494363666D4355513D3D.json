While there are normal solo and objective mode along with mods, the real value comes from multiplayers as this game's main value is through co-op.\n\nThis game have 5 difficulties:\nBeginner (Every zeds drop like flies if you hit them enough)\nNormal (A bit more challenge, needs slightly more coordination between teams, but spam and pray method still works)\nHard (A more difficult challenge, needs better coordination between teams, spam and pray method is not so effective anymore, even level 6s can die pretty quick in hard)\n\nWhy do I stop here? Because the last two difficulties will be discussed later. Now... for first-timers...\n\nYou start out knowing nothing, level 0 perks, killing zeds is your priority, getting powerful guns are a chore, people (in pub games) don't give you money when you need that last $20 for an aa12 or m32 grenade launcher, you spam and pray hoping that those big monsters will die. How come my nade didn't work when the siren screams?\n\nYou went on to play in normal, zeds are harder, that big glowy guy along with that chainsaw dude eat you alive, the patriach kills you like you are nothing. At this point, majority of first-timers went back to beginner, stayed in normal or hard difficulty and very rarely went up to the last two difficulties. Now, this is the point where most players do not continue playing. I have to say that because:\n\n- It takes a lot of commitment to be good in this game, a lot of grinding perks (getting those medic heals, headshots, stalker kills), repetitive maps, even the old status of the game does play a part (as it is 5+ years old which in gaming industry it can be considered a bit out-dated) along with KF2 coming out in full release soon.\n\nFor those that actually stayed and grind those perks, you might finally reach a level 6 which is the highest perk level for one of the perks, finding out you can kill zeds more efficiently, less money to buy guns and ammo at trader, and killing that big glowy guy and chainsaw guy (which now you might know as fleshpounds and scrakes respectively). Nonetheless, the last two difficulties on Killing Floor can and mostly be considered as a 'filter' to see if one does actually have the will and skill it takes to survive. I myself, was a part of these players, spamming aa12 shotguns at scrakes and fleshpounds hoping they will die. But a player and a small number of other players mentioned the ineffectiveness of such methods. At this point as well, some will listen, some won't. Those who don't, will just stay in normal and hard difficulty forever, but they  will be very hard-pressed, let alone to win against the patriach, but just to survive the zed waves in higher difficulties.\n\nThen, one day, after you actually meet a player who you considered as very good (or an expert or can even be considered legends) and listens, a whole new world opens up filled with even more stuff and knowledge. This factor along with a solid teamwork (which are paramount) for the last two difficulties:\n\n- Suicidal (Even more difficult, as zed's HP and their damage goes up along with other limitations such as you can't flinch lock sc with katana, pray and spray method are detrimental. Most level 6 'eternal normal and hard-dwellers' would wipe a lot here. Some of them would just get frustrated and rage quit. The level of teamwork is a step or two up compared to hard and specific perk roles are a must)\n\nAnd once you spend hours learning from the 'expert/pro/legendary' players on multiple ways to kill sc or fp with different perks, you feel ready to take on the highest difficulty:\n\n- Hell on Earth (The highest difficulty, perks with specific roles along with solid communication and teamwork are paramount. Patriach fight is very challenging and damages that the zeds give out along with HP are more painful. One mistake on a critical point could mean an instant wipe even when you have those expert/pro/legendary players)\n\nAt this point, you learn even more ways and tactics to survive Hell on Earth and beat the patriach. Then you realised... when you went down to normal and hard, it becomes almost too easy and people start to notice you killing fp in seconds before it even reaches the team. Before you know it, you are that 'expert' player. \n\nIt needs to be noted that the learning curve goes up exponentially from Hard to Suicidal because the multitude of skills, abilities, and knowledge learned to survive there. If you managed to read and keep on going till this point, congratulations because you are part of the top 5% of Killing Floor players.\n\nThen.. does it end there? When you finally got all the achievements (looking at you, Schneidzekk kill while falling and the one for FP in the back with dwarf axe) ? No, actually. Because there are lots of methods to kill the big zeds (sc, fp and patriach). When you rejoice at the fact that you are finally able to properly lock the patriach with the katana/machete/knife/welder/syringe and dance around it as it tried to chain guns you, you find out there is actually a tournament... with teams all over the world trying to beat each other with the fastest time!\n\nYou took the initiative and form a team with your other expert/pro/legendary friends from different countries, you practice, find faster camp spots, certain tactics as you improved your individual and teamwork skills even more. You also find that your teammate's skills as a whole have developed significantly as well, so much that it would not be possible in a normal setting. Strategies are formed, discussions, insults, banters are made. Gathering people for practice is a chore (It really is!), and giving time for yourself to practice locking patriach with katana.
