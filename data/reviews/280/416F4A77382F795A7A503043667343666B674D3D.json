Öncelikle yapımın, orijinal oyundan senaryo bazında hiçbir farkı olmadığını söylemem gerek. Yine de kısa bir değinmem gerekirse, hikâyemiz Black Mesa adı verilen gizli bir tesiste başlıyor. Gordon Freeman isminde bir MIT profesörünü canlandırdığımız bu başarılı kariyer, yanlış giden bir deney sonucu yerle bir oluyor ve Xen adı verilen öte-evren'den içerisinde bulunduğumuz tesise yoğun bir uzaylı istilası başlıyor. Anlayacağınız üzere, bu tesisten kurtulup olanları tüm dünyaya, tüm şeffaflığıyla anlatmak için elimizden gelen her şeyi yapacağımıza ekip arkadaşlarımıza söz veriyoruz. Bu sayede dönemin en sevilen oyun karakterlerinden birisi, Gordon Freeman efsanesi doğmuş oluyor. Diğer noktalarda mekaniksel olarak farkları olsa da hemen hemen aynı hissiyatı veriyor diyebilirim. Kıssadan hisse anlayacağınız şey, yapımın orijinal oyundan tek ama tek farkı iyileştirilmiş grafikleri. Bunların dışında oyun hakkında eleştiri yapmak istiyorum zira gerçekten hak ediyor. Ulan, orijinalde gayet sorunsuz çalışan bir yapımı, sadece grafiklerini iyileştirmeye çalışırken nasıl bozdunuz merak ediyorum gerçekten. Sırf bu yüzden oyundan daha doğrusu yapımdan soğudum. Buglar ve hatalar bir yana dursun, oyunun yükleme süreleri öyle artmış ki sanırsınız 2022 yapımı bir oyunu HDD ile açmaya çalışıyor gibiyim. Her neyse, bu konuda daha fazla eleştirip içimde yatan Half-Life fanını canlandırma niyetinde değilim. Velhasıl, eğer oyun içerisinde yer alan hatalara katlanabilirim diyorsanız deneyin fakat bu tip olaylar sizleri irite ediyorsa hiç bulaşmayın derim. Her ne kadar serinin bende manevi bir değeri olsa da bu yapımı maalesef tavsiye edemiyorum.\n\nDaha fazla inceleme için;\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/28040015[/b]","timestamp_created":1640028388,"timestamp_updated":1659070491,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106173854","author":{"steamid":"76561199059535307","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1640386340},"language":"english","review":"you play as walter white","timestamp_created":1640017251,"timestamp_updated":1640017251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106153826","author":{"steamid":"76561198802975243","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":77,"last_played":1644189053},"language":"spanish","review":"es como si el motor de half life 2 \"\"soucer\"\" tuviera un hijo con half life 1, y tiene un pobrema cereblar, este es el resuntado:","timestamp_created":1639988414,"timestamp_updated":1651992905,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106145041","author":{"steamid":"76561198430119967","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":305,"last_played":1639971450},"language":"spanish","review":"good boenardo clasico de clasicos","timestamp_created":1639971979,"timestamp_updated":1639971979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106137133","author":{"steamid":"76561198255308112","num_games_owned":247,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":711,"last_played":1512613340},"language":"english","review":"I made a severe lapse in my judgement playing through this trash.","timestamp_created":1639958690,"timestamp_updated":1639958690,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106114068","author":{"steamid":"76561199207614351","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1658144127},"language":"russian","review":"Первый халф лайфыч прикольный конечно...\nЕсть некоторые баги, лаги и т.д.

I would not suggest to play this game without it and this review was written to compare OG Half Life to the Source port with this mod.\n\nValve really came ahead of the bunch, releasing a remaster of an older a game, porting assets to a newer, more capable and robust engine, before remasters became a thing. The idea is great on paper, but in reality it turned out messy, and I'm being polite here. You can watch reviews online on why that is and why you should not touch this game even with a 10 foot pole.\n\nBut what if I told you that you can actually play it and not suffer from all those issues? Thanks to a \"Fixed\" mod, the game is somewhat glitch-free, apart from some stuff (the mod has a document of issues that were not fixed). The game has crashed on me 3-4 times (not much more than the original does for me) and there was one time that my save got corrupted, but since I do quick saves all the time, that was not a big deal. I also did not read the document about what's not fixed, so I had the most raw possible experience.\n\nLet's talk positive. The game looks genuinely nicer! It feels like the game was not released in 1998, more like 2001, maybe 2002. New water and particle effects stand out especially. Some of the environments look much more vibrant, lively and even natural (especially the canyon section). The Source engine also introduced ragdoll physics, which makes the game feel much newer, too, but you can still blow up people like you used to in the original. I played with HD models enabled (which I might get shot for doing so), but you can always disable them, if you wanted to (requires a restart, sadly). Some of the models were given a visual quality bump, it feels like. Grenades actually look like grenades, M16 looks darker and the revolver is not shiny like it was left out in polishing for decades. Everything looks subtly better, and you will mostly notice differences when played side by side with original game or if you've played the original a bunch of times.\n\nNow, the negatives/issues. Mind you, I played the game on hardest difficulty, so some of the issues seemed more pronounced because of that. First of all, the elephant in the room, the SMG/M16. The \"camera shake\" is still present, but the gun seem to be a bit more accurate to compensate for that. If you are not aware, during longer bursts, for some reason, Valve decided to artificially add recoil to the gun, which makes your camera go up and down in unpredictable manner. First of all, why up and... DOWN? It would be easier to compensate for if it was going only up, even more so if it was predictable. It's just all over the place.\n\nIt seems like some of the scripted scenes are still mildly broken. They feel like they are delayed for couple of seconds, for some reason, and NPC's (both hostile and friendly) seem to react to your presence when they shouldn't.\n\nNow let's talk combat. First of all, enemies are all bullet sponges (hard difficulty, duh), but since when marines can take a crossbow bolt without dying? Same for vorts, actually. Houndeyes have broken hitboxes (don't even try hitting anything other than eyes) and controllers are the worst offenders. For some reason, once they see you, they will instantly start flying to you head on, which they didn't do in original. That took me of guard, but I kept playing, since I could take a difficulty spike like this, even though the game felt substantially harder (I was almos always out of something: be it ammo or health and/or HEV suit charge). What I couldn't take is how broken the hitboxes were on both Gonarch and Nihilanth. Both took all almost all my ammo to kill and made me resort to hivehand, which, by the way, still restores ammo while holstered, but you get +1 ammo icon every time it restores when you're holding it and, when you holster it while not full and you're not holding it, you will only get full ammo ~1 second after you get it back from the inventory, showing you the amount of ammo you left it with. Jank.\n\nBack to Xen bosses. They almost made me pull my hair out, they took me much more time than they used to in original, even on Hard. During Nihilanth I actually took the portals to get the ammo necessary to kill him (which I almost never do, since I have enough before the fight anyway), and never in my life I though that the way to finish him is to throw a C4 into his head and blow it up (never did that in my life, firing from the ground was always enough before).\n\nThese are the issues that came from the top of my head as more memorable ones. There are couple more little quirks I have forgotten because of how insignifficant they were, but they are still there, nonetheless.\n\nIn conclusion, even with the mod, the game is more of a novelty, really, an answer to a \"What if?\" question.  I still enjoyed all of the game, Half Life is still Half Life, even if you give it couple of crowbar hits. If you prefer more glitchless experience and don't mind a bit older graphics, play the original. If you are fine with some bugs, crashes and glitches and prefer a bit better looking image overall, play HL: Source with a \"Fixed\" mod. Recommended.\n\nPsst, if you want to experience an amazing-looking Half Life experience on newer Source engine, without the glitches and with MUCH better graphics? Look no further than Black Mesa. It's an awesome remake made by fans, which was actually made in response to Half Life: Source and how badly made it was.","timestamp_created":1639438170,"timestamp_updated":1639438170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.637056529521942139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105784458","author":{"steamid":"76561199124179163","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4951,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4840,"last_played":1640473773},"language":"english","review":"cool","timestamp_created":1639429646,"timestamp_updated":1639429646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105763352","author":{"steamid":"76561198427396415","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":383,"last_played":1660587509},"language":"polish","review":"dla mnie spoko","timestamp_created":1639401590,"timestamp_updated":1639401590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105763177","author":{"steamid":"76561198285102799","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1639322522},"language":"russian","review":"Отвратительная версия первой халвы в которую тяжёло играть.

Any sane person knows that it takes more than a CTRL+C / CTRL+V to port a game this huge to another engine. I tried to like this, but the silly errors made me wonder why I was still punishing myself with this utter failure if I could simply install the original (and still amazing) Half-Life.\n\nPerhaps the graphics, one might say? Nah, the original doesn't look too bad, especially in this era of retro games that look purposely outdated. So, this leaves Half-Life: Source as an outdated port full of annoying glitches and no expansion packs (namely, Opposing Force and Blue Shift). There's absolutely no reason for someone to buy/play this game when the original is still available and kicking.\n\nThe Source engine fuels lots of amazing games out there: Left 4 Dead 1 and 2, Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: GO, to name a few. It's a shame that the technology got a black sheep this bad, but if you're stuck with Half-Life: Source and can't return it, then you might as well try to get the most of it by downloading a community mod such as HL: Source Remastered.","timestamp_created":1639009409,"timestamp_updated":1639559795,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.728947639465332031","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105485983","author":{"steamid":"76561198300786414","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":303,"last_played":1608329830},"language":"english","review":"this games blows, it isn't uno.","timestamp_created":1638998695,"timestamp_updated":1638998695,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105476079","author":{"steamid":"76561198123045336","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1007,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1007,"last_played":1638986382},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego FPS definitivo.
