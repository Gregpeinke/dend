Digo esto porque creo que blue shift es mas justo y tiene un poco mas de sentido con respecto a opposing force ya que en este shepard avanza sin realmente saber a donde solo donde le guia el camino mientras que en este...\nHISTORIA\n...Barney, el protagonista de este juego avanza con un poco mas de sentido que es encontrar al doctor Rosenberg que le ayudara a escapar de Black Mesa donde iremos combatiendo soldados y alienigenas Xen lo cual me lleva a esto que es un problema, en el Half Life original los policias no duraban nada y tenian muy poca punteria pero este NO, porque, bueno no se sabe tenemos que suponer que Barney es el policia elegido o algo asi pero...ña no importa.\nGAMEPLAY\nBueno te la resumo ya que es como en mis otras reseñas: Es igual de buena que el de Half Life y Opposing Force (y en parte del 2).\nDIFICULTAD\nEs muy buena comparada con la de Opposing Force que esa era injusta en tema de recursos, esta es mucho mejor en tema de recursos el unico tema es que compara con Opposing Force esta no cambia nada ya que no tiene ni nuevas armas ni nuevos villanos pero es divertido, eso si no es tan buena comparada con Half Life y su secuela.\nCONCLUSION \nHalf Life Blue Shift considero que (talvez) sea la mejor expansion de todas ya que aca tenes un objetivo y no es tan injusta como Opposing Force, si tiene errores como bugs y que hay momentos en los que como Opposing Force es injusto.\n Pero este tiene una buena historia y te la recomiendo completamente, a cierto le quita puntos el error del mouse pero ya explique como arreglarlo en mi reseña de Opposing Force y aparte este juego no revoluciono tanto como Opposing Force en tema de armas y enemigos.\nCALIFICACION\n\n\nHalf Life Blue Shift: 8","timestamp_created":1604586748,"timestamp_updated":1604586748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78765745","author":{"steamid":"76561198367369210","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189,"last_played":1604585989},"language":"turkish","review":"Half-Life 'tan daha çok eğlendim.Kısa ve güzel bir oyundu.","timestamp_created":1604586039,"timestamp_updated":1604586039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78759510","author":{"steamid":"76561198345688421","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":113,"playtime_forever":702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":702,"last_played":1651267116},"language":"russian","review":"Наконец то появился внятный сюжет.
