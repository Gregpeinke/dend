Out of all the games I have played I can't really immerse myself in them as much as I can in Half Life 2. It may not be perfect and it might not have aged too well but still whenever I play this game I feel like I am a part of the world. Most of the things you see around you can be interacted with, not just in combat. In my opinion the best parts of the game are the more mundane ones, like the puzzles or the road trips or walking around the various resistance bases. Although the game is very linear it never feels that way, the level design works in a way that makes you feel like you are exploring the whole world for yourself even though you're simply taking the path the developers wanted you to take.\n\nIf you like atmospheric and immersive single player games don't hesitate to give Half Life 2 a shot if you haven't played it already.","timestamp_created":1479948696,"timestamp_updated":1479948696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26966646","author":{"steamid":"76561198047750544","num_games_owned":329,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":537,"last_played":1427751091},"language":"english","review":"Pretty dang good","timestamp_created":1479948596,"timestamp_updated":1479948596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504504501819610596","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26966411","author":{"steamid":"76561198236650394","num_games_owned":327,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":169,"last_played":1594596010},"language":"brazilian","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1479948542,"timestamp_updated":1479948542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26965513","author":{"steamid":"76561198122490689","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":933,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":538,"last_played":1518816916},"language":"spanish","review":"Me encanto\nObra Maestra","timestamp_created":1479948327,"timestamp_updated":1479948327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26965348","author":{"steamid":"76561198156540903","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":988,"last_played":1565676521},"language":"english","review":"They put something in the water, to make you forget.

Nicht nur Armbrust und MP, sondern auch ein Gravitron (mit der man Objekte anziehen und abstoßen kann) und zahme Aliens u.a. stehen bereit.\n\nDie Gegner sind durchaus (auf unterschiedliche Weise) clever und erfordern teil schnelle, zielsichere Reaktionen oder geschicktes, vorsichtiges Vorgehen.\n\nSpäter haben wir sogar rebellische Mitstreiter an unserer Seite, die uns beim Kampf etwas unterstützen. Manchmal stehen sie uns aber auch im Weg, sind aber immer höflich zu uns, den von ihnen vererhrten Gordon Freeman. Das ist manchmal schon etwas peinlich. Aber sauer werde ich, wenn sie dieem Held der Rebellion dann daran erinnern, dass er doch bitte sein Magazin nachladen soll (ich lade nach, wenn es mir passt). Aber gut, die armen Seeln, sterben eh' alle früher oder später im heroischen Kampf gegen die Aliens und wir kämpfen dann doch wieder eine Weile alleine.\n\nZum Glück (für mich) bleibt es dennoch ein FPS. Wir müssen unserem Team keine taktischen Anweisungen geben oder mehrere Personen steuern. Dabei müssen wir fast immer auf der Hut sein, denn besonders im Häuserkampf kann hinter jeder Ecke, jeder Tür und jedem Fenster ein Gegner lauern. Da ich (beim ersten Mal) nicht weiss, was mich erwartet, habe ich allzuoft gerade die falsche Waffe in der Hand und bin ziemlich am werkeln, die Gegner nieder zu machen. Oft helfen auch Granaten, die man aber auch erst mal ins Ziel befördern muss. Andererseits kann man fast immer irgendwo Munition, Medipacks und Energie finden, so dass man oft genug durch einen Schlamassel kommt ohne zu sterben.\n\nStirbt man doch, wird standardmäßig der letzte Spielstand geladen. Es gibt viele Kontrollpunkte, wo automatisch gespeichert wird. Man kann aber auch ein Quicksave oder explizites Savegame anlegen. Sehr komfortabel.\n\nDie Grafik ist (auch heute noch) ansprechend.\n\nDie Steuerung ist sehr gut und (im Vergleich zu HL) präzise(r) und nirgendwo mehr hakelig. Gordon läuft im Normalfall zügig. Zum Rennen verbraucht er Energie, ebenso für eine Taschenlampe und zum Tauchen. Spielerisch ist das in Ordnung, weil wir so etwas haushalten müssen.\n\nPro & Contra:\n+ Spannender FPS\n+ Lange Spieldauer\n+ Abwechslungsreiche Level\n+ Wiederspielreiz hoch\n+ Gute Steuerung\n\no Ansprechende Grafik\n\n- (Nichts, außer die dummen Hinweise unserer Rebellenfreunde \"Nachladen, Dr. Freeman\")\n\nWertung: 10/10\n\nDas Spiel setzt(e) Maßstäbe im Bereich FPS und ist zurecht äußerst positiv bewertet.\n","timestamp_created":1479944341,"timestamp_updated":1479944341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505642473697662354","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26946572","author":{"steamid":"76561198008780299","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":990,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":990,"last_played":1452817340},"language":"english","review":"....just shut up and let them take your money...\nplay it","timestamp_created":1479944265,"timestamp_updated":1479944265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26945835","author":{"steamid":"76561197970966891","num_games_owned":597,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1306,"last_played":1558804952},"language":"english","review":"Hands down the best game ever.","timestamp_created":1479944119,"timestamp_updated":1479944119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26945759","author":{"steamid":"76561198107790956","num_games_owned":802,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1307,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":856,"last_played":1600049352},"language":"english","review":"Please in Gabe Newell name make Half Life 3","timestamp_created":1479944102,"timestamp_updated":1479944102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26945675","author":{"steamid":"76561198099595583","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":658,"last_played":1585412884},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life 2-Это легендарная игра!!!
