I own alot of games such as far cry,tomb raider,saints row and many others and yet I'm still attracted to this game. Sure this is a normal FPS game which is very common but this game is very different in it's aspects,gameplay,team cooperation and mechanics\n\nFirst thing out,this is a team HORROR game and trust me it's a very good horror at that. I usually get scared by the spawns of the ZEDs as they spawn infront of me or worse,I walk into the middle of the group spawns. Sure it's annoying but that will teach me a lesson for wandering about. The ZEDs themselves have an amazing and terrifying design,from the small and puny clots to the godly fleshpounds. The design of the maps is very dark and gloomy which adds to the ambiance and scenic of the game. It gives that extra spooky effect. And if it is too dark for you,turn up the brightness. But beware if your playing on low brightness hehehe, that glowing yellow object? Stay away from it.\n\nSecond things is by m far my favourite and that is teamwork. Wait you don't know what team work is? Well stopping running around the map quuick-scoping people. But seriously this game really recommends teamwork to aid in your survival. This however still depends on your team mates. Bad and selfish team? Instant death. Good and caring team? Instant win. \n\nI should also touch up on the perk system. There are seven main perks which are \nField Medic-Focuses on healing team mates and keep them alive as well as your self. Your the most tankiest class so its good if you take the damage for your team.\nSupport specialist-Focuses on taking out the big guys mainly.\nSharpshooter- Clears thrash (Small ZEDs) and big guys too.\nFirebug-Not the best class, it is good for thrash clearing but if you love fire,then this is one for you.\nDemolitionist-BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!! Who wouldn't love this class? Explosive and focuses on killing big guys as well as BLOWING EVERY SINGLE LAST ZED TO PIECES!!!!!\nBerzerker- The melee guys for those who like it up close and personal( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Your sword is your friend, guns? Ew who wants that. You will love running around the map and kill the ZEDs and most fun is when you tackle on the big guys.\nCommando-another meh perk but i wouldn't say it is that bad. Their main focus is clearing thrash and being A FUCKING ASSHOLE AND STEALING MY FUCKING SCRAKE AND FLESHPOUND KILLS!!!!!! But if you love rifles then knock yourself out with this one.\nThese perk have a max level of 6, wait 6? That's it? Don't worry pal,the way to level up is so hard you rather play the game then focus on leveling up. I have 200 hours on this game and i only have 3 level 6. That's alot to learn from that statement.\n\nLastly,ay ay don't sleep on me yet man. This is the last point. The last thing you can do on this game is solo and earn achivements. WAIT,WAIT!! DON'T COME NEAR ME. I KNOW I SAID TEAMWORK IS IMPORTANT HEAR ME OUT FIRST! Solo is very fun and very scary. The reason being is because YOUR THE ONLY ONE ALIVE. And if you die well,game over man you gotta start a new map and from scratch again. But hey thats the fun part. Dying over and over again is annoying from my experience but that is the best part. You'll die and think maybe if i had done that i would have survived. Or maybe if i done that i would still die but killed most of the ZEDs. So when you die you'll think of what you could or could not have done to survive. And there are tons of achivements so you won't feel bored and you will have something to do. \n\nUh one more thing hehe. SHUT THE FUCK UP I'M ALMOST DONE! The one bad thing about this game is the servers. THERE ARE TONS OF THEM. But good luck finding the one in your region hahaha.\n\nAlso one more thing to point is the DLC. Yes i know they are very expensive but don't worry. There are mostly gun and weapon DLC and won't affect the gameplay at all. I only own the neon character pack and no weapon DLC and the game still feels the same. (I'm getting more DLC in the future so stfu)\n\nSo in conclusion killing floor is indeed a very good game. And horror game. I highly recommend the game to those who are considering to get it. The graphics may not look good but trust me the gameplay is fantastic. The community is honestly dying and i don't want this to be a dead game. Most of the members are moving on to killing floor 2 because it is more \"MODERN\". So I'm saying this again, this is a wonderfull 2009 game and you will love it if you out your heart to it.\n\nThanks for reading and i hope you enjoy killing floor the same way i do.\n","timestamp_created":1489628244,"timestamp_updated":1489628244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57617640495300293","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30528685","author":{"steamid":"76561198136292385","num_games_owned":515,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1261,"last_played":1531323573},"language":"english","review":"Honestly to me this game is pretty fun, sure it has a lot of extra content that is locked unless you buy the pack for them, but really you can play the game well without them, it's not so that the game is extremely hard to play it without needing to spend some extra money on weapon packs, ya just need to build up you're perks, and it is worth noting that I mostly played this game offline so I do not know to terrbily much about the online Community, but they seem helpful for the most part","timestamp_created":1489599409,"timestamp_updated":1489599409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30514578","author":{"steamid":"76561198111324942","num_games_owned":387,"num_reviews":128,"playtime_forever":348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":348,"last_played":1489877971},"language":"english","review":"ggggg","timestamp_created":1489525358,"timestamp_updated":1489525358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30502894","author":{"steamid":"76561198086003774","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2607,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2224,"last_played":1555496898},"language":"english","review":"Jordan English is a lazy server owner","timestamp_created":1489472962,"timestamp_updated":1489472962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30495228","author":{"steamid":"76561197998129645","num_games_owned":287,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3263,"last_played":1489424129},"language":"danish","review":"Great game.","timestamp_created":1489430991,"timestamp_updated":1489430991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30493134","author":{"steamid":"76561198083825197","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":86867,"playtime_last_two_weeks":151,"playtime_at_review":64038,"last_played":1659883729},"language":"russian","review":"Что это в нем светится???","timestamp_created":1489422697,"timestamp_updated":1562370972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508050084114074707","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30482462","author":{"steamid":"76561197997529945","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":87,"playtime_forever":18526,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18482,"last_played":1513964072},"language":"english","review":"I got this game on day 1 way back once upon a time, getting it at 15$ for preordering rather than 20$. I had a good run with this game, I did. So much so that trying to talk about it generally might lead to long rambling nostalgia fueled reminesces that could give your grandpa a run for his money. So I'll skip to the point.\n\nPROS:\n+Some of the best gunplay I've seen in a game. The original cast of guns all felt superb- the sounds were crisp and unique to each weapon, the animations concise and you could practically feel the power in the stronger guns.  \n+The soundtrack, presentation and goofy character bios (and of course, the voices, more on that) all lend itself to feeling like some kind of ScyFy channel knockoff of 28 Days later. This is a good thing, because I love my schlock movies. \n+ Good map designs, coupled with a nomadic need to find the weapons trader lend themselves to a lot of fluid, everchanging encounters in each playthrough. You'll never really get bored of any of the maps.\n+ A wonderful cast of cloned, cannibalistic freaks leads to a memorable bestiary that are all equally threatening. You'll learn to hate and fear them in time...\n+...And eventually overcome them and dominate them, thanks to a great leveling system. In the first few weeks of release, most players could barely make it to the final boss, let alone survive him. A year down the line, everyone had some maxed out perks and what started as a survival horror became a European Exterminator simulator. From just trying to get a double barreled shotgun, to fearlessly pumping a whole round of AA12 into a Fleshpound at point blank and watching that fucker gib big time.\n+ The wonderful, cheesy voice actors. From the classic original two dudes, to the female voices that are just half assed high pitched versions of said originals, there's a certain charm to it all that will have you readily adopting lower end Cockneye slang as a ready part of your vocabulary. \n+Map support means no shortage of modding content.\n+ I'm not sure if things have changed, but this game easily had the nicest playerbase in any online game I had played. Players almost always were supportive, coordinated, often comedic and quick to lend you some dosh. I think the only exception to this was one rather unfortunate incident on some server with friendly fire enabled, some Crawlers and a fire axe. Really unfortunate.\n\nCONS\n- The holiday events, while novel, tend to overstay their welcomes. I remember the first time the Christmas edition came out it lasted till nearly a month after said holiday. \n- I'm a grizzled purist that prefered the simplicity of the original arsenal of weapons for each class. That each readily fulfilled a different role and a lot of the subsequent updates saw a lot of weaponry that was at best redundant and at worst leaves you struggling to grab the weapon you're actually looking for when there's only 5 seconds left before the shop closes and FUCK\n-This game is 8 years old, it really doesn't need to still cost 20$. Granted, if you're like me, you will still easily get your 20$ worth out of it, but come on. \n-You will eventually have to move on from this game and live a life as an adult with responsibilities and priorities. I want to be 16 again and I can't and that makes me sad.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nUnlike a lot of people here I still like KF2 despite some of it's flaws, but if you're new to the games, this is absolutely the place to begin. This was the game I thought Left 4 Dead was gonna be but wasn't. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.\n\nAnd be sure to avoid any server with friendly fire enabled like the plague.","timestamp_created":1489365560,"timestamp_updated":1489366057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30461193","author":{"steamid":"76561198085743351","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":112332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":83595,"last_played":1658713932},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom!","timestamp_created":1489287298,"timestamp_updated":1489287298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579288065433502197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30425750","author":{"steamid":"76561198343835368","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":561,"last_played":1494281105},"language":"english","review":"best gameplay ever seen in my life thx bros","timestamp_created":1489152201,"timestamp_updated":1489152201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501537024974822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30410275","author":{"steamid":"76561198196784351","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":588,"last_played":1631862352},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen Juego :D","timestamp_created":1489073931,"timestamp_updated":1489073931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30394961","author":{"steamid":"76561198039888663","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6962,"last_played":1633691471},"language":"turkish","review":"süper","timestamp_created":1488994678,"timestamp_updated":1488994678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30389449","author":{"steamid":"76561198146331669","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":18816,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10370,"last_played":1625774885},"language":"russian","review":"В игре много всего интересного : Перки , зомби , прокачка перков , карты , очивменты и т.д.

Люди начали уходить из фирмы, и тогда он попросил оставшихся модифицировать его. И в итоге он стал \"Патриархом\"(финальный босс)\nПосле этого наподения на Великобританию , были посланы 6 человек на зачистку местности , и уничтожение Кевин Кламели( его фото можно увидеть на карте офис)\nНу как-то так)\nИз плюсов игры я хочу выделить:\n-Атмосферу, здесь она жуткая и в таком духе стимпанка)\n-Не маленькое разнообразие оружий ,ну в отличии от поджигателя..\n-Интересный гимплей , он однообразный , но как и Dota2 , CS она затягивает своей однообразностью)\n-Множество карт , как и официальные ,так и созданные в мастерской\n-DLC , около 30 скинов (+базовые ,и за достижение) , 3 пака новых оружий(остольные просто скины на оружие)\n-Уровни сложности , по началу играешь на лёгких , потом привыкаешь к \"Ад на земле\" \n-Перки, их тут 7 , как по мне самые полезные это--> Техник, Снайпер, Подрывник, Медик..\nУ каждого класса есть своя цель\n1.Снайпер- убивать больших зомби Скрейк, Отбивальщик\n2.Техник- у некого подобная роль , но его цель сдерживать стадо зомбей (т.к дробовики бьют по облости)+ быстро заваривает двери\n3.Командос- его цель убивать всякую мелочь, Клоты, Сталкеры, Берсерки , Ползуны , Толстяки\n4.Медик- лечение товарищей , с помощью шприца, оружий с иньекторм и лечебных гранат\n5.Поджигатель- уничтожение больших толп, у него общая цель с Техником и Командос\n6.Подрывник- уничтожение больших толп , но без помощи товарищей он безполезен( взрывы наносят себе урон)\n7.Берсеркер- он танкует и сдерживает толпы в проходе , в соло может выиграть любую игру\nНе судите строго , это мое мнение о целях классов)\n-Ко-оп , можете давать команды, делится оружием, деньгами , лечить товарищей , в общем командная игра)\nИз минусов:\nНу как по мне минусов нет ,а писать всякие мелочи я не хочу..\nНу в общем как-то так, игра интересная , всем рекомендую 10/10\nСтоит своих денег.","timestamp_created":1488019125,"timestamp_updated":1488019125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30158326","author":{"steamid":"76561198067705863","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":292,"last_played":1405961503},"language":"english","review":"I used to have a pass to this game WAYYY back and honestly, I love it!\n\nThe new zombies I am introduced to is so overwhelmingly scary but sure as hell exciting.

Although they are technically not undead, and the game consistently calls them \"specimens,\" these creatures, which travel around in hoards trying to eat people, certainly won't be offended if you mistake them for zombies. These all-but-zombies come in a variety of breeds, you can kill them with a variety of weapons, and that pretty much sums up the game. Killing Floor is satisfying in its simplicity, though the lackluster graphics are a testament to its humble beginnings as an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod. Even as a full game, it forgoes accouterments such as story, characters, and competitive multiplayer mode, yet where zombie-killing fun is concerned, it delivers in spades.\n\nGameplay in Killing Floor is simple. Slaughter a batch of specimens, buy new equipment from the trader, and repeat until you have a boss fight with \"The Patriarch,\" a nasty misanthrope with a rocket launcher, a chain gun, and the ability to go invisible. No verbose exposition, lengthy cutscenes, or half-baked attempts at character and story development are arbitrarily affixed to this pure first-person-shooter experience. From the beginning, you'll love the game's satisfying gunplay. Guns look and feel real thanks to convincing ballistics and iron sights, which make aiming both important and engaging. In addition, \"pray and spray\" is worthless on higher difficulty levels, and ammo is often sparse, so every shot counts. To survive the intense and often claustrophobic firefights, you must coordinate with your teammates and make good use of the environment, which you can accomplish by welding shut doors to create temporary choke points, forcing the creatures to fight on your terms. Furthermore, you need to try and complete each round near the trader, who moves her shop between waves (unfortunately she won't sell you her personal teleporter) and opens for business for only less than a minute each time.\n\nAt the start of each map, you must choose one of six perks that enhance your skills in certain areas and work like classes, minus the restrictions. For instance, field medics are faster at healing themselves and their teammates, whereas commandos do more damage with the assault rifle and are better at spotting invisible enemies. Regardless of which one you're playing at the time, you'll gain experience toward leveling up your perks every time you act appropriately in-game. For example, each headshot, with the right guns, counts toward the sharpshooter perk, and you earn experience for the firebug perk by roasting enemies to a crisp. When selecting a perk, you may want to look at your teammates, because although you can play with a squad full of chainsaw-wielding berserkers, a well-rounded team will increase your chance of survival.\n\nUsing an algorithm that factors in player achievements, such as long-distance kills and headshots, Killing Floor will occasionally send everyone into slow motion, aka ZED time. (The ZED stands for the same thing as the S in Harry S. Truman: nothing.) Although it can be helpful at higher difficulties, the slow motion kicks in all too often during uninspiring moments--such as when you're trying to turn around--and can become an annoyance, particularly on beginner difficulty. Another annoying situation can come up when you're trying to find and kill the final enemy in a wave. Though they generally succeed at navigating the map, creatures can occasionally become caught on something, and nothing is more frustrating than spending several minutes trying to find the last creature only to discover that it's invisible and stuck on a log 150 meters away from the trader.\n\nAlthough Killing Floor technically has both single-player and multiplayer modes, the lack of any computer teammates means that single-player is good only for playing out your Rambo V: Zombie Apocalypse fantasies. Similarly, Cooperative mode is the only gametype (sorry, competitive players), and there are only five maps, which are, to be fair, all large and nonlinear, with plenty of corners to hide in, doors to weld behind you, and settings for heroic last stands. In multiplayer, your survival depends largely on your teammates, and coordinating with them is both fun and highly advantageous. Unfortunately, ample opportunities for griefing are also available. Mischievous, or simply misguided, teammates can weld shut the door to your escape route, forcing you to choose between going out guns blazing and trying to un-weld a door while fiends chew on your innards. Even more infuriating is not being able to visit the trader because some oaf is blocking the doorway, and given that friendly fire doesn't apply, you can't even execute him or her for it.\n\nVisually, Killing Floor compares poorly with contemporary shooters, thanks to its five-year-old engine. Perhaps with this in mind, the developers went for a dark and gritty aesthetic, and when the lights are low, you won't notice how stiff the animations can be. Curiously, most of the specimens are nude, leaving you to wonder whether they rebelled against their masters due to a grossly inadequate clothing budget. The specimens come in familiar varieties, none of which look particularly great, including the zombie with the chainsaw; the zombie that goes invisible; the big, fat zombie that vomits acidic bile; and so on. The most interesting specimen is the fleshpound, a monstrosity with two meat grinders for arms and a giant yellow light on his chest that turns red when you provoke him, prompting a frenzied and deadly rampage. As far as gore is concerned, headshots provide delightful fountains of blood, and you can occasionally sever limbs, but the chainsaw feels anticlimactic. What's the point in having a chainsaw if you can't dismember zombies in a geyser of viscera that would fill the Roman Coliseum?\n\nThe sound effects are outstanding, especially for guns, and you can often use subtle sound clues to detect incoming enemies. Unfortunately, the voice acting and soundtrack don't achieve the same level of quality. To be fair, the problem with the voice acting is mostly with the script, except for the trader, who is just all-around bad. She constantly harasses you with repetitive and unappealing sexual innuendos, and the medics incessantly bleat that they are trying to heal you rather than \"shag you.\" Meanwhile, derivative, generic metal music does little to improve the tone, though it does lend itself well to blasting zombies.\n\nKilling Floor is permeated by a sense that you're having way more fun that you ought to be. It's absurd and crass, and yet you can't help but enjoy it. Maybe there is something inherently entertaining about gunning down hordes of zombies. Maybe the simple formula of fight, flight, or weld speaks to some primal part of the human brain. Whatever the reason, Killing Floor will have you gleefully decapitating monsters like the reincarnation of an ancient war god. It's just plain fun, and for only $20 you could do a lot worse.","timestamp_created":1487975594,"timestamp_updated":1487975594,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.59404599666595459","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30149207","author":{"steamid":"76561198099348369","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":212,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":129,"last_played":1471358296},"language":"russian","review":"изи
