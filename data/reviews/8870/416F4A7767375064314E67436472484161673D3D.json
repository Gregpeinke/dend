bought this game on summersale 2016 after looong consideration. I don't know why it took me such a long time X) \nI love this game. What kept drawing me back to thinking about buying it was the art, the game's really beautiful. Storywise I didn't know much else than the trailers. I hadn't played the first two BioShocks, so the universe was new to me. The story turned out to be so rich, intelligent, interesting and emotional, it made the game billion times even better and made me want to buy the first two! I didn't know it would be so storydriven and I'm glad it is! As someone who started from third BioShock, I think you can start from that, but to understand Burial at Sea dlc better I would recommed getting to know Rapture from the first two games.\nAll in all, it's a great game! I play it with a xbox 360 controller and find it comfortable to play with it. Some shooters don't play well with a controller, but i found it easy and fast to learn to be good with it. The game has also beautiful music and the downloadable content are also great!\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1480351844,"timestamp_updated":1480351844,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27967355","author":{"steamid":"76561197964465881","num_games_owned":388,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2058,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1322,"last_played":1506389905},"language":"english","review":"Still one of the best game I've ever played!","timestamp_created":1480351173,"timestamp_updated":1480351173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27967168","author":{"steamid":"76561198093082362","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":111,"last_played":1500752346},"language":"english","review":"Worth the money","timestamp_created":1480351068,"timestamp_updated":1480351068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27966512","author":{"steamid":"76561198030395155","num_games_owned":276,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1859,"last_played":1656799388},"language":"russian","review":"Ну что я могу сказать про данную игру...

Lo más increíble es que a medida que vas avanzando en los juegos que conforman la saga, te vas dando cuenta que aquellos sucesos que ocurrieron quizá en el primer juego y que en aquel momento no tuvieron mayor relevancia para ti, en Infinite cobran un sentido totalmente nuevo y adquieren una razón de ser, demostrando que la historia, desde el inicio, estaba totalmente pensada y estructurada.\n\nLa segunda gran virtud de Bioshock y la razón por la que muchos decidimos jugar a estos juegos en primer lugar, es su excelente ambientación, pasando del increíble mundo submarino estilo steampunk de Rapture en los primeros dos juegos, al hermoso estilo colonial americano de los cielos de Columbia, manteniendo un cuidado al detalle espectacular en cada rincón del juego y mostrando una mejoría gráfica substancial entre cada entrega de la saga.\n\nRespecto a la jugabilidad, los tres juegos corresponden a shooter en primera persona combinado con un sistema de poderes que usarás tanto para combatir como para avanzar en el juego, brindándote así un amplio abanico de opciones para que puedas jugar a tu propio estilo y nunca llegar a aburrirte. Tanto si te gusta combatir con poderes y fuegos artificiales, como si eres de los que les encanta gastarte hasta la última munición del revólver, te divertirás como un enano jugando a estos juegos.\n\nEl último punto que quiero tocar en esta reseña es sobre un tema que probablemente es bastante tabú en el mundillo de los videojuegos, ya que ciertamente en la mayoría de los casos son basura: me refiero a los DLCs. Para nuestra grata sorpresa, Bioshock no es el caso, todo lo contrario, probablemente los dos DLCs que conforman Burial at Sea deben ser, junto a los DLCs de Dishonored, los mejores DLCs que haya jugado alguna vez, y es que, son el perfecto cierre para una saga tan espectacular como lo es Bioshock, realmente valen cada centavo.\n\nFinalmente, sólo decir que me apena un poco que esta grandiosa saga haya terminado, pero a la vez me alegra que nos haya dejado en todo lo alto, sin rellenos, sin intentar extraer dinero de su éxito como muchas otras sagas lo han hecho, sólo entregándonos lo que nos tenía que entregar y dejando atrás un gran legado para el mundo de los videojuegos. Para mí sin duda, una obra de arte.","timestamp_created":1480314210,"timestamp_updated":1480314210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27919799","author":{"steamid":"76561198104777065","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":609,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":453,"last_played":1521966988},"language":"russian","review":"Прекрасная игра","timestamp_created":1480312580,"timestamp_updated":1480312580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27919278","author":{"steamid":"76561198030941109","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":785,"last_played":1472366989},"language":"english","review":"This game is amazing.
