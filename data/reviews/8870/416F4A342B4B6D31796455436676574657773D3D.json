The characters are all good and the graphics are breathtaking.\n\nThe gun play is good but I felt like the hook could have been made less necesary (the were part where if you weren't hanging from lane to lane it was really difficult not to die). Carrying only 2 weapons was also a bit annoying but nothing really bad. Also by the end I just wanted the gun parts to stop because after like 12 hrs of them I just wanted the story to advance.\n\nWhich takes me to the story... Oh...my...god... Even without the ending (which made my head explode) the story is amazing and the characters feel like they are real people with flaws. Anyone willing to hear me talking about this game had a lecture about the story haha I was like 2 weeks looking for videos explaining details and theories. And the fact that there are details that make sense only after the ending make the second playthrough enjoyable because of the \"Oh my god, I didn't notice that\" or \"Now this makes senses\" moments.\n\nThe gameplays has flaws (nothing major at least for me) but the amazing storyline makes up for that. This is a beautiful and interesting game that gives you a lot to talk about and discuss. 9/10 for me :).\n\n\nSPOILERS!!!!\n\nI was not expecting Elizabeth being Anna and neither Rapture being another universe's version of Columbia. All those tails in the Lutece's flipping coin board made me sad :s. Also I hope the theory of hearing the Songbird's death in Bioshock 1 is true, If this was intended since the beginning it would be 10 times more cooler.\n","timestamp_created":1467146603,"timestamp_updated":1467146603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523379385471343994","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23905027","author":{"steamid":"76561198085853170","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":692,"last_played":1586758924},"language":"english","review":"A pretty game with an engaging storyline.

There is no multiplayer for bioshock infinite but that honestly dosen't matter because the story line is so good and in detail ! also there is alot to do and explore so if it was from me and i'm sure so many others would agree with me!

I have an MSI gaming computer and it runs it at 1280x720 on Ultra settings with everything turned on and it runs at 60 and even 80 frames at times so I'm pretty sure most decent pc can run this but no problem if you haven't got a good gaming pc just turn the settings on low and the game will for sure be playable :) \n\nOverall: Stunning graphics, audio, story, gameplay and just everything about this game is amazing even so is the DLC content! \n\nI give Bioshock Infinite a big thumbs up and 10/10!
