Usa el motor unreal engine y está disponible la workshop para este juego.\n\nMi análisis lo estructurare en 5 puntos.\n\n1. Armas. Hay bastante variedad y con el paso del tiempo han ido incrementando la oferta teniendo en cuenta las sugerencias de la comunidad.\n\n2. Perks. Hay 6 perks en total, tal vez se eche en falta alguno mas, aunque los básicos de todo juego de este estilo están presentes y muy bien implementados.\n\n3. Mapas. En el estreno del juego se disponian de pocos mapas, en la actualidad el numero de mapas es bastante grande. Además hay que tener en cuenta el apoyo de la conunidad realizando nuevos mapas, lo que lo hace un juego con una diversidad de entornos muy grande.\n\n4.Eventos. Este es mi punto favorito, Tripwire Interactive apuesta con realizar eventos que suelen coincidir con los periodos de Navidades, Halloween, Verano. Aprovechan para sacar nuevos mapas, incluso en el último año han llegado a implementar unos mapas por objetivos (lo cual es un gran acierto). \n\nEste sin duda es el punto más fuerte del juego, ya que tras varios años de su estreno, no han abandonmado el juego en ningún momento.\n\n5. DLCs. A nadie nos gusta los dlcs, y este juego si los tiene, pero en su defensa diré que son dlcs que no influyen en el juego, se basan en skins para tus personajes y algunos diseños de armas. sin demasiada importancia.\n\nPor todos estos puntos expuestos, la compra de Killing Floor es obligada, es uno de esos juegos que te dejaran satisfecho y sentirás que has hecho una buena inversión","timestamp_created":1352899262,"timestamp_updated":1403473306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514705896377563477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"326505","author":{"steamid":"76561197968672309","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":393,"last_played":1455916612},"language":"english","review":"Very fun.

Я тогда просто не понимал, в чём крутость лефта и чем она так интересна. Поэтому я тратил время на киллинг флур больше, чем на лефт (правда на пиратке, но всё же). \n\nТеперь можно рассказать о плюсах и минусах (если они есть) игры:\n+\n-Стрельба (она мне показалась более реалистичной)\n-Физика\n-В целом геймплей (проходишь несколько волн противников, а потом валишь босса по имени Патриарх (не Кирилл к сожалению). Вроде простая схема геймплея, но боже как классно убивать здесь всякой нечести)\n-Саундтрек (больше всего мне понравились композиции группы zYnthetic)\n-Стиль игры и дизайн всего и вся (карты, оружия и т.д.)\n-Кооп (опять же в лефте мне не понравился кооп, здесь ситуация наоборот)\n-Money, Money, Money...\n\n-\n-Отсутствие сюжета и информация о мире Killing Floor\n-Графика (тогда мне было как-то насрать на эту графику, но пусть тут будет)\n\nВот что можно сказать про эту игру. Она конечно не шедевр, да и 2-ая часть в бете (выйдет наверное очень скоро), так что покупать первую часть только в том случае, если вы в неё не играли вообще и смотрите с презрением на 2-ую часть. Хотя в любом случае - попробуйте. Это один из самых адреналиновых шутеров за всё время.","timestamp_created":1352028975,"timestamp_updated":1462117955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4137510","author":{"steamid":"76561198032652933","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":13782,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7966,"last_played":1457522960},"language":"schinese","review":"好游戏","timestamp_created":1352023685,"timestamp_updated":1352023685,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6497191","author":{"steamid":"76561198067545972","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":337,"last_played":1515596835},"language":"russian","review":"Збс игра! :D\n\nОценка 10/10","timestamp_created":1352015873,"timestamp_updated":1385537326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6380523","author":{"steamid":"76561198065039337","num_games_owned":558,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":4563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2701,"last_played":1562119665},"language":"english","review":"A really fun game made in London or somewhere around that.
