It will seem hard at first (especially in solo mode) but once you get used to it, you'll be in for tons of fun! I do honestly think co-op is where the game shines its brightest, not only because it makes it easier to survive, it's because then you get to feel the magic feeling of teamwork, with players constantly sharing money, just because it helps everyone on the team out. The varying monster types are intresting to see as well, because you've got your fat zeds, crawler zeds, screaming zeds, invisble zeds, rocket-launching zeds and your normal every-day zed (there is plenty more zeds after that, but you get the gist). \n\nThere are holiday events that will happen on (who guessed it?) holidays or in the same month as the holiday. These events give you the opportunity to get a new character when you get all of the achivements, which is pretty awesome, not to mention the holiday maps that are always unique and intresting. I think the gameplay is enhanced when you play with friends, because communicating will be a lot easier and it's just fun to blast some zeds with you buddies.\n\nOverall this game is pretty sweet, but it is a good idea to buy it on sale in case you think it's a little too repetitive for your taste.\nAnd that concludes this review of this awesome zed genocide simulator.","timestamp_created":1421626589,"timestamp_updated":1421626716,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522093832492828369","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14058633","author":{"steamid":"76561198035997354","num_games_owned":565,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":3704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3704,"last_played":1397858355},"language":"english","review":"Best zombie themed co-op dosh simulator out there.\nAlso a fat stack of £20 notes can be worth £3.\n10/10 £20 notes, would toss dosh again.","timestamp_created":1421622796,"timestamp_updated":1421622796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14058240","author":{"steamid":"76561198073237285","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1102,"last_played":1498171662},"language":"french","review":"Un bon gros défouloir, gore à souhait, des classes qui plairont à tout le monde, bref, à essayer de toute urgence !","timestamp_created":1421621075,"timestamp_updated":1444831911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516971230506896973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14057808","author":{"steamid":"76561198148760230","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":10355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1899,"last_played":1504553271},"language":"english","review":"This game is extremely fun especially with friends.

A my do nich řežem a řežem ... teda střílíme, ale jednou jsem bosse rozmašíroval i motorovkou!\n\nProtože bych mohl napsat relativně dlouhou recenzi, a tato hra si ji plně zaslouží, ale takových už bylo několik, vezmu to raději v bodech:\n\n* silně kooperační hra\n* systém perků a \"skillů\"\n* stabilní UT engine\n* protivníky lze zasáhnout do různých částí těla a např. je takto omezit (těšme se na KF2)\n* jednoduché, ale účinné stupně obtížnosti\n* dostatek serverů\n* dostatek DLC pro skiny a zbraně\n* bohatá komunitní tvorba (vč. extrémů, kdy mapa i prostředí vypadá jako v Minecraftu)\n* v závislosti na období (Vánoce, Helloween, apod.) je hra autory přepnuta do zcela jiných modelů monster\n* často v brutální slevě\n* brutální násilí ...\n\n\nHru trochu kazí samotná otevřenost (proč mi to připomíná platformu Android?), kdy existuje spousta \"farming\" serverů, kde bez úhony lze svůj perk naskillovat během pár minut.

Monstra se objevují na pevně daných spawnech pro každou mapu a proto detailní znalosti mapy a umění se někde dobře vyzbrojit a \"zabukovat se\" dává vysokou šanci na přežití. S kvalitním teamem ovšem. Samotné kempení není dostačující, po každém kole se otevře na jiném místě obchod, kam je potřeba co nejrychleji doběhnout, nakoupit a zpět a po cestě tam i zpět nejlépe posbírat itemy (náboje a zbraně). Tuto hru jsem hrával v teamu s dalšími dvěma přáteli, což byl minimální počet pro to, abychom si slušně rozdělili jednotlivé perky a v boji se pak vhodně doplňovali či zastupovali. S větší obtížností hry však bylo potřeba narazit na server s dalšími zkušenými hráči, kteří byli ochotni kooperovat a buď již znaly profláklá místa nebo se s nimi dalo domluvit. Nižší obtížnosti lze hravě a zábavně hrát stylem rush, pobíhat a střílet.\n\nPS: Těšíme se na [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/232090/]Killing Floor 2[/url]\n\n[quote][h1]Líbí se Ti mé recenze?[/h1] Mohu být tvým kurátorem, stačí kliknout na [b]Sledovat tohoto kurátora[/b] (Follow) na profilu skupiny [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/somanyfails#curation]SO MANY FAILS[/url].[/quote]","timestamp_created":1421332768,"timestamp_updated":1455703753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13994688","author":{"steamid":"76561198021371091","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":37704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32236,"last_played":1586624406},"language":"russian","review":"Основным и на тот момент единственным поводом регистрации в Steam'е был релиз Killing Floor'а на физическом носителе. Конечно я и до этого был знаком с этой игрой, но когда узнал о том, что 1С планирует издать продукт на территории России - я твердо для себя решил, что куплю ее!\nНаиболее актуальными темами в последнее время являются темы выживания, постапокалипсиса и конечно - зомби. Все эти элементы включены в игру.\nВ игре предусмотрены одиночный режим и режим мультиплеера. Если бы игра обладала только первым режимом, она бы не получила такой популярности и навряд ли зацепила меня. Вся фишка в мультиплеере. В выживании в жутких условия, толпах зомби и командной игре складывается весь режим. Ошибка одного товарища по команде может повлечь за собой гибель всего отряда.\nВ игре семь классов, игра за каждый из классов разнообразна и требует навыка:\n- Медик, который, при наличии определенных навыков может за пару секунд вылечить весь отряд, который пострадал от серьезных монстров. Так же этот класс имеет определенное преимущество по урону от врагов, но в свою очередь не имеет мощного оружия, для того, чтобы наносить урон врагам.\n- Поддержка/техник - этот класс включает в себя дробовики, ружья и тому подобное оружия. На мой взгляд техник имеет наиболее мощное оружие. Да, можно сослаться на характеристики того же M99 AMR (класс: Снайпер), но при высокой скорострельности, и большого количества патронов КПД у техника при отстреливании толпы зомби, будет намного выше. Хотя все относительно. Так же техник имеет скоростное преимущество при \"заварке\" дверей. Ну и конечно огромное преимущество в переносимом весе амуниции (до 24 кг, против 15 как у все).\n- Снайпер - этот класс содержит в себе стрелковое и снайперское оружие, а также много пистолетов. Большое преимущество в игре за \"Снайпера\" имеет точность. Именно благодаря точного выстрела можно с облегчением выдохнуть, после героического выстрела \"Снайпера\" в Fleshpound'а.\n- Коммандос - это мой любимый класс. Коммандос - он же просто \"автоматчик\" специализируется, как ни странно на автоматах. Оружие данного класса позволяет иметь больше патронов, чем какое-либо из других классов. Взяв два автомата в руки не составит труда \"зачистить\" за волну сотню мутантов. Так же коммандос способен видеть Сталкеров - монстров, которые невидимые и уходят из \"инвиза\" только когда атакуют. Ну и конечно коммандос видит здоровье врагов. Все это очень хорошо и, казалось бы, идеально, но... ты можешь высадить полную обойму из двух стволов и не убить, например, Scrake. Я уж молчу про Fleshpound'а.\n- Берсеркер - это класс ближнего боя. Для меня он является самым сложным и непонятным. Несмотря на то, что я достаточно много времени провел за этот класс, я все равно удивляюсь виртуозности и навыку игры некоторых игроков, которые в одиночку могут \"затащить\" всю игру. Большим преимуществом является независимость от патронов и боеприпасов. А что могут сделать шесть берсеркеров против Патриарха...\n- Поджигатель - чем-то схожий по результату с \"Коммандосом\" класс, направленный на массовое уничтожение мутантов, но против сильных монстров еще более бесполезных, чем \"Коммандос\". Но оружие \"Пиро\" полезно на финальной волне, когда Патриарх уходит в \"инвиз\" и важно не потерять его из виду. На помощь приходит огонь.\n- Подрывник - класс полная противоположность \"Берсеркеру\", ибо имеет весьма ограниченный выбор оружия ближнего боя. Для этого класса важна дистанция. Этот класс очень выгодно использовать на финальной волне, когда вокруг магазина можно все заминировать и ждать, когда Патриарх наступит на мину.\nТак или иначе каждый класс уникален и баланс игры не нарушен тем или иным классом. Конечно в командной игре нужны все, и каждый выполняет свою роль: кто-то слаб против мощных противников, а кто-то делает один выстрел в 7 секунд, но зато наверняка. Это командная игра и здесь не получится играть \"каждый за себя\". В этом игра и привлекает мое внимание до сих пор. А я уже играю в нее более 5 лет. В Steam'е же игра с середины 2009 года, и она регулярно обновляется. До сих пор! Разработчики регулярно добавляют карты, скины персонажей и новые виды оружия. Да, игра давно не \"фиксится\" и не модифицируется, но это потому что с этим разработчики закончили еще пару лет назад.\nСейчас я с нетерпением ожидаю Killing Floor 2, а сам тем временем \"добиваю\" недостающие достижения в игре.\nНадеюсь, что Tripwire Interactive отлично справится со своей задачей и заставит меня провести в их новой игре не одну сотню часов!","timestamp_created":1421329251,"timestamp_updated":1421329251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561752974987030029","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13994580","author":{"steamid":"76561198016932802","num_games_owned":302,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":23915,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21223,"last_played":1489545737},"language":"spanish","review":"killing floor si señor...\nun titulo para recordar siempre, cuando eres principiante se te puede hacer pesado y dificil de no morir, pero cuando eches tres partidas ya estaras enganchado.

The fact that this game is generally focussed on (but not limited to) multiplayer and teamwork is what makes it that much more enjoyable. Why face hordes of endless flesh-eating creatures alone, when you can share the fun of burning them, blowing them up and hacking them apart with a team?

They can do so many wonders for the team while doing what they do best! \nSupport Specialist:\nThis guy is armed with the CQB (Close Quarter Combat) Gear like shotguns and such. These guys can really pack a punch!\nSharpshooter:\nIf your like me you'll aim for the head most of the time. So why not become a Sharpshooter? These can really help the team even if they can't do a thing. \nCommando:\nThese are your average Run'n Gun guys. Packed with Assault Rifles they can really help the team if they know what they are doing.\nBerserker:\nThese guys are maniacs. They have an wide array of melee weapons which can really do some damage if they can get enough support from the team when needed.\nFirebug:\nDo you like paying with fire? If so the Firebug is for you! These guys run around with weapons modified to do damage and also to burn things.\nDemolition:\nThese guys are like miners, with guns. These guys can set off things that can be unbelievable! They can also kill things much easier with the right weapons.\n\nPicking a perk is easy but picking the weapons can be quite challenging sometimes. But finding the right team is perfect. If you know how to cooperate with people then this game is for you. Other than that. This game features lots of DLC content. Unless you buy the Killing Floor Bundle then you get all the DLC's for the price of 69.99! Anyways.

The developers put out a DLC now and then, but they're almost all pointless reskins that don't add anything fresh or original to the gameplay. After 200 hours you start to want some new weapons and a gold AK47 isn't actually a new weapon. The handful of new weapons they've added are ridiculous sci-fi or fantasy weapons that don't fit in with the game's theme or feel at all.\n\nThe last good additions to the game were the FAL and the .50 sniper rifle, both several years ago IIRC. The high-powered .50 added a lot of enjoyment to the game without being too unbalanced - if you're carrying it, you can't carry _anything_ else. Apparently the devs thought it was still too OP and now the ammo costs 250 pounds *per bullet*, prohibitively expensive on higher difficulties. We were actually having _fun_ again, and they utterly ruined it. Wonderful.\n\nThere are a metric fuckton of maps, but most of them are just kind of awful, too cramped to move around and generally not fun. \n\nOther than the large number of maps, the developers seem to have taken the approach of extending the game length through grinding. If you play normally, expect to spend 100 hours or more to get the Commando to level 6. That's right, each class only has 6 levels, but they can take dozens to hundeds of hours to max out. You'll be grinding like it's free-to-play but there are no shortcuts here, just lazy devs. All of the time they've have wasted on camo skins and gold skins and endless character packs could have been put into adding even one new level to each of the classes, or one new monster. No new enemies are ever added. The achievements are a grind as well, I think there are four or five achievements for each map for beating it on different difficulties and game lengths. That's really not a good way to extend the life of your game.\n\nFor the years I've been playing, the developers have never fixed the extremely common bug of the medic's healing darts not registering. About 50-75% of the healing darts you fire will hit your teammates but NOT heal them, meaning the medic's role is quickly relegated to shooting the same person over and over until the heal actually works. How fun.\n\nI haven't explored the community content much; most of the community maps are garbage so downloading and testing them is usually a waste of time.\n\nWith the team focused on Killing Floor 2 I don't expect we'll be seeing much new content for Killing Floor, not that there has been any worthwhile content besides the 3 objective maps in the last 2 years. You might as well save your money for the sequel.","timestamp_created":1421245010,"timestamp_updated":1422923690,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486804723739624023","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13982038","author":{"steamid":"76561198064427098","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":7410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4196,"last_played":1577055270},"language":"brazilian","review":"Meu jogo favorito, muita conquista, muito tiro, jogo otimo.
