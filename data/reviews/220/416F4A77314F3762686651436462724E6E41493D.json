Alyx is a badass, Eli is kind and feels like a grandpa. Everyone has their own characteristics. The story is interesting.

Pamiętam jak pierwszy raz zagrałem w HL2 jeszcze w wersji non-steam i wciągnąłem sie na wiele godzin. Ostatnio odświeżyłem sobie tą gre i byłem pod wielkim wrażeniem jak ta gra jest świetna nawet po prawie 16 latach. Genialnie skonstruowana rozgrywka, która nie nudziła mnie ani przez chwile wraz z wykorzystaniem innowacyjnego i niedoścignionego silnika fizycznego. Jeśli nie słuchamy ciekawych dialogów poprzedzających fabułe, to prawdopodobnie walczymy z ciekawymi przeciwnikami lub rozwiązujemy jakąś zagadke logiczną, jeździmy pojazdem lub dowodzimy oddziałem. Każda acryciekawa akcja przechodzi płynnie w drugą. Jeszcze pare słów o fabule, które jest dobrze napisana, na początek trafimy do City 17 wzorowanego na miastach bloku wschodniego, opanowanego przez kombinat i tak zaczyna sie nasza przygoda. Nie chcę spoilerować wam jej ale moge powiedzieć że jest bardzo ciekawa, trafiamy na ciekawe postacie jak np. urocza Alyx Vance, Eli, Doctor Kleiner czy Dog, czyli metalowy pies :3. Troche szkoda że zakończenie nie daje tyle satysfakcji jakbyśmy tego chcieli (ale na szczęście są jeszcze dwa epizody, które może dla was zrecenzuje). Grafika jest ładna, chociaż nie aż taka jak np. w pierwszym Far Cry, ale styl graficzny drugiego Half-Life'a cały czas bardzo dobrze sie trzyma. Strzelanie oraz bronie są bardzo fajnie, wymienie przykłady tych najlepszych: ikoniczny łom, mocny revolver, SMG, który może strzelać małymi granatami, AR2, strzelba, kusza pełniąca role snajperki oraz OCZYWIŚCIE Gravity Gun, dzięki któremu można podnosić obiekty, rzucać nimi, rozwiązywać zagadki, ale również może służyć jako ciekawy oręż :) . Lokacje nie są jakieś ogromne, ale są całkiem ładnie zrobione jak np. City 17, Droga przez kanały, Black Mesa East, Ravenholm, Autostrada 17, Nova Prospect czy Cytadela Dr. Breena. Nadal miłe wrażenie robią też animacje postacii. Pełne ikoniczne są te dobre postacie, jak i nasi przeciwnicy jak np. Funkcjonariusze City 17,  Kombinaci, Stridery, Headcraby, Zombiaki czy Antiliony. Fajne są batalie z helikopterem Kombintu, Striderami, Strażnikami Antilionów czy Gunshipami. Gra nie jest jakoś specjalnie trudna, ukończenie jej, w zależności od umiejętności gracza, czyli tak z 8-13 godzin (lub krócej). Na plus zaliczyć jeszcze można Soundtrack, niezłe AI, przyjemne w zdobywaniu osiągnięcia (oprócz jednego) oraz niska cena. 36 zł za świetną strzelanke ? Warto kupić (na przecenie około 7,19 zł). Według mnie najlepszy FPS na pecety. Jedynie co sie mi nie podobało to zakończenie oraz strzelanie nie jest tak dobrze zrobione jak współcześnie, ale nadal jest dobrze.
