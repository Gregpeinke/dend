2 no es un juego para todo el mundo, esta mas bien centrado para jente que le guste el tema de jugar con tranquilidad, tomandose su tiempo para pensar que van a hacer a continuacion para resolver los puzzles. Empezare dando mi opinion entorno a las diferentes partes del juego:\n\n-Graficamente: Los graficoes del juego estan muy muy bien, ha enbegecido de una forma formidable y, su rendimiento es ejemplar, Source ya es un motor muy viejo pero ha demostrado que puede competir contra los motores mas nuevos. Valve si ha demostrado algo es que sabe como hacer motores graficos, que en este area ya no tengo nada mas que a√±adir.\n\n-Jugabilidad: La jugabilidad de Portal y Prtal 2 es muy muy caracteristico, ya que tienes que usar la pistola de portales y los recursos del entorno para completar los puzzles. El modo multijugador es algo nuevo para Portal pero le sienta muy bien, es muy entretenido y da muchisimas horas de juego, junto con los mapas creados por la comunidad (que lo comentare a continuacion)\n\n-Mods: Si hay algo que caracterice a Valve es el como permite a la comunidad crear y distribuir sus modificaciones para los juegos de Valve de forma gratuita, algo de lo que todos los consumidores de modificaciones les estamos muy agradecidos, pero con Portal 2 no solo permiten a los Moders profesionales crear sus mods, si no que tambien han creado una herramienta dentro del propio juego que permite a cualquier persona con algo de imaginacion crear sus propios mapas y distribuirlos medianto el workshop de forma gratuita, lo malo de la herramienta es que es muy basica, y yo, por ejemplo, he creado un par de mapas, y lo malo es que solo los puedes hacer con unas medidas especificas maximas y no te dan tantas herramientas para crear como si fueses un moder profesional (cosa que no lo soy).\n\n-Historia: La historia de Portal, al principio, no parece nada del otro mundo, hasta que juegas a todos los Half-Life, entonces te das cuenta de la magnitud de la historia que, desde mi punto de vista, es magnifica.\n\nEn conclusion, Portal 2 junto con Portal son obras maestras, y eso que tubo muchas criticas Portal 2 cuando salio, pero yo le doy un 9-9,5/10, muy muy muy recomendable.","timestamp_created":1442525341,"timestamp_updated":1485714774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18075257","author":{"steamid":"76561198112778130","num_games_owned":463,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":735,"last_played":1655842151},"language":"english","review":"I REALLY RECOMMEND IT!","timestamp_created":1442520145,"timestamp_updated":1442520145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18074941","author":{"steamid":"76561198043377526","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1716,"last_played":1527349649},"language":"english","review":"Best game I have ever played :3","timestamp_created":1442518671,"timestamp_updated":1442518671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18074707","author":{"steamid":"76561198165525511","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1610120572},"language":"english","review":"Great game.\n\nJust don't play with a friend, they're evil and you know it...","timestamp_created":1442517632,"timestamp_updated":1482494550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18072604","author":{"steamid":"76561197987625231","num_games_owned":306,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":623,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":438,"last_played":1453817411},"language":"english","review":"I quote Oli Welsh, \"Portal is perfect.

The tutorial gives you the foundations of how to play the game but after that you are left to your own devices to figure out how to reach the exit. The visuals are somewhat simplistic but they do however look great as they suit the setting that the game is in. If the single-player experience wasn't already anough to buy this game then the co-op experience definitely is. Playing with a friend to solve puzzles can be great fun but also very frustrating but enjoyable at times. However there isn't much replayability in terms of the single-player and multi-player puzzles because once you have done them you have the solution to do it again without thinking.

It had put its remarkable signature when it was first released and even now, after 9 years, Portal 2 can be easily identified as a \"masterpiece\" with puzzles, narrative, its original soundtrack, gameplay, and so much more. \n\n[b] Story [/b]\nThe story once again takes place in our lovely Aperture Science facility where it is now rotten, seemingly abandoned, due to the shut down of GLaDOS. Wheatley, [spoiler] which is the Aperture Science core of being a moron, [/spoiler] wakes the player and starts a journey to escape the facility once and for all. Yet, things are going to get a lot troublesome as the facility wakes up once again [spoiler] alongside GLaDOS herself [/spoiler].\n\nThe narrative in Portal 2 is simply amazing. The \"host leads the player\" aspect is still kept by numerous NPCs in the game and all the dialogues are so original that it still feels fresh as if it wasn't done in the original Portal already. You feel the immense pressure, joy, relaxation, rush, and tense moments as the NPCs join you till the various parts of the level.\n\n[b] Soundtrack [/b]\nSimply amazing, if not a masterpiece.  Is it possible to craft a track piece that suits all the different themes in a single game? Portal 2 clearly shows that it indeed is.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\nWe are once again assisted by our one and only Portal device. The test chambers' designs are unique and will test your ability to evaluate multiple things from multiple perspectives at once. Alongside our iconic Portal 2 device, we have a new feature that adds a new color to the game which is the gel system. Honestly, with all the narrative, OST, and new levels it is impossible to claim the gameplay as \"dull\" or the \"same\".\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nPortal 2 was born as a masterpiece and is still as masterpiece. If you hadn't played Portal 2, you are  [u] clearly missing A LOT. [/u] With many twists, levels that require various new methods, well-written character development, story, and a finale, Portal 2 will always have a special spot amongst other games.","timestamp_created":1442240667,"timestamp_updated":1593453645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18030743","author":{"steamid":"76561198089093671","num_games_owned":596,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":671,"last_played":1442172772},"language":"brazilian","review":"Eu Simplesmente AMO este game !","timestamp_created":1442240076,"timestamp_updated":1442240076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18030402","author":{"steamid":"76561198079563685","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":838,"last_played":1454476636},"language":"english","review":"Very relaxing and humorous.

And if you don't have portal 1, you won't like it NEARLY as much as this game. While the original only had cubes, buttons, fizzlers turrets and energy pellets, THIS one replaces pellets with lazers, and adds NEW functions! There's aerial faith plates, tractor beams that go in both directions, lazerfields, repulsion gel, prepulsion gel, conversion gel, cleansing gel which is basically water, new characters, a new co-op mode, and an EXCELENT plot-twist half-way through. I won't tell you what that is, so you can find out for yourself, but believe me, IT'S GOOD! And you can make your own levels now too!

Right. There aren't any. \nIf you have even a passing interest in Valve software (and since you are reading this on Steam you almost certainly do) there is no excuse not to buy and play this through to the end. Containing a solid 6-10 hour single-player campaign that, while centering on robots, has enough humanity to create a narrative not dissimilar in themes or quality to the likes of Wall-E, and a co-op campaign with a weaker story but mind-bogglingly difficult puzzles that require true teamwork, Portal 2 has no shortage of content. And that's without even mentioning the perpetual testing initiative which literally offers infinite content and a stellar level creator. And, while I won't be specific so as to avoid spoilers, this game's finale is on a scale of epic not unseen in the likes of Halo (PC Master Racers, please don't kill me) or Battlefront, and this is a puzzle game we're talking about here. A puzzle game with an epic, explosive climax and a sci-fi story so immersive you forget it's just a game? Only Valve. Not to discredit Half-Life 2, which is undoubtledy amazing, but in my mind no Valve game has ever been better than Portal 2. That is, until Half-Life 3...\n\nBuy this game. Now. And if you already own it, buy a copy for someone who doesn't, and play it with them. Everyone NEEDS to play this game. I've seen Candy Crushers and CoD fans alike fall in love with this game. I cannot describe the full quality of this game, so I won't. Buy it and see for yourself.
