I thought this game was just going to give me few hours of joy. Now, it's my most played Steam game. The community is, as far as I experienced, mostly respectful people unlike another game... you know which one I mean.\nAnyway, what's so special about this game is how each class (perk) is played differently. They are effective in some situations, against certain zeds...\nHowever, the game is far for perfect. It has minor downfalls:\n-There is a bug where your game crashes during the map change in multiplayer (seems to happen mostly on beefy computers).\n-The UI in the trader's is not that ergonomic.\n-The Linux port is terrible, but works fine on Windows.\n-Some classes do not have many weapons, while others have many. For example, the medic and firebug have so few weapons compared to the support specialist.\n-Way. Too. Many. DLCs. That's my opinion, but DLCs are horrible ways to make money. At least, Killing Floor only has some you don't need to play (extra characters). However, as I stated, some classes do not have a lot of weapons. There are weapon DLCs, that would \"fix\" said issue, but no such luck.\n\nI would say, in all honesty, this game is totally worth while, as long as you're not planning to play it on Linux.","timestamp_created":1400526311,"timestamp_updated":1400526311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10171475","author":{"steamid":"76561198019279770","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":169061,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":157527,"last_played":1654489056},"language":"japanese","review":"ﾋﾞｭﾝ　ﾊﾞﾁｭﾝ　ｸﾞｵｵｵｫｫｫｫｫ　ｶﾞｶﾞｶﾞｯ　ｱｱｱｰ!\n~~~ was eaten by a Fleshpound\nﾎﾟｺﾝ　ﾄﾞｰﾝ　ｳｳｳﾝ!　ｸﾞﾘｭﾘｭﾘｭ　ﾋﾞｭﾝ　ｳｳｳﾝ!　ｸﾞﾘｭﾘｭﾘｭ　ｱｱｱｰ!\n*** was eaten by a Scrake\nｼｬｷﾝｼｬｷﾝ　ﾊﾞﾝﾊﾞﾝﾊﾞﾝ　ｶﾁｯ　new mag!　ｼｬｷﾝｼｬｷﾝ　ｱｱｱｰ!\nxxx was eaten by a Gorefast\n\n[b]YOUR SQUAD WAS WIPED OUT[/b]","timestamp_created":1400519990,"timestamp_updated":1400550300,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":52,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509608328342437744","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10169963","author":{"steamid":"76561198067704381","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1905,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1465,"last_played":1407776425},"language":"english","review":"I hate clots...

I bought the game when it was on sale and partially because my friends recommended it to me, but still one thing convinced me more then my friends and that was the fact that there are specimens in the game. Who doesn't enjoy killing specimens? In Killing Floor you kill them brutally by shooting their heads of with a shotgun or just by emptying your weapon on them. \n\nIf you now think it's easy you are WRONG! Almost all specimens have special abilities. The so called \"Stalker\" is almost invisible and tries to sneak up on you to kill you. The \"Husk\" is shooting fireballs at you. The \"Scrake\" is carrying a chainsaw and has quite some health, but the important thing is that he runs towards you if he is low on health. The \"Siren\" is screaming and if you get to close her screaming will do damage to you. \n\nThe \"Fleshpound\" is almost the strongest of all specimens. He walks fast, he charges fast, he has a high healthbar. You could say that you have to kill him from a distance or close by when you have a high damage weapon. The reason why I said almost the strongest of all specimens is because \"The Patriarch\" is the last specimen you need to kill before you win the game and he isn't easier then all of his friends. He charges faster, has the ability to become invisible and he has the highest health. You need to have the best weapons or you are screwed.\n\nMy opinion is that teamwork, kills and common sense the three things you will need to have to survive the waves of specimens. You need the teamwork because you can't deal with the specimens on your own. More players means more specimens so the chance you get cornered is higher when you are alone. Kills are giving you money and money gives you weapons. With common sense I mean that you need to be carefull certainly when you are a beginner. You first need to know which specimens are dangerous before killing specimens in close combat so don't run into them like a lunatic.\n\nIf you like to slaughter some monsters and want a new challenge. Buy this game and find out how every specimen looks like and more important what they will do to kill you!","timestamp_created":1400439747,"timestamp_updated":1400439862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10160787","author":{"steamid":"76561198005484098","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3908,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2841,"last_played":1550017255},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogabilidade ótima, muito bom mesmo, recomendo para todos!","timestamp_created":1400428724,"timestamp_updated":1400428724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10159938","author":{"steamid":"76561198119563409","num_games_owned":300,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":10772,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8283,"last_played":1521229769},"language":"russian","review":"Мясной шутер от 1 лица.\n Если вы хотите найти игру с выживанием от орд зомби, эта игра для вас.","timestamp_created":1400424024,"timestamp_updated":1400430328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509054303169250488","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10157321","author":{"steamid":"76561198077895174","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":236,"last_played":1401194192},"language":"brazilian","review":"O Jogo é muito bom, porem as vezes é difícil jogar com amigos o server trava e o jogo da erro","timestamp_created":1400405945,"timestamp_updated":1400405945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516556262969970703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10156727","author":{"steamid":"76561198124810111","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2704,"last_played":1463768672},"language":"english","review":"Exploding headshot simulator.

This game doesn't kid around, from its origins as a mod for the game Unreal it maintains status as being a no frills hardcore game experience, it isn't forgiving to beginners and most players, even after over hundreds of hours of playing won't be able to survive on the SECOND hardest difficulty level. Strategy is paramount, and what Killing Floor excels at in its co-op that so many other games do not even close to doing as effectively is the synergy needed between players, whether it be sharshooters needing to kill the big guys or support specialists needing to weld doors shut the indirect way in which the team interacts in order to survive feels natural and each class has its own specific role - this aspect of the multiplayer is so well crafted other games pale in comparison, wherein other games co-op is so badly thought out, in KIlling Floor you don't need friends to fulfill petty game mechanics like helping you up from being crippled or buffing you up to tank damage, you need friends to shoot the invisible enemies you can't see, take care of the horde so you can focus on the big fella or distract the zeds away from you cause they can take more damage. Killing Floor is a game with high stakes and demands precision and focus to win - if you are not an asset, then you are a liability - good players can compensate but one good player cannot carry a team.\n\nYou learn by playing more and there are some great in-game courtesies that ppl developed over time that make the multiplayer experience that much better - this contributes to the strange fact that there is a often a unspoken form of communication between players that usually garners either bonds of trust or flames of hate. \n\nKilling Floor - zombie killing like you've never seen before, oh and friends help a lot with this game","timestamp_created":1400173537,"timestamp_updated":1400173537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10119913","author":{"steamid":"76561198032536113","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2739,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2485,"last_played":1469416068},"language":"english","review":"HELL YEAH ITS A GREAT GAME!","timestamp_created":1400173290,"timestamp_updated":1400173290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10118831","author":{"steamid":"76561198074919638","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1468075036},"language":"russian","review":"Графа ужас.

But thats where you would be wrong, because the developers \"Tripwire Interactive\" keep breathing new life into this game, ranging from new weapons, characters, maps, types of Zeds, Zed costumes and i could go on for ages. \n\nBeing a game about Teamwork and surviving an onslaught of Zeds trying to eat your skin and wear your insides like a wedding gown, you would think that the community would be full of elitists and pardon my launguage \"Assholes\" but thats where it differs from most online games, and has you either working together or Surviving by yourself while others get face humped by scrakes, fleshpounds and sirens. The community ingame is very helpful and alot of fun to play games with, i've only come across two people who made my gameplay difficult, and that was fixed when they tried to knife a Fleshpound.\n\nOverall I absolutely love everything about this game. I highley reccomend this game to anyone who loves Wave survival, gunplay and watching bodies implode.","timestamp_created":1400102654,"timestamp_updated":1400102654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53017878532409668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10113650","author":{"steamid":"76561198110296353","num_games_owned":339,"num_reviews":88,"playtime_forever":7608,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3071,"last_played":1509549428},"language":"english","review":"so much gore, KILL THEM ALL!","timestamp_created":1400102264,"timestamp_updated":1400102264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10111719","author":{"steamid":"76561198080446100","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":478,"last_played":1424082553},"language":"russian","review":"Весёлая,убивательная и няшная игра!)","timestamp_created":1400087637,"timestamp_updated":1400087637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10111056","author":{"steamid":"76561198018585726","num_games_owned":637,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":537,"last_played":1584902512},"language":"english","review":"You shoot shit and then gore comes out.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1400082480,"timestamp_updated":1400082480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472494840621948242","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10110001","author":{"steamid":"76561198060045333","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":27549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27127,"last_played":1427919714},"language":"french","review":"Le meilleur jeu de survival zombie.

Let me explain why:\n\n- There's plenty of variety to keep you playing. If its excess of weapons and maps isn't enough, the Steam Workshop content is always there.\n\n- The progression system in Killing Floor is great. Gear only lasts for the match, but leveling up is consistent throughout games. It gives you something to work towards while allowing you to become very powerful in your first few matches.\n\n- Solo mode is definitely bearable, with multiplayer matches being equally entertaining. Killing Floor is a game where you don't need to be on voice comms to win matches or have fun, so long as you stick together.\n\n- As mentioned previously, the Steam Workshop helps keep Killing Floor alive. While it can be frustrating (forcing you to unsubscribe from already-downloaded items in order to obtain more), the content on there makes the DLC less relevant.\n\n- Like other Tripwire Interactive games, telescopic sights for guns are done right. Unlike most modern games (which simply decrease your FOV), Killing Floor's scopes are only zoomed in INSIDE the scope area. If this is too taxing on your machine, this can be disabled.\n\nNow, the negatives. This game's far from perfect, and for all the praise I'll give it, it certainly isn't flawless.\n\n- It looks rough around the edges. Its graphics definitely need some work, especially when it comes to explosion animations.\n\n- Some gameplay \"mechanics\" are nothing short of infuriating. For instance, you cannot cancel a reload animation. Things like this can easily get you killed when they shouldn't be in the game in the first place.\n\n- The Steam Workshop mods practically require certain other mods before they can be used properly.\n\n- The weapon DLC isn't THAT attractive. The only reason you would want it is if you plan to use it in multiplayer matches. As someone who plays solo mode almost exclusively, I have enough Steam Workshop weapons to last me a lifetime.\n\n- For some people, the fact that you will often not survive will be a deterrant.\n\nOverall, I recommend it. I ain't throwing a rating on the game (since ratings have no universal scale), but I'd give Killing Floor a shot, even if you don't have friends to play with.\n\nI definitely suggest that you read other reviews, though. I doubt I went over anywhere near everything.

I've seen to glitches in all the time I've owned the game. Also in this zombie game it IS possible to play single player. But in honesty the game is so much more fun in Co-op. Yes the workshop for those of us who are crap with computers, is a little confusing, but maps are easily installed and that's what matters. The game is funny although it doesn't seem to be trying to be funny. It's not a game for the weak of heart, or who shy away from gore filled games. But if you were that kind of person you wouldn't have clicked on the game that has 'killing' in the title, not to mention the title is splattered by blood. Also the bullet time moments are awesome even when you're reloading, the class's are fun to swap through, and the weapons and trader system are great. All in all 200/10 I mean it, if you like killing thingies, have a social life, and have a slightly dark sense of humor this game is for you.","timestamp_created":1399846111,"timestamp_updated":1399846111,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520319819450378418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10087360","author":{"steamid":"76561198034952842","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1426,"last_played":1389033169},"language":"english","review":"Buy it just if you have a friend to play with","timestamp_created":1399843308,"timestamp_updated":1399843308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496774196624755859","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10087004","author":{"steamid":"76561197968887154","num_games_owned":1191,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":4649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4649,"last_played":1362124800},"language":"english","review":"Dosh!

Too many bad design choices have been made to kill things that made the core gameplay what it was.
