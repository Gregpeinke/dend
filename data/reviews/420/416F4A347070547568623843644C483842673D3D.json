City 17 is gone and its disgusting city is no longer accessible and now you’re in a nice forest instead. Plot thickens and the awesome cliffhanger ending is just so epic. Half-Life 3 will come to those who wait and are patient if you’re mad that the game isn’t out yet Rome wasn’t built in a day and developers who poop out a new game every other year typically do a bad job at it. With great time comes great perseverance and with the ending of Half-Life Alyx there's more of an insight of Half-Life 3’s appearance in the near future. Praise Gaben.

Any FPS I play now, needs to have Rift support or it just won't do. I had to adjust the FOV to 110 and HUD FOV to 50 to get things to work properly so I wouldn't need a barf bag. Once that was done, game on with ful immersion. What a great game! The final battle with the crapload of striders attacking the base felt like I was really in the middle of an alien shitstorm! Here's hoping Valve releases HL3 in 2013 so we can put this saga to bed. hey now! 10\\10","timestamp_created":1370976538,"timestamp_updated":1370976538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4726417","author":{"steamid":"76561198041173375","num_games_owned":576,"num_reviews":109,"playtime_forever":2993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":275,"last_played":1641918343},"language":"english","review":"Good story. but still want to know what happened after the cliff hanger in the end","timestamp_created":1370802231,"timestamp_updated":1589703513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5244828","author":{"steamid":"76561198046905148","num_games_owned":464,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":17,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1370828676},"language":"spanish","review":"Obra maestra!","timestamp_created":1370665846,"timestamp_updated":1370665846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1765635","author":{"steamid":"76561197997669587","num_games_owned":685,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":395,"last_played":1370688323},"language":"english","review":"Without giving away any spoilers to newcomers to Episode Two, this very well may be the biggest cliffhanger in video game history. Regardless, it's a fantastic addition to the most successful first-person shooter taking place right after the departure from City 17 by transit upon the destruction of the Citadel. This, along with Half-Life 2 and Episode One aren't anything that anybody should have any reason to miss.
