If you can stand the campiness, old Unreal Engine quirks and the repetitiveness of its gameplay, it can be very fun.\n\n\nIt's still alive with a halfway decent population despite the development of its sequel, Killing Floor 2. There's not much of a plot, but the Objective Mode maps give you insight and expand on what there is, and the lore can be surprisingly interesting. This is a game for people who want to shoot the hell out of monsters with a healthy layer of cheese, and while that's more or less all there is to the game, the wide variety of maps, perks, difficulties and weapons make sure it doesn't get too stale. The tactical, methodical gameplay at the higher levels also contributes to this for more experienced players.\n\nKilling Floor was born from an Unreal Tournament mod and still uses Unreal Engine 2, which belies a lot of its jankiness and interface/gameplay quirks, although at least it allows for smooth 60 FPS gameplay. The graphics aren't mind-blowing, but are still nice if you turn the settings up, and most maps have a convincingly foreboding, gritty atmosphere - kind of like a grindhouse movie.\n\nThe guns, though, are grand. Tripwire Interactive also made the WWII games Red Orchestra & Rising Storm, and they put a lot of work into their video game guns. Killing Floor's guns sound and feel excellent, very smooth compared to some other aspects of the game, and there is a pretty wide array to choose from even without the DLC guns. A fair bit of the game's lasting appeal may be due to how satisfying they are to use.\n\nThere are three DLC weapon packs that give new guns, the others being gun reskins or new characters, but the guns themselves are either mostly balanced or actually on the weak side. This is far from a pay-to-win game, although it's still a bit annoying seeing someone with a nice gun that you can't have unless you ask them to drop it. Since the DLC is uniformly overpriced and mostly comprised of cosmetic skins, wait for a sale if you want any of the actual weapon DLC.\n\nKF's voice acting is indeed cheesy: there are two voices stretched across most of the game's characters, including most of the DLC ones, and about 45% of their voice lines are British slang by volume. The music is mostly industrial/ambient metal that meshes fairly well with the game's tone. Don't be fooled, though: this game [i]can[/i] approach survival horror, especially when you're on the run with little ammunition and half of your team dead.\n\n\nKilling Floor is great for what it is, but it's repetitive by nature. Its sequel, while having a wider color palette, higher production values and a faster pace, is the same basic concept. Any choice between the two for newcomers will probably boil down to whether they like the gritty yet somewhat campy aesthetic of KF1 or the more sci-fi aesthetic of KF2, as well as how powerful their computer is. The cheese and the jank can even grow on you if you end up playing the game enough.\n\nAs to a comparison with Left 4 Dead, I'll just say that the Killing Floor community is definitely more welcoming. I'm not entirely sure why; maybe it's the fact that there's only a versus mode in the sequel, and even there it's not actually played often. Maybe Source engine gamers and Unreal engine gamers are simply different. Who knows?\n\nAchievement hunters be warned: there's a broken achievement that was a tie-in to another game, and the devs have no intention of fixing it. I count myself lucky I earned it back in the day...","timestamp_created":1310246231,"timestamp_updated":1587892070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521432757377624512","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4861339","author":{"steamid":"76561198042593668","num_games_owned":468,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2626,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2472,"last_played":1545953689},"language":"english","review":"Lots of zombie killing fun.
