Unfortunately, I picked the wrong version to try out. Little did I know, Half-Life: Source has a bunch of crippling bugs that have not been fixed in years.\n\nSome particularly fun bugs: one advanced enemy can't do damage to yourself or your NPCs, spoiling some story moments and making a few segments very easy. A puzzle involving conveyor belts has such severe graphical glitches that it's practically impossible to navigate. The player's walk/run speed seems extremely high, and a lot of the platforming segments become frustrating just because you quickly slide off of surfaces. Sometimes, the AI directing enemy soldiers will lock up, and they will stand frozen while you dispatch them. And, about two thirds of the way through, you begin to encounter Apache helicopters which are un-killable. I'm basically soft-locked on my run, because I can't get across an open area before the chopper guns me down, and none of my weapons work against it.\n\nSo yeah, it turns out that HLS is a buggy port. I've read elsewhere that the original game doesn't have any of these problems, though I haven't tried it myself. The parts that work are great, and the genius of the original level and enemy designs shines through, but this game is truly, badly broken.","timestamp_created":1577156597,"timestamp_updated":1577156597,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503783643245697021","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60417858","author":{"steamid":"76561198055042812","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":126,"last_played":1575266519},"language":"english","review":"The game is stupidly bugged, only get it for the gmod stuff","timestamp_created":1577138999,"timestamp_updated":1577139055,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503816783428192139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60415752","author":{"steamid":"76561198041273626","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":748,"last_played":1585145533},"language":"english","review":"The ERA from the best game ever.\nHALF LIFE!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1577136636,"timestamp_updated":1577136636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60406335","author":{"steamid":"76561198149009809","num_games_owned":362,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":380,"last_played":1638130689},"language":"english","review":"Well it is Half-Life isn't it?","timestamp_created":1577126640,"timestamp_updated":1577126640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518248140811920166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60403015","author":{"steamid":"76561198322976564","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":136,"playtime_forever":293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1578886469},"language":"english","review":"Obviously this is just the same as the Original.

Она вышла в 1998 г.) а в source он уже доработан и с ним удобнее играть. Графика стала более красивой и качественной но не спеши с покупкой из за графики, о ней я ещё поговорю в минусах. У оружий добавились отражения и это круто. Тела умерших врагов стали более реалистичнее падать при смерти. \nМинусы:  В полюсах я говорил про оружие, так вот: отдача у автомата ПОЛНОЕ ГА... Она ужасная, с него трудно стрелять, а и пока не забыл о отражении на оружии, они есть ВЕЗДЕ, даже там где негде нечего отражать. На уровнях с горама (я уже не помню что там было) они стали 3D но их мало, на уровне где мы получаем рпг есть вертолёт у которого... Маленький хитбокс? Не я серьёзно, пока попадешь скорее стареть спидранером по half-life. Вернёмся к графике, на одном уровне присутствует графический баг из за чего из ваших глаза будет биться кровь.  Ну и последний минут связан с телами после смерти, они исчезают и из них нельзя сделать мясо и поиграть в футбол (в обычном не source мясо от врагов вроде можно было пинать)\nНадеюсь я помог тебе определиться с выбором какую халфу купить.
