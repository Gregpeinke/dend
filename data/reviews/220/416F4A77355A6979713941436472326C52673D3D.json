It’s fun to play through every once in a while but really, I can’t call this one of the greatest games ever made. There are a few things holding it back from being that.\n\nFirst off, the pacing. It’s probably my biggest gripe with the game and it’s what has held me from fully replaying it for such a long time. There are so many sequences that just bring the gameplay to a full halt. It’s not that big of a deal the first time through since the story is interesting, but once you’ve experienced it all, you’re basically just stuck waiting for the game to finally move on. This sort of storytelling is something I have a gripe with in many modern games as well. \n\nOne side note is the amount of loading screens in the game. There's tons of them and they get annoying pretty quick since they constantly break up the action and atmosphere.\n\nThen there’s the gunplay which really doesn’t feel satisfying at all. The only weapons that are kinda fun to use are the Gravity gun and on occasion, the shotgun. The rest just feel and also look kinda boring, which is a shame, since Half-Life 1 and its expansions had a bunch of pretty cool and interesting weapons.\n\nIt doesn’t help that the enemy variety is kept pretty minimal. The Combine forces pretty much all feel the same, the only difference being the weapons they carry. Their AI is also pretty dull, so gun fights really aren’t all that interesting. There’s a couple of intense fights where you have to fight Combines and huge forces like gunships or striders at the same time but other than that, most firefights are pretty dull. \nThankfully, the headcrabs are a bit more interesting, since there’s multiple versions of them. But what about all the other cool aliens from Half-Life 1? This sort of ties in with the weapon selection as well. The HL1-Games had a bunch of really cool alien weapons. Half-Life 2 has pretty much 1 (the Combine rifle) and honestly, it doesn’t really handle that much differently from the SMG you get earlier in the game.\n\nOne thing that is still top notch is the atmosphere of the game. It still sucked me in just like it did back when I last played it. I’m a big fan of these sorts of dystopian settings. \nHowever one thing I will mention is that it feels entirely different from Half-Life 1. I didn’t mind, personally, but it’s still something that should be mentioned since it’s rare that a sequel feels so radically different from its predecessor. Half the time I forgot that I was supposed to be playing a sequel to Half-Life. That is, when people aren’t constantly shouting Gordon’s name around.\n\nThe graphics are still pretty good, although they do show their age, but that doesn't bother me. The physics engine is still probably one of the best ones around, though it's implementation in this game seems a bit gimmicky. By the third time they recycled the \"Use gravity gun to build bridges over hazardous ground\"-part, I was like \"Alright, I get it\". \n\nThe level design's alright as well. What I like is that there's a lot of variation. There's straight up shooting bits, mixed with some fast-paced vehicle sections and slower paced, atmospheric bits here and there.\n\nOverall, I encourage everyone to play this game on their own with a neutral mindset to get their own opinion. I think it’s important for everyone to see for themselves whether or not this game is worth all the praise or not. It is a fun game after all, just not “one of the greatest games of all time”, in my personal opinion.","timestamp_created":1445207143,"timestamp_updated":1445207143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18558227","author":{"steamid":"76561198027979146","num_games_owned":1593,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1859,"last_played":1405184386},"language":"russian","review":"Собственно, из-за этой игры я и узнал кто такой Гейб Ньюэлл и что такое стим клиент.

Now this game really falls apart in the story, everything is good until you release that the story is really nothing too special, sure the world in Half life was amazing, but there was'nt enough effort put in to enhance the story in my opinion. Compare this to the Halo franchise, halo really succeeds in stroy telling, i think that halo still has the most interesting universe even till today. Half life falls apart in story telling, you would just stop and certain areas, meet up with the good guys, take out more bad guys, thats basically what you are going to expect in hal life 2. i did'nt think that half life 2 didnt really deserve the honour for being one of the best games, sure it has great graphics at the time, sure the mechanics in the game are awesome, but i thougth that it needed more stories to be told along the way, like in halo, where Cortana is always following around the Master Chief, sometimes talking about things that happened to the past when refferig to something. And what idont get why Gordon Freeman was being starred again in this game, in the first game your main objective is to tell what happenedy in the Black Mesa facility, you just wanted to tell people to get as far away from the place, he was'nt really the best person to be picked in my opinion, i mean they could have hired a voice actor to voice out Gordon, its really weird to be extremely silent when throughout the game, people would just remember you as saving the world, and it would be really weird that you just being silent about it, they needed a voice actor. Lastly, the ending, THAT ENDIng sucks, i mean they needed a much better ending, and i dont see that being reffered to in the reviews. Why? Because half life is the best game? HELL NO. The games's story was already bad, and the ending just realy shows how rush the game felt. Overall the game has one of the most fun and topnotch game mechanics and would reccomend buying it, but if ou really expect to get alot of exposition in this game, you dont here. i give this game a 7/10","timestamp_created":1444840425,"timestamp_updated":1444840425,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.317224174737930298","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18471734","author":{"steamid":"76561198136321432","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1258,"last_played":1444797567},"language":"spanish","review":"Me

jogo já criado, e isso não é exagero...\n\nAntes de Portal, CS: GO e Left 4 Dead, a Valve, minha empresa de games preferida já havia lançado o seu \"masterpiece\": Half-Life 2, o jogo com a combinação mais fantástica que um gamer pode querer: Física impecável, trama envolvente e enorme, personagens carismáticos e gráficos excelentes e leves, lembrando que o game é de 2004!\n\nSe o primeiro game já era sensacional, com horas e horas de duração, personagens interativos e momentos de tensão incrivelmente bem conduzidos, HL 2 surpreende retornando com os melhores elementos do primeiro, melhorando cada detalhe e acrescentando ainda mais coisas! A trama não é copiada, e sim, original, com muitos mistérios e personagens enigmaticos, como o G-Man, que até hoje ninguem sabe quem é... Muito bom!\n\nO jogo conta com muitos capítulos, diálogos envolventes, violência, armas originais e divertidas, trama empolgante, cenários detalhados, universo imersivo e vivo, gráficos lindos e leves e ainda por cima você encontra essa obra-prima por um preço ultra-barato na Steam! O jogo tem pouquíssimos bugs, coisa que todos os jogos tem, mas em half-life ou você nem vê os bugs, ou então você vê e 5 segundos depois já não faz mais diferença nenhuma pois é algo bem simples e não influencia no gameplay e/ou gráficos...\n\nO protagonista é Gordon Freeman, o cientista mais famoso do mundo dos games... Ele não diz uma palavra durante a aventura toda mas consegue ser carismático e ter dezenas de companheiros pela trama, praticamente todos mostrando confiança nele! Um dos únicos momentos em que vemos Gordon Freeman inteiro ou quase inteiro na saga, sem contar a capa, claro, é na expansão Blue Shift do Half-Life 1, no qual jogamos com o guarda que tenta abrir a porta no início, e olhando para trás, vimos Gordon no trem =} É a melhor cena desse naipe pra mim.\n\nO jogo tem tensão, aventura, explosões, mensagens de honra e esperança, tiroteios, alienigenas, robôs, veículos e diversos capítulos emocionantes e surpreendentes... Um jogo para diversos públicos e ainda por cima é a parte base! Ainda temos HL 2 EP 1 e 2 para continuar a trama! É possível que um dia HL 3 seja lançado, e se isso acontecer, pode apostar, meu amigo... pode apostar que a internet para, pois se a Rockstar Games teve poder pra fazer isso com GTA V, a Valve tem muito mais, e isso eu garanto, haha!\n\nA Valve disse um pouco depois do lançamento do HL 2 que capítulos seriam lançados com intervalos de alguns meses, e até citaram episódio 3 e 4, mas acabaram lançando apenas o 1, 2 e o ep Lost Coast, que são todos muito bons mas ainda deixam mistérios no ar! Mistérios que precisam ser revelados! Joguem e entendam...\n\nPrós:\n-Gráficos muito bons e o jogo é muito leve\n-O jogo pode vir no pacote Orange Box por um preço barato e ainda você tem a chance de experimentar Portal, um jogo sensacional que faz parte do universo de Half-Life!\n-Tem conquistas e cartas colecionáveis\n-Personagens carismáticos\n-O jogo é grande e em nenhum momento é enjoativo\n-Cenários detalhados\n-Missões bem variadas, divertidas e todas vão deixando a trama ainda mais empolgante!\n-Mistérios... G-Man...\n-Muitas armas legais\n-Física impressionante!\n-Jogabilidade muito boa\n-Expressões faciais dos personagens impressionam!\n\nContras:\n-Sinceramente, não existem coisas negativas nesse jogo... Na análise eu informei sobre pouquíssimos bugs, coisas que possuem em todos os jogos, mas até nisso half-life é bom, haha, nem bugs você percebe direito, e quando percebe, é tão simples que nem interfere!\n\nRecomendadíssimo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1444764367,"timestamp_updated":1657476000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":99,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.877656221389770508","comment_count":15,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18457253","author":{"steamid":"76561198023137125","num_games_owned":572,"num_reviews":114,"playtime_forever":1774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":650,"last_played":1618712725},"language":"english","review":"Its Half Life.
