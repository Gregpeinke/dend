The graphics are nice and stylized. There are a lot of varied settings, but the game has been streamlined to the point it misses greatness. While I appreciate shooters with wide open spaces, it is rather hard to do well from a combat mechanic perspective. You can only carry two weapons and rather little ammo. The weapons are not very interesting either. Some only serve to be replaced by other weapons. Scrounging for ammo and heath is rather stupid as you can't carry med kits and the ammo is very limited so you always have either have full ammo or no ammo. This is the opposite of what Bioshock did. The AI is either a critique of religious zealots or just bad. To make up for the bad AI enemies sometimes just have 10 times the HP of other enemies. Plasmids have been marginalized and are not used for puzzles. Instead you can ride a kind of roller coaster or open portals. Both of these aren't very interesting from a gameplay perspective. The boss fights aren't interesting but then again they never really were in the series. While I am criticizing it I will also add that you can’t save the game manually and you just get resurrected when you die. There are certainly plot twists but they are much more cutscene related. It may sound like I hate the game, but I don't. It could have been much more though. It has great atmosphere, excellent acting, and the first side kick character I don't find annoying. It also solves the original’s lack of NPCs that are trying to not kill you or not behind a glass wall. It is a much less lonely game that the original.\n\n I am not sure how critics can give the game an A with the combat faults (I played on hard until the last level where there didn’t seem to be enough ammo so I switched to normal)\n\nAnyway I paid about 10 dollars for the game and I got my money's worth. \n\nGrade: B\n","timestamp_created":1403998610,"timestamp_updated":1403998610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10922464","author":{"steamid":"76561198092284135","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":3025,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":626,"last_played":1640436338},"language":"thai","review":"โครตมัน แต่มีบัคนินหน่อยแต่ไม่เป็นไรพอมองข้ามไปได้ 10/10","timestamp_created":1403998153,"timestamp_updated":1403998153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10922376","author":{"steamid":"76561198120455116","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":942,"last_played":1487026162},"language":"spanish","review":"es  el mejor  juego que  he comprado","timestamp_created":1403997867,"timestamp_updated":1403997867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10922028","author":{"steamid":"76561197986271427","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":901,"last_played":1404338476},"language":"english","review":"Really fast paced and full of action. 10/10","timestamp_created":1403996982,"timestamp_updated":1403996982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10921731","author":{"steamid":"76561198100933703","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":645,"last_played":1422119634},"language":"russian","review":"Замечательная игра","timestamp_created":1403996299,"timestamp_updated":1403996299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10921720","author":{"steamid":"76561198013169144","num_games_owned":300,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1322,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1322,"last_played":1403992155},"language":"english","review":"Great fun and a great story line.

Bioshock Infinite is set in the early 20th century, just before World War I.  Rather than a city under the sea, the game takes place in Colombia, a city the floats in the sky.  You play as Booker, a Pinkerton agent  who finds himself in debt to his superiors.  He is given a chance at redemption and sent to Colombia where he must rescue Elizabeth, a girl born with special abilities and subsequently idolized there.  Naturally, people do not take kindly to Booker's presence and thus the main conflict is created.  As the story unfolds, you discover the origins of the city, learn about people who inhabit it, and discover it's wonders.  The plot can be a bit confusing at times so it's important to pay attention.  I had to play through the game three times before I understood everything, or at least believed I understood everything.\n\n(Gameplay)\nAgain, Bioshock presents itself as a first person shooter.  This time around however, long range combat is just as relevant as close quarters combat.  You can only carry two weapons at a time.  Weapons can still be upgraded, but the upgrade no longer changes the appearance of the gun.  There are only eight vigors (plasmids) for you to use this time around in the base game.  You can equip two vigors at a time, switching between one or the other with a hot key.  Vigors can be upgraded for efficacy and also charged up for a secondary fire functionality in combat.  Combat is not as deep as Bioshock 1 or 2, but it is certainly not boring and can get intense at times.  Collectible clothing gives you passive abilities and the tonic system provides you with a rechargeable shield.  Health does not recharge, nor do your \"salts\", the new Adam.  There is not as much to do in between fights.  Hacking is gone (though I guess it fits with the time period) and there is little exploration to do.  You are presented with choices again since this is Bioshock. \n\n(Design)\nThe detail of this game is incredible.  It might be the best looking game I have that runs the Unreal 3 Engine.  The sounds and sights are something to behold.  Each environment feels different though the music is not as emotional.  There were no overlapping sound issues this time around too.\n\n(Final Comments)\nThis game left an impression on me, and there are not many games I say that about.  While I consider it a departure from the series, I still highly recommend it based on its design and plot.  Your first 30-40 minutes are some of the most memorable you may ever have in a game.  The ending ties up the plot nicely and will get you thinking as well.  Catch some coins and make the pilgrimmage to Colombia if you can handle the truth.                        \n","timestamp_created":1403989437,"timestamp_updated":1403989437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10918572","author":{"steamid":"76561198053113746","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":668,"last_played":1403987675},"language":"english","review":"Amazing.

Many of the mechanics of Bioshock 1 are back including Infinite's own version of plasmids.  I was a little disappointed in the shooting.   I actually restarted the game at the highest difficulty level after realizing I hadn't even died once almost halfway through on the normal difficulty level.  It does get tougher in the second half though.   Probably my favorite new gameplay mechanic is the rail system where you can attach your magnetic arm to the aerial monorail system in the new world of Columbia and control your speeds, jump on enemies, achieve powerup perks that make this system of combat better, and more.  It also has a surprise twist tie-in to Bioshock 1's story.  Overall, an easy game, but a story better than most movies.

Одной из главных особенностей Bioshock Infinite является шедевральный сюжет, где каждая незначительная деталь может оказаться очень важной и стать дополнительным поворотом сюжета, из которых и складывается эта завораживающая история. Так чего уж тут говорить, сам сюжет я рассказывать не буду - лучше купите эту игру! Но, пожалуй, самым главным  подарком геймерам от Irrational Games является Элизабет. Она - та самая девушка, которую и надо вызволить из башни главному герою игры, Букеру ДеВитту. К большому счастью, в этой игре нас не пытаются подкупить самоходными сиськами, поэтому Элизабет из себя хрупкую молодую девушку, которая также является чертовски обаятельной и няшной. И даже не верится, что она не существует на самом деле, поскольку\nпо сравнению с теми людьми, с которыми вы ездите в общественном транспорте, именно те самые люди и являются каменными статуями с покер-фейсами на лицах. Вот такая она яркая и жизнерадостная!\nТакже вместо плазмидов в игре появились энергетики, сходные по своим действиям из прошлых игр, но в отличие от Ягуара, весьма помогающие как в бою, так и в мирное время.

For those all too familiar with Rapture, it may be hard to digest at first, but after the first 30 minutes to an hour you begin to feel more at home in the world of Columbia.\n\nWhile I have to admit I'm not big fan of fighting \"law enforcement\" as oppose to impaling splicers on walls, they've certainly done very well in terms of the in-game mechanics. I don't know if it was just me, but the soldiers sure seem very durable. Not sure if the weapons may just be weaker or if there's an emphasis on combos with vigors, but overall it is more challenging than the original two Bioshocks. I should emphasise that you can't really employ much of a stealthy approach in the game as you may have in the first two (if that's your style).\n\nThe visuals are simply stunning, pretty much the same as the cutscenes. The music is nice and it manages to employ a similar kind of atmosphere that's present in the originals. As a whole I think it was a great addition to a very successful series and a must buy by me!","timestamp_created":1403949776,"timestamp_updated":1412333832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10900234","author":{"steamid":"76561198104331446","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":95,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1403989461},"language":"bulgarian","review":"really fun game and exciting.","timestamp_created":1403948066,"timestamp_updated":1403948066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10899981","author":{"steamid":"76561197964934584","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":551,"last_played":1403885458},"language":"french","review":"Très bon jeu, l'histoire est bonne, graphiquement c'est beau, le jeu est nerveux avec une bonne difficulté.\n\nC'est franchement une belle réussite.","timestamp_created":1403947414,"timestamp_updated":1403947414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10899677","author":{"steamid":"76561197996941383","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":825,"last_played":1404387725},"language":"english","review":"This game sucks less than the previous Bioshock 1 and 2.
