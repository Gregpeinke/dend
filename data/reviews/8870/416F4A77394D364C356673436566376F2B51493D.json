The game play itself, while not nearly as great as the story is solid enough to carry it through into a great experience. \n\nIt is not at all easy to craft characters that the player ends up caring about, to follow the \"show, don't tell\" paradign without falling prey to the low-hanging fruit of spelling things out for the audience. The story is good on its own and it is made much better and richer if you pay attention to all of the signs, audio recordings and little side-snippets of info along the way. There's a good reason so much discussion has been had about the ending and the meaning behind it and that is a sign of top notch plot. \n\nIt is also a very polished game from a technical standpoint. Pretty much no crashes, bugs or the like. \n\nIn short, if you're a fan of great storytelling this is a must-play.","timestamp_created":1631349446,"timestamp_updated":1631349446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99149506","author":{"steamid":"76561198260572054","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1270,"last_played":1631347598},"language":"spanish","review":"Uff

un jeu en ligne droite mais avec durée de vie qui a facilement une dizaines d'heures de vie et l'un des rares jeux que j'ai rejouer ( il faut dire que steam ne compte pas les heures joués sans internet ), c'est pas un monde ouvert mais il a le mérite de laisser une certaine liberté de visiter l'environnement.\nC'est un jeu que je recommande mais le moins bon aussi des jeux biosock, la preuve que biosock a mi la barre tellement haute que ses suites n'arrivent pas à son niveau mais en même temps se sont de très bons jeux.\n\nL'histoire du jeu qui est plus qu'un simple sauver la princesse, est pour moi géniale et avec une fin totalement explose de cerveau, c'est sûre qu'avec un monde avec des univers parallèles cela devient un peu la folie.\nLa ville de Columbia est magnifique ( même si e préfère rapture ) et l'ambiance ( au début ) est plus calme qu'un rapture, où l'on va découvrir un conflit entre les riches racistes adeptes contre les communistes-anarchiste avec soif de sang.\nSi dans le rapture la citée a été crée sous un principe de liberté et d'individualisme celle de Columbia repose sur un système esclavagisme religieux.\n\nC'est un bon fps avec une intelligent artificiel correcte, une grande diversité d'armes avec leurs améliorations, 8 pouvoirs plus ou moins utiles.\nAvec une certaines variétés d'ennemis même si d'un camp à l'autre on fini par trouver les mêmes ennemis.\nL'univers de Columbia est beau et cohérent dans sa folie et mentalité mais je n'aime pas les rails qui nous permet de passer d'un endroit à un autre mais en même temps devient redondant à la manière de fuir.\n\n[u] C'est un jeu que je recommande et j'attends le prochain biosock avec impatience et j'espère qu'il sera sur la lune ou au centre de la terre ou même revoir rapture ( heu pas spécialement dans l'espace )

Локации смотрятся  шикарно и разнообразно (особенно начало), иногда хочется просто остановиться и полюбоваться красотами этого мира. Из-за необычной графики , игра выглядит довольно сочно  , а по стилистике она мне  напомнила Dishonored (Ещё одна шикарная игра, которую определенно стоит пройти). \n•СЮЖЕТ (Без спойлеров)\nПожалуй одна из лучших сюжетных игр.\nСюжет очень интересно закручен , по началу ты думаешь , что сюжет весьма прост , так как нам толком ничего не говорят , просто доставь девчонку из точки А в точку Б , но это лишь 1 половина игры. Во 2 половине появляется множество интересных моментов , а сюжет уже и не кажется таким простым , так как он кардинально меняет своё повествование , попутно подкидывая множество неожиданных поворотов , а также кучу вопросов. Финал сделан довольно неожиданным , объясняя  , что вообще происходит , и с чего всё началось.\n• ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ\nВот тут довольно спорный момент...\nУ тебя есть неплохой арсенал , начиная перечисление с пистолетов , заканчивая гранатомётами. Некоторые пушки довольно схожи по стрельбе , но чего-то прям интересного нет . Пару стандартных автоматов , дробовиков , винтовок и прочего. Так как игра не особо длинная , они не успевают надоесть. Есть также способности , их 8 шт . Хоть  у каждой своя отдельная красивая  анимация , ощущаются некоторые одинаково , так как функционал у них по большей части один. Каких-то интересных способностей нет , а их комбинирование выглядит уныло . Из-за малой эффективности большинства способностей мы просто  забываем о них во время боя , используя изредка щит и оглушение. Большим плюсом можно отменит Элизабет . Помимо хорошей истории , она очень часто вам помогает, а не мешается под ногами. кончились патроны ? Она уже готова дать тебе обойму , а может мало здоровья или маны ?

I've beaten this game twice and enjoyed myself both times however upon further reflection BioShock 1 and 2 were better games with more in depth mechanics and themes and story for the whole game. Its a shooter with a really nice coat of paint but somewhat lacking underneath that paint. Also if you take a moment to look at videos such as The Bioshock Infinite we never got or Bioshock Infinite Critique  on YouTube you will start to realise the wasted potential and what the game could have actually been, the promises made and what they were showing before it came out were amazing even by today's standards and at the end we got a really cut down dumbified stripped down version of what was shown, Im sure if what was shown in beta and alpha actually did get fully fleshed out properly we would have a real masterpiece. \n\nEven after all this I would still recommend it because it makes an attempt to be unique and succeeds so much in atmosphere in a genre of really boring repetitive shooters that have nothing to say or are not trying to be better in any way even 8 years later. But it needs to be made clear that the next BioShock game should not be aiming to be like Infinite and it should be better than it. If we get another game like this in the BioShock franchise its because people are willing to look past the flaws and have praised the game when its just a shooter with a really really nice coat of paint on the surface but not that much depth.","timestamp_created":1631204054,"timestamp_updated":1631204054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99054226","author":{"steamid":"76561198302594634","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":500,"last_played":1631203848},"language":"schinese","review":"hao","timestamp_created":1631201536,"timestamp_updated":1631201536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99053368","author":{"steamid":"76561198422887272","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":504,"last_played":1631200235},"language":"schinese","review":"6666","timestamp_created":1631200302,"timestamp_updated":1631200302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99052844","author":{"steamid":"76561198272839411","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":681,"last_played":1627798765},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegazo","timestamp_created":1631199596,"timestamp_updated":1631199596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99052100","author":{"steamid":"76561198207104376","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1332,"last_played":1639471553},"language":"schinese","review":"多年以后入正二刷，我就静静的站在那看她跳舞看了快一个小时吧，实在意难平","timestamp_created":1631198537,"timestamp_updated":1631198537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99049176","author":{"steamid":"76561198048165036","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1058,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1058,"last_played":1611016922},"language":"english","review":"first off..
