Yapım ilk oyunda yaşadığımız yıkımdan net olmamakla birlikte 9 ile 273 yıl sonrası arasında geçiyor. Fazla uçuk tahminler arasında yaklaşık 30,000 yıl sonrası olduğu söylense de şahsen bir tesisin hâlen çalışabilmesi için daha ufak sayılar olması gerektiğini düşünüyorum. Hikâyenin odağına geçersek, bir odada açıyoruz gözlerimizi. Ufak testlerden sonra kapımız çalınıyor ve ünlü oyuncu Stephen Merchant'ın seslendirmenliğini yaptığı hücre robotumuz Wheatley içeri giriyor. Kısa bir konuşmanın ardından yine tesisten kaçma planları kuruyoruz ve emin adımlarla yola koyuluyoruz. Şahsen ilk oyun fazlasıyla eğlenceli ve sürükleyici olsa da, Wheatley gibi matrak ve dengesiz bi karakteri bizlerle buluşturduğu için bu yapımı ayrı bir seviyorum diyebilirim. Bunların haricinde ilk oyun ile aralarında bulunan dört yıllık süreç, fazlasıyla olumlu sonuç vermiş diyebilirim zira hem grafiksel anlamda hem de mekaniksel anlamda oldukça tatmin edici bir deneyim sunuyor. Grafiklere baktığımızda kaplamaların daha detaylandığını ve efektler konusunda geliştirildiğini açıkça görebiliyoruz. Oynanış dinamikleri ve mekanikleri bakımından da bizleri yenilikler bekliyor. Aperture Science'ın kurucusu olan Cave Johnson'ın en sevdiği buluşlarından birisi olan jeller ile de burada karşılaşıyoruz. Zıplamak için, hızlanmak için ve portal açmak için üç farklı jel çeşidi bulunuyor ki bunları oyunun ilerleyen dönemlerinde görebilirsiniz. Sanırsam bahsetmem gereken her şeyden konuştuğumu düşünüyorum. Oyunda eleştireceğim tek nokta ise ilk oyunda olduğu gibi koşu mekaniğinin bulunmaması. Evet bunun yerine hızlanma jelleri eklendi dediğim gibi fakat oyunun bütününde aktif olarak kullanamıyorsunuz. Bunların dışında üzerinden geçebileceğim başka bir nokta kalmadı sanırım.
