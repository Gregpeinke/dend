Half-Life was a revolutionary game, adding the concept of story telling combined with a Quake/Doom like FPS shooter, all with enhanced graphics and sound effects.\n\n Half-Life spawned many great mods like TFC, CS, DOD, and much more. These mods turned into games, that we are still addicted to til' this day. \n\nThis game is still an awesome experience, and even in 2020, I would still recommend picking this game up if you've never played it before. It's a great opportunity to experience a revolutionary game, and to still be amazed by how well this game holds up. Personally, I still don't think it visually looks that bad. \n\n Before we get into this review, I would like to state that the following with be observed with considering both it's release date and the current date. !!!!THIS IS ALSO MY OPINION!!!!\n\nLet's start.\n\n[h1] HALF-LIFE [/h1]\n\n[b] PRESENTATION 10/10 [/b]\n\n Absolutely classic. An easy to navigate HUD, a fantastic start to the game, and a load of wonderfully designed levels. Half-Life definitely set the bar for games to come.\n\n[b] SOUND 8/10 [/b]\n\n The sound seems standard for it's time. Obviously, today it is far from even medium quality. It's not unbearably bad, but I think the sound is standard and fine for a game from the 90s.\n\n[b] GAMEPLAY 10/10 [/b] \n\n Extremely revolutionary. I can't use that word enough. This style of gameplay changed the world of FPS games forever. There is more to this game than running to rooms and killing monsters. You need to use your brain to get to the next level. Brilliant.\n\n[b] GRAPHICS 10/10 [/b]\n\n I had to go back to games from 1998 and see how HL1 compared. Half-Life definitely blows the other games away with it's awesome detail and effects for it's time. I can't see how it could have looked any better for it's time. \n\n[b] LASTING APPEAL 10/10 [/b]\n\n People are still on. People still play though the game. It has an active speedrun community. Mods are still being developed. Critics still mention it. It has not and will never be forgotten. An absolute classic of a game!\n\n[h1] 9.6/10 FOR THE BEST GAME EVER!

My first true gaming love. In my minds eye, you are this perfectly flawless experience that will forever be amongst my favorite of games. Although I have played through you again multiple times, you have yet to fail at being a fun and engaging experience.\"\n\nHalf Life takes you on an adventure unlike anything its predecessors had done before. There are no cutscenes, there are no loading screens. Everything happens in realtime, from your perspective, with full control over where you are and what you are seeing. This dynamic storytelling was a new concept and was something that really got your blood pumping. Rather than stepping away from the keyboard/controller and just watching, you were living this experience and controlling what happened. This is what makes Half Life so engaging and enjoyable.\n\nIn its day, Half Life was groundbreaking on a graphical scale as well. In comparison to today's games it looks flat, jittery, comically-badly animated, and the explosion sprites are laughable. With all that being said, visuals aren't everything and it is still a great experience. Don't go into this for the graphics, go into it for the nostalgia and fun!\n\nThe game is linear and there isn't much as far as options for completing it, but it has puzzle-like challenges that make you think a bit. Figuring out what button opens this or which tunnel you have to take to get to that is part of the challenge. Not extremely difficulty, but it breaks up the linear-ness of the game and keeps you engaged.\n\nIt's got a MOTHERFUCKING crowbar. That's right, you can bash in some headcrab zombies' skulls until you find yourself a .357 or machinegun. Even after finding a gun, I sometimes prefer to just continue to kill motherfuckers with the motherfucking crowbar.\n\nAll-in-all this is a great game. I would highly suggest playing through it. I got it with the bundle included with my 9600XT back in the day and it was definitely worth the video card upgrade.\n\n~JiX","timestamp_created":1486748044,"timestamp_updated":1486748044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29824643","author":{"steamid":"76561197988954169","num_games_owned":320,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":5208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5203,"last_played":1527207709},"language":"brazilian","review":"Onde tudo começou, apesar de ser lançado em 1998 ainda hoje garante uma boa jogatina, para os fãs da série é indispensável para um bom entendimento de toda a narrativa da história.

It was Valve’s first video game and ran on their first engine, and eventually led to the creation of the now-booming game distribution and social network you're using right now. The graphics are now somewhat outdated, but story and gameplay more than make up for it. There are many installments to the Half-Life series, a couple being Deathmatch and Episode Two, as well as the famous vaporware Half-Life 3.
