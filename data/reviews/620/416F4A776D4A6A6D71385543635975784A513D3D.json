The characters are fun and memorable, the gameplay is amazing, the graphics are on point, its amazing. There are so many things to find in this game from secret rooms left by a previous employee of aperture to little breaks in the game that can reveal new things. \nA bit part of games for me is atmosphere. Make me feel what I might feel if I were in my characters shoes. If something is dark and gloomy, make it so. If something freaky happens, make me afraid. This game gets it. The twists it takes are often hard to see coming, which makes for an absolute blast for your first playthrough and adds to the suspense of playthroughs afterward. \n\nOverall, this game gets a 10/10 in my book.

The learning curve really allows any player to go at their own pace, and the puzzles are not vindictive stumpers that will make you cringe in despair. It is also impossible to get stuck in any nook or cranny on any level due to the care and thought that went into the design of each level. \n\nAside from the main game, it also comes with a free DLC co-op level, and endless downloadable fan-made custom maps that, from my experience, are all extremely well done and planned out just as well as the main game. \n\nThis game is perfect for friends who want to just do some casual gaming together since you can literally stop playing at any point in time without feeling like you will lose a lot of progress. It's also great for the solo gamer who wants to fill their casual gaming time with something much more fulfilling and thought provoking than desktop Solitaire. Portal 2 goes on sale quite often too so really very little reason to not pick this game up. There is so much replay value in this game though that even 20 dollars is a steal.","timestamp_created":1397720689,"timestamp_updated":1397720768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9838516","author":{"steamid":"76561198072159742","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":2385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1542,"last_played":1405206320},"language":"english","review":"Play for the co-op, nothing else","timestamp_created":1397711740,"timestamp_updated":1397711740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9838148","author":{"steamid":"76561198060119848","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1646,"last_played":1648897214},"language":"english","review":"THE BEST GAME MADE BY VALVE AND WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST GAME BY VALVE...

Obviosly it could never live up to the original, but Valve has put a lot of effort in to it. You awake as Chell about twenty years after Portal. The facility is in ruins and you have been in cryosleep the whole time. You are woken up by a small robot named wheatly. He takes you on a tour of the facility. You are then reunited with GlaDOS as you are trying to escape and she sends you on a journey through the testing chambers. Throughout the story you are given clues that there is another person in the facility as you find rooms with writing and pictures coating the wall. During the story we venture to the bowls of the facility and uncover a big secret that can be spoiled by doing one of the achievements. Also just before the ending credits we are treated to a wonderful sight. Overall portal 2 is a great game with little flaw and a great pace.
