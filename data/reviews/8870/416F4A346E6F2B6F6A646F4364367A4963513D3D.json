Лютэс\n\n\n«Bioshock Infinite» — третья  игра из серии «Bioshock», но сюжетом она не сильно связана с прошлыми частями, и вы смело можете начинать знакомство с Вселенной Bioshock’а с Infinite.\n\nТакой глубокой и увлекательной истории, которую нам рассказывает игра, в индустрии не было.\nСценарий BioShock Infinite поначалу кажется в меру банальным и не слишком выдающимся —  Букер Девитт отправляется в летающий город Колумбию, чтобы найти и вернуть на землю некую загадочную девушку Элизабет. Но  сюжет оказывается сложной загадкой и ключ от которой дают только в  конце. Сюжет прекрасен всеми самыми удачными фишками научно-популярного жанра. Здесь найдется место и параллельным вселенным, и квантовым парадоксам, и путешествиям во времени.\n\n\nНичто в Infinite не болтается никому не нужным и  не вызывает раздражения или скуки. «Прокачке» подлежит все: как оружие и способности Девитта, так и его постоянные характеристики — максимальный уровень здоровья, щита и запаса соли. Помимо этого, Букер может надеть на себя одновременно четыре предмета одежды, которые дают ему различные бонусы.\n\n— Я вижу… орла.\n— А я — решку.\n— Здесь всё дело в плоскости.\n— Что ты видишь с этого угла? Жив.\n— А с этого? Мёртв.\n— Та же монета.\n— Но другая плоскость.\n— Орёл.\n— Решка.\n— Мёртв.\n— Жив.\n\nПлюсы:\n- Великолепный сюжет и история, достойные фильма или книги.\n- Шикарная атмосфера, которая привлекает ещё с начала игры.\n- Превосходный дизайн, очень красивая графика.\n- Концовка. Она расставляет всё на места,когда в другое время может сломать мозг\n- Невероятно детальный, проработанный и красивый мир, где уделено внимание разработчиков к каждой детали.\n- Элизабет. Это один из лучших персонажей и напарников\nМинусы:\n- Их нет\n\n\n\nЭта игра оставила мне столько позитивных эмоций,что как и Ведьмак 3 я ее  не забуду!\n\n10 из 10 [/h1]\n","timestamp_created":1487182297,"timestamp_updated":1487182297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":118,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.850682258605957031","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29946391","author":{"steamid":"76561198074446744","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3114,"last_played":1443497568},"language":"english","review":"Note: I played this game on Linux.\n\nThis is the gold standard by which I judge all other video games so far.

Only 2 weapons, no alternate ammo, no unique or visual weapon upgrades, barely any environmental interactivity (like oil spills, pools of water, barrels, etc) and not much choice in passive upgrades like Tonics, just forgettable hats and other minor gear upgrades.\n2-3 Handymen in the entire game, and no Little Sister mechanic just made them another dull enemy to fight. Just a splicer with more health, whereas the Big Daddy was passive until attacked, used mines, and had other abilites (like stomping / turret-throwing). Every Big Daddy felt like a mini boss, and was a challenge / joy to fight, and required a bit of strategy with laying traps and such.\nEven hacking is absent, which, I agree was not the most fun 'minigame', but it was rewarding for hacking doors, vendors, turrets, etc. It added another element of freedom.
