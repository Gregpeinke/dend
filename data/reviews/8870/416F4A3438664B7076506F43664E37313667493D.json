BioShock Infinite [/h2]\n \n [h1] Welcome to Columbia! [/h1]\n \n BioShock 1 & 2 were a huge hit, so they had to release a part 3! Bioshock is very unique just because of the ability to wield different magical powers (known as Vigors) as well as firearms. You can literally change what Vigor you have equipped while on the run! This is a very unique and well-implemented concept that actually kept me indulged in the game. I really hope they release a part four!\n \n [h1] Too….much….INFORMATION! [/h1]\n \n [h3][b][u] Storyline [/u][/b][/h3]\n \n Please do not attack me since I haven’t played BioShock 1 & 2. Well, mostly because their graphics were a bit too outdated for my taste! [spoiler]I swear I will play & finish both of them one day! ☹[/spoiler]. So, the story was a bit too sudden & confusing for me. It felt like I was immediately thrown into war after waking up from a good night's sleep. Hence, do not do the same mistake as I did & please play the previous parts before playing BioShock Infinite. Here’s a short introduction to the story (of course, it is certainly [spoiler]spoiler-free[/spoiler]):\n \n [i] You play as Booker DeWitt who is tasked with retrieving a certain “Girl” (who goes by the name “Elizabeth) from the alternate reality floating city of Colombia. It all seems like a walk-in-the-park until a security guard identifies him as a “False Shepherd” from the letters “AD” which were branded on his hand & now each & every cop & mechanical security bots are after his ass. Will he rescue the maiden and escape with his life or will he fail & fall into the hands of the antagonist? [/i]\n \n In my opinion, the story was beautifully woven & it isn’t a very forgettable plot. Each & every character leaves an emotional impact on the player. I really love games where the storylines are unforgettable! \n\n [h3][b][u]Vigors [/u][/b][/h3]\n \n Vigors are the main charm of the game. You may ask, what in the world are Vigors? So, Vigors are basically bottled superpowers. You can find Vigor bottles literally lying around (I mean, bruh, those are superpowers that have the ability to kill people, why the hell would you leave them lying around just like that?) or you can buy them from vending machines & upon drinking them, you get the respective power. These powers can be used in battles and also for support like burning something, giving an electric jolt to a piece of machinery, etc.\n \n Although these may sound a bit too overpowered, they obviously have limitations. They require “fuel” to be used. In this case, the fuel required to use Vigors is nothing but Salt. Again, you can find salt at random places or buy it from vending machines. You can upgrade each Vigor twice using the Silver Eagle coins you collect. \n \n The game has a total of 8 Vigors as follows: \n \n [table]\n[tr]\n              [th]Vigor[/th]\n              [th]Description[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n              [td]Bucking Bronco[/td]\n              [td]Ground/Earth related Vigor.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n              [td]Murder of Crows[/td]\n              [td]You can control crows and use them to attack enemies.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n              [td]Shock Jockey[/td]\n              [td]Electricity.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n              [td]Devil's Kiss[/td]\n              [td]Manipulate & Generate Fire.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n              [td]Possession[/td]\n              [td]Possess machinery allowing you to turn foes into allies.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n              [td]Charge[/td]\n              [td]Allows you to literally Ram into enemies at high speed & dealing a lot of damage.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n              [td]Return to Sender[/td]\n              [td]As the name suggests, cast a shield that absorbs incoming gunfire & fires it back.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n              [td]Undertow[/td]\n              [td]Allows you to either push away or pull in entities.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n \n [h3][b][u]Weapons & Gunplay[/u][/b][/h3]\n \n One of the first weapons you get is a Skyhook, which is actually a transportation tool that allows you to zoom through the Zip-lines. You can also use it to brutally kill enemies. This weapon is passively equipped and is the only melee weapon you can wield. \n \n There are a total of 13 firearms you can use. Each of them is unique & has completely different properties. But the one thing they have in common is that the bullets literally have no bullet drop. Well, you can’t obviously snipe with the pistol as the bullets disappear after travelling a particular distance, but it means the weapons are a bit too accurate in close & mid-ranged combat. Each weapon has its own ammo type & the weapon itself can be upgraded up to 4 times using Silver Eagles. \n \n [h1]Pros[/h1]\n [list]\n [*] Very interesting storyline of a decent length.\n [*] A unique concept of using Vigors & Tears.\n [*] Combat is very fun & intense.\n [*] Pleasant visuals & audio.\n [*] Characters that leave an emotional impact.\n [*] A very beautiful & mind-blowing ending that’s hard to forget.\n [*] A lot of content in the game. \n [*] Other Game modes are included in the form of DLCs, hence adding to the hours you can extract from this game.\n [/list] \n \n [h1]Cons[/h1]\n [list]\n [*] The game lacks in save points. \n [*] The story kinda goes haphazardly towards the end which might confuse you. It actually diverts from the initial main plot & kinda becomes a huge mess.\n [*] No re-playability value in the main game unless you want to collect all the collectibles or try it in another difficulty mode.\n [/list]\n \n [h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\n \n I regret not playing the previous parts. I thought this game was very overrated at first, but playing it made me understand why it gained such a reputation. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute I invested in the game although it became a bit of a mess in the end, plot-wise. It’s best to grab this game through the Bioshock Collection bundle as you get all three games & DLCs at a very good price. But please do not buy the game & DLCs separately.

[/h1]\n\nBishock Infinite - невероятно классная игра (как и большая часть остальных игр серии). Лично я с самого начала скептично относился к играм биошока. Летающий город казался чем-то невероятным, но не затягивающим. Как же я ошибался когда думал что это очередной тир. Игра не только о том, как ты стреляешь по жестянкам, которые, почему-то, стреляют в ответ, отнюдь. Это игра про сюжет как и остальные части, а сюжет здесь мало кого разочарует. \n\n\"Чего ты вообще хвалишь её и ничего не приводишь как аргумент своего 12/10?\" - спросит кто-нибудь. А я, как average Bioshock enjoyer расскажу с самого начала достоинства именно этой части.\n1. Возможно это только мой личный вкус, но игра крайне красивая. Колумбия чертовски красивая.\n2. В этой игре действительно есть мясные моменты когда ты без патронов с одним аэрокрюком бежишь в толпу врагов что бы отхилиться в рукопашной.\n3. Вы когда-нибудь представляли какого на огромной скорости на аэротрассе держать картечницу наперевес и стрелять в ботов, которые охотно прячутся за укрытиями от тебя, будто от какой-то кары свыше.\nИ многое многое другое. Игра настолько разнообразна и хороша, что помимо экшн моментов, описанных выше, есть крайне много плюсов сюжета. Но о них я, конечно же, не расскажу, ибо спойлер.\n\nВ общем, могу посоветовать игру каждому, а так же могу посоветовать проходить её на максимальной сложности.

Это было непередаваемо, проходил одновременно и на пс4 на английском и в шикарной русской озвучке на ПК, озвучка 5+! Жаль в ремастере русского нет. Если без спойлеров ( глупо да но я бы не хотел тем кто не играл всё портить) игра кидает твистами с середины и под конец игры, в двух длс,и полная картина закрывается когда всё сходится и оказывается что infinite по-сути приквел к первому bioshock . Стрельба улучшена и совсем новый мир, фишки типа аэрорельс просто нечто, живые по настоящему живые персонажи, один из лучших нпс ( Элизабет) в играх на её плечах считай всё повествование и записях собранных в округе.
