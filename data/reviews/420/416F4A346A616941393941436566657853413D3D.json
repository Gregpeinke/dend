Vediamo i ribelli in un mondo ormai post apocalittico, combattere con le ultime forze Combine rimaste. Una campagna estremamente dinamica e molto più avvincente rispetto a HL2 Ep. 1. Le ambientazioni sono molto particolari: usciremo infatti da City 17, per immergerci nella natura grazie a White Forest. Per quanto riguarda il gameplay non ci sono cambiamenti.

I played through the game twice (100%ing the achievements), including that level, but my experience didn't change. That battle is annoying for several reasons:\n[list]\n[*]too long, 2 or 3 striders would have been enough, thank you. Avoiding player fatigue seemed a big deal in the game and its predecessors, but here you have to kill 10+ striders in a row, accompanied by lots of hunters??\n[*]alot of weapon switching between the adhesive striderbusters and a handgun to hit those when they stick to a strider\n[*]switching in and out of the car all the time\n[*]going back and forth to pick up a striderbuster and put it in your car (ONE AT A TIME) and go back to a strider, rinse and repeat. That's not an enjoyable part of the battle, that's just tedious\n[*]the accompanying hunters are annoying to kill because there are so many, with or without the car. Running them over with the car is hit and miss, it might have been better if the car had a 3rd person view. Killing them with weapons is tedious, they are bullet sponges. Killing them with the gravity gun and some heavy object is ok but you have to get close to them, and the distances in that level are big if you are on foot. More \"in and out of the car\"...\n[/list]\n\nSo the strider battle has no flow, you constantly switch between combat and hurrying back to collect one single striderbuster, switch into and out of your car, look at the radar to find out you have to drive to the other end of the map for the n-th time.\n\nThe good thing about that battle was the precomputed physical destruction of those buildings. And the environment looks nice.\n\nIn the developer's commentary they say that this level was the longest in production and they had to put alot of work into it to make it work. They even had to tweak the autosave mechanism. That is a sure way to tell you're on the wrong path, putting too much awkward effort into making something work that just doesn't really work. I think they should have ditched the idea early on and thought of something else as a climactic battle.\n\nIn the developers' commentary they often say that they cut stuff or switched to another idea when something didn't work. This should have been such an occasion, too. But appparently they weren't so flexible here for some reason. I wonder what happened.\n\nSorry this review hits hard on that strider battle level that stands out for me as weaker than the rest.\nBecause the rest of the game is great nonetheless.","timestamp_created":1447867758,"timestamp_updated":1447870294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19142964","author":{"steamid":"76561198085477871","num_games_owned":1113,"num_reviews":186,"playtime_forever":282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":282,"last_played":1463940147},"language":"english","review":"Dankest Steam appid ever.","timestamp_created":1447847173,"timestamp_updated":1447847173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483793348073959351","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19140670","author":{"steamid":"76561198016686323","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":267,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":267,"last_played":1447827882},"language":"english","review":"Don't play and fall into the loophole of players praying everyday to Gaben for the next game.","timestamp_created":1447827952,"timestamp_updated":1447827952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19129730","author":{"steamid":"76561198111598586","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1433583600},"language":"english","review":"it been nearlly nine years and episode 3 isnt out yet...","timestamp_created":1447771675,"timestamp_updated":1447771675,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524844110012054443","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19126153","author":{"steamid":"76561198250726064","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":138,"last_played":1447611017},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life 2: Episode Two очень замечательная игра.

Кроме лесных территорий, игрок пройдёт заброшенные шахты, гнездо муравьиных львов и ракетную базу — все эти локации так же будут отличаться своей масштабностью.\n\nВо втором эпизоде нет такого сосредоточения на кооперативной игре, как в первом: хотя сюжетно игрок проходит всю игру вместе со своей напарницей Аликс Вэнс, во многих игровых событиях она по тем или иным причинам не принимает участия. Кроме Аликс, игроку предстоит сражаться бок о бок с дружественными вортигонтами.\n\nВ Episode Two был немного изменён инвентарь игрока: фонарик теперь работает на независимой от HEV-костюма Фримена батарее. Разработчики расширили круг использования гравипушки: помимо применения её вместе с бомбами для страйдеров, было добавлено множество новых объектов, которые можно запускать во врага.","timestamp_created":1447582728,"timestamp_updated":1447582728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19084402","author":{"steamid":"76561198132263650","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":229,"last_played":1447804231},"language":"brazilian","review":"Ótimo jogo.
