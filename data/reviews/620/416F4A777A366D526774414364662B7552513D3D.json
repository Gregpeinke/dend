The fact that Valve usually don't make more than 2 of a franchise pretty much guarantees this is this is the last iteration Portal will see, so I am glad this game turned out as well as it did.\nIt is best to end with a bang.\nFirst of all, the graphics had some touch-up from the last game, and the physics seem a bit more real-to-life(well, as real to life a game about portals can get). Second, the story of this game adds so many layers and questions upon what Portal had to offer, which keeps it just as interesting as its predecessor, if not more so. Finally, the inclusion of not only a level editor, but also a multiplayer mode and a much longer campaign make this game worth twice the price tag it's placed at. I would call it flawless(even the minute issue I had with the loadtimes was at least somewhat fixed).\n\nPros:\n+Plenty of content this time around\n+Interesting story which builds upon the plot of the original, leaving the player plenty of story questions to think about\n+Lovable characters make a return, and the game introduces a great deal of new ones as well\n+Level Editor with a bit of a learning curve, but is pretty easy to make basic stuff with\n+New Multiplayer Mode\n+Better graphics than the previous game\n+Space Core.
