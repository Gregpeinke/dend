Дойдя до конца могу сказать-игра прекрасна, лучшая для своего времени, ведь тогда это было что-то нестандартное среди обычных коридорных шутеров. Халф-лайф может похвастаться хорошим и продуманным сюжетом со своими тайнами, разнообразием оружия и противников, загадками разного плана, неплохим музыкальным сопровождением и прочее.

tips before playing:\n\nUncheck \"Enable HD models if available\" in Video Options. \nUncheck \"Auto-Aim\" in Mouse Options unless you want to use a controller.\n\nThe HD models look different to the original models, so I think it is better to not use them so you experience the original art style rather than something different. Also, the HD models don't really fit in with the low resolution map textures in the game.\n\nSet the resolution to something low-ish like 1024x768 resolution. I would recommend not using widescreen for the sake of compatibility. One thing to note is that low resolutions scale surprisingly well on 4k monitors - I think valve implemented some in-game scaling that basically makes the game window the same size as your desktop resolution even though the in-game resolution is much lower.\n\nOh yeah, and keep in mind that you have to press ctrl right after pressing space to get into some parts of the levels like vents and tall ledges or going on top of boxes - I had long pauses between some parts of my play-through and I kind of forgot that you could do this until I got stuck and remembered it again.\n\n\nReview:\n\nHalf-Life is a very good 1st-person shooter. \nThe level design is generally very good, and the way each level flows onto the next is practically seamless - it's quite an immersive game. The world building is pretty well done, and the art design looks quite good. \n\nThe game-play is quick and fun, with some cool puzzles that take advantage of the game's mechanics.\n\nStory-wise it is interesting but the story doesn't have much depth - what sells this game story-wise is the combination of both the world building of the levels and the interesting dialogue even though there is no clear narrative. The ending to HL1 is anticlimactic, but in a good way - it ends with a pretty cool twist. Anyway, Half-Life isn't the type of series where you will expect a detailed story but it does get more story-focused in the later chapters of the series - it becomes more of a character-driven story rather than a plot-driven story.\n\nThe biggest problem with Half-Life is that it peaks half-way through and the last few levels are worse in quality - but it's not such a big problem as even the worst levels are still pretty decent in terms of gameplay and in terms of world-building and immersiveness are just as good as the previous levels.\n\nI have to say, Half-Life is one of my favourite 1st person shooters if not my favourite. It has the perfect balance between gunplay, puzzle-solving, and exploration and it never gets boring - although the Xen levels can get a bit tedious at times. \nOverall, I give Half-Life a 9/10. It is near-perfect.\n\n-End of Review-\n\n\n-EXTRA-\n\nI thought I might as well place a little comment at the end here comparing Half-Life 1 with Half-Life 2, as I don't think I can be bothered writing a review for HL2.\n\nIn terms of level design: \n\nHL1 is better as it has a pretty good balance between linear and non-linear sections. HL1 also rewards exploration of levels so levels feel bigger than they actually are. If you think about it, HL1 is actually pretty linear compared to something like Doom 1 but it makes up for it by having rather large levels for the puzzle and platforming sections, and the linearity is better in some aspects as the time length between fun parts of the game never gets long thanks to the scripted events while in a game like Doom there can be a lot of tedious backwards and forwards lengthening the time between each combat encounter. Comparatively, HL2 is a lot more linear with levels that strongly resemble long corridors - whether this is bad or not depends on your preferences. For some people having less detailed levels might be better for enjoyment - perhaps they prefer gameplay over exploration.\n\nNow, what about gameplay? \n\nHalf-Life is a series that is famous for its varied gameplay. Compared to games like Doom 1 which mainly consist of running and shooting - the half-life series has a lot more mechanics in play like using objects to solve more complex puzzles or having underwater parts in levels. HL1 is both better and worse than HL2 - on one hand it has better shooting mechanics, but on the other hand HL2 has a LOT of physics-based mechanics and a greater variety in the gameplay. If you like having pure variety, HL2 has variety in spades. Whether the mechanics are used well or not depends on the levels - in HL1 you have a few mechanics that are used extensively in larger well-designed levels, while in HL2 you have a lot of mechanics that are used occasionally in smaller levels. HL2 can't help but feel a bit gimmicky at times with its mechanics - this isn't necessarily a bad thing and at the time the newness of its mechanics did a great job at selling the game to people. Nowadays though, HL2 feels a bit less new which reduces its appeal a little bit compared to how it was back in the day - but it's gameplay is still just as fun even though it lacks that \"wow\" factor now. In my opinion, HL1 has aged a bit better as even though its object physics aren't as good as HL2 the platforming and gunplay is more refined and I prefer the level design and unique art style. In my opinion HL1 is better than HL2, but I fully understand why people would prefer HL2 as HL2 does have a lot to offer that HL1 does not.\n\nNow I say that \"HL1 has aged a bit better\", well this is not exactly the case. In my opinion the core gameplay (player movement and gunplay) has aged pretty well, but there are 3 things where half life hasn't aged that well:\n1. Graphics. This is probably the biggest one. Now, graphics =\\= gameplay however the fact of the matter is a lot of people prefer having newer and better graphics - people tend to like the new more than the old. Half-Life's textures for the most part are good enough (and the polygons high enough) to be immersive, however every now and then there is a very low resolution texture that can break immersion. In my opinion the textures are *just* good enough, any lower and I would probably say that Duke Nukem 3Ds pixel art looks better. The textures are high resolution enough to be immersive and low resolution enough to use your imagination - I would say that it is just about good enough for modern standards. However, I feel like, in the distant future, games like Doom 1 and 2 will probably age better graphically due to their pixel art style.\n2. NPCs and AI. The NPCs are rather simplistic in Half-Life and the animations are pretty old school. The biggest issue is that when you get an NPC to follow you in Half-Life they don't always behave as you would expect.\n3. The physics. Moving boxes is a bit unintuitive in Half-Life, you can't really pick them up you have to shift them side to side.\nWhen you compare this to half-life 2 - HL2 does feel superior in these aspects. HL2 has timeless graphics using complex shaders which look more than realistic enough to be immersive - although sometimes there is the occasional blurry texture. It scales better with high resolutions (running 4k resolution is a non-issue although the menu scaling is a bit off - this is not an issue if you primarily use quick-save to save the game). The biggest advantage of HL2 is the NPCs - the animations are practically flawless, especially the facial animations. Every NPC feels like a real person - HL2 is well ahead of its time in this regard. HL2 manages to be more immersive overall compared to HL1. In terms of physics HL2 feels more sandboxy you can put objects into different orientations by making them fall off ledges, which you can use to accomplish different tasks, although sometimes it breaks immersion when there are invisible walls in the way.\nIn terms of gameplay - I personally found that the little quirks of HL1 such as the simple NPCs and weird physics made the game more interesting - it's kind of fun to mess around with NPCs. HL1 feels more mystical rather than realistic.","timestamp_created":1577685450,"timestamp_updated":1586832891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536516845226287842","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60890452","author":{"steamid":"76561198976383613","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":248,"last_played":1612850183},"language":"english","review":"best half life game, only bad thing is a lack of workshop. better than half life 2 in every way, the only good thing in half life two was the gravity gun.","timestamp_created":1577684649,"timestamp_updated":1577684649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60890139","author":{"steamid":"76561198956833539","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1652098001},"language":"russian","review":"конечно рекомендую, это же халф лайф","timestamp_created":1577684215,"timestamp_updated":1577684215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60889653","author":{"steamid":"76561198029055417","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":338,"last_played":1577750685},"language":"english","review":"Playing for the first time in 2019, this game is absolutely worth the $1 that I paid for it","timestamp_created":1577683520,"timestamp_updated":1577683520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60889600","author":{"steamid":"76561198208727339","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":121,"playtime_forever":814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1611417728},"language":"russian","review":"Бессловно великая игра, породившая гигантов(CS и т.д)\nИгра пройдена за 8 часов на 100%","timestamp_created":1577683452,"timestamp_updated":1577683452,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60883722","author":{"steamid":"76561198811904124","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":2718,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2236,"last_played":1631548961},"language":"latam","review":"Si amigaso es el HL, que esperas para tenerlo","timestamp_created":1577675489,"timestamp_updated":1577675489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60883149","author":{"steamid":"76561198107285639","num_games_owned":399,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":446,"last_played":1597792839},"language":"spanish","review":"un clasico   10/10  estaria bueno que le pusieran mods o que tuviera  cromos y logros","timestamp_created":1577674702,"timestamp_updated":1577674702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578544080257415771","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60882154","author":{"steamid":"76561198971433658","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":2800,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1652014542},"language":"english","review":"fun","timestamp_created":1577673382,"timestamp_updated":1651677522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60881975","author":{"steamid":"76561198187246702","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":684,"last_played":1603826960},"language":"english","review":"good game\n","timestamp_created":1577673151,"timestamp_updated":1577673151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60880139","author":{"steamid":"76561198359248117","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1465,"last_played":1578145834},"language":"english","review":"Still as fresh as when I played it with my kids all those years ago.
