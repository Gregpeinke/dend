Ich habe mir das Spiel im Steamsale für 0.99€ gekauft. \nBereue ich den Kauf? : Nein\nWürde ich mir Portal nochmal kaufen? : Ja\nWürde ich den Normal-Preis von 9.99€ dafür bezahlen? : Sicherlich nicht!\nSind wir mal ehrlich: Portal ist kein schlechtes Spiel. Es mag zwar schon ein Wenig in die Jahre gekommen sein, da es schon seit 10 Jahren auf dem Markt ist (Erschienen 2007), macht aber trotzdem vieles Richtig. Es ist ein Puzzle-Spiel wie es im Buche steht, welches durch die revolutionäre Idee von Portalen ein neues Spielgefühl bekommt. \nNegativ ist, dass man sich eingentlich die ganze Zeit von Kammer zu Kammer fortarbeitet. Dies gibt zwar relativ eindeutig die Richtung vor, hinterlässt aber nach einiger Zeit ein sehr beklemmendes Gefühl. Gut, dass ich trotz Trödeln nach gut 2 Stunden das Spiel beendet hatte. \nPositiv für mich war der sehr stumpfe Humor. Er hat zwar bei mir auf einen Nerv getroffen, aber es ist möglich, dass Andere nicht so viel damit anfangen können.\nWas ist auch noch in meine Review aufnehmen wollte ist, dass man wohl keinerlei Probleme an den einzelnen Testkammern haben wird.

The complete lack of ANY communication for TEN YEARS is completly disgusting, It is disrepectful to the fans who supported valve for years. Its sad that valve doesnt even have the courtesy to tell their fans that half life is dead. It is clear that we will never get a satisfying ending to an amazing story. I personally am not interested in anything valve has released since Episode 2, and if the single player story driven masterpieces of recent years are anything to go by, its that valve only cares about its games as service titles, and not their narative driven campaigns. I am deeply upset that we will never get to explore the atmospheric and exciting universe of half life again. Valve prides themselves on their independance and flat workplace structure, but its clear there is a lack of focus.
