2 is the best puzzle game I HAVE EVER PLAYED (YET). I extremely recommend playing Portal before this, as it helps with the story-line. The game is hilarious, with GLaDOS and Wheatly making you laugh. Also the funniest single-player game I have ever played. On that note, there is a co-op mode. I haven't done much of it, but it looks amazing.

For the new people...\n\nThis game is very true to the original plot to the game, and so much more; there's a lot of hints to the original game, even all the way in the beginning of test chamber 00, when you see the test chambers are deteriorating, and what I mean by this is that there is moss on the walls, plant vines hanging down, etc. And I don't mean that in a negative way; in fact, I personally love the look of something aged, especially like this. Another awesome factor is when one segment of the game (SPOILER ALERT), is when the protagonist [Chell], ends up in the OLD Aperture Science Lab, where she witnesses the beginnings of the test chambers, and (from what I believe is) her father, as well as Caroline, before she turned into GLaDOS, after [former CEO] Cave Johnson fell deathly ill after moon rock poisoning.\n\nTL;DR - If you played the original game, I HIGHLY recommend it. 100/100","timestamp_created":1588194568,"timestamp_updated":1588194568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68262466","author":{"steamid":"76561198025711551","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":557,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":557,"last_played":1588194239},"language":"french","review":"Un chef d'oeuvre","timestamp_created":1588194251,"timestamp_updated":1588194251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68261881","author":{"steamid":"76561199030402785","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":392,"last_played":1588193411},"language":"english","review":"this game is so bad, you cant even sleep or craft like in minecraft. you also cant mine and there is no day or night cycle. smh","timestamp_created":1588193475,"timestamp_updated":1588193475,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.386554867029190063","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68261473","author":{"steamid":"76561198274466854","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1295,"last_played":1588381777},"language":"english","review":"Going into Portal 2 I was skeptical that it could live up to the innovative mechanics, unique aesthetic, and riveting storytelling of the original.

The story is larger than the first and their is a new cooperative mode that is a lot of fun to play with friends. My favorite part of the game is how they went with a rusty and grungy aesthetic to completely counter the clean and robotic feel of the original.\nOverall, if you have played the original and have not played Portal 2 you must give it a try!

Fun and memorable characters and story, and despite it's single-track nature, it has a lot of replay value because there are so many small details that you're bound to miss the first time you play. It's an excellent continuation to the story of the first game - though you may have to discover some of the details yourself. The environments are done beautifully and are overwhelmingly claustrophobic at times. As I feel, this could be classified as psychological horror, as there are multiple locations in the game which, regardless of how many times I had previously been in or around them or whether an active threat was present, triggered my fight or flight response and made me panic. This is probably just me, though.
