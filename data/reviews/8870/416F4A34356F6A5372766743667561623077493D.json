After giving it another chance it's safe to say it has more problems than just that. Honestly, the base game just plays badly and becomes tedious quickly.\n\nGood stuff:\n+ The setting yields some impressive setpieces, particularly at the start which benefits from exceptional world-building. \n+ The Skyhook mechanic is pretty cool for the most part - it's quite enjoyable to just ride around and jump at enemies to slap them or blast them off the map.\n+ Infinite does have some interesting characters. Elizabeth in particular is a standout - her ability to open 'tears' is pretty interesting both plot- and gameplay-wise, even if the latter doesn't actually amount to much more than \"press button to spawn a scripted object that might help you\".\n\nBad stuff:\n- It's mind-boggling how bad a lot of the actual gameplay locations are given the possibilities afforded by the setting. You'll often forget you're in a city floating in the air because you'll be doing a lot of the fighting in boring streets and builds interiors which could've been located in any run-of-the-mill city. Instead of utilising the setting to its fullest potential, they filled the game with places which are undoubtedly pretty but really generic in terms of gameplay. In the first two games, I did not forget about the setting which was oozing with character. But here? I'd say about half was completely forgettable.\n- The core gameplay loop is an incredible downgrade from Bioshock 1 & 2. Loads of things are simplified to the extreme or removed completely. There's no hacking, no manual saving, no special currency to purchase powers or their upgrades. You can only hold 2 weapons at a time and their upgrades are rudimentary and boring. You'll often need to run around the level trying to pick ammo or new weapons mid-fight; fortunately the powers are alright so they'll often be your main source of damage. There really isn't a lot of strategy to the combat in this game. In most places you can get by with spamming powers and just headshotting enemies peeking from behind cover.\n- It's hard to say much about the plot without giving it away, so let me just put it this way - it tries really hard to seem smart but if you look beyond the surface level, it doesn't really mean much. This problem is at least partially rectified but the two 'Burial at Sea' DLCs, but that's a separate topic.\n- The game's performance isn't great - I've had some significant hitches throughout the campaign. That's not ok for a game that's 8 years old.","timestamp_created":1616625811,"timestamp_updated":1616625811,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501994967460632324","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89028695","author":{"steamid":"76561198100955424","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":69,"playtime_at_review":585,"last_played":1660431722},"language":"turkish","review":".","timestamp_created":1616625115,"timestamp_updated":1616625115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89025474","author":{"steamid":"76561198820239890","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1109,"last_played":1587942676},"language":"latam","review":"Llegué a jugar los primeros dos títulos de \"Bioshock\" y la verdad siempre me quedé con las ganas de jugar el \"Infinite\". \n\nAhora que pude probarlo, además de terminar su historia principal, debo admitir fue una de las mejores historias que he jugado en toda mi vida.\n\nAdemás, contiene una jugabilidad sumamente adictiva y divertida. \n\n¡Muy recomendado!; un must si te gustan los first person shooters con historias y mecánicas atractivas. \n\n","timestamp_created":1616620502,"timestamp_updated":1616620502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89024847","author":{"steamid":"76561199015490490","num_games_owned":585,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":92,"last_played":1616753159},"language":"german","review":"patrick lied","timestamp_created":1616619651,"timestamp_updated":1616619651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89023624","author":{"steamid":"76561199068190506","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":721,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":719,"last_played":1616618163},"language":"spanish","review":"yo los shippeaba lpm","timestamp_created":1616618005,"timestamp_updated":1616618005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89021367","author":{"steamid":"76561198967609546","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1616636476},"language":"russian","review":"абоба","timestamp_created":1616615153,"timestamp_updated":1616615153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89019183","author":{"steamid":"76561198198241122","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":617,"last_played":1621410201},"language":"english","review":"I've finally got a chance to play this. oh how the wait was worth it. it's not Bioshock 3, but its a great game! 10/10","timestamp_created":1616612473,"timestamp_updated":1616612473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89017267","author":{"steamid":"76561199004361125","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1231,"last_played":1615555071},"language":"russian","review":"Увы и ах,но это самое главное разочарование фанатов серии.Абсолютно беззубое,кастрированное и самое главное что это игра пустышка сама по себе и с сиротским твистом под конец игры.Красят только монтаж звука и работа дизайнеров-художников.","timestamp_created":1616610089,"timestamp_updated":1616610318,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89016221","author":{"steamid":"76561198219759673","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":471,"last_played":1618408887},"language":"english","review":"Game is an absolute masterpiece.

There are great ideas here. Interesting concepts, likeable characters and a beautiful setting; But none of it comes together all that well and many things are never given any depth or fleshing out at all. The combat isn't exceptionally exciting, the story feels like large swathes were cut out of it and many of the games systems are unrewarding or contradictory to each other. There are certainly good things here, but they don't outweigh the bad for me. \n\nBioshock Infinite is a pale shadow of its predecessors and whether this is due to destructive executive meddling, clashing creative differences, both, or neither I don't know; But the game has suffered greatly for it. I've read the artbook, which overflows with all kinds of interesting and striking ideas. Why so few of them ended up in the final product I don't know. Don't play Bioshock Infinite if you enjoyed Bioshock 1 or 2, because it's nothing like them. Play it if an unexceptional shooter with gorgeous environments and an alright story sounds like something you're in the mood for.","timestamp_created":1616557418,"timestamp_updated":1616557418,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515494942665100098","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88971155","author":{"steamid":"76561198071606299","num_games_owned":996,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2510,"last_played":1615765056},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is definetly among the best games I've ever played.

Jestem fanem gier, które stoją na wysokim poziomie fabularnym. Wymieniona produkcja do takich właśnie należy. \nBioshock to gra typu FPS. Podstawowym jej elementem jest strzelanie i eliminowanie wrogów. Każdy fan takiej rozgrywki powinien być zadowolony. Duży arsenał broni, szczypta nadprzyrodzonych umiejętności, urozmaica i wzbogaca przygodę. \nGłównym i według mnie najlepszym elementem gry jest świetnie napisana historia. Poruszany jest tutaj wątek tzw. wszechświatów równoległych. Grając, mamy coraz więcej pytań i bardzo mało odpowiedzi. Pogmatwana historia pełna zwrotów akcji czyni to dzieło bardzo ciekawym i wciągającym. Spędziłem te kilkanaście godzin bardzo dobrze, nawet przez moment się nie nudząc. Świetna historia, charyzmatyczni bohaterowie, piękny, barwny i zarazem tajemniczy świat w który można wsiąknąć do głębii- to główny atut produkcji. Fabuła wciąga tak bardzo, że grę można skończyć \"jednym tchem\". Wspaniała historia osadzona w fikcyjnym świecie wśród chmur, pochłąneła mnie, zaskoczyła, dała wiele do myślenia. Jestem ogromnie usatysfakcjonowany tą przygodą. Piękne lokacje, ładna grafika, świetna optymalizacja, stanowi dobre tło do niesamowicie napisanej fabuły. Minusów brak- serdecznie polecam każdemu, kto uwielbia ekscentryczne
