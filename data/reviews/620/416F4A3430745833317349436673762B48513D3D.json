High tech machines working nearby, inmense descruction surrounding you, and environment detail gives the eye candy that any high graphical gamer is seeking. In addition, the audio is well designed. From robotic voices to collapsing buildings, the audio in it will not disappoint you. \n\nStory:\n~~~~~\nBefore reviewing the story, have in mind that I have not played Portal 1. I can not provide any helpful information that can link the 2 video games. For portal 2, however, I like to see the story from two different perspectives. The main plot is well designed and written, the side characters are well developed, and the humor in it is done correctly. You will find the story itself quiet interesting and hilarious as you progress into the game. However, the overall setting is never explained. It will leave you wondering (not a whole lot) after completion of the game. \n\nGame-Play:\n~~~~~~~~~\nThe game-play in portal 2 is very puzzling (really that's what the game is all about). If you come here expecting to have some shooting and action, you will not get it. Although you do encounter enemies on your way, it is not Portal 2's main purpose. It requires you to solve puzzles by creating portals that will allow you to teleport from one place to another. At times, you may believe that the game already has everything that it can possibly offer, but then you encounter new mechanics that make the puzzles crazier and more strategic. \n\nOther Things:\n~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe online workshop adds on a lot of user created maps. Even after you complete the game, if you are still enjoying the puzzles, you can download plenty of user created maps. You can even create your own. It also allows you to complete puzzles with friends which adds on the puzzles' difficulty since it requires for both players to work togethere (Have in mind some friends won't easly cooperate with you!).\n\nOverall:\n~~~~~~\nPortal 2 is an amazing game. Its first person and puzzle mechanics make it very unique. If you love puzzles, you are missing out on Portal 2. I personally recommend it, and if I could rate it. I would rate it a 9 out of 10.\n\nI hope this review helps (It's my first review!).","timestamp_created":1385959747,"timestamp_updated":1385960019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7875809","author":{"steamid":"76561197992994186","num_games_owned":574,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":520,"last_played":1378923572},"language":"brazilian","review":"Eu sempre sou cético com continuações, pois os riscos de ser apenas uma repetição dos jogos anteriores da franquia são altos.

What games are pieces of art. this piece of art is a master piece from the visual astetics, to the mind blowing story line. the characters are the most memorable of them all and the atmosphere is so sad and dreary it just pulls you in and you can't stop playing. i actually engaged in it and it brought me to a whole new world which was just quite the expirence. Also, the co-op is a blast to play with friends and to just mess around and have fun. i recomend this game to everyone cause anyone can get into it and if i may mention its gameplay is so so so so so so good! real thing for me that got me into though, was the characters and the atmosphere which i don't play games for those reasons, but this one made me. In short, just buy it.","timestamp_created":1385941052,"timestamp_updated":1468977025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7872528","author":{"steamid":"76561198106449013","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61,"last_played":1402880631},"language":"english","review":"Complicated, lots of fun, great dialogue, and it actually connects back to Portal 1.","timestamp_created":1385940557,"timestamp_updated":1385940557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7872290","author":{"steamid":"76561197988515881","num_games_owned":354,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":734,"last_played":1656872408},"language":"brazilian","review":"Esse jogo é muito inteligente e viciante.\n","timestamp_created":1385939522,"timestamp_updated":1385939522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7871995","author":{"steamid":"76561198055633621","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":860,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":703,"last_played":1440361394},"language":"english","review":"Sick game","timestamp_created":1385938320,"timestamp_updated":1385938320,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497024804353713989","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7871982","author":{"steamid":"76561198006899117","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2587,"last_played":1497684479},"language":"english","review":"Story mode is a blast and picks up where the first left off.

There is also a multiplayer option to this game, you and your friend can solve puzzles together, these puzzles can only be completed with your friend so you'll have to figure out what you have to do, and what your friend has to do. Depending on who is player 1 or 2 your characters are 2 different robots. Player 1 is the small robot named Atlas, and Player 2 is the tall robot named P-Body. Atlas has 2 differents shades of blue with his portal gun and P-Body has 2 different shades of orange with his portal gun. The singleplayer campaign is very fun (except for the puzzles that I mentioned earlier they can be frustrating but they can be fun also) the funniest part of the campaign is the voice actor for a small robot named Wheatly he has a really funny voice and says lots of funny things he is voice by Stephen Merchant. Anyway this game is very fun and exciting I would definately recommend it to all my friends and anyone else. 10/10 Because of... well baisically what I just said. This is a must buy! Thank you for reading my review. :) ~DQSwordz","timestamp_created":1385923319,"timestamp_updated":1386016724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7867893","author":{"steamid":"76561198070580292","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1106,"last_played":1378908038},"language":"russian","review":"Good game ^)","timestamp_created":1385923054,"timestamp_updated":1385923054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7867646","author":{"steamid":"76561198082532492","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":327,"last_played":1427564297},"language":"swedish","review":"Dem puzzles","timestamp_created":1385922336,"timestamp_updated":1385922336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7867527","author":{"steamid":"76561198037102510","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":742,"last_played":1635080474},"language":"russian","review":"Вэлв ,как всегда, на высоте","timestamp_created":1385921957,"timestamp_updated":1385921957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7867454","author":{"steamid":"76561198016309691","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1143,"last_played":1485614956},"language":"french","review":"Le genre de jeu qu'on aimerait voir plus souvent.
