It was absolute trash and, thanks to it, we never saw another PoP game again. Well... 2K kind of did the same thing to the Bioshock franchise with Bioshock: Infinite.\n\nI've played it for less than 2 hours so far, and stopped (for the time being) because writing a review about it honestly seemed a lot more fun than actually playing the game.\n\n([b]EDIT:[/b] OK, so, a couple more hours in, and the game got a little better -- at least the combat is not [i]so[/i] bad, once things ramp up. But Infinite is still [i]not[/i] Bioshock, so this will remain a negative review for the disappointment, and as a warning to others who, like me, were expecting \"Bioshock 3.\")\n\n\n[u][b]Here's what changed from Bioshock 1/2 to Infinite:[/b][/u]\n\n-Hacking is gone;\n\n-Collecting adam is gone;\n\n-Fighting Big Daddies/Sisters is gone;\n\n-Rescuing/protecting Little Sisters is gone;\n\n-Alternative ammunition types are all gone;\n\n-The whole game is pretty linear, so the map is gone as well, because it lost its purpose;\n\n-Ammo abounds, so you don't have to worry about it anymore;\n\n-You can only carry 2 weapons at any given time. You're free to swap either of them for any other you find, at any time, but when you find yourself in a situation where you need one you're not currently carrying, well... good luck;\n\n-Enemies no longer spawn randomly in previously cleared areas... specially because you can't go back to them;\n\n-Now, you walk around a lot, watching the sights and listening to crap, then fight an arena-style battle, then do some more walking, then arena-fight again, and so on;\n\n-You no longer carry medkits and eve (now called \"Salt\") hypos on you -- you can only use the ones you find scattered around. On the other hand, now we have a shield to soak damage before you start losing HP;\n\n-You can no longer save your game. Why? Because BS:I uses a checkpoint system. So, if you die, you'll respawn a few seconds earlier, and get infinite (maybe that's where the game's title came from?) tries at getting the next part done;\n\n-Plasmids are now called \"Vigor.\" The game feeds them to you one by one, linearly, and there are no more tonics for you to customize a build (now you get a total of 4 pieces of clothes to give you passive buffs, and that's it);\n\n-The game's setting, unlike in BS 1/2 where it was dark and creepy, is now colorful and silly. \"Gay\" might be the most appropriate word to define it. The visuals are pretty, sure, but instead of fighting crazed mutated people in a ruined undersea facility, now you go around fighting baptist police officers on gleeful floating islands;\n\n\nSo... remember everything you liked about the first 2 Bioshocks? Remove most of it, simplify the rest, and you'll get Bioshock Infinite.\n\n\n[u][b]TL;DR:[/b][/u]\n\n\"Overwhelmingly Positive\" reviews is quite a stretch, given how much Infinite deviated (in the wrong direction) from the previous Bioshocks.\n\nThis is a dumbed-down, franchise-killing game. It's not [i]bad[/i], but it lost most of the franchise's charm and assets, making it feel like a rather generic FPS game.\n\nYou should play [remastered] Bioshock 1 (best) and 2 (it crashes a lot) instead of this. If you've done that, and want more, Infinite won't provide it -- this is [i]not[/i] Bioshock 3.\n\nNow, if you're looking for a linear, rather generic shooter with minimalistic customization options, this one should do the trick. But don't pay too much -- by now, 10 bucks sounds fair.","timestamp_created":1631523845,"timestamp_updated":1637533608,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.380630642175674438","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99277990","author":{"steamid":"76561198096725764","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1631577770},"language":"english","review":"gun go pew pew","timestamp_created":1631521549,"timestamp_updated":1631521549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99277391","author":{"steamid":"76561197992288060","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":1960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":424,"last_played":1633763776},"language":"japanese","review":"これはクラッシュしないで遊べます\nセールのときにバイオショックコレクションを買うほうが普通に買うより安いっていう謎の価格設定になってます\nバイオショック１と２はおまけで付いてくるって考えたほうが良さそう\n本当は１からやりたかったけど…クラッシュが多すぎて…\n\nヒロインのエリザベスはお小遣いをくれるしかわいい\n愛してるぜ，エリザベス","timestamp_created":1631520333,"timestamp_updated":1631520333,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99274728","author":{"steamid":"76561198099190072","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":558,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":558,"last_played":1609073520},"language":"schinese","review":"阿特拉斯biss","timestamp_created":1631514972,"timestamp_updated":1631514972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99273540","author":{"steamid":"76561199037592266","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1632090564},"language":"brazilian","review":"A melhor história de todos os games.

Я считаю, что подача могла быть сделана куда лучше, тк сюжет реально крутой. \nИз сильных сторон игры можно отметить улучшенный шутан по сравнению с двумя предыдущими частями, апгрейды, разный лут, разное оружие, хотя как по мне оно скучное и не особо по-стимпанковски, скорее просто олдскул.
