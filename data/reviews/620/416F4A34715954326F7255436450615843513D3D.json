The game mechanics are expanded with new elements, the size of many puzzle-levels is trully immense and the game is significantly longer than the first one.\n\nAlso, the story of Portal 2 isn't just a very nice addition to the puzzles like in the first game, but now it is an integral part of the game. Dare I say it's even more enjoyable then the puzzles themself and the epic finale will resonate in your mind for quite some time!\n\nBut the most defining aspect of Portal 2 are two hilarious AI companions who are responsible for your constant giggling throughout the game. And both of them are also murderous psychopats...\n\nMoreover, you get a multiplayer! Puzzles in a multiplayer mode are generaly harder, but two heads are (usually) smarter than one, so you should be able to solve everything. At least we were ;-) Multiplayer campaign isn't very long, but it's a great addition to the game and it works flawlessly replacing humour and storytelling with comradeship and sense of belonging (or more likely enmity and hatred after a few failed attempts of solving some harder levels).\n\nOnly reason I won't give Portal 2 better rating then to the original is the fact that I feel like the puzzles aren't as inventive and fun like they were in first game and they get a bit repetitive over time. Or you can say I am no fan of gels, I guess... But it may also be just because the game is quite long and it was probably impossible to make all levels completely different from each other.\n\nP.S.: There isn't any cake again! But this time you can try to bake your very own, or even try some of miriads of community-created recipes (mods and maps) with your friends :-)\n\n[b] Rating: 9.5/10 [/b]","timestamp_created":1331369478,"timestamp_updated":1643578765,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5161108","author":{"steamid":"76561198045788351","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1530657171},"language":"english","review":"мазафака, эта игра вполне  себе кошерна, но мультиплей обязывает играть именно с корешем, потому что часто вам подбирают в напарники всяких бичей.","timestamp_created":1331364218,"timestamp_updated":1331364218,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3970647","author":{"steamid":"76561198029989135","num_games_owned":635,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1608460122},"language":"english","review":"Engaging puzzles and great storyline, i dont see how i couldn't reccomend it!","timestamp_created":1331352933,"timestamp_updated":1331352933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4713724","author":{"steamid":"76561198041035944","num_games_owned":761,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3656,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2776,"last_played":1652412478},"language":"english","review":"It's awesome.","timestamp_created":1331334098,"timestamp_updated":1331334098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501915693283081055","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3020019","author":{"steamid":"76561198016028456","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2648,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2091,"last_played":1423795343},"language":"english","review":"SPAAACE!","timestamp_created":1331327287,"timestamp_updated":1419777158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1885194","author":{"steamid":"76561197999302891","num_games_owned":343,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":325,"last_played":1418452655},"language":"english","review":"Now with robots!

humour.","timestamp_created":1329339858,"timestamp_updated":1329339858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558823525905609131","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4753330","author":{"steamid":"76561198041469189","num_games_owned":318,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":895,"last_played":1575259313},"language":"english","review":"Great
