Both expansions were developed by Gearbox and got support from Valve. When I first found out that the expansion packs for Half-Life were developed by Gearbox I was quite amazed. Around that time, there was a lot of drama surrounding Duke Nukem Forever and Aliens: Colonial Marines, so I was amazed that in the past Gearbox had the honor to make expansions for a game classic like Half-Life. \n\nIn this expansion you experience the story of Half-Life from the perspective of a soldier. You are going to Black Mesa, and your aircraft crashes. You wake up and don't know what is really going on and what the mission is. \n\nThe game itself is pretty hard for me to curate, because it all just feels and plays the same as the original game. (With the expansion having half the length of the original game.) The new features are some different weapons and enemies, both of which are creatively implemented.  The only new feature that I didn't think was all that well executed was the nightvision goggles. They looked cool at first, but they sadly only really work in short distance. \n\nThis expansion takes place in Black Mesa for the most part, not much time is spent in alien dimensions. At the beginning, I had the feeling that the weapons were a little bit more balanced than in the original game. Because I found myself using the shotgun more often. Still there are some new weapons that I almost never used. \n\nWhat I found special about Opposing Force is that I could see that Gearbox added some more humor in the expansion than what there was in the original Half-Life itself. I still have to say that the story in my opinion didn't really add too much to what we already knew from Half-Life, but it is still fun to see it from their perspective.\n\nThe nitpick I have though is that the thing I loved about Half-Life is that there never really was a moment of standing still where you are forced to listen to someone. Opposing Force had that happen twice, sadly. This was pretty annoying when I died a few times at one of those points. (I recommend quick saving directly after you are done waiting) \n\nThroughout the expansions there were some nice references and they shared the same moments with the original Half-Life timeline.\n\nThe gameplay is the same mixture of shooting and exploration, just like in the original. The beginning first felt a little dull but then the game started to pick up. I especially liked the shooting at some parts, even though I hated one of the new alien enemies who in my opinion was just really annoying, an enemy which requires too much ammo to take down and does too much damage.  \n\nOpposing Force might not be as good as Half-Life, but in my opinion it is still worth to play it if you want to have more of the same Half-Life gameplay.\n\nReviews of the other Half-Life games:\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/70/]Half-Life[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/130/]Half-Life: Blue Shift[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/220/]Half-Life 2[/url]","timestamp_created":1468400828,"timestamp_updated":1470397793,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.660081923007965088","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24282592","author":{"steamid":"76561198123555367","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1073,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":503,"last_played":1615604525},"language":"english","review":"I would actually argue that this game just might be better than the original Half-Life.\n\nSure, we all love Gordon Freeman, but this game improved so much over the original. \n\nOne of my orginal problems with half life, was that the puzzles didn't always make sense. In this game I felt like it was a lot more fair when solving puzzles. The weapons are so much better than the previous Half-Life's, they feel more tight and there's a lot of variety this time around regarding the types of weapons you can use.\n\nI also have to say, that this was so interesting to play story wise. You actually get to get a deeper look into the scientists, guards, and the army. They seem more like people and less like NPC's. \n\nEven the tutorial mode [which isn't that helpful. But I mean, there are some things you might like to know? Nothing spectacular though.] Is made so much more lifelike than the last two games. \n\nSadly, this game is short.\n\nI kind of wish I could keep playing this game, it was an amazing game but it kind of endend with \"Wait- that was the ending?..\" \n\nIn conclusion/TL;DR\n\nHalf Life Opposing force, was a lot of fun. And I think it may be one of my favourite valve games of all time.","timestamp_created":1468357312,"timestamp_updated":1468357312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24281217","author":{"steamid":"76561198167468897","num_games_owned":600,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":8942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1467,"last_played":1658670161},"language":"english","review":"The best expansion pack of HL","timestamp_created":1468352905,"timestamp_updated":1561782813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24280122","author":{"steamid":"76561198304706620","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":96,"last_played":1513775788},"language":"english","review":"Not as good as Blue Shift but it's decent","timestamp_created":1468349370,"timestamp_updated":1468349370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49081110954284668","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24273374","author":{"steamid":"76561198008865827","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":426,"last_played":1468324838},"language":"english","review":"Another of the expansions that surpases the original.  I don't find though, that this is better than Blue Shift, that game flows smoother whereas Opposing Force again has too much of the platform game issues that HL has, and also this has a terrible boss fight at the end, and I'd rather no boss fight (ala Blue Shift) than a bad one.  Still, the story is cool, seeing the different alien race and species is also cool, and i feel that this game is worth a shot.

Like Half-Life, this game has some annoying aspects such as those freaking Sewers in Chapter 10. Aside from that, this was a fantastic expansion to the original game and pretty much the definition of Government Cover-Ups.\n\nThis game offers an interesting side story to the Black Mesa Incident and while you do fight Aliens, they are pretty different from the ones you fought in the original. Barely any Headcrabs, Alien Grunts, and Vortiguants. One thing I love about expansions is added content and that is what this game offers. New military grade weapons, new alien weapons, and one new weapon developed by the Lambda Core.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic and the level design is pretty good. As I said, this game has some annoying aspects (that freaking Sewer), but just like the original game, the good aspects pretty much made everything bad about the game forgivable.\n\nNow what are you waiting for?

Players fill the boots of Cpl. Adrien Shephard, a marine stationed at a military base close to Black Mesa.  After the events of Half-Life, Shephard's squad gets called to Black Mesa to help contain the alien threat.  The game plays exactly like Half-Life, but Adrien gets access to a few weapons and abilities that Gordon did not.  For example, Adrien can climb ropes and wires.  He can also use his leadership abilities to have medics heal him or have an engineer weld a door open.  Finally, Cpl. Shephard uses several new conventional weapons (laser dot magnum, LMG, sniper rifle) and unconventional weapons found throughout Black Mesa.  Notable unconventional wepaons that get used in puzzles are the barnacle which lets you \"hookshot\" certain points in the world and a kind of Portal Gun that transports you to Zen for its alt fire.  All in all, I think this expansion is definitely worth a sale pickup if you enjoyed the original Half-Life and want more story.","timestamp_created":1467471143,"timestamp_updated":1467471143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24014888","author":{"steamid":"76561198097423480","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":19512,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14403,"last_played":1568144338},"language":"english","review":"meh","timestamp_created":1467463237,"timestamp_updated":1467463237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485943764448165894","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24007634","author":{"steamid":"76561198141260852","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1467442312},"language":"english","review":"It's half life","timestamp_created":1467442405,"timestamp_updated":1467992104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23989497","author":{"steamid":"76561198110076372","num_games_owned":311,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":271,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1467145096},"language":"english","review":"New story, awesome weapons, tougher enemies.\n\nIts very challenging and fun game for Half-Life Fans","timestamp_created":1467390880,"timestamp_updated":1467390880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23975183","author":{"steamid":"76561198136757467","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":454,"last_played":1481921752},"language":"spanish","review":"Holy shit, me encanto la expansion, mas armas, mas enemigos, nuevas maneras de pasar los niveles, tienes que pensar bien ya que tiene retos un poco mas complicados de su juego base pero nada que con logica puedas superar, aunque el Boss Final me decepciono, queria un nivel mas desafiante y no repetitivo por que  era disparo al ojo, me oculto de su gas toxico, me muevo del otro lado, oculto del gas y del golpe, disparar al otro ojo, esperae a que expulse a un enemigo y explotar a ese enemigo con bombas y de nuevo repetir el proceso, pero en si me satisfacio esta expansion, 9/10","timestamp_created":1467349704,"timestamp_updated":1467349704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481675416231155396","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23961335","author":{"steamid":"76561198158607847","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":127,"last_played":1572780791},"language":"turkish","review":"Güzel bir oyun ve düşündürücü.Fakat source system ile yeniden elden geçirilirse yada geçirilip hikayeside deişirse tadına doyum olmaz","timestamp_created":1467308886,"timestamp_updated":1467308886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518828451633453369","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23960773","author":{"steamid":"76561198156083142","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":955,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":544,"last_played":1656593978},"language":"english","review":"Two big things about this game...(Well maybe 3,omg Half-LIE 3 confirmed xddd mlg)\n\n1.The Displacer looks like the BFG (Big Fucking Gun) from DOOM \n2.G-MAN made my game\n3.

Ve sonunda bir göreve tayin edildim. Karargahta ilginç giyinmiş takım elbiseli bir adam gördüm (Gman). Dedikodulara göre onun hükümet adına çalışan yüksek seviyeli bir bürokrat olduğunu ve acemileri kendi yanında çalışması üzerine işe aldığını duydum. Diğer kişilerde gizli bir araştırma grubunun üyesi olduğunu söylüyor.\n\nEğer öyle bir şey varsa katılmak için elimden geleni yapardım. Bir maceranın içinde olmak ve biraz değişim hiç fena olmazdı.\n\n-200? 5 Mayıs (Adrian Shephard’ın günlüğünden)\n\nSonunda hükümet adamı(Gman)’i gördüm. Onun bir hükümet adamı mı yoksa baş bir şey mi olduğundan emin değilim. Fakat çok sıkı bir takım elbise giyiyor ve yanında bir çanta taşıyordu. Daha çok bir avukatı veya sigortacıyı andırıyordu. Gün boyunca onun beni bir kaç kez izlediğini fark ettim. Benim aldığım eğitimi izliyordu. Ne yapacağını şaşkınlıkla bekliyorum.\n\n-200? 9 Mayıs (Adrian Shephard’ın günlüğünden)\n\n4 haftalık eğitim tamamlandı. Eğitmenler her gün yeni şeyler öğretiyorlar. Bugün sabah koşusuna hazırlandık, eğitmenlerimiz bir haftamız kaldığını ve eğitim tamamlandıktan sonra kapalı alanlarda stratejik çatışma uzmanı olacağımızı söylüyor. Bu hafta her gün savaş similasyonu tesisinde eğitim alacağız. Bu gelişmiş ve özel eğitimin bize ön hazırlık kampında söylenmediğini biliyorum.\n\n-200? 12 Mayıs (Adrian Shephard’ın Günlüğünden)\n\nKapalı alan savaş teknikleri eğitimimiz başladığı günden beri dedikodular havada dolanıyor. Arkadaşlarımızın çoğu bir görev için aktif hale getirildiğimizi düşünüyor.  Kimsenin görev hakkında bir fikri yok. Ama Black Mesa Tesisini adının çok konuşulduğunu duydum. Fakat orasıyla ilgili henüz elimde hiç bir bilgi yok. Orada çok gizli bir araştırmanın yürütüldüğünü düşünüyorum. Bu olaylar benim hiç ilgimi çekmiyor.\n\n-200? 15 Mayıs (Adrain Shephard’ın Günlüğünden)\n\nDedikodular doğrulandı. Black Mesa’daki bir görev için eğitim aldık. Tek bildiğim tesis bilim adamlarınca bazı yeni araştırma ve deneyler yapmak için kullanıldığı. Ne için biz askerlere orada ihtiyaç duyduklarını merak ediyorum. Bize sadece hazır olmamız emredildi. Görevin bence heyecan verici bir yanı veya potansiyeli bulunmuyor. Savaşların ve çatışmaların olduğu bir yere gönderilmeyi tercih ederdim.","timestamp_created":1467030428,"timestamp_updated":1619046626,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":65,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.868491053581237793","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23853164","author":{"steamid":"76561198284139163","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1469919114},"language":"english","review":"I wish i could play it, but the fucking widescreen is being a dickhole.","timestamp_created":1467010201,"timestamp_updated":1467010201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23838344","author":{"steamid":"76561198112269163","num_games_owned":611,"num_reviews":101,"playtime_forever":965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":403,"last_played":1623533612},"language":"turkish","review":"go and catch him Shepard !!!","timestamp_created":1466967980,"timestamp_updated":1466967980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23837940","author":{"steamid":"76561198097595251","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":491,"last_played":1618055007},"language":"english","review":"top kek shoot bitches get money paid marine hired 10/10 ign ok could use more hitmarkers 1v1 me rust","timestamp_created":1466967257,"timestamp_updated":1466967257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518624603748321533","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23834114","author":{"steamid":"76561198147691739","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":420,"last_played":1635710046},"language":"turkish","review":"Küçüklüğümden beri kahramanım olan Adrian Shephard ile bir oyun mükemmelden daha öte.Half Life 1'in yanı sıra Opposing Force'da 1'den 7'ye kadar silah barı ekleniyor ve yeni silahlar ile tanışıyorsunuz.Yeni hikaye ile birlikte Gordon Freeman ve başımızın belası G-man'i tekrar görüyorsunuz.Oyunun en iyi yanı ise değişik yaratıklarlar sizin peşinizi bırakmıyor.Değişik bosslar ile dövüşmek ve onları yok etmek için yapmanız gereken şeyler oyunu daha eğlenceli kılıyor.Her ne kadar günümüzden baya eski bir oyun olursa olsun şans verilmesi gereken bir oyun.","timestamp_created":1466959681,"timestamp_updated":1466959681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23813320","author":{"steamid":"76561198218478372","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":240,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1619610492},"language":"schinese","review":"菜鸟补童年系列","timestamp_created":1466910836,"timestamp_updated":1466910836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556234300136566162","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23811850","author":{"steamid":"76561198079307565","num_games_owned":318,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":496,"last_played":1643735349},"language":"brazilian","review":"MELHOR JOGO DO UNIVERSO","timestamp_created":1466906370,"timestamp_updated":1466906370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23804823","author":{"steamid":"76561197977657472","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":244,"last_played":1467185846},"language":"english","review":"There's not much to say.

Ein Energiexperiment ist gründlich schiefgelaufen und hat ein Portal zu einer anderen Welt geöffnet. Merkwürdige, aggressive Aliens strömen in unsere Welt und greifen alles an, was ihnen über den Weg läuft. Um der Übermacht Herr zu werden, wird auch schwerbewaffnetes Militär aktiviert...\n\nAls Corporal Adrian Shepard finden wir uns in einem Truppentransporthubschrauber wieder. Nachdem dieser gleich zu Beginn  abgeschossen wird, gilt es, zunächst alleine zu überleben, Waffen zu finden und uns gegen Sicherheitssysteme zu behaupten. \n\nWieder sind die Level extrem abwechslungsreich, Shooter-Passagen wechseln sich mit Schalter- oder Jump-Passagen ab. Meist sind wir in Black Mesa unterwegs, aber durch Portale gelangen wir auch mal auf die Alien-Welt.\n\nMeist sind wir allein unterwegs, aber in einigen wenigen Momenten sollten wir eine neue Mechanik nutzen, nämlich anderen Soldaten rudimentäre Befehle zu geben. Dabei wird \"Opposing Force\" nie zu einem richtigen Taktik-Shooter, über ein \"schneidbrenn mir mal die Tür auf\" geht es kaum hinaus; eine nette Ergänzung ist es dennoch.\n\nViele neue Waffen kommen ins Arsenal. Thematisch naheliegend sind sicher das Scharfschützengewehr und das Schwere Maschinengewehr. Statt eines Brecheisens haben wir nun eine Rohrzange und ein schickes Messer. Neue, sehr coole Alienwaffen sind auch am Start, unter anderem ein lebendes Alien, das wir erst füttern müssen, damit es ätzende Flüssigkeit verschießt.\n \nAnsonsten funktioniert die Spielmechanik des First-Person-Shooters ähnlich reibungslos und flüssig wie im Original. Das Pacing ist hervorragend, die Rätsel interessant, der Schwierigkeitsgrad hat angezogen, was sich aber eingedenk dessen, daß man in der Regel vorher schon das Original gezockt hat und somit Übung mit den Mechaniken hat, genau richtig anfühlt. \n\nAuch die Ironie hat \"Opposing Force\" (nebenbei bemerkt wie Half-Life/Halbwertszeit oder Blue-Shift/Blauverschiebung auch unter anderem ein physikalischer Begriff) nicht verloren. So findet man zum Beispiel ein Wandbild von Gordon Freeman mit der Untertitelung \"Employee of the Month\" oder um einen riesigen Wurm zu besiegen, müssen eine Gearbox und ein Valve aktiviert werden.\n\nGrafik und Sound bleiben im Wesentlichen auf dem (damals sehr guten) Stand des Hauptspiels.\n\nDaß man die Ereignisse des Originals aus anderer Perspektive miterlebt, \"Opposing Force\" also praktisch parallel zu \"Half Life\" spielt, ist eine sehr weise Entscheidung, die wesentlich zur Immersion beiträgt, denn irgendwo jetzt läuft Gordon Freeman durch Black Mesa und kämpft seinen eigenen Kampf.

If you're itching for more Half-Life then this is a must play and is an awesome addition to Half-Life series.","timestamp_created":1464364832,"timestamp_updated":1464366984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.675347864627838135","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23218474","author":{"steamid":"76561198165699533","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":165,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1494249196},"language":"russian","review":"КРУТЬ!\nКРАТЬ!\nКРОТЬ!\nХАЛФ ЛАЙФ","timestamp_created":1464272217,"timestamp_updated":1464272217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23209013","author":{"steamid":"76561198138798938","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":430,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":430,"last_played":1442865625},"language":"english","review":"Adrian Shepard :)","timestamp_created":1464214495,"timestamp_updated":1464214495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464684009552001953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23193655","author":{"steamid":"76561198139657361","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":267,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":259,"last_played":1555628895},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life: Opposing Force is one of the two standalone expansion packs for the original Half-Life. Both of the expansions are developed by Gearbox and overseen by Valve. I found Opposing Force to be better than Blue Shift, but that is just opinion. On to reviewing the actual game now. The game starts off with you being introduced to the character you play as Corporal Adrian Shephard, who is apart of the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit, or H.E.C.U. for short. You are riding a helicopter along with other members of the H.E.C.U. into the Black Mesa Research Facility, but then the helicopter is suddenly assaulted by alien aircraft. The helicopter crashes and you are knocked unconscious. You wake up in the Med Bay, with orders to hunt down and eliminate Gordon Freeman. The gameplay mechanics are the same as the original Half-Life, but with new, fun, interesting weapons. Brand new enemies, which require certain tactics to defeat efficiently. Plus new levels of course. You occasionally run into friendly soldiers on your journey throughout Black Mesa, but they are quite clunky and stupid at times. Overall the game is fun and exciting with a mysterious storyline just like the original Half-Life. It is also very fun to see the Black Mesa Incident from different a perspective.\nTLDR: Fun, challenging, and mysterious like the original. This time from a different perspective. The better of the two expansion packs in my opinion.","timestamp_created":1464139326,"timestamp_updated":1464139689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23191682","author":{"steamid":"76561198136713379","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":722,"last_played":1574225944},"language":"english","review":"Best plumbing simulator ever 10/10","timestamp_created":1464129307,"timestamp_updated":1464129307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470588237047195435","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23186084","author":{"steamid":"76561198030271401","num_games_owned":2779,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":636,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":636,"last_played":1558889222},"language":"polish","review":"HL:OP - spin-off oryginalnego Half-Life'a, opowiadający niejako tę samą historię, ale z zupełnie innej perspektywy - daje sporo radości, ale klimatem nieco ustępuję sławnemu poprzednikowi. Naukowca zastępuje tu konkretny zawodnik z oddziałów specjalnych, który wie, w co się pakuje i nie zamierza naparzać we wraże kreatury łomem*. Jakkolwiek Valve nie bawi się tu w twórcę pornoli, tj. nie szuka szerszego fabularnego pretekstu do radosnego napierdzielania w lewy przycisk gryzonia, tylko od razu rzuca gracza w wir ostrego walenia (z karabinu oczywiście), sama historia - choć opowiedziana nad wyraz skromnymi środkami - jest na tyle ciekawa, że grę chce się ukończyć. Żałować można tylko tego, że twórcy poszli na moralne kompromisy i zamiast zaprezentowania nam głównego herosa jako bezwzględnego egzekutora, którego nie wzruszają krzyki naukowców i ich błagania o litość, podali nam empatycznego wojownika, który brzydzi się mordowaniem bezbronnych. \nA fe.\n\nZalety:\n+ więcej Half-Life'a.\n\nWady:\n- graficznie dupy to już nie tylko nie urywa, ale nawet jej nie szczypie.\n\nOcena: 7/10\n\n* tylko kluczem francuskim.\n\nhttps://kulturaobrazkowa.pl","timestamp_created":1464109560,"timestamp_updated":1595486407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjN7u8dQCdKq5WA=="}
