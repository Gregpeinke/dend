I’m extremely happy with what I got, and what I got was a game with perhaps not the best graphics in the world but a very enjoyable co-op system. \nI haven’t played single player so I don’t know this, but co-op is probably the way the game is supposed to be played, and if for any reason at all you are not going to play co-op, you shouldn’t really get this game as there are better single player zombie slaughter games out there. Like I mentioned the graphics are not very good but definitely acceptable considering the games age and the developer’s budget at the time.\nAlthough this game has a lot of DLCs which I know for a fact put off some people from getting the game, the DLCs don’t really affect the game that much and are only some skins for your characters and guns you can do without. The players of the game are definitely very friendly from my experience. The game is relatively easy to play and generally not very challenging until the later waves of zombies or “zeds” as the game calls it.\nOverall I would recommend the game if you have friends that are willing to play with you and have some fun, or even just to connect to a random server and make some friends;  but if you don’t have any one to play with then if could get quite boring.\n\n\nUPDATE: After playing Killing Floor 2, i can now say that personally KF2 is not as good as this game, gameplay wise.","timestamp_created":1499711258,"timestamp_updated":1515199406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33436941","author":{"steamid":"76561198384454418","num_games_owned":417,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":788,"last_played":1549427773},"language":"english","review":"Amazing and addictive and tons of replay value.

There’s usually multiple ways in which you can succeed in these, such as camping in one place or being on the move constantly.\n\nKilling stuff is a very satisfying time-waster. Shoot, burn, slash, disintegrate, explode, gib, intoxicate, dismember and decapitate the enemy as you please.\n\nThe difficulty and learning curve in this game are quite good. While the game is rather unfriendly towards newer players (in mechanics and the fact perk weapons cost more when your level is lower), it is easier to master even the highest difficulty. That is not to say this game won’t offer you a challenge.\nThere also exist servers with a boosted difficulty level, should the base max difficulty level become too easy.\n\nThis is a game in which having a somewhat high ping does not directly make it unplayable. Even at 150 ping, you can still contribute to a game (granted that your skill allows it). This means you can essentially play worldwide reasonably okay, with a few limits.\n\nThere are many options with the console, like making custom text, voiceline binds, useful gameplay commands, commands that make certain tasks easier, commands for fun stuff, etc.\n\nThis game has good replay value. I've crossed a thousand hours and still haven't had enough of this game. Some have 3000, 4000 or even more hours logged and still play to this day.\n \nThis game is not a very not-demanding one. Some pretty old and/or crappy rigs can run this game just fine. A friend of mine who has a 10 year old laptop can still run it, and another one used to run it on their Vista.\n\n[h1]The bad[/h1]\nThe playerbase is definitely the worst part of this game, especially now that we’re a few years down the line and staring at what’s left of it. It's a lot of bad and inexperienced or perk-farmed players joining high difficulty games and causing it to fail or make it more burdensome, but there are also quite a number of trolls in the circuit. It’s come to my attention that there’s essentially two groups: new and regular players who just play normally, and the considerably more experienced players who have gotten bored of the game and as result find different ways to entertain themselves in Killing Floor. Sadly, their idea of entertainment is to ruin the fun for somebody else. Not every server allows kickvoting and where it does, you need several kickvotes for it to process, but not every player is aware a kickvote is going on, so this is often a quite arduous process.\n\nAnother fact about the playerbase is that not too many people play this game anymore (though it's definitely not dead). At the right hours you'll usually find enough servers to play on with others but the choices are limited.\n\nA lot of the characters and weapons are put in paid DLC packs. Some of these weapons are a serious boon, such as the flare gun.

Antagonists are zombies that approach players in waves, and in-between rounds, survivors earn cash that can be put towards upgraded weapons, armor, or other perks. The zombies  themselves get progressively more difficult, and the game has a variety of different types, such as zombies that scream at you to cause splash damage, zombies with arms modified into buzz-saws, and zombies with rocket launchers...just to name a few. Each must be approached a little differently, which enhances the cooperative element of the game and adds variety to gameplay. On the final wave, a special \"boss\" zombie spawns that is extra tough and capable of nasty tricks that can take players by surprise if they don't work well as a team.\n\nIt's basically a deeper

Since its official release in 2009 (previously being just an Unreal Tournament mod) this is a game that has gained a very loyal community over  the years and at one point it was one of the top games on Steam. I think is important to mention Killing Floor is kind of a resurrected game; prior to the 2017 humble bundle giveaway this game pretty much had a foot in the grave with a mere 300 to 400 players at peak hours. Now, as of July there are up to 5000 players and that is something that actually, really makes me happy. My experience with Killing Floor has been mostly positive despite being a somewhat repetitive game, it has an undeniably charm. Gameplay has its own learning curve so this is not the type of game where you can do whatever the hell you want and expect to win. Teamwork is important just like learning the entire game mechanisms. It takes time but if you are really enjoying the game, once you know how everything works you will have no trouble in giving Killing Floor hundreds of hours.","timestamp_created":1498950494,"timestamp_updated":1499287950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33102081","author":{"steamid":"76561198368254045","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65,"last_played":1604078663},"language":"english","review":"Great CO-OP zombies game.

(В общем замените \"Горизонт\" на \"Umbrella\" и само все прекрасно поймете.) \n \n  Поиграв в пиратскую версию игры около тысячи часов. Я приобрел эту игру, как ностальгию и дань уважения прошедшим боям. Ну и затем, чтобы с пацанами по LAN посидеть...\n  Теперь почему я считаю, что вам следует попробовать в нее поиграть:\n\n1) В игре представлены 7 разных классов: Медик, Коммандос, Подрывник, Поджигатель, Снайпер, Берсерк и Техник. У каждого имеются свои особенности и свой предпочтительный арсенал. \n2) Разновидонсти мяса здесь тоже есть. От простых зомби, который убиваются с одного-двух выстрелов в голову, до огромных светящихся юнитов, которые могу вас размозжить с первого раза. И каждому нужно искать свою тактику.  \n3) Игровая механика пострена на том, чтобы продержаться определенное количество волн. В промежутках между волнами открывается магазин, где можно закупится. И на последней волне вас встречает босс, создатель - Патриарх.\n4) Killing Floor, как CS 1.6, как Half-Life, как карта Dota в Warcraft III - никогда не умрут. Поэтому купив эту игру у вас не будет проблем с поиском сервера для игры. Игроки постоянно обновляют игру, создавая новые моды, оружие и карты.\n\nВ целом мой вердик -  Эта игра достойна быть в вашей библиотеке. Отличная игра для игры одному или в кампании друзей","timestamp_created":1498908935,"timestamp_updated":1499003475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33076760","author":{"steamid":"76561198285292255","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1498903001},"language":"thai","review":"เล่นไม่ได้เว้ยยยยยยยยยยยย","timestamp_created":1498903433,"timestamp_updated":1498903433,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48unm/twCeOGWfg=="}
