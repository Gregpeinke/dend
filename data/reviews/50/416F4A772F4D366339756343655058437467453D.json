As I have pointed out in my previous reviews for HL & HL Blue Shift the graphics may not be up to today’s standards, the game play and AI are not overly sophisticated, but this is a trip down memory lane with one of the most important vintage FPS game changers.\n\nYou are either a HL fan or not, but there is no disputing the fact that there is still a huge HL community, creating some incredible mods, maps and keeping this game alive.\n \nAnyway, back to the review. Having played as Gordon & Barney - Half-Life: Opposing Force lets you see Half-life´s story through the eyes of Marine Corporal Adrian Shephard. Who, after surviving a helicopter crash, has to make his way through Black Mesa and survive (similar theme here). However, what I did like were some subtle changes in the game play and weapons.\n\n[*] The crowbar has been replaced with a wrench, which actually appeared to handle heavier with I felt added some realistic physics to the weapon.\n[*] The desert Eagle has a laser target; to be honest I do prefer to play with pistols rather than high powered weapons all the time. Having said that, the M249 SAW is just a weapon of mass carnage and is brutally fun.\n[*] There are a couple of new Alien Tech weapons such as the awesome Shock Roach, Spore Gun. One fun addition is the ability to collect Snarks (little deadly hyperactive bugs which you can throw and they run around attacking anything they can find, including you at times).\n\n[/list]Some other nice touches are the way you can get some actual help form the AI characters, as with HL and Blue Shift there is some interaction with Scientists who usually open doors or heal you and Security guards who help with shooting the aliens, HL OP takes AI co op a little further where you can join up with other Marines and actually do some real damage. In addition, finding a medic to help heal the engineer to flame cut a sealed door was definitely a nice addition for some limited squad based gameplay.\n\nOverall, Opposing Forces was a great way to end the debut of Half Life and each expansion pack added its own take on the Black Mesa Facility storyline. Opposing forces for me, and remember this is only my opinion, is a far better gameplay experience than the base HL release, however that is definitely down to the popularity of HL and the development of the game 2 years down the line.\n\nA definite must own for true FPS gamers.\n\nAlso worth checking out the walkthrough\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=163587409","timestamp_created":1549119397,"timestamp_updated":1549119542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48707613","author":{"steamid":"76561198119513145","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":2117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1376,"last_played":1651661780},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life: Opposing Force is an expansion pack for Half-Life that lets you see Half-life´s story thru eyes of a H.E.C.U. marine Corporal Adrian Shephard. It has a lot of new weapons, like a Barnacle grapple that lets you grab on to living organisms, or a spore launcher which is kinda like a weird fish thing which in order to fire it you need to feed it. The puzzles are kind of weak and i would say that the game is more combat based youll have to decide if that is a good thing i personally thought that the shooting in half-life games was pretty simple but here with such a large weapon variety i dont really mind it. Also there are a lot of new enemies like the shock troopers or Voltigores which both fall under a completely new alien race originally titled Race X. And as well as with the first game you play as a blank slate you can have psychopath Shephard or just a normal guy that wants to escape. I reccomend Opposing Force i think it is a good expansion.","timestamp_created":1549100734,"timestamp_updated":1549100734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48707043","author":{"steamid":"76561198320110609","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":3741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":862,"last_played":1652457144},"language":"english","review":"Very fun.

Además, tiene un soundtrack bastante notable.\nMuy recomendado.","timestamp_created":1548204042,"timestamp_updated":1548204169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48470230","author":{"steamid":"76561198308508662","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":168,"playtime_forever":207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1548285089},"language":"english","review":"Ooo rah!","timestamp_created":1548116021,"timestamp_updated":1548116021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48457928","author":{"steamid":"76561198851490588","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":111,"last_played":1574674631},"language":"english","review":"ok, this is epic","timestamp_created":1548064274,"timestamp_updated":1548064274,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572689831256866455","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48443800","author":{"steamid":"76561198262807975","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":909,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":589,"last_played":1561316050},"language":"english","review":"AMAZING YES 10/10","timestamp_created":1547997604,"timestamp_updated":1547997604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48441067","author":{"steamid":"76561198289536823","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":602,"last_played":1558736360},"language":"brazilian","review":"Os acontecimentos desse jogo como o de Half-Life: Blue Shift ou Half-Life: Decay, se passam ao mesmo tempo que Half-life 1, onde nos proporciona uma historia muito dinâmica.

It sure sounds like a good idea, but this game definitely isn't it.\n\nIt's a pathetic cop out. Your character (which of course speaks and you can't hear it, screw the very things that make Half-Life good) ends up surviving a helicopter crash (I sure have never heard of that before) and ends up running through plenty of poorly designed maps (of much lower quality than original Half-Life) with a ridiculous amount of invisible walls. By the time you get a gun in your hand, HECU is already retreating, and the entire plot is just artificially extended by G-Man closing your door right in front of you. His character doesn't even fit with how he normally acts, he participates in action too much.\n\nPerformance is atrocious at times, thanks to the abuse of dynamic lights. Enabling the night vision goggles causes the framerate to drop into star fox levels, much worse than original Half-Life (Valve is to blame here with their broken port of the goldsrc engine and patches removing functionality, but this game is so bad that it crashed on me, something no other goldsrc game ever did). Pretty much every elevator with mesh floor is broken, at times so bad that I can even get stuck using it normally. The entry vent to pit worm's nest has a known bug where it randomly causes you to get stuck on your way in, and nobody bothered to fix that, the only advice you can find is to load an earlier save and try again. The final boss fight has a game-breaking bug as well. In many cases, after defeating it nothing happens (in my case, nothing happened in all 3 times I've defeated it). That bug has been known for years, hasn't been fixed, and the ad-hoc solution is to manually load the final map from the console.\n\nGearbox HAD to shove their deviantArt-tier alien Race X (which Freeman and Calhoun haven't seen) into the game. They look like an attempt to model 3-year-old child's drawings and are probably as original as ones such a child would come up with. Ammo sponges is the best way I can describe them. There are WAY too many fights where you just get thrown against a way too large group of enemies, and it gets repetitive really quick. Do you hate black ops from Half-Life? Enjoy countless fights with them, ones where you end up with more enemies spawning should you decide to pick up some ammo or a medkit from an earlier area. The only enjoyable thing is the wrench, which while slow (not a problem since there are more melee weapons in this game, plenty of weapons feel like duplicates of each other) can gib characters instantly from their full health. The sad part is that you don't fight against Black Mesa personel, something I hoped for in this game. I expected to have moments where I have to fight against guards and slay scientists, all of them end up being friendly to you for no good reason. AI of soldiers you encounter is somehow worse than original Half-Life, at least they seem to be able to take more damage and have better weapons, so using them to conserve ammo works better (and there's way too little of it in the game, expect to run around enemies to have something for cases where you actually need to fight).\n\nThe idea with a detached barnacle used as a weapon is good, but of course it had to get executed poorly.\n\nIf you happen to own this game, don't even bother downloading it as it is a waste of time.\n\nTL;DR: the plot is a cop out, fights are repetitive and annoying, Gearbox took the source material too loosely and lost the grasp on what made Half-Life good, and replaced it with bugs.","timestamp_created":1547838814,"timestamp_updated":1548007728,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.252318382263183594","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48404494","author":{"steamid":"76561198834015113","num_games_owned":695,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":312,"last_played":1547651750},"language":"czech","review":"Half-Life Opposing Force je DLC ktoré ma veľmi prekvapilo ale v dobrom .

However some of my problems are about that new features. First of all we go different places which we never been so new enemies could be endemic to these areas but after a while new beam shooting stronkk guys takes place of our asszapping teleporting boys and that doesnt really feel rigth even if it is caused by the portal Gordon jumped in which also let that flying psychic pearheads come to world. Other than that black latex wearing folks unoriginally take place of HECU because yeah, we are the HECU: badass villains of the first game that fight with every single living being until death or retreat command arrives. But for some reason we seem to be the good guys in this game. I am really disappointed by that fact as i expected to terrorize scientist and torture security guards until they tell the way out in this game but instead it mimicks the original game and makes us a protagonist instead of an antagonist. New weapons are really good and creative making Shephard an interdimensional beam shooting sniper spiderman. Bad side is they are too much to handle and some of them are like added in game just because the developer could add them. I think you will understand what i mean if you played the game.

The HECU side of the Black Mesa incident isn't too touched upon and thus it's really interesting to see what they went through and the little things happening behind the scenes. Opposing Force adds new weapons and enemy types. The weapons are quite fun and very satisfying to use and I like how the style is different from the original Half Life. The new enemies are more difficult than the original Half Life, they can soak up more damage and inflict more damage and get really annoying though their designs are quite cool. You also get new allies, HECU Marines, Engineers, and Medics can help you fight off enemies and it's kinda fun fighting like a squad with them. There are also climbing ropes that weren't seen in the original Half Life that you can swing from which are unique. This game is short though and you'll get about 2-4 hours of gameplay give or take (This is expected from an expansion though).\n\nAs I said before the new enemies in the game are quite annoying and challenging to face (at least for me). Especially the shock troopers which will pretty much constantly take down your health and can take alot of hits back if they aren't dealt with quickly.\n\nThis game is a nice sidestory and another perspective to the Black Mesa incident. If you like Half Life and want more of it, I recommend this game, though you aren't missing out on anything if you don't play it.","timestamp_created":1546996586,"timestamp_updated":1547000563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48179290","author":{"steamid":"76561198325814802","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":3233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2107,"last_played":1658435475},"language":"english","review":"Good old memories i would like Valve to begin making Half life 3","timestamp_created":1546908045,"timestamp_updated":1546908045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48157585","author":{"steamid":"76561198198987443","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":346,"last_played":1608343178},"language":"spanish","review":"⡴⠑⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⣀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣀⡀\n⠸⡇⠀⠿⡀⠀⠀⠀⣀⡴⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣦⡀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠑⢄⣠⠾⠁⣀⣄⡈⠙⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣆ ta bueno\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡀⠁⠀⠀⠈⠙⠛⠂⠈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⡿⢿⣆\n⠀⠀⠀⢀⡾⣁⣀⠀⠴⠂⠙⣗⡀⠀⢻⣿⣿⠭⢤⣴⣦⣤⣹⠀⠀⠀⢀⢴⣶⣆\n⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣷⣮⣽⣾⣿⣥⣴⣿⣿⡿⢂⠔⢚⡿⢿⣿⣦⣴⣾⠸⣼⡿\n⠀⢀⡞⠁⠙⠻⠿⠟⠉⠀⠛⢹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣌⢤⣼⣿⣾⣿⡟⠉\n⠀⣾⣷⣶⠇⠀⠀⣤⣄⣀⡀⠈⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇Cómpralo\n⠀⠉⠈⠉⠀⠀⢦⡈⢻⣿⣿⣿⣶⣶⣶⣶⣤⣽⡹⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠲⣽⡻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣜⣿⣿⣿⡇\n⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣷⣶⣮⣭⣽⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿","timestamp_created":1546814615,"timestamp_updated":1593703444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48152712","author":{"steamid":"76561198145304029","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1546799184},"language":"hungarian","review":"Took me almost 4 hours to finish.\nI really enjoyed it, it's way better than Blue Shift.\nThere lots of new enemies, new weapons.\nBought on a sale for 0,80€, worth the price.\n\nIf you love/like Half Life, you should give it a try.","timestamp_created":1546799325,"timestamp_updated":1546799325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48148337","author":{"steamid":"76561198193414774","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":124,"last_played":1598787645},"language":"english","review":"best expansion EVEASRFOM1OJ419-45U1O[RPJ1PWDM1;4JL1IOJ4R","timestamp_created":1546786788,"timestamp_updated":1546786788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48122222","author":{"steamid":"76561198072600219","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":558,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":558,"last_played":1546698482},"language":"english","review":"I liked Opposing Force more than Half-Life itself.
