Half-Life 2 is the type of shooter that we do not see anymore. In an industry competing for who can have the most explosions and 10 year olds screaming, it is a breath of fresh air to play this game and notice all of the important things that are missing from most first-person shooters: atmosphere, level design, and most importantly, fun. Half-Life 2 manages to nail all three of these aspects and much more. A linear shooter, yes, but it has enough deviations from the typical FPS tropes to provide players with a unique experience that doesn't hold your hand to the next checkpoint. Graphically it is not up to par with today's major releases, but with an engine that has aged so well as Source, it is hard to put some of today's technologies up against it. Physics are still excellent, facial animations are terrific, and the overall art design, couple with the music, give the game a real sense of this strange and dystopian atmosphere that you are a part of. As we see some FPS now returning to this formula (e.g. Wolfenstein: The New Order, Bioshock Infinite), the reminder of the influence that this game has had on these newer releases is amazing. Easily my favorite first-person shooter of all time and a must play for anyone looking for a different experience.","timestamp_created":1419394338,"timestamp_updated":1419394338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13560023","author":{"steamid":"76561197965963219","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10609,"last_played":1475420662},"language":"english","review":"This game is a good way to get lazy.\nIts started Source Engine that made games like GMOD and Left 4 Dead.\nI put more than 100 hours in this game,playing around with cheats and playing the story.\nI like the 3 part thing it does with episode 1 and 2.\nI give the game a 10/10 because its the game that calls for more and then you play more and enjoy it.\nIf you speedrun the game first, then play through it slow, your mind will be blowed away.\nBeat my Speedrun Rec: 1:12:47\nI can say more but it will take around 2 hours to write.","timestamp_created":1419390017,"timestamp_updated":1419390017,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13559513","author":{"steamid":"76561198064722509","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":675,"last_played":1505856540},"language":"english","review":"It is a great MUST play game, this has really good graphics and style.

Integrating puzzles, using environmental elements in ways that would make no sense in a predictable FPS game but in a similar IRL situation would make all the sense in the world, is absolutely stunning. Your movements are so responsive, however you move, you move, no questions asked. I haven't even gotten to the storyline yet! This game's plot, not even to mention that of the entire series as a whole, makes your heart race, your head ache, and makes your soul yearn for more. The enemies are so inspired yet so original, the characters so fleshed out yet so mysterious that it leaves you to fill in the gaps with your own theories upon theories whilst Valve keeps delaying Episode 3. I don't even mind how linear it is! I think it's great, because even though you have a clearly defined path, you can get by with a plethora of different ways, you can intelligently sort your way through or you can leeroy jenkins it (and fail) \n\nAnd then the sheer sense of righteous heroistic armed solitary vigilantism that this game gives you is amazing. Do you want to take down a totalitarian ruler who controls the world with an iron fist? Do you want to indirectly battle an alien species bent on total domination of the Multiverse? Are you one of those people who, like me, are actively defiant of rule  by military authority, control, fear and oppression? do you want to be the hero of a dystopian story so like and yet unlike any of the novels you read? Do you feel like breaking the age-old motif of militarized shoot-and-run fighting, and want, for once, to play the role of a super-smart theoretical physicist with his uber-badass nerd glasses, throw on a suit of armour and crowbar and gun your way through endless hordes of mindless zombies, weaponized monsters and meatheaded military personnel alike while having to actually use your brain in a First-Person-Shooter?
