2: Episode One is kind of the black sheep of the Half-Life 2 games. It is a good game in it’s own right but it lacks the innovation of Half-Life 2 and it lacks the story of Episode 2 which is by far the best story arc of the whole series in my eyes. So we are left with a good game that is sadly forgotten in the mix by many because it is the middle child. All of the same great game play is back in Episode One. The story in itself is good and enjoyable. City 17 is now a war zone and the game revolves around trying to escape it. The graphics are just as good as Half-Life 2, no better but no worse. The game doesn’t have any of the driving sections of the original. There is however a great level taking place in a hospital which was almost as creepy as Ravenholm.\n\n\tI played Episode One on Linux. It never crashed on me. There are once again some AI issues. This time what happened to me was on a mission where I have to lead civilians to a departing train some of them got stuck in a wall corner and wouldn’t proceed making me have to reload a previous save. Outside of the AI issue I noticed no other bugs.  There were 4 AA settings; 6 AF settings; a V-Sync toggle; 9 other graphics options and an FOV slider that went from 75-90. You could change the difficulty level at any time as well as manually save at any time. Performance was fantastic which wasn’t surprising given the game’s age. \n\nGraphics Engine: Source\nGraphics API: OpenGL\nDisk Space Used: 1.05GB (not counting HL2 base game)\n\nGraphics Settings: All Highest; 8x AA; 16x AF; blur off; V-Sync on; multi core rendering on; HDR full; 90 FOV; 1920x1080\n\nGPU Usage: 16-52 %\nVRAM Usage: 1022-1398 MB\nCPU Usage: 5-20 %\nRAM Usage: 2.7-3.3 GB\nFrame Rate: 137-144 FPS\n\n\tOverall I can’t say too many negative things about Episode One. It does it’s job well which is to further the Half-Life story. It doesn’t innovate but it also doesn’t make anything worse. I finished the game on the hardest difficulty in 3 hours and 48 minutes. \n\nMy Score: 8.5/10\n\nMy System:\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 580 8GB Gaming X | Mesa 21.2.5 | Samsung

Unfortunately, [b] Half-Life 2: Episode One [/b] takes a massive step back in pacing, story and level design that lead to a good addition to the series but a disappointing step back for the gameplay experience. While the environments are still detailed and the worldbuilding remains incredible, there is a lack of real substance behind the goals of Gordon and Alyx throughout.\n\nFirst off, the pacing: its been slowed in some areas to a crawl. While you begin in the aftermath of the Citadel's destructive collapse, the game takes its sweet time laying out the same gameplay loop that was present in the original title. It isn't until halfway through the game where you finally get the chance to use some decent weaponry, and even then there aren't many combat arenas to use them in for a little while beyond that. However, out of the nowhere the game throws nearly every weapon Freeman had at the end of the original game back into his arsenal going into the fourth (out of five) chapter, which felt very unnecessary. Weapons should've been trickled into the player's possession much earlier and spaced out accordingly, since there aren't any notable additions to Gordon's loadout as well as the fact that this title is a fifth of the length of the original game. \n\nCombat arenas are also notably weaker, and many devolve into simple shootouts versus giant spiderants and Combine opponents. Many are linear and lack movement like in the original title during segments like Nova Prospekt, and there are no defense scenarios like in the aforementioned chapter from the base game. While the player is propelled forward for much of the story, it feels as if the developers forgot to spice the gameplay up with some defense segments, involved puzzle solving sequences, or detailed and interesting combat arenas. For the most part you'll run forward, shoot enemies, and repeat unless you are thrown into a square/circular room with little cover and objects to use.\n\nThe story also comes to a halt here: Gordon and Alyx are stranded inside of the Citadel with little time before a second reactor meltdown, but after delaying the process the duo are completely focused on escaping the city. While there are some worldbuilding elements such as an explanation as to the origins of the strange creatures in the Citadel, as well as some insight on the struggles of humanity under Combine control, many of it provides depth to the world but lacks a compelling narrative to boot. It boils down to an escape from the city with a few key setpieces along the way. \n\nVisually, the game looks as good as before if not a tad bit better. There are some interesting lighting segments when Gordon and Alyx traverse through the railway systems underneath City 17, and the destroyed landscape of the city itself (while lacking in some color) showcases the bleak nature of the destructive forces at hand. This amplified the intensity of the escape itself a lot, and despite many actual \"levels\" being a bit standard, it got me through most of the experience without a heap of complaints. \n\nThe gunplay is untouched thankfully, though the delay of getting weapons was annoying. The game's focus on the gravity gun early on is an okay gimmick, but that was a stronger gimmick at the end of the last game and lost a lot of the impact gameplay-wise here. There aren't a whole heap of environmental puzzles section nor standard puzzles as well, which would have helped with the level design stagnation and pacing issues. The music is still good, though a lack of mood-setting tracks such as that of Ravenholm's really showcased some of the repetitive action-packed fury these tracks tend to convey. A better mix would have done wonders, though this would have also required some better level diversity.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with [b] Half-Life 2: Episode One [/b] but I'm left with the feeling that this project was severely rushed and chopped up. Honestly, both episode's being combined into one would have given Valve more room to experiment with level design again, but the nature of these episodes and the lack of commitment for a full sequel must've forced Valve's hand, especially with the way things were left in the base game. This would've worked better as a combination with the other episode and a full rebranding, possibly just splitting the game into two parts akin to [b] The Last of Us [/b], but alas this is what we were left with. Thankfully the series is still alive and kicking, and this serves as a solid albeit disappointing entry in light of one of my favorite games of all time. I can [b] Recommend [/b] this one to fans of the first and second games...obviously.
