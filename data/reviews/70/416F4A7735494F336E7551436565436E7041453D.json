Considering the substantial success that Valve relishes in today, it's not surprising that their first effort to enter the gaming market was an instant hit. Heavily inspired by id Software's Doom and Quake games, Half-Life is a perfect blend of 90s and modern first-person-shooter. Anyone who proudly calls themselves a gamer MUST have played this game at least once - especially considering that it's an easily affordable product on Steam that is still updated by Valve even twenty years later. \nThis is often cited as one of the earliest F.P.S games (back then they were called \"Doom clones\") that had actual plot, complete with characters, dialogue and setting. As old as it is, the story is very well-detailed and sets off a chain of events that only escalates further down the line. \nEven with the dated graphics, the game still looks brilliant today and can run at 60fps, with loading screens that always last no more than a single second. Valve games seem to maintain a pattern of focussing more on gameplay rather than on cutscenes, and it's no surprise that Half-Life did so well at telling a story without ever taking the player out of the immersion of the infamous silent protagonist: Gordon Freeman. \nAs for those of you who prefer multiplayer action over single player, Half-Life also offers a deathmatch mode which, incredibly, still has players clogging the lobbies even today. There is no ranking system, and despite its rather bland design, it's an appreciated addition to a game that didn't even need it. \nI am not exaggerating when I say that this game is pretty much the sole reason for Steam's very existence. Without it, Valve would never have gotten off the ground and we would live in a world absent of Portal, Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, and so on. \nSo, do not be intimidated by the fact that this game is from 1998. You'll be surprised at how well it holds up and how tight the controls are. If you want to explore Valve's roots that made them the game-changers that they are (or rather, were) today, then download Half-Life, pick up that crowbar and start whacking the hell out of everything. You won't be disappointed. \nTime to choooose.","timestamp_created":1530306112,"timestamp_updated":1544831722,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559050261974334717","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43168591","author":{"steamid":"76561198345530093","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":267,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1620200176},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyunu

In my opinion, this is the most unique sound desing that I've ever encountered. It totally fits the whole game. Voice acting is good, too (for 1998 game ofc xddd). The third thing is the engine, this game was created in. Goldsrc takes place from the original IDTech1, by ID Software. The first Quake was made in it. This engine, ofc, is now just outdated, but... but, just look, what people are creating for it. There's so much mods and modding-platforms for this game.

Porque la IA de este juego es una pasada, los aliens son unos verdaderos hijos de puta, los militares estan más chetados que un puto hacker y te hacen desquiciarte, pero a esto sólo le veo cosas buenas, ya que es un juego que te plantea gran reto. \nSi sólo quieres pasartelo y disfrutar de la historia y juego excelente, póntelo en normal, pero si quieres quebrarte la cabeza y medir cada paso que des, ponlo en difícil y prepara el culo. \nPor último decir lo único malo que he experimentado en el juego, y ha sido el movimiento del personaje, aunque ya estaba acostumbrado un poco, ya que diría que es un movimiento parecido al del Counter Strike 1.6, al haber tanto plataformeo 3D igual he muerto las mismas veces por los enemigos que por caídas, pero bueno, le da un plus a la dificultad.","timestamp_created":1530265009,"timestamp_updated":1530265009,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43147903","author":{"steamid":"76561198108592373","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":708,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":600,"last_played":1556709096},"language":"english","review":"This game is legendary: simply put.

Then theres the other gun that me and my freinds describe as the \"Ghostbuster Gun\". Oh man and that revolver is just great too. super acurrate , kills most enemies in 2 shots , and i mean cmon revolvers are just cool in general. all the guns in this game are pretty great in one way or another and feel great. \n\nThe multiplayer is pretty simple to get into and fun as well. you respawn instantly so dont need to wait for long to get back into the action. all the guns from singleplayer are somewhere on the map. i will say some of the bigger maps feel too big for small groups of freinds tho.\n\nSome of my major complaints here is mostly the bugs. along the way through the whole game my character just gets stuck on things. alot of times it happens when its loading the next part of the map. other times i get stuck on a lever im standing too close to when i pull it. also had one weird instance weird if i touched a body on a moving elevator it just instantly killed me. and i had one major super gamebreaking bug. putting spoiler tag cause it involves a pretty late part of the game. [spoiler] so in gonarchs lair during that boss fight the creature is meant to at one point jump into a hole. and then go down onto its web thing. well for about a half hour i tried to fight the monster while it did not do this. needless to say it was frustratring. i couldnt really kill it even if i used all my ammo. and if i stayed near it instead of jumping down below the web it would just kill me. the boss was unbeatable and wouldnt die untill i reloaded an earlier save. [/spoiler]\n\nThe story is well gordon freeman just having a really bad day while everyone keeps telling him to go and do stuff cause hes the only one capable of doing anything [spoiler] during the resonace cascade thats making alien bug people randomly teleport in everywhere. oh and then a weird guy with a briefcase asks you if you want to work for him. [/spoiler]  Which is allright i guess. most of my fun came from just wondering who hell designed the various facilities and maintenance shafts with zero regard for human safety rather than the story itself.","timestamp_created":1530180127,"timestamp_updated":1530180127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572009623050689697","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43118906","author":{"steamid":"76561198138475188","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1064,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":973,"last_played":1530064450},"language":"spanish","review":"Wow","timestamp_created":1530160460,"timestamp_updated":1530160460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43118154","author":{"steamid":"76561198837137316","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1631287050},"language":"english","review":"I knew that this game was old, but I never knew that it came out in 1998!

The gameplay is fun and the story is well-written. I played the game on the hardest difficulty, and obviously, the enemies were at times challenging to defeat, particularly the soldiers. But you get plenty of ammo and health throughout the game, and you just have to play smart. My only criticisms are that the game goes on for too long, and that some of the puzzles are hard to solve. The game starts on a great note, with the player becoming immersed in the world they are in. However, the game loses some steam in around the middle. Levels like \"Power Up\" and \"On A Rail\"  became tedious with constant backtracking and not knowing where to go next. Luckily, the game regains it's momentum with the following levels. Chapters 12-14 in particular, are the highlights of the game. Though they aren't as interesting as the preceding chapters, the Xen levels are still playable and they culminate in a satisfying conclusion to a great game. Half-Life is one of the best FPS games I have ever played, along with \"DOOM\", and definitely better than \"Call Of Duty\". If the graphics don't hold up for you (For me, they did), try out \"Black Mesa\", a remake of this game with MUCH better graphics. If you haven't ever played \"Half-Life\", play it!","timestamp_created":1530124831,"timestamp_updated":1530124831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43101756","author":{"steamid":"76561198842793013","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":307,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":141,"last_played":1604055550},"language":"turkish","review":"HAYATIMDA GÖRDÜĞÜM EN EFSO OYUN..","timestamp_created":1530111851,"timestamp_updated":1530111851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43101741","author":{"steamid":"76561198401291456","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":135,"last_played":1631307263},"language":"english","review":"Great Game","timestamp_created":1530111813,"timestamp_updated":1530111813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43101409","author":{"steamid":"76561198813390630","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":106,"last_played":1600598416},"language":"turkish","review":"mazilerrr","timestamp_created":1530111099,"timestamp_updated":1530111099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43101147","author":{"steamid":"76561198391564461","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":521,"last_played":1612808177},"language":"russian","review":"Игра по прежнему актульна даже спустя 20 лет, у менея всё.","timestamp_created":1530110472,"timestamp_updated":1530110472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43099543","author":{"steamid":"76561198843361691","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":32,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1529915043},"language":"english","review":"Good old masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1530106715,"timestamp_updated":1530106715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43097972","author":{"steamid":"76561198072559211","num_games_owned":1894,"num_reviews":105,"playtime_forever":1172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1157,"last_played":1531343911},"language":"russian","review":"А я уже и забыл, что от игр может тошнить (если вы понимаете о чем я).

per cui Half life è un capolavoro\n\n- Narrativa silenziosa. Al giorno d'oggi è la prassi che in un FPS di stampo narrativo (anche quelli che ritengo dei capolavori, come la saga di Bioshock) tutto ci venga spiegato da tutti. NPC che parlano, blocchi di testi da leggere ecc. Tutto ciò ovviamente è molto bello, ma è molto più arduo narrare una storia con poche parole, pochi dialoghi e poche scritte. Half-life ci riesce.  La stessa regia ( come quella relativa alla sequenza di introduzione a Black Mesa) è un grande espediente per instaurare nella mente del giocatore degli elmenti su cui dedurre dove ci troviamo, chi siamo e cosa si fa in questo luogo.\n\n- Ironia. Il primo Half-life, al contrario del secondo, è un gioco che non si prende troppo sul serio. L'ironia è sottile e comprende figure come quella degli scienziati, dei militari e delle figure governative. Un chiaro esempio di ciò è la sequenza di intro a black mesa: mentre la voce pre-registrata del vagone in cui ci troviamo spiega detagliatamente le norme di sicurezza e raccomandazioni relative, assistiamo ad un enorme perdita di materiale radioattivo gestita malamente in una zona di transito.\n","timestamp_created":1530038706,"timestamp_updated":1530038706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43076330","author":{"steamid":"76561198061777085","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":157,"last_played":1586291040},"language":"english","review":"I like the game because it is a good game.","timestamp_created":1530036655,"timestamp_updated":1530036655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43075202","author":{"steamid":"76561198056539173","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1601,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1212,"last_played":1592515767},"language":"spanish","review":"THE BEST♡","timestamp_created":1530034073,"timestamp_updated":1574896027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43074573","author":{"steamid":"76561198119825059","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":334,"last_played":1500155071},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1530032712,"timestamp_updated":1530032712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43074550","author":{"steamid":"76561198423370572","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":664,"last_played":1550862911},"language":"english","review":"Like it!","timestamp_created":1530032667,"timestamp_updated":1530032667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43074459","author":{"steamid":"76561198310964893","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164,"last_played":1580666927},"language":"english","review":"00f","timestamp_created":1530032480,"timestamp_updated":1616518557,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43073033","author":{"steamid":"76561198041554143","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":23,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1590257215},"language":"spanish","review":"Para mí, el padre de los FPS!","timestamp_created":1530029416,"timestamp_updated":1530029416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60120844841003418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5IO3nuQCeeCnpAE="}
