Ken’s development team was responsible for creating the first BioShock (2007), which garnered overwhelming praise from critics and gamers for environmental storytelling, storyline, and artistic beauty of the underwater city, Rapture. BioShock Infinite garnered similar praise from both groups though there were some division within the fanbase because of the convoluted plot, plot holes, an attempt to make a very complex story gone wrong (personal opinion, but I probably already ruffle some feathers on the fan group). The game was considered as one of the most anticipated games for 2013. The game was revealed around September 2010 and it came with a full-fledge “alpha gameplay” in E3 2011. Two years later, the game was released on March 2013. I originally wrote a negative review about this game on Steam, but after playing the game for the second time, I decided to update the review and see if my views changed. Does BioShock Infinite live up to its expectation back in 2013 and years after the release date?\n\nBioShock Infinite takes place in 1912 on Columbia, a sky-city led by Prophet Comstock. You play as Booker DeWitt, a bitter protagonist who has a mysterious past, must get Elizabeth and bring her to New York to wipe away the “debt”. The story does get complex about Elizabeth’s powers and how her powers can shape those around her. I do like the complex relationship between the two characters, which brings positive and negative interactions throughout the game. One aspect of this game I really like is the artistic talent from the developers on creating the world of Columbia. The introduction is very impactful even if the religious themes does not suit the player’s views. Still, Columbia is vibrant, artistically beautiful, and colorful. The gameplay is similar to BioShock with the use of vigors (Infinite’s version of plasmids), but Booker can only carry two weapons. Elizabeth can create “tears” for tactical purposes like turrets, debris as cover, barrels of weapons for ammunition, and various others. The story can take around 10-12 hours even with finding voxophones and exploration (for the base game). The two-episodic DLC, Burial at Sea, can take an average of five hours – depending on the player’s play style. In addition, the voice acting performances from Troy Baker (Booker DeWitt) and Elizabeth Comstock (Courtnee Draper) are outstanding and have to be commended. \n\nThere are criticisms for BioShock Infinite. The gunplay is average – at best as the game tends to be more action-focused than its previous BioShock installations. There are similar weapon variations with the “red” weapons are weaker than the originals. Some sequences can feel like a Michael Bay movie which doesn’t fit into a BioShock game with no tactical planning and Elizabeth having limited abilities to assist Booker in firefights. The climatic battle near the end of the game is lazy and unusually anti-climactic. The worse sin is how the story became unnecessarily convoluted, causing me to have many headaches, leading to confusion, and shaking my head on the story’s inconsistencies in Infinite and the tie-ins to Burial at Sea. I usually pay close attention to the storyline. At first, I can understand what the story is leading, to but adding many plot-points in a short period of time leads to convolution. \n\nI wrote a negative review for BioShock Infinite back in late 2013 mainly because of the story. As of typing this review, I still dislike the story but I do appreciate what Ken Levine’s vision for BioShock Infinite due to its artistic aesthetics and art style. The game is best played on the hardest difficulty (1999 mode). Personally, it’s not a positive or a negative review but a “mixed” reception. The only reason why I gave this game a thumbs up because the positives outweighs the negatives even my personal bias lean towards not liking the game. I wish Steam has a “mixed” review (having a yellow-brownish thumb with the thumb pointing horizontally).  BioShock Infinite is a good game on its own, but not a great BioShock game.","timestamp_created":1374435853,"timestamp_updated":1603675240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504587173461914063","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1231700","author":{"steamid":"76561197989720946","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":817,"last_played":1451601894},"language":"english","review":"An absolute masterpiece of gaming.

It was a competent game, don't get me wrong. The shooting was pretty good and the story was OK. But it didn't grab me to nearly the same degree that BioShock did. Returning to Rapture. already knowing a great deal about it's history was not the same as the first trip down to this sunken Dystopia in the Bathysphere.\n\nWhen I first read about BioShock Infinite, I cringed a bit because it was set in a different place, and I wondered if this was a sequel in name only. Let me assure you: it is not. Ken Levine's singular vision is back for this, the third game in the series, and it means the quality of the game, especially its story-telling and character development, has returned to that of its groundbreaking original predecessor.\n\nI can’t really speak about the boldest aspect of the game, the ending, without spoiling it. It uses a well-worn idea from Science Fiction with great effect. I vastly appreciate its physical manifestation in Infinite, also found in the brilliant To The Moon. Succinctly it is a thoughtful ending to a fantastic game, superlative to the somewhat routine endings of its predecessors.\n\nTo Ken Levine and everyone at Irrational Games I say, bravo. Easily the best game I’ve played this year, and the best game in the BioShock series so far.

The plot kept me engaged the entire time, and while certain areas did feel like filler (specifically right before the final act) the small plot twists and interesting premise, along with the great characterization, will keep you playing.\n\nAtmosphere: 10/10\nColumbia (the city the game takes place in) is beautiful, and the variation between different zones is beautiful. A screenshot from anywhere in game looks like a painting. The music is fitting, the city feels alive, and while you don't always feel like you are miles off the ground, you always feel like you are in Columbia.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nSolid shooter mechanics, and a variety of weapons. The new plasmids, err tonics, are different enough to compliment a variety of play styles. The action is fast paced and very much -in your face-, so don't expect stealth mechanics, but the gun-play is much improved from the original Bioshock. The limit of two weapons at a time is also a welcomed addition, as it makes you wonder if carrying around an RPG for a boss is worth it when fighting individual units. \n\nSound: 9/10\nThe voice acting is fantastic, and while the music is up to par with industry standards, doesn't really stand out all too much. There is only one point at which soundtrack really stood out to me, but even then it was only for a moment. For the most part the soundtrack is going ot be fast paced to match the gameplay, which works. Columbia, however, and the sounds of the machines and songs on the streets, work perfectly. \n\nPros:\nGreat Story and Atmosphere\nSolid Mechanics and Gameplay\nContinues the BioShock story\nAmazing Characterization\n\nCons:\nCertain areas feel like filler\nStrange difficulty spikes in some areas\nLow-Medium Replayability\nSome tonics you get too late into the game\n\nExtra Notes: Looking forward to see where they go with DLC.

Musik und soundeffekte und auch die Sprachausgabe sind von erstklassiker Qualität.\n\nDie Geschichte ist raffiniert, aber nicht gerade logisch oder intelligent. Auch passiert im gesamten Mittelteil nichts von Relevanz, aber es hat immer noch mehr Handlung als die meisten Shooter. Bei einem erneuten Durchlauf merkt man, dass die Entscheidungen, die man gelegentlich trifft, keine Auswirkungen haben außer einer kosmetischen, was schade ist.\n\nInnerhalb der Spielwelt gibt es einige Ungereimtheiten, die offensichtlich aufgrund mangelnder Differenzierung der Entwickler entstanden sind und andere aufgrund der anzunehmenden Vorgaben des Publishers Elemente des Franchises wiederzuverwenden. Das betrifft das Verhalten aller Figuren miteinander: NPCs mit dem Spieler, Gegner mit dem Spieler, Gegner mit deiner Gefährtin... es kommt zu einer Diskrepanz der Glaubwürdigkeit.\n\nDie DLCs sind enttäuschend, weil sie Columbia nicht vertiefen sondern sich wieder auf Rapture berufen und nur Fanservice sind. Für sich genommen und spielerisch sind die wohl in Ordnung, nur versuchen die unvereinbare Dinge zu verbinden und es wird so getan als sei das von vornherein so geplant. Außerdem erfüllt Burial at sea nicht die angesetzten Erwartungen, so dass eine aufgeschlüsselte Geschichte daraus geworden wäre.\n\nDennoch habe ich für das Kernspiel viel Sympathie übrig, die teilweise irrational ist. Leider verbraucht sich der content recht schnell, aber es gibt mehr zum Nachdenken und zu entdecken als in vielen anderen Spielen und seien es auch kleine Eastereggs oder Makel.

То, что мы называем атмосферностью игры, собрано из мельчайших деталей: игрок наблюдает отнюдь не сценарические клише, которые, казалось бы, должны пробуждать определенные чувства, а ощущает происходящее напрямую, как бы невзначай.\n\nBooker DeWitt - это тот самый протагонист, которого я всегда желал увидеть, но никак не мог встретить. Не пустая оболочка, прогоняемая по рельсам сюжета, а цельная, многогранная личность, далеко не всегда считающаяся с игроком в принятии решений. \"Да что же он такое творит? Нужно было не так, не сейчас, по-другому...\" - удивительно ощущать такие мысли, на самом деле.\n\nПожалуй, иногда слов недостаточно. Здесь, свою роль играет Elizabeth. Она воспринимается не просто компаньонкой или напарницей , а, что поразительно, частью главного героя: не только эмоционально, но и за счет механики игры. С уверенностью можно сказать, что такого совмещения персонажа и игрока до этого не было, пожалуй, нигде. \n\nKen Levine делает всё для того, чтобы представить повествование должным образом: заставляет нас глубоко прочувствовать происходящее и с головой погрузиться в него, стать тем самым Booker'ом DeWitt'ом и буквально прожить за него эту историю. Финал дополняет эту картину, поднимая столько же много вопросов, сколько мало дает ответов, оперируя уже не просто человеческими жизнями и судьбами, а поистине высокими материями. \n\nСпасибо.","timestamp_created":1374334365,"timestamp_updated":1606332819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2974934","author":{"steamid":"76561198015338596","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1158,"last_played":1396510298},"language":"english","review":"Mind-blowing ending.

I can't praise it much without spoiling it, so I'll just say that it's definitely a classic and leave it at that.","timestamp_created":1374283074,"timestamp_updated":1374283074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102032","author":{"steamid":"76561197961860435","num_games_owned":345,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":1083,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":678,"last_played":1407613218},"language":"english","review":"Great game!

Viagem no tempo, distorção temporal, paradoxos, e isso sem deixar de lado a parte emocional, não há como não se \"apaixonar\" por Elizabeth, uma personagem fortíssima assim como o protagonista que controlamos. Apesar de ser um FPS, este jogo possui uma história muito bem trabalhada, e como eu disse, personagens muito bem construídos. Um adendo, procure todos os Voxfones, pois partes muito interessantes da história estão lá, inclusive a construção da mítica do jogo.\n\nNão há muito o que comparar em relação aos outros bioshocks, a mecânica é fabulosa, a jogabilidade excelente se mantém, o uso bem pensado do mouse para o uso dos poderes também. em alguns momentos o uso do hook se mostra uma das coisas mais bacanas do jogo, viajar pelos céus e atacar inimigos através de trilhos usando um gancho de mão é uma das experiencias mais bacanas que se pode ter num jogo, ainda mais sendo um bioshock.\n\nAcho que o importante do jogo é isso, jogabilidade excelente, gráficos muito bonitos, personagens fortes, e uma história cativante.
