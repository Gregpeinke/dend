Even better if you get the half life bundle on sale so then you can enjoy the entire series!\n","timestamp_created":1647656889,"timestamp_updated":1647656889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112438805","author":{"steamid":"76561198865601713","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":624,"last_played":1647646218},"language":"russian","review":"–ª—É—á—à–∞—è –∏–≥—Ä–∞ –æ—Ç –≤–∞–ª–≤","timestamp_created":1647646240,"timestamp_updated":1647646240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112432750","author":{"steamid":"76561198233834644","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":1632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1632,"last_played":1619400133},"language":"english","review":"headcrabs","timestamp_created":1647637857,"timestamp_updated":1657829863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112427302","author":{"steamid":"76561198989113754","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1657976850},"language":"english","review":"The game is very enjoyable with exciting gameplay and challenging levels.","timestamp_created":1647631342,"timestamp_updated":1647631342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112425772","author":{"steamid":"76561198832323033","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2918,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1776,"last_played":1653147630},"language":"russian","review":"—Å—É–∫–∞ –¥–∞–∞–∞–∞–∞–∞–∞–∞–∞","timestamp_created":1647629510,"timestamp_updated":1647629510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112422767","author":{"steamid":"76561198844025150","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":226,"last_played":1648846520},"language":"turkish","review":"online modu g√ºzel single modu g√ºzel","timestamp_created":1647625865,"timestamp_updated":1647625865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112422312","author":{"steamid":"76561199043209597","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":365,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":244,"last_played":1649085231},"language":"turkish","review":"Tarihin GER√áEKTEN eskimeyecek olan oyunu.","timestamp_created":1647625323,"timestamp_updated":1647625323,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112420746","author":{"steamid":"76561198911281413","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":585,"last_played":1659031051},"language":"latam","review":"El Juego.","timestamp_created":1647623402,"timestamp_updated":1647623402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112419376","author":{"steamid":"76561199166414836","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":606,"last_played":1655123034},"language":"czech","review":"Slu≈°n√° old school hra.

\"cinematic\" start is very impressive first time, but if you don't know english you are stuck and play it like a sierra quest (it's published by sierra, get it?). And every time you want to replay the game the \"cinematic\" 2 hours long intro is utter trash you have to suffer through. You already know the story beats, now you just want the gameplay.\nFirst hour after the event was kinda weak in the 90s: without internet full of walkthroughs it is very easy to miss the crowbar and the first gun in all of the clatter and be stuck.\n\nThen it's hours upon hours of pretty mediocre insane corridor shooter, where the most fun part is pressing buttons. Your legally blind nerd protagonist single-handedly destroys more army-men, tanks, choppas and giant enemy crabs than duke nukem or doomguy. You even have to fight hordes of sexy-time girl-ninjas. At one point you are even captured in a teerible trope of \"now we take away your inventory\". The army guys drag you somewhere looking at you while you are looking at them and leave you alive for no reason. Talk about dumb bad guys.\nOnce you start to get sci-fi and alien bioweapons you finally start to see that this is not a stupid shooter where all cool guns were replaced with stupid boring realistic military stuff with weak damage. This isn't the Wolfenstein 3D on a 3D engine. Bioguns were great then and they are great now. Even today there are still like 3,5 games that have them. One of which is called Opposing Force.\nSo okay it's a mediocre FPS with primitive gunplay where you can press E half as much as in the Duke Nukem 3D (but now in 3D) and it has some cool sci-fi and bioweapons you never saw anywhere else. You finally finished it and a science dude tells you to jump in a portal and win the game.\n\nOH DAMN XEN! NOW THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER! An alien world with extremely fun reduced gravity, now we are talking! There are some alien and sci-fi games. But it's always you invading a civilized space or defending human's colonies with civilized spaces, so same corridors slightly different skin. But this time you run around alien wilderness and then invade an alien sci-fi factory! The last boss is pretty weak. It's not as bad as in Quake, but it's still a stupid puzzle. It will take some time but it is possible to understand it without a walkthrough.\n\nAnd then there is the multiplayer deathmatch. Quake 2 is absolute garbage without MP, and HL would not be the same without it too. You played with all those weird weapons and gadgets, half of which are utility tools with no use to them, and now you can finally place traps for fellow humans or rain aggressive naked rats into their hiding hole. You can run around with vacuum cleaner reducing live players into bloody chunks.\n\nAmazing Xen and great deathmatch make this corridor game with bad gunplay one of the greatest games to this day.","timestamp_created":1647479461,"timestamp_updated":1647479461,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501510560512542725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112316718","author":{"steamid":"76561199230917789","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4411,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":3031,"last_played":1659893751},"language":"english","review":"AMAZING GAME!!!

Basically, the birth of modern \"cinematic\" FPS games.\n\nYou weren't the \"only one against the world\", but could and needed to recruit fellow scientists and security guards. You wielded an arsenal of (mostly) realistic weapons, such as Glock and MP5. There are many parts/levels, that other than the dated graphics, are still memorable and gripping, such as the fight against the Apache gunship. This game still oozes atmosphere.\n\nBut it's not perfect, and the big problems are the platforming sections (the bane of FPS games throughout their history IMO) and Xen, the \"Gigeresque\" alien world you get to visit in the latter part of the game. Put those two together, and you have a rather frustrating and unsatisfying \"epilogue\" to an otherwise great experience.\n\nBut overall, I feel it is a game that can still be very much enjoyed, even without through rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia. And for those of us who played it back in the day, it will no doubt bring back lots of memories of a certain \"golden era\" of gaming.","timestamp_created":1647466899,"timestamp_updated":1647466899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112310847","author":{"steamid":"76561199069870567","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2908,"last_played":1655233975},"language":"english","review":"good stuff","timestamp_created":1647466322,"timestamp_updated":1647466322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112309368","author":{"steamid":"76561198063297912","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":318,"last_played":1647467705},"language":"english","review":"This is a pretty good game since it's from 1998.
