La trama del gioco è ben realizzata e ben strutturata. Per avere un'esperienza ottimale del gioco bisogna anche conoscere o aver giocato a Portal.\n\nCarina la modalità Co-op dove si impersonano due robot (P-body e Atlas) che devono risolvere i test utilizzando due Portal Gun in grado di creare quattro portali indipendenti. Inoltre nella modalità Co-op è possibile, dopo aver completato il percorso del test, scegliere una camera di test attraverso il pannello che si trova all'inizio di ogni test track. É possibile personalizzare l'aspetto di Atlas e P-body.\n\nSe sono state completate sia la modalità Singleplayer che la modalità Co-op, esiste la possibilità di scaricare nuove camere di test sia in Singleplayer sia in Co-op grazie a Workshop di Steam.

To arcydzieło. Nie bez powodu plasuje się na pierwszym miejscu na steamie pod kątem opinii wśród wszystkich gier kiedykolwiek na tej platformie. Tak jest ponieważ ta gra sobie na to zasłużyła, Dobra! Do rzeczy: Oryginalny pomysł - taki mokry sen każdego developera. Doskonała, klimatyczna ścieżka dźwiękowa. Absolutnie rozbrajająca i dorosła mimo wątku sci-fi fabuła. Fenomenalnie napisany antagonista, którego pamięta się po latach i wspomina z łezką w oku(koniecznie ograć część 1 zanim sięgniecie po dwójkę). Wprowadzone bardzo pomysłowe i co ważniejsze - pasujące do konwencji nowości względem Portal 1 tj. żele, tunele, mosty świetlne. Niekosmicznie trudny ale ciekawy projekt komór. No i już na sam koniec... twórcza, oddana oraz bogata społeczność, której projekty, niektóre utra-trudne komory testowe sprawiają, że płacisz raz, a grasz praktycznie bez końca.

Chociaż próg wejścia nie jest wyśrubowany, to można utknąć na parę chwil w wersji fabularnej Valve oraz na parę ...DNI w wersji dla najgorszych masochistów którzy pragną przejść zaawansowane logicznie komory społeczności steam.\n\nPodsumowując; polecam każdemu, kto chce przeżyć na serio zajebistą przygodę.
