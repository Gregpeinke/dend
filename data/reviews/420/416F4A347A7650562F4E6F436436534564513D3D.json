This is definitely the most story-focused entry in the Half-Life series. I'm personally not sure whether I agree with this (albeit slight) refocus, but the story is done well and minimally intrusive. If you didn't like how brief the previous entries were on dialogue, this will probably be your favorite one. My only criticism is that some of the scripted sequences go on for a minute or two more than they should. And they almost always explain the very simple plot. Alyx is fleshed out a little more and the rest of supporting cast gets more development- especially the new, and welcome, Dr. Magnusson.\n\nThe gameplay is more diverse than any other game in the series. The six or seven hours spent driving, shooting, squishing, jumping, crawling and hurling (with the gravity gun, of course) just zoom by. The levels are nothing you haven't seen before, but they're so well focused and immaculately polished it's impossible not to fall in love with the series all over again. The only brand new enemy is the hunter, which is kind of a strange addition. Their flechette gun is neat and very lethal, but the hunters themselves unfortunately end up being little more than bullet sponges. And unfortunately you can't take the gun from them! What a missed opportunity! Do yourself a favor and stockpile magnum ammo for those suckers. Or just hit them with your car.","timestamp_created":1493083208,"timestamp_updated":1493083208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31347858","author":{"steamid":"76561198371396296","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":62374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":493,"last_played":1619105199},"language":"english","review":"Nicely made game!

Half-Life 2: Episode 2 [/h1]\n\nReleased in 2007, Episode 2 is the second episodic entry in Valve’s Half Life 2 series. It is the direct continuation of Episode 1, following Gordon and Alyx’s perilous journey to reach the White Forest resistance base.\n\nThe gameplay takes elements from both its predecessors and integrates them into a much more expansive setting. Large portions of the game take place outside in the sprawling country valleys surrounding City 17. This largely rural environment provides some beautiful vistas, and is a refreshing change of pace from the dense urban landscapes that have come before. The game still plays in a very linear fashion, but the presentation often gives the illusion of a more free roam environment, and makes the linearity far more subtle than the previous instalments.\n\nEpisode 2 reintroduces vehicle gameplay to the series, and several of the chapters focus on the player driving around in a modded 1969 Dodge Charger. The car controls pretty well and further helps with the feeling that you are travelling across open terrain in order to reach your goal. Some novel gameplay elements such as adding radar to the car in order to help you find hidden supply caches also provides a nice diversion.\n\nYou still have an AI companion with you for large portions of the game, however this is now much more liberally interspersed with independent gameplay. You are often separated from your partners in order to solve puzzles or engage in combat. I feel that the developers found a solid balance here, allowing you enough time on your own to feel a sense of accomplishment at completing objectives by yourself, but also giving you enough emotive scenes with your companions to give the story significance.\n\nThere are a couple of new enemies introduced: The Antlion worker comes equipped with a projectile attack which provides more varied enemy behaviour during the Antlion chapters. The more imposing addition is the Combine hunter. These formidable opponents have had their AI specifically designed to act in a pack mentality; surrounding, flanking and enveloping the player. The open and flowing map designs really help to accentuate this concept.\n\nEpisode 2 also sees some further graphical improvements to the Source engine. Some notable upgrades include motion blur effects on things like the hunter projectile attacks, and particle system improvements for better flame effects. There have also been further developments in HDR lighting, which can be observed most notably when using the flashlight in the underground tunnel chapters.\n\nAnother remarkable addition is the use of what Valve calls cinematic physics. These effects are usually showcased in set piece events where large portions of the landscape are altered in front of the player in a very dynamic manner. A prime example of this is the collapsing railway bridge scene at the start of the game, where huge sections of metal framework plummet down in a convincingly realistic way.\n\nThe main criticism that can be levelled at the game is its length. Despite being longer than Episode 1, its seven chapters can still be comfortably completed in less than 10 hours. However, it is worth mentioning that there is also a developer commentary mode which includes tracks by Merle Dandridge (Alyx Vance) if you are at all interested in the design process, or if you simply wish to get a little more replay value. \n\nPersonally, I feel that Episode 2 is the most story driven entry in the series and has some compelling voice acting to enhance this. It is also the most graphically advanced entry, while also providing diverse gameplay throughout. Unfortunately the infamously long wait for Episode 3 continues, however this does not detract from the accomplishments of Episode 2.

Но потеха потехой, а как же Знание, в коем сила кроется? Игроки из кожи вон лезут, строя всевозможные догадки по поводу интересующих их вопросов. Что было с Фрименом? Кто такой G-Man? Кто такие комбайны? Однако на носу уже второй эпизод, который подарил нам отличный геймплей и атмосферу, но ответов не слишком-то и прибавилось, скорее вопросы новые появились. И главный из них – неужели в пяти часах геймплея третьего эпизода разработчики планируют поместить всю интересующую игроков информацию, все объяснения, всю развязку? Имеют место опасения, что нам скажут «Безусловно, вы все узнаете, но уже из Half Life 3! Встретимся лет, этак, через пять!». Да, Half Life 2 получила от различных изданий более 35 наград «лучшая игра года», но если третий эпизод выйдет в духе второго, игра станет «просто хорошим сериалом», а доктора Фримена, если он когда-либо и удосужится заговорить, слушать уже мало кто станет.","timestamp_created":1491310052,"timestamp_updated":1491310052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464238911867141724","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30939066","author":{"steamid":"76561198054753519","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":570,"last_played":1494527776},"language":"english","review":"Hardcore crap with over9000 Save\\Loads.

(It doesn't make sense, story-wise, for there to be a modified Gravity Gun in Episode Two.)\n\nEpisode Two is longer than Episode One, but it sure didn't feel that way. I enjoyed every moment of this game, and time flew by as a result. I did not have to crawl through multiple air vents, nor was I lost in the dark like I was in Episode One. Instead, I was able to drive around, walk over grubs, solve some puzzles, and participate in some rather intense action sequences.\n\nThe story (and music) in this game is the best of those available in the \"Half-Life 2 saga.\" The characters show more depth than ever before, which makes them all more likable. Ultimately, the story will tug at your heart strings, but it ends abruptly. If anything, this game's ending is what has most gamers freaking out over a potential Half-Life 3 game. \n\nAlso, it will take you more time and effort to complete these achievements than those in the previous two games. However, you should feel proud of completing a couple of these achievements. The Get Some Grub achievement is no joke, considering you have to find and kill 333 grubs, and the Little Rocket Man achievement is probably this game's most notorious, if not annoying, feat. (Be sure to close the door at the very end, otherwise your hard work will be wasted!)\n\nSimply put, Half-Life 2: Episode Two ends with a bang, and it is far more enjoyable than Episode One. It's a must-play game. If you haven't played Episode Two, then set some time aside; you should really play this game. I can't recommend it enough.
