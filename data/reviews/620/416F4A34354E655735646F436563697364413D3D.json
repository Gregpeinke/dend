Sûrement un des jeux devant lequel j'ai le plus rigolé.\n\n[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]\nUn des meilleurs jeux de réflexion auquel j'ai pu jouer. Le concept des portails est génial, sans compter tous les niveaux comprenant d'autres techniques à maîtriser, en plus des portails, comme les Halos d'Excursion, les Ponts de Lumière Tangible ou autres gels de saut et d'accélération. Très riche pour les amateurs de réflexion.\n\n[h1] GRAPHISMES [/h1]\nLes graphismes ne sont pas des graphismes énormes Ultra HD ou je ne sais quoi, mais ils sont amplement suffisants pour ce genre de jeux, rien à dire dessus.\n\n[h1] DUREE DE VIE[/h1]\nLa campagne solo est composée de 8-9 chapitres plus ou moins longs, à combiner avec la Coop qui propose 5 chapitres + 1 bonus (je crois). Donc vous pouvez quand même passer du temps dessus, toujours avec les blagues de GLaDOS et le fameux Wheatley.\n\n[h1] DIFFICULTE [/h1]\nPour un jeu de réflexion, la difficulté est très bien dosée. Les niveaux ne sont jamais trop faciles ou trop durs, ils ont réussi à trouver un juste milieu, ce qui est parfait. A chaque fois, on a un niveau qui permet d'assimiler le nouvel élément à prendre en compte, et les niveaux sont de plus en plus difficiles au fur et à mesure que l'on avance. Pour moi, les plus difficiles étaient lors de la visite du vieux centre d'Aperture.\n\n[h1] REJOUABILITE [/h1]\nUne fois le jeu terminé, il ne faudra pas vraiment compter sur une grosse rejouabilité, ou alors il faudra laisser un certain temps entre votre première partie et votre seconde. Malgré tout, le Workshop peut vous proposer une expérience différente avec des niveaux faits par les joueurs.\n\n[h1] AVIS [/h1]\nLe meilleur jeu de réflexion auquel j'ai pu jouer, et l'un des meilleurs jeux tout court.\n[b] Les plus [/b]\n[list]\n[*] L'humour\n[*] Le Gameplay\n[*] La difficulté\n[*] La Coop (qui est vraiment très bonne)\n[*] La durée de vie\n[/list]\n[b] Les moins [/b]\n[list]\n[*] Rien :)\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1489702292,"timestamp_updated":1511378983,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593959689140319824","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30548752","author":{"steamid":"76561198238724814","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":688,"last_played":1553827719},"language":"english","review":"its fun to play","timestamp_created":1489700624,"timestamp_updated":1489700624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30547362","author":{"steamid":"76561198330391051","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":6675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2967,"last_played":1635360633},"language":"italian","review":"coco belo","timestamp_created":1489694635,"timestamp_updated":1545414619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30547322","author":{"steamid":"76561198261476091","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":922,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":563,"last_played":1520188043},"language":"english","review":"i loved the game!! would love to see a thriller and exciting portal 3 like this one.\n","timestamp_created":1489694527,"timestamp_updated":1489694527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30547166","author":{"steamid":"76561198353780832","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":49,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":49,"last_played":1484515693},"language":"english","review":"Dank","timestamp_created":1489693945,"timestamp_updated":1489693945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30546686","author":{"steamid":"76561198097637619","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":821,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":683,"last_played":1495719242},"language":"german","review":"Einfach ein Klassiker!\n\nEs ist ein tolles Rätsel Spiel, in dem viel logisches Denken abverlangt wird.

Очень радуют пасхалки + секретные комнаты, найти которые ты только можешь с трудом и желанием. (да, или просто позырить в инете, очень для этого их и делали =-=) Так же хороший и трогательный сюжет, расскрывающий вселенную Portal 2, остается надолго в памяти, как и юмор и калоритные персонажи... Неожиданные повороты, хотя в игре нет альтернативного прохождения, очень трогают за душу и осторожно подводят к концовке. \nИгра меня порадовала графикой и нормальной озвучкой ГЛаДОС на русском(в отличие от 1 части, где она говорила с каким-т скрипом в голосе и гугл транслейт акцентом)... \nСейчас на рынке есть много головоломок, зачастую это просто фиговые инди. Поэтому советую пройти игру (хотя бы пиратку). Ибо это стрелялка, а что-то другое с  уникальным геймплеем, со своей вселенной.","timestamp_created":1489609134,"timestamp_updated":1525643522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.663633346557617188","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30530688","author":{"steamid":"76561198121648939","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":345,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":345,"last_played":1492192455},"language":"russian","review":"Заставляет думоть, но от моей деградации не уйти.","timestamp_created":1489606931,"timestamp_updated":1511519998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30529607","author":{"steamid":"76561198129457862","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1096,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1052,"last_played":1541102675},"language":"german","review":"Die vielen Eastereggs erhöhen den Wiederspielwert und haben eine grosse Community um dieses Meisterwerk wachsen lassen.
