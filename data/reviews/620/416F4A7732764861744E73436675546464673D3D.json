Великолепная игра, представляющая из себя головоломку от первого лица. В нашем распоряжение есть портальная пушка, с помощью которой игрок будет проходить игровые уровни. Игра полна юмора и интересных сюжетных моментов.\nПо сравнению со первой частью заметно улучшилась графика, увеличилась продолжительность, а также были добавлены разноцветные гели, репульсионные воронки и другие объекты, которые помогут нам преодолевать тестовые комнаты. Игра является головоломкой от первого лица. В ней нужно решать множество задач с помощью всего двух порталов (вход и выход). Игра проходит, как в замкнутых комнатах, так и на открытых пространствах.( Но я думаю вы это и так знаете :D ). Звуковое сопровождение отличное. Звуковые эффекты нареканий не вызывают. Музыки не много, но она здорово поддерживает атмосферу происходящего.\nТакже в игре присутствует возможность построения комнат. Так сказать, блеснуть сообразительностью и создать, почти, неразрешимую головоломку и послать в сеть. А можно играть уже созданные кем-то комнаты, загрузив из той же сети в Стим. Великолепная и неповторимая игра! Головоломки, заставляющие по настоящему включать мозги ( если таковы имеются :D ), уморительный сюжет (причём даже в кооп сюжет вплетён и очень даже не плохо), опять же повторюсь \"замечательное музыкальное сопровождение и картинка радующая глаз!\" Впрочем, всё как всегда у Valve, одна из лучших игр. Я думаю со мной согласяться многие! \nНу и без оценок я не оставлю этот обзор ( Это чисто мое мнение и я его никому  не навязываю )\n\nМузыка и звуки 11/10 Как я и говорил звуки здесь шикарны поэтому оценка превышает стандарты :D\nГеймплей 10/10 игру спокойно можно пройти на одном дыхании если есть мозги и ты хоть каплю умеешь ими пользоваться\nГрафика 10/10 графон стал намного лучше чем в первой части но это естественно так как индустрия игр развивается и есть куда расти дальше.\nИтог 10.3/10 почему выше 10 да потому что первый пункт 11 а не 10 :D что хочу сказать в целом игра, нет постойте ШЕДЕВР стоит того даже немного жалко что такая игра и не получила премию \"оскар\" от Steam но может у нее еще все впереди, на этой счастливой нотке я пожалуй и закончу! Всем побольше игр в Steam.

[/b]\n\n[b] Art des Spieles [/b]\n[quote=Wikipedia] Portal 2 ist ein Puzzlespiel mit Plattformelementen, welches aus der Egoperspektive gespielt wird. [/quote] Im Prinzip geht es vor allem um die Interaktion mit der Umwelt des Spiels. Mit viel Grips und teilweise etlichen Versuchen muss der Spieler Rätsel lösen, um vorwärts zu kommen. Neben dem Singleplayer bietet Portal 2 auch einen Koop- Modus, in dem man mit seinen Freunden gemeinsam an die Lösung der Rätsel gehen kann. :)\n\n[b] Handlung [/b]\nNachdem die Protagonistin \"Chell\" nach den Geschehnissen des Vorgängers [i]Portal[/i] in einen lang währenden Schlaf gefallen ist, übernimmt man auch in diesem Spiel wieder die Kontrolle über die junge Dame. Die Laborräume von [i]Aperture[/i] sind in der Zwischenzeit dem Verfall überlassen worden. Doch nach erneutem Erwachen erweckt der Spieler versehentlich [i]GLaDOS[/i] , die Antagonistin aus dem ersten Teil, zu neum Leben. GLaDOS beginnt nahezu umgehend damit, Chell neuen Tests zu unterziehen und das Labor wieder herzustellen.\n\nOhne zu viel verraten zu wollen: Das Spiel nimmt im Lauf eine sehr interessante Wendung... ;)\n\n[b] Pro's [/b]\n[list]\n[*] geniale, unterhaltsame Story\n[*] teilweise sehr fordernde Level\n[*] äußerst humorvoll mit guten Dialogen\n[*] sehr gut laufendes Spiel\n[/list]\n\n[b] Con's [/b]\nKann ich für mich selbst keine finden, dafür war ich zu begeistert von dem Game! :)\n\n[b] Fazit [/b]\nPortal 2 hat es tatsächlich verdient, als eines der besten Spiele aller Zeiten bezeichnet zu werden.

Вторая часть уничтожила по мне главный минус первой части. Продолжительность. Я не знаю за сколько вы проши первую часть, но при особых старании ее можно пройти за часа 3. Теперь же, вторую часть можно пройти за часов 10. Ну а кооп еще отнимет времени... кстати о нем.\n+Кооператив. Ну, это самый главный по мне плюс, который дает игре разнообразие.

Игру проходится долго и не легко, как первая. Много что было добавлено и это прекрасно. Остаётся радость и печаль после прохождения этой игры. Хочется игрокам ещё одну часть... Не хочу вас расстраивать, но придётся - Portal 2 это конец, одновременно прекрасный и ужасный. Обязательно пройдите эту игру!","timestamp_created":1492180840,"timestamp_updated":1492180840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31136711","author":{"steamid":"76561198290954535","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":9526,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6389,"last_played":1646876015},"language":"english","review":"i love portal 2 the story is the best the voice actting is really good and you can make your one test","timestamp_created":1492180671,"timestamp_updated":1492180671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31135696","author":{"steamid":"76561198162501786","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":530,"last_played":1528049278},"language":"english","review":"only game ive played that i feel i have an obligation to review, first things first i only just finished the single player and it has been the most fun ive ever had playing a game the variety in levels the ingenuity of the puzzles and the great voice acting and script make this an amazing experience.

It expands upon what the first game offered, allows for a sense of depth and familiarity with characters, and is an outstanding game by it's own merits- and this is just a review 8 years after the launch!","timestamp_created":1492128648,"timestamp_updated":1574376132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31125755","author":{"steamid":"76561198133773388","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":1905,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1732,"last_played":1526975346},"language":"english","review":"Really good interesting and challenging puzzles, genuinely funny throughout, both single player and multiplayer.\n\nCo-op is great, provided neither/both of you have done the same levels before. One of the best coop games I have ever played, even good for people who aren't really that into gaming, and good for getting used to controlling from a first person perspective.\n\nAlso the co-op element allows them to do even more interesting and ingenious puzzles now there are 4 portals to use, and both players have equal parts, it's not just one person doing all the work.","timestamp_created":1492125671,"timestamp_updated":1523839529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31125070","author":{"steamid":"76561198199790959","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3674,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2772,"last_played":1643048215},"language":"english","review":"Great story! 10/10\nAlso when is portal 3 coming valve?","timestamp_created":1492122308,"timestamp_updated":1508488118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2vHatNsCfuTddg=="}
