A genius approach to the puzzle genre, that had some of the best mechanics in video games. I fell in love with the characters and their personalities. Like GLaDOS for her bipolor, psycotic, 'know-it-all' attitude towards the games events, but watching an A.I. develop a personality is an experience I never thought I could take so seriously. At the same time, however, an appropriate amount of comedy that took me off gaurd, leaving me to litterally laugh out loud. With the addition of a multiplayer that actually contains a story mode, blew my mind. The multiplayer works in the same ways, but with added new mechanics. Such as the ability to point out places for your partner to places his/her portals. I had high hopes for this game being that Portal 1 was the first PC game I had ever played, so I entered the game hoping that It would deliver, and boy did it. I played this game over at least 6 times and beating the multiplayer story twice. Each time I played through it, I picked up something that I had not  known before. Something that most modern games fail to do now a days. I am happy to say that my expectations for the game were definitely met. Reccommend that you would try this game for sure, although I do recommend that you do play the first Portal game first however. Reason being that you won't be able to understand some of the comical, emotional, and visial references to it (trust me, there are a lot of them).\n\nRecommended Audience: all\n\nScore:\n\n9.5/10\n'Instant Classic'","timestamp_created":1393141801,"timestamp_updated":1393141801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9229046","author":{"steamid":"76561198108012860","num_games_owned":372,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":91,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22,"last_played":1420400639},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра.

Игра была официально анонсирована Valve 5 марта 2010 года. Изначально её выпуск планировался осенью того же года, однако после нескольких переносов датой выхода Portal 2 было назначено 18 апреля 2011 года. В России игра вышла 21 апреля 2011 и распространяется компанией «Бука».\nПродолжение развивает игровой процесс первой игры, состоящий из головоломок, построенных на использовании специального устройства для создания порталов — разрывов в пространстве — позволяющих игроку мгновенно перемещаться из одного места в другое. Среди множества нововведений геймплея в Portal 2 присутствует кооперативный режим для прохождения двумя игроками. Действие игры происходит спустя некоторое время после событий Portal в разрушенной и заброшенной Лаборатории исследования природы порталов (Aperture Science) и фокусируется на дальнейшем противостоянии всё той же главной героини, подопытной девушки Челл, и маниакального суперкомпьютера GLaDOS. В кооперативном режиме присутствует отдельная сюжетная линия.\nСравнивая Portal и его продолжение, Valve подчёркивает, что первая часть была лишь экспериментом, в то время как Portal 2 является уже полноценной игрой с совершенно новыми элементами геймплея и гораздо большей продолжительностью (игровой процесс рассчитан примерно на 6 часов в одиночном режиме и столько же в кооперативном). Более того, на конференции GDC 2010 директор Valve Гейб Ньюэлл заявил, что Portal 2 — это лучшая игра за всю историю существования компании.","timestamp_created":1392984992,"timestamp_updated":1392984992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9203173","author":{"steamid":"76561198039264936","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":73,"last_played":1646639617},"language":"english","review":"A great continuation of Portal 1.

I dont believe I have words that can even compare to the wonders that is portal. However, I will admit that this game is much easier than the first portal. (at least for me) I flew by this game in a breeze, fell in love with Cave Johnson and played it many times after beating it. If you like Portal I def. recommend this game and the first one.
