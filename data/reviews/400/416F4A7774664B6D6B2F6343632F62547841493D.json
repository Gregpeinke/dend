Now that might be obvious considering the only prominent voice work is of Ellen McLain (including the turrets) and the cast of characters is relatively higher than this game, but I feel its design in both level and story makes it higher in this regard. \n\nNow I have played Portal 2 a handful of times, and this only for the first time, even with knowing the outcome of the game, I suspended my belief and played it like a kid who just got the Orange Box and found this interesting Portal game inside the bundle, and man was it a melancholic void. I think the level design is the key factor that created that added level of isolation, from these pristine white walls and polished cubes, having a very up-kept feeling with the subtle yet powerful contrast of broken or dirty areas like the 'weird goo'. It was like looking into a cubist painting and seeing a small leak of an unsightly faded green seeping from behind the painting, that sense of unease really heightened the subnormal atmosphere of the place. This was also strengthened when stumbling upon the Ratman dens, which really started to tip the scales in the uncanny nature of the facility.\n\nNow compare that to Portal 2, where the old test track is now run over with greenery and faint birds can be heard. It is completely obvious this place was abandoned and has no upkeep whatsoever. The answer stares you in the face. Now that isn't bad, since it is building upon the previously established story and themes from its predecessor whilst adding new content to create a new but still continuous experience (AKA The Perfect Sequel), but I love the drip-feed in Portal 1 that is the true nature of Aperture Laboratories being this husk of a facility overrun by a sentient, omnipresent and rebellious robot regulator, and that couldn't have been present in the latter half of the franchise.\n\nNow what I really have trouble with is a specific way that tests are dealt with compared to how they deal with their tests in Portal 2. If you enter the Developer Commentary section of Portal 1 and listen to what they say, all of their design choices make complete sense and were felt throughout the game, such as the introduction of new mechanics and the clever ways they can train your mind to find the solutions through the use of context clues, Ratman's scribblings or previously learned game mechanics. The problem I have with the tests is them having pivotal test solving moments in a style I'd like to call \"Rehearsal/Reaction Testing\", which is a good fit for a puzzle platformer game, but some sections seem to feel harder on new players. Let me explain.\n\nI understand that being a God at puzzles but no proficiency at platforming or vice versa is not what the game is trying to accomplish. It is supposed to make you improve in both fields, but it feels that the game assumes you have a certain level of reaction that some players might not actually have before playing this game. Valve has done an excellent job on teaching new players mechanics and introducing/debunking concepts the player stumbles upon by just doing the right footwork, but still let's the players actually figure things out by themselves with all the valid information given, but platforming can be done in a similar fashion. They still have introduced flinging techniques well, but it felt too little too late for me, as even in some areas I was struggling to piece together the information I have already gathered from playing Portal 2, its community mods and the Perpetual Testing Initiative, among other things. They only really get introduced halfway through the game and sometimes I felt like when I did some of my flings, it was completely different to how it was supposed to be completed, which I either did it the deliberate way or the puzzle is more open ended, which is good, but if an intermediate player like me can't figure out what is the desired and purposeful solution, I'm sure the new players couldn't even try to find the shoddy workarounds that I did, let alone the actual intended path.\n\nThose moments only took up around 5% of my actual experience, and were less game breaking then I might let on, but I still find it a valid point of criticism (which had already been worked on wayyyyyyyy before even started thinking to play this) for Portal 1.\n\nThe only other real critique I can say is that the graphics haven't aged well, but that has nothing to do with Valve, that's just the cruel passage that is time. Apart from those, I really have nothing else to say negatively about this game. Its story is intriguing whilst it expands the canonical Valve Universe, the gameplay is finely tuned to create an incredibly unique puzzle experience and has cemented the franchise as the Puzzle Platforming juggernaut that is so truly deserves.\n\nThanks Valve :D","timestamp_created":1611400810,"timestamp_updated":1611400810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85196763","author":{"steamid":"76561198043447743","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":368,"last_played":1611399422},"language":"schinese","review":" 这也太短了8","timestamp_created":1611399531,"timestamp_updated":1611399531,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85196573","author":{"steamid":"76561198362226039","num_games_owned":672,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":3405,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3045,"last_played":1644270494},"language":"russian","review":"В какой-то момент ты выучишь как проходить игру и начнёшь проходить её на скорость соревнуясь с друзьями, и через тридцать минут у тебя не останется друзей, потому что у тебя их и так не было","timestamp_created":1611399234,"timestamp_updated":1611399234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85195635","author":{"steamid":"76561199012576987","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":257,"last_played":1611242642},"language":"schinese","review":"很好玩\n","timestamp_created":1611397880,"timestamp_updated":1611397880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85194903","author":{"steamid":"76561198799330921","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1647745121},"language":"english","review":"this game got me nudes +rep","timestamp_created":1611396741,"timestamp_updated":1611396741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85194526","author":{"steamid":"76561198337093231","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":686,"last_played":1641296572},"language":"english","review":"very nice game, well designed and good looking","timestamp_created":1611396169,"timestamp_updated":1611396169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85193326","author":{"steamid":"76561198274969993","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":13633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13518,"last_played":1644186996},"language":"english","review":"It's pretty neat.
