Quick save and load were very useful, but you do get past some puzzles so fast and easily, you do forget about it, and when you need it, you always quick load back to far. Luckily the autosave was there to help. It also comes with bonus maps, if you're like me, and played the game overly fast. Though I will say, the main game took me only a little more than two hours.

I've seen friends play it and understood it was puzzle based but never got around to playing it in its entirety... until last weekend. I have to say the hype for this game was huge when it came out but I never really understood why it got as much love as it did. After playing through it I could finally see why so many have come to love the franchise and is still a topic of discussion to this day.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes were looking at a first person puzzle game. We use a portal gun to create two portals (which allow us to enter through one and come out the other in a different place in the room) to progress through the level. It’s a simple premise, get from point A to point B but there is so much depth to the game. You can reach the end of a level in multiple ways, it’s not a one solution type of puzzle game. I've found that the levels have a good learning curve to them. The tutorial levels work well at getting you acquainted with the games mechanics and the levels get progressively more difficult as you complete each stage. \nThe stand out sections for me where at levels with robots aiming to kill you, requiring you to take risks and think differently to avoid death and also the infamous final stage which is easy to find out about on the internet as I did know how it played out before but it was a fun stage none the less.\n\nThe story revolves around character you’re playing as going through a facility \"testing\" the portal gun. You are assisted by character called GLaDOS who is an AI unit that directs you by voice. A few laughs were had listening to GLaDOSs “advice” and seeing where the story goes with her. Portal starts and ends on a great note. You are dropped into the world without any clues as to what’s going on, making your way from level to level, slowly discovering the truth of what the facility is. Portal tells a great story without overwhelming with exposition and staged moments.\n\nThe graphics look good enough. Portal came out in 2007 and it’s easy to see the age of the game. All in all I was surprised at how well the game worked with newer hardware. I managed to run Portal on an ultra wide screen with 3440 x 1440 resolution. It ran smoothly, I didn't encounter any issues playing through it all. \n\nPortal holds up as a great first entry into the franchise. As someone who hadn't played it for a decade I can safely say that it’s a great game for all types of players who enjoy puzzles mixed in with an interesting narrative. The mechanics and physics in the game are very entertaining to mess with and it’s a game that encourages creativity in getting through the levels. It took me roughly three hours for a complete play through. Some may find this short but Portal definitely has a lasting impact and will have you thinking about the moments well after the credits roll.","timestamp_created":1496234141,"timestamp_updated":1496234141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32071744","author":{"steamid":"76561198114555190","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":1974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":62,"last_played":1609469806},"language":"english","review":"played it on xbox, bought it just so i could play though it again, I mean i havent but that doesnt mean i wont....thanks summer sale","timestamp_created":1496178836,"timestamp_updated":1496178836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32070664","author":{"steamid":"76561198276042654","num_games_owned":688,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":8,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1573113873},"language":"schinese","review":"先送上好评","timestamp_created":1496175249,"timestamp_updated":1496175249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32070077","author":{"steamid":"76561198155204059","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":292,"last_played":1622846950},"language":"english","review":"it was cool, but rather limited i would ask for a level editor/ creator so its less limited but i still recomend it","timestamp_created":1496173517,"timestamp_updated":1496173517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32068218","author":{"steamid":"76561198332724456","num_games_owned":542,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":547,"last_played":1616714328},"language":"english","review":"Short, sweet, and awesome.

BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED...!\n\nWhenever I buy a game, it usually sleeps in the corner after i've tested it for a few days and got bored with it. Very few games have kept me entertaining till the end. But Portal is definitely something else. Even though its classified as a puzzle game, the story is totally amazing. Especially if you notice the subtle things like hints on the floor sometimes when you are puzzled on what to do next. Out in the end in a room I saw a projector showing a powerpoint stating the competitor for aperture tech. It was something irrelevant to the whole game and to the experience. But the fact that such a thing exists takes this to a whole new level. I wish I haven't missed any subtle things.\n\n\nComing to the main star of the show. THE AI!!!!!\n\nWithout the AI, this game wouldn't have gotten so much praise. The sarcasm, its voice, here and there random language changes, intentional glitches, etc brings a whole new picture into the game. Not to mention the robots that tries to kill us.\n\n\nOverall I have never enjoyed any game better than this. If there is anyone out there who have played a better game, please do tell me. I would definitely like to play them.","timestamp_created":1495737534,"timestamp_updated":1495737534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31954797","author":{"steamid":"76561198110075184","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1495729099},"language":"english","review":"A timeless masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1495729250,"timestamp_updated":1495729250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31953537","author":{"steamid":"76561198348174256","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":168,"last_played":1632833481},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1495725704,"timestamp_updated":1632832318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31953399","author":{"steamid":"76561198067567275","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":92,"playtime_forever":81,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":81,"last_played":1356508800},"language":"english","review":"My requirements of a GOOD game:\n\nFun Game: ✔\nLinux Port: ✔\nGood developers: ✔\n\nOptional:\n\nIndie: ✘\nGood fanbase: ✔\nImmersive: ✔","timestamp_created":1495725236,"timestamp_updated":1495725236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.43090587854385376","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8vuKoNwCd5/yeQ=="}
