What an amazing game. It's so misunderstood and seen as \"an unforgiving game\", \"a very tough game\" and \"the hardest game in 1998 (debatable)\", when in reality, it's just played incorrectly. Half-Life isn't just a shooting game with story, it's a strategy game with story. The game isn't just \"run, shoot, die, reload, run, shoot, live\", it's \"run. think. shoot. live.\", which is also the whole \"phrase\" of the retail game back in 1998; the phrase would be plastered almost everywhere on the game boxes. It's shocking the amount of people that just think the game is \"oo I now have an SMG so I can use THAT instead of the shotgun to kill enemies!\", it's more in-depth. Each gun, each purpose. Each enemy, each strategy. Each map, each way. The pistol is meant for mid-range attacks, when you're with enemies which aren't worth wasting your ammo on. The crowbar is great for melee; fast and powerful. The shotgun is for closer range attacks. The SMG is good for clearing out enemies at long range. The revolver is great for longer range enemies who need to be taken down quickly. I'm missing so many other weapons, but you get the point; running and shooting isn't all, thinking and living is another big part.","timestamp_created":1578236555,"timestamp_updated":1606697366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61358407","author":{"steamid":"76561198309711143","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":1197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":332,"last_played":1644609390},"language":"brazilian","review":"é bom","timestamp_created":1578234403,"timestamp_updated":1578234403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61358065","author":{"steamid":"76561198172538366","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":572,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204,"last_played":1651418622},"language":"czech","review":"i když je to stará hra velmi be baví a jsem s ní spokojem","timestamp_created":1578234003,"timestamp_updated":1606337533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61357960","author":{"steamid":"76561198313440286","num_games_owned":408,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1594770245},"language":"english","review":"impulse 101 during credits, shot gabe newell 8/5","timestamp_created":1578233895,"timestamp_updated":1579676414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61357285","author":{"steamid":"76561198139326510","num_games_owned":345,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1161,"last_played":1578232617},"language":"schinese","review":"经典。老游戏了，虽然以现在的眼光来看，刨除画面，也依然还会有很多不适应的地方，不过还好我基本也算那个时代过来的，所以完全可以适应。重玩一波就当怀旧，还记得当年还是从班上同学那借的盘，不得不说那个年代在中国买正版盘的着实难得。","timestamp_created":1578233105,"timestamp_updated":1608450166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61355590","author":{"steamid":"76561198420050394","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":370,"last_played":1586376023},"language":"turkish","review":"nostalgia","timestamp_created":1578231368,"timestamp_updated":1578231368,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61355378","author":{"steamid":"76561198805724177","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":743,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1617381223},"language":"turkish","review":"güzel bir oyun aq","timestamp_created":1578231156,"timestamp_updated":1578231156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61355333","author":{"steamid":"76561198059633397","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":634,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":615,"last_played":1590355765},"language":"brazilian","review":"Cara e um classico","timestamp_created":1578231113,"timestamp_updated":1578231113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61353452","author":{"steamid":"76561198256653988","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":590,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":590,"last_played":1578159709},"language":"koreana","review":"고든!

Y para las nuevas generaciones realmente espero que lo jueguen, se que los gráficos no son los mejores pero para su época fue toda una revolución gráfica aún así lo recomiendo totalmente.\n\n||-----HISTORIA-----||\nEs bastante buena su historia para ser un juego de disparos en primera persona, pero es mucho mejor que la averigües por ti mismo.  :)\n\n||-----CONTROLES-----||\nEste caso depende más de tus gustos, en mi propia experiencia me gustan pero no me terminan de convencer del todo porque me parecen algo sensibles. (Sobre todo en los saltos)\n\n-Muchas gracias por leerlo y espero que te halla gustado.

Mesmo assim se sustentou no seu gameplay divertido, fluido e dinâmico (freeman parece um sonic de tão rápido). No geral a ambientação é ok, nada de inovador, e a trilha sonora é meio inexistente (mas colabora para o clima do jogo). Além disso me surpreendi com as mecânicas de puzzles e como o jogo não se preocupa em te orientar e facilitar.\nCurti, o jogo é competente em vários pontos de vista e as expectativas para \"Half Life 2\" acabam de aumentar.","timestamp_created":1578181201,"timestamp_updated":1578181201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xsG7ue8Cevb06QE="}
