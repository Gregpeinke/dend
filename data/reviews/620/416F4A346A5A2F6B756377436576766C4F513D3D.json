Portal 2 traz a jogabilidade muito parecida com a do primeiro jogo, porém completamente diferente, ao mesmo tempo, possuíndo inúmeras mecânicas novas, level design (que já era incrível) ainda melhor, uma trama memorável, que se liga de maneira incrível ao modo co-op (no estilo co-optional), não sendo apenas fases do mesmo jogo com dois jogadores, mas sim toda uma continuação da trama, tendo Atlas e P-Body como seus novos protagonistas. A antagonista (GLaDOS, oh, GLaDOS), a robô mais amada pelos gamers, retorna com todo o estilo que ela merece, trazendo com ela o Wheatley (e uma grande quantidade de neurotoxina mortal), companheiro de Chell no singleplayer, e personagem de grande importância no plot, também muito carismático e um bom alívio cômico em certos momentos.\n\n Suas mecânicas de plataforma em primeira pessoa são simples, porém foram muito bem utilizadas para criar fases complicadas, divertidas e com puzzles bem trabalhados, tanto no singleplayer quanto no multiplayer (até mesmo sabendo quando o jogador pode ficar preso em alguma fase e o \"parabenizando\" por conseguir tal proeza, com o humor que só Portal consegue trazer), principalmente pela quebra do paradigma protagonista/antagonista, fazendo Chell e GLaDOS até mesmo terem que trabalhar juntas em certo ponto. O desenvolvimento do enredo é ainda maior com os segredos do Lab Rat, cujo plano de fundo é contado na HQ digital que está no site oficial do jogo, além de trazer uma diversão extra, ao nos fazer tentar encontrar todos os seus segredos.\n \n Portal 2 é e continuará sendo meu jogo favorito por muito tempo, sem competição.

Ahora hay más personajes, y una historia atrás de todo el asuntillo. Vamos a entender en qué estamos metido, y vamos a reaccionar ante las personalidades que aparecerán.\n[*][b]Dialogos:[/b] Los diálogos son extensos, con un doblaje bueno, como es normal en un juego de Valve.\n[*][b]Gráficos:[/b] Source es viejo, pero para hoy, juegos como Portal 2 no tienen nada que envidiar a juegos con Unreal Engine. Portal 2 presenta texturas de gran calidad, y unos escenarios hermosos, apoyado de una iluminación acogedora. \n[*][b]Dificultad:[/b] Tal vez el modo historia no presente una dificultad épica. Pero en el cooperativo, ya se empiezan a complicar las cosas, teniendo en cuenta que la comunicación con el otro jugador es importante. Y las ya mencionadas cámaras hechas por la gente, las cuales son parte de Steam Workshop.
