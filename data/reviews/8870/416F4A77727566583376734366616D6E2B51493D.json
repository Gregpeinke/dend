Однако, давайте обо всём по порядку. \n\nГеймплей конечно не может похвастаться своей актуальностью, сейчас шутеры вышли далеко вперед в плане динамики и проработки арен, да и ИИ в Infinite не особо расторопный даже на высоких уровнях сложности, а множество способностей и разнообразный арсенал зачастую не нужен и ситуации, которые бы вынуждали вас использовать разнообразное оружие и тоники крайне мало, да и большинство из них обусловлены сюжетной необходимостью. Да и механик оригинальной дилогии тут немного не хватает (взлом турелей, магазинов с оружием и другими припасами и так далее). Однако геймплей можно назвать вполне себе удовлетворительным и игра по большей части не о глубоком шутерном геймплее - игра в первую очередь рассказывает интересную, захватывающую и запутанную историю приключений Букера ДеВитта и Элизабет.  \n\nСюжет, на мой субъективный взгляд, самая сильная сторона игры - придумать такой мир и рассказать в нём историю, что завязана на путешествии по различным временным линиям с примесью политики, восстании и сатирическим высказыванием на тему американской истории с их войнами (Боксёрское восстание, Войны с Индейцами и прочее), расизмом и прочими радостями великой нации, это надо уметь, да ещё и подано всё это в замечательной визуальной обёртке, которая смотрится великолепно и поныне. Ну и вкрапление научной фантастики с константами и переменными тоже весьма интересно\n\nПерсонажи. Их не так много, да и глубиной они не блещут в большинстве своём, но сюжетную функцию выполняют отлично, выделяются своими дизайнами, внешностью и действиями. Вишенка на торте - Элизабет и её трансформация от милой, наивной девушки, что росла в клетке в нечто другое, а главный герой приятен уже потому, что его озвучивает Трой Бэйкер и тем, что его комментарии и свистки порой доставляли. \n\nВизуал, как уже было ранее сказано, и по сей день прекрасен и доставляет море эстетического удовольствия, ремастер этой игре не нужен...пока что. Плюс тот факт, что Irrational Games выжали такую картинку из модифицированного Unreal Engine 3 уже сам по себе поражает. \n\nВ итоге мы имеем великолепную игру с удовлетворительным геймплеем, прекрасной историей, колоритными персонажами и, совсем забыл упомянуть, неплохим атмосферным саундтреком, который прекрасно дополняет происходящее в игре. \n\n","timestamp_created":1631183306,"timestamp_updated":1631183306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99042300","author":{"steamid":"76561198215075597","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":404,"last_played":1631182199},"language":"schinese","review":"“如果有的选，我一定会在第一次上船的时候带妳去巴黎，伊丽莎白（安娜）。\"\n就让时间永远定格在沙滩上的音乐里吧...","timestamp_created":1631182647,"timestamp_updated":1631182647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99040249","author":{"steamid":"76561197995162172","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":1843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1214,"last_played":1631603064},"language":"italian","review":"L'ho ripreso in mano dopo 8 anni e ancora riserva alti momenti di divertimento.

Columbus is truly beautiful in every corner, making the horrors that lay just beneath the surface all the more shocking. Combat is fun, and you gain powers and equipment pretty fast actually. However, with that being said, I'm already considering upping to the highest difficulty. The aim assist is EXTREMELY generous, feels like aim bot really. You also get an arsenal of abilities pretty fast making your fights fairly one sided. My only other issue with this game as it stand is the price tag. Already played through this game once when it first came out, I remember loving it so I wanted to play it again, but 30 dollars for a nearly decade old game is a no go for me. Luckily, caught it at a -75% sale dropping it down to 7 dollars, which is a steal imo. I think the price tag could get away with a solid 20 at most, but maybe a 10 is more fitting. If youve never played Bioshock Infinite before, and the game looks like your style, I'd say go for it so long as youre going in blind. If youve already played it or god forbid have been spoiled, maybe wait for a sale.

Gotta play Bio1 & 2 first imho. Bio infinite wraps everything up in a beautifully somber bow that can only be done true justice by playing it to the end yourself. \nI will say this, infinite does take a rather noticable departure from the first two games in gameplay as it takes on a heavier FPS emphasis than a visibly atmospheric horror and though it has its moments of stealth navigation, it is mostly devolves into wild-west shoot outs and zip lines, with various enemy types.\nSome little tips:\n-The recordings you can pick up along the way do help with filling in on the lore and developing plot, be sure to listen in. \n-I found the weapon upgrades to be far more useful than the ability upgrades just imo. \n-Use the stat potion upgrades at first for shields above health (sheilds always recharge, and health pickup are plentiful even on hard difficulty), then salts increase as needed depending on how much you really use the abilities (i got through most firefights without even exhausting my salts below half on hard difficulty)\n-get ready for the mind

I think it is probably still one of the best games out in the market, You should absolutely try it out.\n\nIt's similar to the previous Bioshock games : you have your arsenal of weapons and your superpowers called Vigors. As opposed to the rest of the trilogy, here you have a nice and colourful setting, you are almost always out in the open, so it's much less scary.

It entails a compelling, beautiful world and intricate characters. Unlike the previous installments in the BioShock franchise, the game is a lot more linear, narrative and character-driven than its predecessors. Where in Rapture you explored the remnants of the war-torn city, uncovering its secrets, here the player finds himself in the middle of the chaos. In theme the game absolutely shines and is a worthy addition to the franchise. When it comes down to gameplay, however, it nudges more in the direction of a common triple A shooter and doesn't share in the original BioShock's customization and individually colored combat. Limited weapons (can carry only 2), the weapons don't visually change like in the original, ... This leads me to say that BioShock Infinite is a great game but doesn't 100% live up to the \"BioShock\" name. A perfect example of this is the insignificance of the vigors in the narrative. In BioShock, ADAM and plasmids played a vital role in the game. This not only from a narrative viewpoint, but also gameplay-wise. They are the reason you hunt down the Big Daddies: to get the much needed ADAM to spend on your favorite plasmids. In Infinite, the vigors exist solely because \"It's a BioShock game\" and they explain it away by tying Columbia to Rapture through the tears. Having said this, BioShock Infinite is still by all accounts a great game which I will always heartily recommend and replay, it's just not a great \"BioShock\" game.","timestamp_created":1631032547,"timestamp_updated":1631196571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.663963854312896729","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98944314","author":{"steamid":"76561198971582611","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":390,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":389,"last_played":1656270313},"language":"english","review":"~ PLAYER BASE ~\n\n▢ Everyone\n▢ Kids\n🟩Mature\n🟩Casual Players\n▢ Tryhards\n▢ Pro Players\n\n~ GRAPHICS ~\n\n▢ What Is This?\n▢ Acceptable\n▢ Good\n▢ Great\n🟩Beautiful\n▢ Masterpiece\n\n~ SOUND/MUSIC ~ (Using Headphones)\n\n▢ Bad\n▢ Nothing Special\n▢ Good\n🟩 Great\n▢ Beautiful\n▢ I´m Gonna Cry\n\n~ STORY ~\n\n▢ This Game Has No Story\n▢ Like Playing \"Candy Crush\" For The Story\n▢ It´s Alright\n🟩 Well Written\n▢ Epic Story\n▢ Thinking About It, When I Sleep\n\n~ PRICE ~\n\n▢ Free\n🟩 Underpriced\n▢ Perfect Price\n▢ Could Be Cheaper\n▢ Overpriced\n\n~ REQUIREMENTS ~\n\n▢ A Toaster Could Run This\n🟩 Average\n▢ Above Average\n▢ High End\n▢ NASA Computer\n\n~ STORY LENGTH ~\n\n▢ Very Short (0-2 Hours)\n🟩 Short (2-20 Hours)\n▢ Average (20-50 Hours)\n▢ Long (50-200 Hours) *+extras\n▢ VERY Long (200-...
