Along the way Dr. Friedman, who goes by Gordon to avoid detection, allies with fellow freedom fighters: Ayn Rand, Friedrich Hayek, Robert Nozick, and Thomas Sowell, who have also changed their names to Judith Mossman, Isaac Kleiner, Barney Calhoun, and Eli Vance respectively. Aided by the Vorogaunts, a race of aliens who originally wanted to take over earth before seeing the value of capitalism, Dr. Friedman fights to stop Keynes and restore humanity's right to private property. I heartily recommend this game, as well as it's sequels where you fight alongside Sowell's daughter and meet Murray Rothbard, who's changed his identity to Arne Magnusson \n\n10/10 would take drugs while playing Half Life 2 and reading Atlas Shrugged again.","timestamp_created":1435351559,"timestamp_updated":1460509278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16726617","author":{"steamid":"76561198069149256","num_games_owned":391,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1435349761},"language":"spanish","review":"Obra Maestra.","timestamp_created":1435350138,"timestamp_updated":1582343878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16725042","author":{"steamid":"76561198149021013","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":75,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":75,"last_played":1434270229},"language":"russian","review":"gg","timestamp_created":1435344886,"timestamp_updated":1435344886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503178894519805908","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16723381","author":{"steamid":"76561198089612386","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":757,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":614,"last_played":1529171078},"language":"english","review":"pERFECT","timestamp_created":1435339324,"timestamp_updated":1435339324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16722895","author":{"steamid":"76561198108769732","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":62,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":62,"last_played":1435332366},"language":"english","review":"Combinez get hit by wind turbine boar thing","timestamp_created":1435337638,"timestamp_updated":1435337638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16722671","author":{"steamid":"76561198035622367","num_games_owned":523,"num_reviews":136,"playtime_forever":749,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":749,"last_played":1396798242},"language":"english","review":"A fantastic FPS.

[/h1]\n\n[b] Half-Life 2 [/b] — легендарное продолжение одной из самых известных серий игр. По сравнению с предыдущей частью игра действительно сделала огромный скачок вперёд (ещё бы, 6 лет прошло) как в плане графики, так и плане режиссуры и геймплея. Во второй части происходит раскрытие многих персонажей, мельком увиденных в [b] Half-Life [/b].\n\nИгра избавилась от тех недостатков прошлой части, которые так сильно бросались мне в глаза. Внушительный арсенал отчасти избавился от чрезвычайно низкой кучности боя и недостаточной убойной силы, которыми грешило большинство оружия из первой части. Тем не менее, стрельба, особенно на дальние дистанции, как была, так и осталась не самой сильной стороной этой игры. Здоровья и патронов стало хватать, противники стали менее смертоносными, но избавились от бессмысленных перемещений.\n\nГеймдизайнеры порадовали нас интересными и яркими локациями. Первая глава очень атмосферно иллюстрирует «1984» Оруэлла. Великолепно проработанные уровни игры (хороший пример — «Рейвенхолм»), прекрасно дополняют сюжет игры. Ближе к концу игры появляется слишком большое количество перестрелок, которые, как я уже сказал выше, из-за неудобного прицела являются слабой стороной игры. Однако, это с лихвой окупается завершающей игру главой.\n\nК моему сожалению, не обошлось и без нескольких недостатков. Из-за некоторой скриптованности игры бросался в глаза тот факт, что некоторые персонажи начинали двигаться при приближении к ним, оставаясь до этого неестественно неподвижными. Недоумение вызвали баги лицензионной версии игры одиннадцатилетней давности на не самом слабом по сегодняшним меркам железе, из-за которых мне пришлось несколько раз перепроходить главу «Нова Проспект».\n\nБез тени сомнения, [b] Half-Life 2 [/b] — весьма достойный потомок. Годы работы пошли на пользу этому проекту, который я рекомендую всем как безусловный шедевр. Но, как бы мне не хотелось поставить максимальную оценку, досадные недочёты, портящие общее впечатление, не позволяют мне этого.\n\nМоя оценка: 9 из 10\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=469531775","timestamp_created":1435322238,"timestamp_updated":1435483920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523441195487976074","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16718524","author":{"steamid":"76561198141259011","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":956,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":446,"last_played":1446403603},"language":"english","review":"9.5/10","timestamp_created":1435322000,"timestamp_updated":1435322000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16717764","author":{"steamid":"76561198071640324","num_games_owned":416,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":175,"last_played":1562200621},"language":"english","review":"I found $0.39 on the ground yesterday.\nUpon further inspection, 3 and 9 are divisible and 0 = nothing.\n\n0+9=9\n9/3=3\n\nAdd 3 to 0 and 9 upside down and you get 63\nUpon even further inspection 63 is 39 upside down.\ndivide 63 by 21 and you get 3.\n\nHalf-Life 3 Confirmed!","timestamp_created":1435318857,"timestamp_updated":1435318857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515691578388214111","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16717576","author":{"steamid":"76561198151920587","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":568,"last_played":1548325276},"language":"danish","review":"Virkelig fantastisk spil, kan klart anbefale, du får så meget for prisen.","timestamp_created":1435318134,"timestamp_updated":1435318134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16716179","author":{"steamid":"76561198189148293","num_games_owned":420,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1529502630},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1435311886,"timestamp_updated":1435311886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16715919","author":{"steamid":"76561198043167809","num_games_owned":797,"num_reviews":166,"playtime_forever":3485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":709,"last_played":1652038298},"language":"russian","review":"Сити 17.
