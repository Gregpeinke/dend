Решил найти Portal, посоветовал друг. Посмотрел отзывы об игре, пару скринов и видео. Понравилось. Решил всё-таки купить его. Потом вижу Orange Box, посмотрел цену и состав набора. Взял его. Чётко. Установил Portal. Запустил. Так-так: главное меню; Новая игра; Глава 1; Начать. Просыпаюсь в камере отдыха, выслушиваю пламенную речь. Клёво. Выпускают из камеры. Прошёл первую камеру, вторую, третью, седьмую... Чётко. Застрял на восьмой. Думал пять минут, десять, пятнадцать... Надоело. Вышел из игры. Через 5 минут захотел ещё поиграть. Зашёл. Прошёл восьмую камеру за 30 секунд. Чётко. Захотел спать. Не, играть лучше. Поиграл минут десять. Понравилось. На следующее утро зашёл в стим, запустил игру, прошёл до восемнадцатой камеры. Застрял. Идиот. Потом посмотрел прохождение. Всё так легко... Прошёл сложное место иии... Упал с платформы... Не сохранился, а авто сохранения не было. ИДИОТ!!! Прошёл ещё раз. Дошёл до последней камеры. Прошёл её, потом свалил из огня и полетел дальше. Дошёл до босса. Прошёл со второго раза. Чувствую себя боссом. Потом понимаю, что у меня выполнено только 6 достижений из 15. Идиот. Начал проходить заново игру и всё выполнять. Чётко. Потом прошёл все усложнённые камеры. Чётко 2х. Теперь 12 достижений из 15. Чётко 3х. Начал проходить головоломки. СЛОЖНА. Прохожу их всё ещё...
