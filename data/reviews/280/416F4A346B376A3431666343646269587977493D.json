Half-Life: Source... Я люблю первую часть этой игровой серии, но именно эту версию я не рекомендую к покупке. Хотите поиграть в Half-Life, то покупайте оригинальную версию. Коли графика беспокоит, то придется заплатить подороже и купить модификацию Black Mesa. \n\nЧто не так с этой версией? Например, баги. Их тут достаточно. Лично у меня они появляются с главы \"Переработка отходов\", когда Гордону приходится ходить по конвеерной ленте. Также запомнились красивые гличи в главе \"Поверхностное натяжение\", когда, пройдя через минное поле и карауливших местность снайперов, надо забраться по сломанной наэлектризованной вышке на крышу здания. \n\nА вот с вертолета я взорвался... В первый раз, когда я проходил HL: Source, он вообще не прилетел. Это облегчило мне прохождение, но на душе будто груз от этого. Вчера, когда я перепроходил этот момент, то... Да, вертолет появился! Но есть одно \"но\"... Оно заключается в том, что имевшихся боеприпасов не хватает для триумфа победы. Причем все боеприпасы для РПГ попали прямо в цель, но вертолет продолжает выделывать пируэты на голубом небосводе. \n\nДалее. Управление будто ухудшилось, по сравнению с оригиналом. Может со мной что-то не так, но... Я начал проходить игру сразу после оригинала. Короче, берегитесь лестниц, особенно, когда ползаете, подобно опарышу в трупе, по многоликой вентиляции со множеством разветвлений перед лифтом, доставляющим прямиком к главе \"Отводной колодец\".\n\nТекстуры, к слову, не заменены. Все объекты просто будто потемнели. Но эти квадратные рельефы лиц и тел остались незаменимы.\n\nИИ стал, как мне показалось, умнее. Теперь тебя сразу заметят, если ты выглянул из-за угла. В первой части можно легко найти \"мёртвую зону\", но не здесь. Да, враги умнее, но у них, помимо этого, есть ещё одно преимущество. Порой ты можешь стрелять во врага (обычно хаундай или хедкраб), но не попадать в него. Обычно это исправляется, когда ты подходишь поближе, но потраченные патроны-то жалко... Уж не знаю, что это за мистическая аура окружает их время от времени от обстрела.

The game do not have completely new graphics and gameplay. Nor it is a remastered as Dark Souls: Remastered - same gameplay, better graphics.\n\n It is more of a Redux, like Hard Reset Redux. The game uses the Source engine and the dead enemies are falling on the ground with the Half-Life 2 ragdoll physics. But I was aware about this and that's why I managed to spot it easily. The graphics are optimised for widescreen but the game uses the original models before the HD-pack from HL: Blue Shift. This means that Gordon uses the original Glock, MP5, shotgun and not the Beretta, M16, SPAS weapons. There are few gameplay changes to remove some annoying quirks like: attacking headcrabs will die without inflicting damage to the player when hit in the mid-air with crowbar; the squeaky beetle grenade now detonates the land mines and the interaction with the boxes is not so janky anymore. The game runs \"out of the box\" on Linux Manjaro and I faced some visual glitches. But noting game breaking. I didn't play it on Windows 10 and I don't know if it stable there. \n These days buying Half-Life games separately is pointless. The only good choice is to wait for a sale and purchase Half-Life Complete or Valve Complete Pack  bundles.","timestamp_created":1614811472,"timestamp_updated":1614813348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.675078988075256348","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87805574","author":{"steamid":"76561198056835913","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":711,"last_played":1614753673},"language":"spanish","review":"BUENARDO\n","timestamp_created":1614810628,"timestamp_updated":1614810628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87798752","author":{"steamid":"76561198828690102","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":16,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16,"last_played":1613616281},"language":"turkish","review":"very good but i need this half life","timestamp_created":1614800516,"timestamp_updated":1625018237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87780574","author":{"steamid":"76561198141607563","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":600,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":553,"last_played":1628244695},"language":"finnish","review":"broken but good for gmod","timestamp_created":1614776647,"timestamp_updated":1614776647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87776258","author":{"steamid":"76561198970167411","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":518,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":424,"last_played":1629544305},"language":"czech","review":"No nikdy jsem nečekal že dám valve špatnou recenzi ale tahle hra je katastrofa je to úplná jednička a všechno je úplně stejně a úplně vyleštěné!

When I purchased the Valve Complete Pack back in 2019, I started the game, but never made it past Office Complex because I didn't know what to do. In early 2021 I finally rediscovered this game and started playing through it. I kept reading articles and watching videos saying that Source was the worst way to play the game. I must say, despite all the hate it gets... It's pretty fun. However, there are some issues that have been addressed a multitude of times, [spoiler] for example the Gonarch fight. That fight was the easiest boss fight I've ever done. (I'm also kinda happy about it) [/spoiler] Updates to the Source engine have broken down the game over time, and it's hard to find an old version so if you have the willpower to go through this game in its current state... At least it's beatable. \n\nOnto what I really liked about the game:\nThe Source engine has given this game a lot of polish, too much to be honest. The graphical improvements such as reflections, detailed water, and ragdolls were worth it. The story played out just as normal, and it was fun to watch Controllers fall from the sky after shooting them with a revolver. \n\nOnto what I disliked about the game: \nThe crowbar apparently was built with a loud speaker built in that makes everything you hit sound like concrete, and drowns out the actual crowbar noise.\nTentacles don't kill you, making the urgent sense of the need to escape disappear. \n\nOverall, a great game that gets a lot of hate. If you're willing to play it, you're one of the few that could withstand a game that is perfectly playable although shows its age.\n\n8.5/10","timestamp_created":1613751811,"timestamp_updated":1613751811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87017328","author":{"steamid":"76561198346690298","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":362,"last_played":1647785438},"language":"russian","review":"Изобилие багов, как графических, так и игровых, а также мизерное количество изменений показывают, как халатно и плохо был сделан этот ремейк.

this game is good but there is a WAY BETTER VERSION ON STEAM than this one!\nThis game is called (Half-Life Source), I recommend buying the one just called (Half-Life).\n\nI will start with the positives and then move on to the negatives.\nI had always heard good things about Half-Life over the years, even getting a few hours in to Half-Life 2, but I decided to stop and play the first one first and then never did. Now I have and it is a master piece. The old graphics never even bothered me, they even have a certain charm to them, the game play and great story really make this game shine. I cant even put into words how good this game is, if you haven't played it before then you really should!\n\nOn the bad side this port is a buggy mess! There was one section (the section with conveyor belts) where the graphics glitched out so bad that it was unplayable and I had to carefully study walk-throughs to get through. That was the only time I remember it being game breaking, but it wasn't the end of terrible bugs. At one point the sky box and other elements started to glitch and be very distracting, another time during a boss fight there where some black boxes all over the place like holes in proper textures. At one point there was a factory with things hanging down, some of them looked right while others where partially there but most of it was gone, so it ended up floating. \nThere were so many bugs toward the later third of the game that after completing it I did research into it. I learned that so many things got messed up in this port that I cant even scratch the surface including missing audio and messed up lighting at different times throughout the game. \n\nBut don't worry, from what I have read all of these things are not glitched in the other version on Steam! I don't know why Valve would keep this up on steam and for the same price, but the original version of Half-Life which is still available on Steam is better than this in almost every way. \nSo buy the other version of this game and witness for yourself an absolute gaming masterpiece!","timestamp_created":1613513179,"timestamp_updated":1613513179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536679506301879883","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86817669","author":{"steamid":"76561199029527790","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":125,"last_played":1627880813},"language":"english","review":"Ruins one of the best games of all time and turns it into a buggy shitshow I haven't finished this game nor do i plan to the flying scientist tells me all but rag dolls make the game more immersive and the new particles are really good. 3/10","timestamp_created":1613496435,"timestamp_updated":1613496435,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520821452140808105","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k7j41fcCdbiXywI="}
