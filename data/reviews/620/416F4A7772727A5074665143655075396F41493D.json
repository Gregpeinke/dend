2[/h1]\nCatching up on many source classics like Portal and Half-Life recently, and I must say the portal series has been a fun one. Portal 2 combines humorous artificial intelligence, great puzzles and brain teasers, and a very fun and engaging story. \n\n[u]Puzzles:[/u]\nThe puzzles were significantly better in the sequel than in the first game, due to many reasons. In the first Portal game there were these annoying electrical balls that you used to hit targets, which also killed you if hit  by them etc. They were never seen in Portal 2, and were instead replaced with many things like the different Gels that added a very cool mechanic to the puzzles, bridges and launchpads etc. I also loved that you often had to use previous platforms and sections of puzzles in order to proceed in the next ones - this gave the puzzles a little more depth than they had in the previous game. \n\n[u]Story:[/u]\nGonna try not to blast you with breaking spoilers here, but i can safely say that the story was pretty amazing. I myself kept the spoilers out and was surprised by the many plot twists i encountered through the game. I also want to note the extreme fucking genius move they made by showcasing the laboratory in all its different timelines while keeping it in the present. [i]Minor spoilers:[/i][spoiler]The first testing stages were very old and would probably date back to the 1980s ish, with bare minimum technology and wooden testing chambers inside humongous rusty metal spheres. I also loved how you could look at the posters in-game and understand their situation with the rest of the world (they weren't into law enforcement and regulations, as well as they had gotten backlash from public due to their behaviour etc). You can also tell how time passes when Cave Johnsons voice lines goes from very uplifting and optimistic, to very dark and ominous as he grows older. [/spoiler]\n\nSome more general things i liked about the game, very minor but also kinda fun to notice:\n - [b]Cave[/b] Johnson - The whole Aperture Science complex was originally built in a salt mine bought by the local entrepreneur Johnson himself, making it funny thus his name being named it.\n - Wheatley: In the end you walk out the door to a massive wheat field, where I immediately thought of Wheatley as a reference. Pretty fun as well because in the end of the game, the loading logo changes from aperture laboratories to \"Wheatley Laboratories\".\n\nYeah so an unusually long review but i just had a lot to say about the game, that's all. Portal is a very classic series and I felt i had to play it at some point, so i just finished the sequel today and if you're considering purchasing it, it's definitely worth the story and gameplay.","timestamp_created":1599605123,"timestamp_updated":1599605288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75670248","author":{"steamid":"76561198848791855","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":687,"last_played":1625143450},"language":"turkish","review":"Kesinlikle oynanması gerekilen bir oyun.

Portal 2 never stops to surprise and amuse -- it has plenty of interesting twists and the trademark humor is still there. I can barely recall the puzzles from the original but it somehow feels the difficulty level was lowered a bit, perhaps not to discourage the newcomers. I only played through the single player campaign (no online friends to try the co-op, unfortunately) but I can sure recommend this game to pretty much anyone who likes brain teasers, casual players included.

The best way to describe it is by comparing it to a movie, a long 10h movie with rather complicated puzzles at times. The worst thing with this game is that it's so good, let me explain, basically at some point the game becomes very dark and scary but it relays that feeling so well that I hated that part because of how bad the vibe was.

Depois de jogar alguns jogos priorizados, resolvi dar uma chance e iniciar o jogo. No início da gameplay eu achei meio entediante pois era muito diálogo e eu fico meio norteado com muita informação pra ler, mas ao longo do tempo você vai se conectando mais com os personagens e começa á ficar mais agradável ouvir oque eles tem a dizer (até porque muitas das falas são muito criativas e até me fizeram dar umas risadinhas de vez em quando). Logo no início a gente conhece o robozinho Wheatley e ele começa a nossa jornada dentro do laboratório Aperture em ruínas. Não vou entrar nos detalhes da história aqui pois acredito que isso seja algo que deve ser aprofundado durante a gameplay de cada um.\n\nQuando você adquire a tão aclamada Portal Gun, os puzzles são simples envolvendo apenas jogar um portal ali, outro aqui, passar por dentro e ir para outra fase; usar a gravidade para se lançar pra outra fase; mover cubos para placas de pressão e liberar a passagem pra outra fase; puzzles bem simples que ao longo do jogo vão sendo incrementados com outros dispositivos que ajudam a criar fases mais difíceis e criativas como lasers, torretas, tubos, gels e outras funcionalidades que podem ser usadas individualmente ou combinados para se criarem os mais diversos puzzles durante o jogo, que é dividido em nove capítulos separados por alguns clímax da história.\n\nOutra coisa que Portal 2 me proporcionou foi o sentimento muito bom de ser um gênio dos puzzles. Sério, a cada puzzle que você passa parece que o QI aumenta 5% e da uma sensação de alívio esperteza que eu nunca tinha sentido antes. Recomendo muito pra ACHA que não é bom em nada, pois com um pouquinho de pensamento esse jogo vai te fazer sentir o contrário, pois convenhamos, você sabe que não é verdade. Jogue Portal 2, é uma experiência incrível. Gameplay divertidíssima, história com vários plots, final simplesmente foda e pode te render algumas horas adicionais com as fases criadas pela comunidade.\n\nNota 10/10","timestamp_created":1599568093,"timestamp_updated":1599568093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75644246","author":{"steamid":"76561198962943866","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":729,"last_played":1607623757},"language":"norwegian","review":"amazing game!!!","timestamp_created":1599567871,"timestamp_updated":1599567871,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75642870","author":{"steamid":"76561198106119351","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1155,"last_played":1599563928},"language":"schinese","review":"超棒的游戏，玩了之后发现自己晕3D，每次玩完脑壳疼，但还是坚持通关了，至于成就我就不强求了……解密和剧情都很赞，单人流程的解密不是特别难，主要就看能不能转过那个弯儿，眼神儿够不够好（重点！）。可惜最后不能带着小圆球走，我对这个小笨蛋还挺有好感的，虽然是个不孝子。双人谜题感觉难度更大一点，和朋友耗尽脑细胞终于通了。最后给声甜腹黑又毒舌的小姐姐（别问，问就是记不住英文名）点赞！","timestamp_created":1599565628,"timestamp_updated":1599565628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75642812","author":{"steamid":"76561199068483982","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":477,"last_played":1621168241},"language":"russian","review":".\n","timestamp_created":1599565516,"timestamp_updated":1599565516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75641880","author":{"steamid":"76561198945589048","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1430,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":874,"last_played":1610647497},"language":"english","review":"Very Very Very Very good game.","timestamp_created":1599563774,"timestamp_updated":1599563774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75641337","author":{"steamid":"76561199087288109","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":148,"playtime_at_review":640,"last_played":1660475317},"language":"russian","review":"Это просто идеальная игра.
