Using 2 kind of portals named \"Blue\" and \"Orange\" portals.\n\nThis game is great it brings the game to a whole new level partly because the concept of puzzle game has been scrambled up with a shooter to make it look so confusing it's awesome.\n\n\n\nPuzzle games used to be pushing buttons and activating or interacting with objects. Portal 2 tries it's best to maintain this elements gamers still love but with a twist. Old puzzles usually require pushing objects or standing on them. Portal uses a \"Portal Gun\" to shoot out portals so you can jump into the blue and coming out of the orange.\n\n\n\nThe nonsense you get from playing Multiplayer is insanely fun. The things you guys can do may not be as straight forward as you think it would be. Preferable playing it with a friend that is willing to create mischief because as the objective maybe getting an object to stand on a platform. You could sabotage your friend and confusing him which makes it so intriguing to do it.","timestamp_created":1392047184,"timestamp_updated":1392047184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9043893","author":{"steamid":"76561198098521356","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":305,"last_played":1517334344},"language":"schinese","review":"考验大脑的游戏~","timestamp_created":1392043985,"timestamp_updated":1392043985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9042828","author":{"steamid":"76561198125029925","num_games_owned":545,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":4949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1652119562},"language":"english","review":"i had one question.....\n\nwhere can you get the code for the game, but you;ve downloaded the game from your PSN? becuase it keeps saying you have to have the box to redeemthe code.\n","timestamp_created":1392036098,"timestamp_updated":1392036098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9042596","author":{"steamid":"76561197988558353","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":2209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":769,"last_played":1433435810},"language":"koreana","review":"정품사라고 하고싶지만...\n\n이건 너무재미있어요!\n\n복돌이 라도 한번쯤 꼭해보는걸 추천합니다","timestamp_created":1392034043,"timestamp_updated":1392034043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9042109","author":{"steamid":"76561198035758987","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3744,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2320,"last_played":1479951034},"language":"english","review":"HALF-LIFE / PORTAL 3 PLEASE!!","timestamp_created":1392029296,"timestamp_updated":1392029296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2KzajcQCfYu/Ig=="}
