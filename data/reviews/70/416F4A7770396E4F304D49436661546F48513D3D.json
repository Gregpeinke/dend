You play as Gordon Freeman, a mute scientist, majored in Theoretical Physics. You start off entering the Black Mesa facility for an experiment, which, naturally, goes horribly wrong, afterwards, Gordon finds himself trapped in the facility, surrounded by bizarre creatures you would NOT find on our planet. Your goal is to escape from the facility while combatting the many creatures that have invaded, as well as some marines, who have been given orders to kill the scientists to cover up the incident. The majority of the challenge in the game comes from utilizing your resources, because unlike other games there are no areas where you can heal and reload, instead you'll find various ammunition located across the game, but none of it is durable, and the only weapons in the game that don't use ammo are the melee crowbar, and this hornet firing weapon you get rather late in the game. The only places you can heal up infinitely are these small pools that only begin to show up VERY late in the game. So basically you have to find out how to dispatch various enemies while utilizing as few resources as possible. This is a very nice challenge, but sometimes it just comes down to you saving before attempting something, and simply experimenting to see how little of your resources you can expend. The game was significantly longer than I had expected, and is very challenging, I got this game when it was on sale for 75% off, for 2.25$, I ended up getting the Half-Life pack for 75% off, for an overall 10$, since you can get the whole package for the same price as you can get this game alone when it's on sale, I'd recommend waiting for it to go on sale, overall I'm glad I got this game, and I do recommend it.","timestamp_created":1386554698,"timestamp_updated":1401911494,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7977508","author":{"steamid":"76561198057685159","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":810,"last_played":1385864502},"language":"english","review":"If you're an atheist who loves science, a communist who hates our armed forces, or a vagrant who likes dinosaurs shooting electricity out of their eyes, then this game is for you.
