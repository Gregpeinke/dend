You can shot a blue portal and an orange portal and when both exist they are connected and work as a tunnel. You have to escape test chambers by taking advantage of this portal device. The game works the same as the original Portal but with a new engine that gives better graphics, a more elaborate story and extra mechanics and devices. If you liked the original Portal you will probably like this game too.\n\n+ Excellent graphics\n+ Excellent voice cast\n+ New mechanics\n+ Good story\n+ Cooperative play\n- The first robot can get annoying at first but it does get better overtime\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\n\nYou start off with a cinematic story were your room is being destroyed and you are helped by a robot. This robot will accompany you through the game and to be honest I found him very annoying at first but he does get funnier later so give him a chance. Your objective is to get freedom from the test chambers using the portal device.\n\nThe game is the same as the original game but with better graphics and new devices. At first it's more of the same with cubes and buttons but as the game goes on you will find [spoiler]lasers, springs, light bridge, transportation funnel, gel with special properties and so on[/spoiler]. It does make the game much more interesting. I did find the puzzles somewhat easier than the original but the new mechanics compensated.\n\nThe story is split into three parts. You will know more more about the background story in the second part, which I found to be the most interesting part of the game with the best puzzles. The game does have a very interesting story although I found it to be a little more artificial than the first game and sometimes unnecessarily cinematic, but just a little.\n\nThe voice cast is excellent and truly adds quality to the game. There are three noteworthy characters in this game: Wheatley, GlaDOS and Cave Johnson. There are other important characters but you will definitely know about these in Portal 2. Wheatly is kind of annoying but he does get a lot funnier overtime and you will understand why he is like that. GlaDOS is really angry and has an excellent script and interpretation and she is my favorite. You will find Cave Johnson later and you'll know why he's a nice addition to the game.\n\nAfter you beat the game you can play community made maps. It's a nice addition and somewhat similar to the advanced maps of Portal. You can also create your own maps. This adds to replayability especially since you can play with a friend cooperatively.\n\nIf you liked the original Portal you will definitely like this game as well. If not it's a very interesting puzzle game but I recommend you play the original game first.","timestamp_created":1507378206,"timestamp_updated":1507378237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw08Kv+94CdN3KhwE="}
