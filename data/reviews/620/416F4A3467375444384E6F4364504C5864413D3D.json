So much new stuff and new mechanics have been added, such as the 3 gels which are just extremely fun to screw around with and to find out how they all combine together, the tractor beams which are so satisfying to go in once you're getting closer to completing the puzzles, the lasers, the faith plates and light bridges. I won't go into too much detail on these new features, you can see for yourself. Glados is expanded upon so much more in this game, even becoming more human and more understanding of Chell along the way. In addition, there are two brand new main characters, Wheatley and Cave Johnson, who both share hilarious lines of dialogue. Overall, the singleplayer campaign is incredibly well fleshed out and just fun to stay along on the ride for.\n\nThen there's co-op, which is an entirely different story. I guarantee this will be some of the most fun and most hatred you'll experience with any friend, perhaps even moreso than Mario Party. The stages are once again intricately designed satisfying-to-complete headscratchers, utilising the different elements introduced in the main story, but this time you and your friend are dependent on eachother in order to get through every level, be it you need to stand on the button in order to activate the tractor beam for your friend to get across, or you're being directed by your mate through his light bridge placements. Either it all flows perfectly or it's a complete clusterfrick and you're both trying your hardest to try and screw eachother over at any opportunity available. And unless you're both robots (which you are ingame but w/e), you're guaranteed the latter will be what happens. The constant switching between which player has ultimate power in each section and the perilous tasks you complete with them via pure trust makes the co-op in Portal 2 not only give you one hell of a powertrip when you're the one in control, but also puts you extremely on-edge whenever your friend is in control. It ends up being one of the most fun experiences you could ever have on a multiplayer game, and I thoroughly recommend at least trying it with one of your friends.\n\nThere's also a level creator for you to create your own puzzles and upload them onto the workshop, with tons of custom puzzles on the workshop for you to have a go at, most of them using an extended level editor tool called BEEMod allowing for music options, level themes, more items to choose from and probably more stuff that I'm forgetting. The creator is already very versatile as it is, and BEEMod just takes it to a whole other level. Lastly there's the robot enrichment store, with cosmetics, skins and taunts for you to use with P-Body or Atlas in co-op mode. Although the items aren't really as economically deep as, say, TF2 or CSGO items, as there's no community market and the only way to buy them is off the enrichment store for their base prices, they're still fun little bonuses for you to have and use on your co-op robots.\n\nOverall, this is definitely a worthwhile puzzle game, and is worth way more than the £7.19 Valve are offering it for. Buy this whenever you can and get your friends to as well.","timestamp_created":1490132616,"timestamp_updated":1600464513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30658875","author":{"steamid":"76561198299748997","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1014,"last_played":1510694485},"language":"english","review":"This game was good, but unfortunatly short, maybe it's just maybe thinking that but I don't know.

Why? Because portal 2 co-op with friends is a lot of fun, assuming your friends don't get irritated easily. The story mode is an excellent follow up too. A great sequel. Very impressed. \n\nSometimes the co-op is frusterating, especially the gel levels, because things just suddenly work and you don't really know why. The game itself is a lot of fun and a great follow up to Portal 1. Then after that you can do co-op with your friends. Or you can do it with someone random which can be funny. Or give you a migraine. Story mode is pretty amazing and I was happy that even now after having this game for so long I STILL like to randomly do co-op with friends who haven't had a chance to do it yet, because it's fun. The story mode has a HUGE area for exploration as you get closer to the end, and you get a lot more backstory to what actually happened in Portal 1, giving the game a bit of depth. \n\nAlso it's so much funnier than the first one. You got Gladus who *spoiler alert* is your potato buddy *end spoiler* then you have a fun robot friend with an aussie accent chatting with you. And some maps are huge. Some gels do some crazy stuff. Sometimes you beat a map and you have no idea how you did it, you just accidentally bounced around a lot and ended up at the end. I really like this game. Big fan.

Зато какой! Отточив перья и логику на первой части, Valve выпустила образцовый сиквел, к которому почти не придраться. Локации масштабнее и разнообразнее, графика — техничнее, повествование — глубже. Основа основ — по-прежнему пушка, создающая два взаимосвязанных портала, правда, механика стала гораздо сложнее.\n\nРаньше мы просто дырявили поверхности, дабы миновать зону обстрела или притащить ящик в нужную точку. Теперь в уравнение добавлена целая охапка параметров. Лазерные лучи и кубические линзы, их преломляющие. Световые мостики для перемещения по воздуху или, если поставить их «ребром», защиты от охранных турелей. Пластина, подбрасывающая объекты. Гравитационные тоннели, которые подхватывают и медленно уносят все, что в них попадает. Три типа гелевой краски: синяя усиливает прыжок, оранжевая здорово ускоряет разбег, белая делает любую плоскость пригодной для открытия портала. (В раннем прототипе был четвертый оттенок, позволявший ходить по стенам и потолкам; его списали в утиль, когда тестеров начало подташнивать.)\n\nИзменений — куча, только Valve не спешит вываливать их разом. Из главы в главу дизайнеры потихоньку переписывают правила, приучая мыслить новыми категориями. Уровни рассчитаны идеально: в меру хитрые, чтобы бросить вызов и растормошить серые клеточки, но без уклона в садизм. В худшем случае вы потратите 15-20 минут на поиски решения, стукнете кулаком о стол и почувствуете себя дураком — ибо ответ лежал перед глазами. В лучшем — порадуетесь, как быстро вы разгрызли еще один кусочек гранита. Portal 2 вообще благосклонна — для каждого многоходового пазла предусмотрены невидимые «чекпойнты»; если допустите фатальную ошибку в миллиметре от победы, вам не придется повторять все с нуля.","timestamp_created":1489948546,"timestamp_updated":1527659328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30621621","author":{"steamid":"76561198166182642","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":5502,"last_played":1660487305},"language":"german","review":"Egal wie alt dieses Spiel noch wird, Ich kann es JEDEM empfehlen.

Honestly this game is really great even just to just figure out the puzzles but that's not what makes it great, It's the bigger picture that makes this game good. It has a lot of character to it that makes it so you won't forget about it as soon as you've completed the game. Not easy but also not particularly hard puzzles. I won't lie sometimes the puzzles had me stuck, but for the most part they're not that hard. That's not really a terrible thing, since you don't want to spend an hour on the same level, trying all sorts of possibilities to no avail. It's just supposed to be a fun casual game so if you want really hard levels, you'll probably have to look on the workshop where sky is the limit, so there really is a market for everyone. Some really well thought-out puzzles on there which can easily compete and even surpass Valve made puzzles\n\nI say it's better than the first Portal because all-round it is. There's more story to it, way more actual content, more characters/character development, co-op and custom puzzles/maps. Portal 2 actually feels like a triple A game. Not only that, but because of the custom maps, you can get way, way more hours in this game than me since there really is an endless supply of creative puzzles on the workshop.\nCo-op is double the fun, as you know every game is better with friends. Shorter than the solo campaign but it's still good all-round and provides a decent challenge - co-op also has workshop support so you're not done after completing the co-op campaign. It's a Source game so it should run well for 99% of people. Just gotta wait for Portal [spoiler]3[/spoiler].

Eu, como teorista de Portal, adoro refazer o jogo inteiro (coop e sp) e tentar achar easter eggs.
