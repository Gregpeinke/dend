But Play this today or soon, it is truly a special game.}\n\nWritten as a cynical edgelord in 2018\n     While I still enjoy the game, its flaws have become more apparent to me. Some things in this game boil down to \"Ooh look at me, I have a physics engine, look at me place a brick on this teeter-totter, yay puzzle complete\", which really wears out; and quickly too. It was my first modern fps, so I adored it, but I have seen modernism done so much better in other games. The story is great, dark, mysterious, but not without hope. The enemies are pretty cookie cutter, which is a shame because the first game had loads of interest poured into the monsters. The combine AI are laughably easy, and kind of boring to fight after awhile. Game can really shine now and then, feeling pretty epic. Long treks by vehicle were fun at first but break up the gameplay. Still great, and Is fun first play through. Graphically, looks great for 2004, but not as good looking as DOOM 3 in some aspects. Recomend you play the first game, well, first. First game is my favorite, only have 3 or so hours at time of writing on steam, but have hundreds on retail cd or ps2 re-release.

Normally as a rule of thumb a successor title in a series never quite touches the audience the way the first did; no matter how good it is. This is one of the rare exceptions where the successor title is possibly even better than the first which was truly remarkable.\n\nReleased in 2004, this game still has graphics that made my relatively new computer bought in 2009 struggle on full graphics settings under certain shadow conditions. The level of detail in the world is incredible, and one thing this game has that lacks in almost every title in existance out there right now is the atmosphere it creates. Something about the game really draws you into the world, it's completely enveloping and makes you really feel like you're walking through the streets... it's a sensation that cannot be described, one must play the game in order to appreciate the level of intricacy that sets this game apart from the rest. I have yet to even complete this game, and I fear the day that I do, because I don't want this franchise to end!! Truly a masterpiece.\n\nAlthough I have many long-standing favourite titles, such as Gran Turismo 1, MediEvil, etc. I feel compelled to say that this game genuinely possibly tops all other games that I have played. It is simply magnificant. I would reccomend the Half-Life series to not only to gamers, but to anyone who appreciates a spectacular story. This is truly art.","timestamp_created":1397847609,"timestamp_updated":1397847609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9862638","author":{"steamid":"76561198068916943","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":450,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":351,"last_played":1428677124},"language":"english","review":"Super nice game, a nice campaign and some nice MODS for it...","timestamp_created":1397842967,"timestamp_updated":1397842967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9862299","author":{"steamid":"76561198095943710","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":2876,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":494,"last_played":1629027011},"language":"thai","review":"เนื้อเรื่องดี กราฟฟิกภาพไม่กินสเเปคคอมมากเกินไป รูปเเบบการเล่นเรียบง่าย ราคาถูก ใครทีมองหาเกมดีๆเเบบนี้อยุ่เเนะนำเลยครับ","timestamp_created":1397840325,"timestamp_updated":1397840325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9861970","author":{"steamid":"76561198065709404","num_games_owned":362,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":943,"last_played":1537180192},"language":"english","review":"Simply a revolution in PC gaming and still nice, entertaining, playable and worth buying game!","timestamp_created":1397837988,"timestamp_updated":1397894718,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9861656","author":{"steamid":"76561198019437892","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1329,"last_played":1656204184},"language":"english","review":"Quite an engaging storyline,  great graphics,  nothing is extremely overpowered,  in short its an extremely high qaulity game by Valve.

The world is deep, and engaging. The controls, I didn't even realize I was hitting the right buttons because they are so natural it is amazing. When I got stuck, I just explored a bit and it felt like I really was improvising a solution, and not like I was preforming a task designed by a developer. The immersion is amazing in that respect. It doesn't just feel like a game, it feels like world. Creating a world even more real than many major RPGs such as Elder Scrolls (a series I love to no end) and as a result it make everything else all the more enjoyable.\n\nEven though Gordon Freeman never says a word, he feels real in a way I can't really explain. It might be because everyone reacts to you so realistically, not to mention no one seems to do anything that gives away the fact they are in a game, characters seems to genuinly fear death, and no one seems to have any information they can't explain in a acceptable, and reasonable manner.\n\nNext I have to say this game makes full use of newer graphic technologies, making it look amazing even with the lowest graphic settings I was forced to use with my less than amazing laptop I had a better visual experience than any of these fancy new games on console. It is amazing what we can do with graphics these days... Oh wait... this game is 9 and a half years years old as of the writing of this guide. Well then, that makes me wonder why everyother game has such terrible graphics. Step up your game Call of Duty, not only is Half-Life 2 a better shooter, with a deeper storyline, it also makes you look horrible visually. Yes, on the lowest settings this game has graphics that I find more impressive than the latest generation of consoles have had to show. It also runs amazingly well compared to games with worst graphics. I got about an average of 50fps, while Skyrim, I am lucky to hit a stable 30fps. So for preformace, this game sets the standard that should be considered minium.\n\nNow to look at some other aspects of this game:\n\n* The controller support is good for those who prefer it. However the keyboard and mouse controllers are good even for people who are more used to controllers.\n* Animation is beautiful, Valve managed to make motion and behavior look and feel natural.\n* AI is brillant. Enemies don't just charge at you, they coordinate, and will attack at your week points, and when fighting with a group of allies the enemy will focus on the most explosed members of your squad. They will hold their ground so you can't approach, then strike when you switch to a weapon that offers less range, while also keeping you at a distance.\n* Difficulty is more than just damage and health, as you play on harder difficulties, the AI improves. It makes the game harder, rather than just grindier.\n\nAll in all, 10/10\n\nDate: 15/04/2014","timestamp_created":1397612076,"timestamp_updated":1397612076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9828158","author":{"steamid":"76561197970089138","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":357,"last_played":1397758434},"language":"english","review":"No other game like it.

From what I've played this game supports only one playstyle. If you're not running around constantly dodging bullets and getting up in peoples' faces (aliens, whatever), you're DEAD. I appreciate the lack of regenerating health, though. Half-Life 2 features some of the most annoying enemies ever. They have no personality whatsoever (unlike Wheatley from Portal 2 or the enemies in Halo). Game options could have a \"very low to ultra\" option to save time. There is little variety in the 3 hours I've played.\n\nThe story is all right. I'm neither utterly bored by it or blown away. Aliens, resistance, the usual.\n\nPuzzles are all right. Navigation, though, is another story. In the beginning of the game, there is a canal you have to walk through. The way to continue is on the SIDE of a box, and the game doesn't give a hint where you're supposed to go. Batman gave subtle hints to the player through his inner thoughts in the Arkham games. Gordon Freeman didn't have to speak, but seriously, the exploration system definitely detracted from the experience.\n\nGun variety is HORRIBLE. You have to play with the same gun until you reach a certain point in which you can pick up a new gun. Rinse and repeat. Now, I know the generic alien army Combines are supposed to carry the same weapons, but couldn't the resistance give/modify cool weapons like in any good resistance story?\n\nConclusion: If you are willing to run around like Duke Nukem most of the game guns blazing, then spend your money on this. If you are willing to do puzzles, spend your money on this. If you are willing to wait a couple of levels to get a new gun, spend your money on this. I can barely recommend this game, because the playstyle it forced me to use made me more alert and fast.

Come trama è veramente spettacolare e più si andrà avanti più sarà intrigante. Inoltre questo gioco ha ispirato moltissimi altri videogiochi anche di stili differenti. Infatti Half Life contiene moltissimi generi: Horror, Comici, Azione e Zombie.\nIo lo dico così sicuro anche perchè ho giocato Episodio 1 e 2. Se avete già giocato ad Half Life 2 è praticamente obbligatorio prenderlo, così almeno concluderete la trama del 2. Se non volete prenderli a prezzo intero i 2 episodi aggiuntivi, aspettate i saldi e li metteranno a circa 1,99.\n[b]La Grafica[/b]\nLa grafica è meravigliosa per essere un gioco del 2004. Questo comunque non vuol dire nulla visto che la grafica è meravigliosa ancora oggi. E' tutto bello e realizzato nei minimi dettagli, soprattutto i volti hanno un espressività e una realtà pazzesca. Questo comunque è uno dei cavalli di battaglia di Valve e del suo source. In altri giochi di Valve le espressioni sono straordinarie (es: Left 4 Dead e TF2).\n[b]L'ambientazione[/b]\nL'ambientazione è veramente bellissima. Si passerà dalla città, alle fogne, alla spiaggia, ai boschi e tante altre.
