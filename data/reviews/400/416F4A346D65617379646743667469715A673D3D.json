It's hard to know what to add to the thousands of existing reviews that have already been written about it. Perhaps this: \n\nIf, like me, you bought a collection of Valve games because you wanted to play Half Life, you may have Portal sitting in your library, but no clear idea of what it is. PLAY IT. Yes, it' s a 'first-person' 'puzzle' game, but those tags don't do it justice. It's worth your time for the humour and backstory, which are great fun and the source of many a gaming meme. And I think it has one of the best implemented, best calibrated, and best integrated (to the point it's almost imperceptible) tutorials in the history of computer games. Not so much a learning curve, as a learning waterslide of delight.\n\nIf you have the sort of brain that can grasp each of the puzzle mechanics as they're introduced, then the few hours you spend finishing Portal will leave you with the sort of self-satisfied contentment you get from watching a great sci-fi mystery movie and guessing the twist. If you can't get your head around it, that's a crying shame, becuase this wsa a groundbreaking, revolutionary game in its time and is, I think, still one of the great games of all time.","timestamp_created":1479933413,"timestamp_updated":1479933413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26865096","author":{"steamid":"76561197968158139","num_games_owned":332,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":31,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Still one of the best puzzle games around.","timestamp_created":1479933317,"timestamp_updated":1479933317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26863569","author":{"steamid":"76561198334195322","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":687,"last_played":1657327616},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego esta genial lo recomiendo mucho","timestamp_created":1479933172,"timestamp_updated":1479933172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26863521","author":{"steamid":"76561197987368141","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1009,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"This game is one of the most well constructed physics based puzzlers you will find.
