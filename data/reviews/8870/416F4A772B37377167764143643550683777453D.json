Na verdade não existe relação até os últimos minotos de campanha, onde Elizabeth abre uma fenda para Rapture explicando que era um dos mundos que ela tem acesso. Ainda assim, no início do jogo uma voz feminina diz que a criação de Columbia foi após a queda de \"sodoma\" no fundo do mar... Achei um tanto quanto complexa a história desta versão.\nPelo game se passar anos antes do primeiro título, há bastante sentido em terem tirado alguns benefícios de jogabilidade, mas achei bem complicado no início, levando em consideração que já havia me acostumado no 1 e 2 da franquia (Não há armazenagem de kits médicos ou poção de \"magias\" - Não há munições diferentes para cada arma - Só é possível carregar 2 armas por vez - Apenas 2 vigores por vez, ainda que possa ser trocado durante o jogo - Entre outras mudanças drásticas).\nA jogabilidade é muito boa e qualidade de imagem, mesmo na configuração mínima, excepcional. A dificuldade é muito menor em relação aos demais títulos, os momentos de ação s~so bem raros, mas muitos deles emocionantes. Contudo, eu gostei bastante de jogá-lo e recomendo. Tanto que irei jogar novamente, porém no modo 1999.","timestamp_created":1580863983,"timestamp_updated":1580863983,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523636341094970703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62983977","author":{"steamid":"76561198102213470","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":908,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":798,"last_played":1580913010},"language":"english","review":"A beautiful game with a great story.","timestamp_created":1580861150,"timestamp_updated":1580861150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62983582","author":{"steamid":"76561198354353569","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":259,"last_played":1581387300},"language":"english","review":"Thousands doors to nowhere....\nBioshock is more than a shooter game.

I was convinced for most of the game that this was essentially a reboot, and I had done absolutely no research on the series to back up that theory, though I did notice some parallels between the first two games and Infinite such as the whole imprinting of the Songbird to Elizabeth and the Little Sisters with Big Daddies, Vigors to Plasmids, Eve to Salts, though at first I dismissed them as concepts that worked for the foundation of a Bioshock title that would work under my reboot theory, just reused under different names. It wasn't until I got to the end of the main game and dove into the DLCs that I finally realised that it in fact is NOT a reboot but a prequel. Its not an overly complicated state of affairs if you pay close attention to whats going on, but if you're just rushing through it to shoot shit and blow shit up with powers then you might get lost.\n\nNow I might get lynched by a few of the more die hard Bioshock fans for saying this but I really did enjoy Infinite more than 1 and 2 overall, despite it missing a lot of elements from the first two titles such as hacking, crafting and the ability to pull 50 different guns out your ass while juggling 50 different Plasmids. I found enjoyment in the slightly more simplified mechanics, the story was more engaging, I only really had interest in two of the guns (Sniper and Shotgun) so I was fine with only been able to hold two at a time from the moment I obtained them to the end of the game, Elizabeth opened locked doors for me and all I had to do was find the lockpicks by exploring, the world itself piqued my interest more than Rapture, the constant interactions between Booker and Elizabeth were great at breaking long bouts of silence you might find in a lot of FPP games where you usually play a silent protagonist...made it all feel 'real' and 'human', it gave everything I did meaning, otherwise I just feel like this robot who's doing everything everyone else tells me to do.\n\nMust have taken well over 100 photos during my time playing through the main game and the DLCs, its quite a gorgeous game with some very interesting concepts and design ideas for the environments, weapons, enemies, etc, it all brought the world to life and made for a very engaging experience both in and out of combat situations. I really took my time just looking around instead of bulldozing from one objective to the next, just trying to get as much as I could possibly get done in one playthrough.\n\nFully recommend to anyone new to the series or anyone who has played 1 and 2 but have yet to play Infinite. The DLCs explains a lot about what happened before the events of the first two titles so those who like a good story or want to witness events in order, play Infinite first before the first two games. A new Bioshock is officially in the works now too, though they say it'll be in development for several years, I'm gonna be looking forward to playing it when it arrives!","timestamp_created":1580843627,"timestamp_updated":1580843627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62969127","author":{"steamid":"76561198260512047","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":750,"last_played":1580826147},"language":"english","review":"I just finished this game.

While it managed to maintain an excellent atmosphere, the graphics and environment were absolutely stunning, I have multiple complaints about the gameplay.\n\nFor starters, the Shield mechanic just felt out of place for the setting, This isn't DOOM or Halo so having an energy shield in addition to the standard health bar. I also have problems with the gunplay. Since when did we have to look down sights in a bioshock game? In addition, unlike the previous two games you'll find many of your weapons outclassed, after the first few levels the pistol and sky-hook were way under-classed, which was disappointing to me because I got through most of the first two games using plasmids and the wrench/drill. \n\nThere's also the problem of being unable to carry first aid kits and salt phials with you like you could with the Kits and EVE hypos. This lead to far more cautious shooting than I did in the last games, only exacerbated by the fact that you can only carry two guns at a time as opposed to the ability to carry all of your weapons with you. Whether this was a stylistic choice I don't know, all I know is that it made some parts of the game and getting some achievements annoying.\n\nI'm also not sure the whole multiple reality thing really fits in with this universe, or perhaps multiverse in this case. Was it interesting? yes and some of the ways it was incorporated into the gameplay were very well done, but it still doesn't feel right for this series, at least to me. I feel like the whole multiple universe thing has become a bit tropey with how often it's  used these days.\n\nIn addition, the enemy variety was somewhat disappointing as well, instead of a variety of splicers used in Rapture all throughout the first two games, the games enemies rarely get past \"another guy with a gun\" whether it's the police, soldiers or motorized patriots, they all felt very similar, as opposed to the variety you saw in Rapture with Spider and Houdini Splicers, All of the Big Daddies, Big Sisters, Brutes and what have you, all of which have a different attack pattern and way of defeating them whereas the enemies in infinite seem to use the same tactics for the most part, but occasionally having a different gun.\n\nNow Let's get to some of the things I did like. For starters, I liked how the game made it a point not to feel like one long escort mission after you rescue Elizabeth from the tower. She gives you items and you don't have to spend your entire time protecting her (the game even makes it a point to tell you this), it makes her feel more like your partner in this adventure as opposed to just being a load your entire way. You actually feel it in levels when she isn't with you because the game because significantly more difficult when she's not around, demonstrating to you just how much you've been relying on her over the course of the game.\n\nIn addition, I enjoyed several of the characters I encountered such as Elisabeth, the Luteces and most of the characters whose audio logs are scattered throughout the game. They were fairly well developed with understandable motivations rather than feeling like their entire existence in the plot was to make a point.\n\nalso, as said earlier, they did a good job making the flying city of Columbia feel like an inhabited city as opposed to the the lonely, slowly collapsing rapture, and there is some reflection of that, where Rapture was made of cramped enclosed spaces that hammered in that you were deep under the sea, Columbia has wide open level design appropriate for the flying city. \n\nThe abilities you get from the plasmids, sorry \"vigors\" are genuinely interesting and unique rather than just being a repeat of the same abilties you could purchase in the first two games, if anything I was only disappointed by how little the selection was. My favorites were the Murder of Crows and Undertow vigors (because  sending a bunch of crows after your enemies is way cooler than reenacting the whole \"NOT THE BEES!\" meme). I like how each new vigor you got had a transformation sequence that was reminiscent of when you grabbed your first plasmid in the previous games, though some of them were a bit graphic and made me feel sympathy pain.\n\nOverall I'd give Bioshock infinite a 7 out of 10, because in spite of it's flaws it's still enjoyable, I was just disappointed when comparing it to the previous games.","timestamp_created":1580772571,"timestamp_updated":1581880531,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568989694118499756","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62933974","author":{"steamid":"76561197962588375","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1500,"last_played":1580771968},"language":"german","review":"Ein Meisterwerk! \n\nWie von Bioshock gewohnt von Anfang an gut.

Now that I actually understood what was beeing said I can safely say this will forever be in my top 5 games.\n(excuse the typos and that stuff. i just cant be bothered to make something super professional on a fucking steam review)\nThe combat:\nIf you're looking for an FPS with a cool ''magic'' system then buy it. The guns are really fun to use, and it only gets enhanced by the vigors. Vigors are sort of magical abilities that you unlock through the course of the game. They all serve a different purpose in combat although some felt less creative or fun to use but that never really bothered me. Although you kinda have to mix things up often so you dont always use the OP once.\nGuns are ''the same'' as vigors in a sense that they all are very much different with pros and cons to each. The game is also very welcome to embrace different playstyles with the mixing of vigors and guns. Honestly the combination of guns and vigors feel endless and that kept the combat from getting boring every single hour of a total of fifteen.\n10/10\n\nThe Story:\nthe story is both confusing and very easy to follow. But it doesn't get confusing until the end, but the end only brought me more questions about the world of bioshock than answers which most of the time is a bad thing. But here I loved that the game had me lay the final puzzle pieces for how the story really ended, and the game clearly wants you to think. \nSadly this game has a voiced character... BUT in this game it works PERFECTLY. The journey that Booker and Elizabeth go on is both engaging and action-packed fun which always left me wanting to learn more about them. Although I couldnt care less for some of the characters and the world of infinite. Overall it was a very interesting story with characters that left me quite litteraly dreaming of them but some(tbh most) left me extremely dull.\n8/10\n\nThe Graphics:\nHonestly I couldnt give a fuck about how the game looked I would enjoy it just the same. But you probably do and lucky for you the game looks amazing. With a good PC you can play most of the game on high settings. on a budget you can make Normal work but that depends on how old/well kept it is. But the best part is that even if you're playing on a AAA battery powered potato you can play this game on low settings. which makes this a perfect budget game for budget gamers with its truly amazing Combat and Story to complement the graphics. But the facial animations for normal npc can get a bit uncanny which did break my immersion the smallest bit if even at all.\n9/10\n\nOverall: 9/10\nThis game kept me on my toes for 15 hours straight and theres even more to do with a even harder difficulty mode and dlc left for me to play. I've fallen in love with this game and I think you will too.
