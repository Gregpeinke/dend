This game blows my expectations away every time I play it. Unlike other games, you can be walking along a plank only for it to break, or you just fall off, and you have to find another way up. This game is so flexible. With the realistic physics, it makes the game far more immersive than most modern aaa games. The puzzles are very subtle most of the time, unlike most other puzzle games where you can tell it's a room with a puzzle to solve to get out. In this game, the puzzles are more tactile, like \"How to I get up to there? I'll stack boxes\" \"How do I get to that ramp? Blow open this tunnel with the explosive barrel.\" This game has no cutscenes, too, so your first person immersion is never broken. The only thing that I would like them to fix would be the loading times. I have an ssd, but the game still stops at certain points to load more of the environment.","timestamp_created":1594862314,"timestamp_updated":1594862314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72761079","author":{"steamid":"76561198843831064","num_games_owned":648,"num_reviews":142,"playtime_forever":914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":914,"last_played":1547935758},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego mítico de la plataforma y que a mi opinión es una compra más que obligada en el mundo del gaming. \nUn gran salto evolutivo que trajo grandes mecánicas como la arma de gravedad, motores de físicas y grandes mapas.

I just started replaying it and although I have fond memories of the game, all the problems really stand out the second time around. Its fun at times but really boring, confusing and stupidly easy at times. This is because of some annoying but very straight forward puzzles and completely brain dead AI, but if you can look past that, there are some very fun parts of this game that make it worth playing. Just wait until you get the gravity gun. The story is the real reason to play this game. It has a story like no other I've ever seen in a video game. With the annoying fact that the cut scenes are unskippable, the characters are gar deeper and more interesting than they were in the original half life, in which they were basically just fodder. Overall, still good, but with a lot of dumb mistakes.","timestamp_created":1594847133,"timestamp_updated":1623161890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72752635","author":{"steamid":"76561198075959379","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":8533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":144,"last_played":1608897928},"language":"english","review":"Cmon, it's Half life.

Give me an open world sandbox game like the much maligned Fallout 76 any day of the week over this so called gem.\n\nFor those of you who happen to like these type of games, the game still looks pretty good. The puzzles are challenging without being too difficult. As for the negatives, there don't seem to be any sort of RPG elements. The world is one long tunnel with no sort of exploration whatsoever. If there is a great story, I never got far enough down the endless canals to find it. \n\nIf you are a die-hard shooter fan, buy and try just to experience one of the turning points of the genre.","timestamp_created":1594792440,"timestamp_updated":1594792440,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.421618938446044922","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72715340","author":{"steamid":"76561198341646619","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1019,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":244,"last_played":1622219911},"language":"english","review":"plays well, and is a lot of fun at times.","timestamp_created":1594792077,"timestamp_updated":1594792077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510983288288116455","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72714054","author":{"steamid":"76561198070213322","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":264,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1585522724},"language":"english","review":"yas dis game is moar liek bred soomoolatoor.","timestamp_created":1594789699,"timestamp_updated":1594789699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72711937","author":{"steamid":"76561198823249477","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1106,"last_played":1594785770},"language":"english","review":"pretty good time killer","timestamp_created":1594785814,"timestamp_updated":1594785814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72711919","author":{"steamid":"76561198121812430","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":750,"last_played":1635310634},"language":"english","review":"Combat is super fun and challenging","timestamp_created":1594785783,"timestamp_updated":1594785783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72711902","author":{"steamid":"76561198046126854","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":636,"last_played":1595037399},"language":"english","review":"funnn","timestamp_created":1594785755,"timestamp_updated":1594785755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72709515","author":{"steamid":"76561198153149380","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1128,"last_played":1655005231},"language":"english","review":"This game is VERY good, and it holds up even today.
