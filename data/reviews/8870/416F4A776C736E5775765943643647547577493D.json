First off this game has one of the best stories I have ever played. Anybody who disagrees simply does not understand it, because it is also the most beautifully complex story I have ever played. This game is extremely beautiful. The combat is excellent. The characters are extremely well done. This game leaves me eagerly waiting for more from the Bioshock series, and will forever be a member among my top favorite games I have ever played. The Burial at Sea expansions, both part 1 and 2 are essential. I was in love from the start of the game and will forever be to the end of time.

Несмотря на свой год, игра выглядит очень круто. Такой хороший и реально захватывающий сюжет можно встретить ой как не часто.\n[h1]Минусы:[/h1]\n-Слишком запутанный сюжет и концовка.\n[hr][/hr]\nЕсли честно, то вообще забыл про Bioshock, а тут решил скачать, хотя бы просто посмотреть что да как. Неожиданно для себя я засел довольно таки надолго, а на целых 35 часов. Уже с первых кадров меня затянуло в этот новый, загадочный мир. Собственно, когда я попал в сам воздушный город, то просто не поверил глазам своим. Настолько всё было красочно и необычно, что дух захватило с первых же секунд. Мне очень нравиться стилистика Bioshock'а: она наполнена своими необычными красками, атмосферой, ни на что не похожей. И Infinite этом плане даже переплюнул первую и вторую часть. Что касаемо геймплея. то тут игра стала немного более упрощённой. У нас в арсенале имеется достаточно оружия и \"Энергетиков\", но за всё первое прохождение я пользовался только Маузером, тяжёлым револьвером и \"Шок-Жокеем\". Но это игре можно простить, поскольку удовольствие использование возможностей приносит ровно столько же, сколько приносили плазмиды \"Восторга\". Также приятно было введение крюка в игру. Он нужен не столько для самой игры, сколько для просто антуража. Естественно, зацепиться крюком за аэротрасу и прокатиться с ветерком тоже приятно. Теперь хочу обратиться непосредственно к сюжету. Очень глубокий и довольно-таки трагический сюжет, но люди зачастую  просто не понимают  этого. Но он построен таким образом, что его нужно собирать самому. Я это сделал  и понял. Вообще задумка может и не самая оригинальная (я имею в виду о существовании параллельных реальностей, путешествие сквозь пространство и время), но подана она так, будто это что-то действительно новое. Впервые, после игры в Dead by Daylight у меня просто-напросто вспух мозг (в хорошем смысле). Новый Bioshock совсем не похож на старый, но это даже хорошо. Плюс ко всему, разработчики очень удачно подобрали время действия, а именно начало 20-ого века: велосипеды с огромными колёсами, цилиндры, громоздкие фотоаппараты, неуклюжие, шумящие механизмы и неразнообразный арсенал оружия.","timestamp_created":1608401791,"timestamp_updated":1608501289,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82703670","author":{"steamid":"76561198255493297","num_games_owned":827,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1796,"last_played":1612888463},"language":"schinese","review":"生化奇兵无限，我心目中的最佳作品，可以和巫师3并列的那种，应该也可以用第九艺术来形容吧。\n艺术设定挺吸引我的，简单来说就是很美，但这种美，也建立在残酷与丑陋之上。为什么这么说呢，通关这部游戏的朋友们应该都会懂。可以说，这部游戏代入感很强，主角Booker与Elizabeth的一丝丝说不清的关系，我能够体会那种情绪。当通关本体，再通关海葬后，我相信很多人会觉得难受的（反正我先哭了），那种说不清的遗憾，会盘绕在你的脑海。\n关于剧情，如果通关了还是没搞懂，可以去看一下B站UP主AerinGhost的关于这个游戏的视频，讲解的很详细！\nElizabeth，你可能找不到第二个这么贴心的“队友”了（说是“队友”都感觉惭愧），AI做的很优秀，比如游戏中会常常帮助你之类的，而且不会突兀，很自然。这样令人印象深刻的女角色，我所知道的也就最后生还者1的Ellie，合金装备5的Quiet吧。\n而这些只是这个游戏的一部分而已，它所隐含的种种现象、行为实在讽刺，不仅讽刺了个人，更是讽刺了整个社会。\n对我来说，这个游戏很完美，剧情，美术，音乐，人物设定，各个方面。\n最后附上我印象最深刻的一段话\n\"Booker...are you afraid of God?\"\n\"No.But I'm afraid of you.\"","timestamp_created":1608399960,"timestamp_updated":1608399960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.746876001358032227","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82701890","author":{"steamid":"76561198841838514","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":1063,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":798,"last_played":1622940818},"language":"english","review":"OK, game very great.\nThis game is considered by many, including me, a masterpiece, basically everything is good, from music to story, but I think it is no surprise, isn't it? Infinite was launched in 2013 and, even though it wasn't the \"game of the year\" like bioshock 1, it was an awesome game, being the last in the bioshock series as of now (oh I look so bias writing it ಠ_ಠ)\nOK, let's get to the pros then. As I mentioned, the music is incredible, it got a nomination for the game with best soundtracks of 2013 and \"Will the circle be Unbroken\" got a award for best videogame soundtrack of 2013 (recommend listening), so it is obvious this game has awesome soundtracks. Character development is basically the heart of this game, I can't say much because of spoilers but even secondary characters have a descent development. Story is very good, it has it's ups and downs (mainly ups) and for many it can be boring sometimes, but still a great story. Its shooter system is great, very similar to other Bioshock games with vigors and many weapons, but you can only use 2 at a time and you have a permanent melee weapon, the aerial combat is very entertaining and the beat'em up mode is very fun at first, the system of tears alongside the help of elizabeth is very good too, leaving the combat much more strategic. Just like other Bioshocks you are very well rewarded by exploring the map, with ammo, guns, and things that will help the game become easier. It is basically impossible to get lost pressing N too :) (Decisions matter, A LOT)\nOK, cons are: bugs, really, I did not find that many bugs but that one when you get stucked in a structure and needs to reset your game to your last save is very annoying, it is not so common but because of it you need to limit exploration a little. The game can be really hard in some points and a bit confusing about where you should go, even with N. The game is not open world nor something like that, it is kinda linear at some points. As I mentioned, you can only carry 2 weapons and ammo is kinda hard to get, so you need to think more and shoot less, dunno if it is a con or not but will leave it here. Things are not SUPER DUPER well explained, but nothing that will ruin your gameplay.\nI have some other things to say about Bureau at Sea but I will leave it for later.\nIn general the game is very great, I would give it a 9 or 9.5/10 (That bug is very annoying still ಠ_ಠ)","timestamp_created":1608398034,"timestamp_updated":1622693312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504239559173583984","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82697335","author":{"steamid":"76561198140988877","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":589,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":516,"last_played":1608436639},"language":"schinese","review":"故事的渲染感真的好，\n就是有点容易死......死机！","timestamp_created":1608393330,"timestamp_updated":1608434168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82696838","author":{"steamid":"76561198272341868","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":879,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":577,"last_played":1616198537},"language":"turkish","review":"Sonunda wtf dediğiniz ayrıca düşünündürende bi oyun.","timestamp_created":1608392802,"timestamp_updated":1608392802,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82695755","author":{"steamid":"76561198056474123","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3601,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2956,"last_played":1608830963},"language":"english","review":"A solid shooter with a great story, looks great for the day too.","timestamp_created":1608391668,"timestamp_updated":1608391668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82694175","author":{"steamid":"76561197968564000","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1001,"last_played":1608389622},"language":"english","review":"I never gave bioshock infinite a chance, mainly because I had not such a good experience with bioshock 1.

I miss good stories in video games and have been a bit burned by the threadbare stories that modern looter shooters, live services, perpetually beta games offer today. Bioshock infinite is leagues better in my opinion. What also surprised me, is how much I enjoyed the gameplay. The hooks and rails mechanic is very enjoyable, only the gun feel is not up to scratch with the best.
