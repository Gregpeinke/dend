I remember playing the demo, Half-Life: Uplink and going crazy for it. So, what did I think of the full game?\n\nIt blew my F**KING mind! Mere words are insufficient to describe how freaking AWESOME this game was (and still is). I shall however attempt to do just that.\nThe story is excellent. You begin as Gordon Freeman, a scientist in a secret laboratory complex called Black Mesa. The suspense builds as you make your way to the test labs and then, once there, it all goes horribly wrong. Your world is thrown upside down. Black Mesa has suffered a catastrophic system failure. Your friends and colleagues are dead or dying. It seems you are trapped far underground. But worse is yet to come.\n\nCombat is good and fun seeing enemies gibbed by your explosives. There is a lot to explore. The facility is vast, although not every door can be opened. Music is good and fits into the location of Black Mesa and the level you are on. Enemies are varied and vary in ability. Each section/level has its own theme and look, along with its own challenges.\n\nHalf-Life was helped back in the day by the hundreds of mods that gamers made, enhancing and extending the Black Mesa complex. With them, the game seemed to last forever, which is no bad thing.\nThe game comes with multiplayer and I must say was an absolute delight to be involved in. I spent many hours with my friends competing and having much fun in the process. I actually became rather good at it, if I do say so myself.\n\nAfter over 15 years the graphics obviously shows its age but in all honesty, who cares? I don't. It's actually one of the reasons I love the game and have such fond memories of it. Most of the character models look and sound the same, so making out who is who is almost impossible, which shows in the sequel.\n\nThere may be Half-Life II and Black Mesa, which are graphically superior but if not already done so, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you play this game. You shall not be disappointed.\n\n10/10 (for its time)\n \n","timestamp_created":1449543848,"timestamp_updated":1449543848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509399056434631348","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19554515","author":{"steamid":"76561197995826686","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":75,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16,"last_played":1646127489},"language":"english","review":"Classic!","timestamp_created":1449523189,"timestamp_updated":1449523189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19544569","author":{"steamid":"76561198220090012","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":771,"last_played":1448610780},"language":"portuguese","review":"fodastico!","timestamp_created":1449483296,"timestamp_updated":1449483296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495495468378067017","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19542999","author":{"steamid":"76561198040834087","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":963,"last_played":1463871135},"language":"english","review":"This game's rad!","timestamp_created":1449473128,"timestamp_updated":1449473128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19542678","author":{"steamid":"76561198018657198","num_games_owned":434,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":623,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1547852063},"language":"english","review":"Help Gordon Freeman escape from CERN after the migrants attack.","timestamp_created":1449470761,"timestamp_updated":1449470761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19542415","author":{"steamid":"76561198089943640","num_games_owned":1297,"num_reviews":74,"playtime_forever":349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":349,"last_played":1411842231},"language":"english","review":"A Classic.

The environments are varied, from office complexes in Black Mesa to experimental labs, to a low-gravity alien realm. The weapons are realistic and easy to use; the crowbar splinters boxes and fractures skulls as it should - the pistol is weedy, but a welcome addition, grenades are thrown as they should, and the shotgun is satisfyingly powerful. The later weapons are brilliant, with my favourite of the gauss gun, which can charge up and take out helicopters if you do it just right. The guns are acquired at a good pace, although you don't get the most powerful one until very late in the game, which feels like a shame.\nIt's tremendously absorbing - you really feel immersed in the levels. The music helps, but it's a bit sporadic - you'll get some great music when you're coming up to a key bit, and then it'll die down. \nWhile there is variety of landscape and it is excellently created-the bareness of the offices and labs except of monsters and the general coldness of the facility as well as the chilling music creates a dark, sorrowful atmosphere. Your almost complete loneliness (apart from the occasional scientist or security guard) is capped by the chilling messages inscribed on the wall, 'Surrender, Freeman.'
