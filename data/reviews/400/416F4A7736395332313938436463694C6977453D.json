years after it first came out, I finally got around to playing this, and it's as good as people made it out to be. I love the dark, witty dialog and aesthetic - throughout the game, you're increasingly made aware that something is wrong, and the overall tone can become deeply unsettling at times, while retaining its sense of humor. I won't go too much into the plot; you should play it for yourself to experience it, and there are wikis if you really don't want to. But seriously, play it.\n\nThe mechanics are simple in theory. You have a portal gun that lets you create an entry and exit hole on select surfaces, so you can warp to locations that you couldn't otherwise reach. In practice, this is more complex, as you also retain your momentum while running/falling through a portal, which allows all manner of crazy stunts and lets you fly over hazards or catapault up to impossible ledges. Thank goodness there's no falling damage, or this game would be absolutely maddening. Sometimes, it can be a little bit annoying to reorient yourself while zooming through the air, but after a while of playing, you mostly get used to it.\n\nThe level design works well, too - once it's done hand holding, it pushes you into the deep end, subtly (and sometimes not so subtly) giving hints at what you're supposed to do, but still requiring you to think your way through the levels. You end up spending a decent amount of the game examining the level layout for every last nook and cranny that you can plant a portal onto. It's good at making you feel smart once you figure it out.\n\nApart from the dizzying weirdness of the maneuvers you have to pull off (which again, you generally get used to), my only complaint with Portal is that it's a bit short. Then again, as a first entry in the series, I don't know that it [b]should[/b] be longer. Portal 2 and its heaps of community content should fix that itch, anyway.","timestamp_created":1511002713,"timestamp_updated":1511003744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36593636","author":{"steamid":"76561198087179455","num_games_owned":1213,"num_reviews":267,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1468228354},"language":"schinese","review":"这个游戏很酷","timestamp_created":1511002331,"timestamp_updated":1511002331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.604161381721496582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36590167","author":{"steamid":"76561198172106475","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":4248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":666,"last_played":1646209845},"language":"english","review":"I

This game is just brilliant on every aspect. From it's timeless graphics, clever humor and design, all the way to story-telling and replayability. \n\nNot that long ago, I liked the game, of course, but i felt that the game missed potencial, was too short, and repetitive, well, let!s just say I was blind. Sure, the game on first playthrough may take only few hours and on the 10th one 30-40 minutes, but, even on the 10th playthrough, it still brings awesome and unforgettable experience. I went to this game recently after a very long time. I came back and went through the whole Half-Life and Portal series, this time with developer commentery, since I was really interested in that, making me revisit these places and experience them again after years. And, I freaking loved it. \n\nPortal is special, it's an art. Not only it is pleasure to play, but everyone can play it. Even if you never played any videogame before, this is a great title to start with. It's amazing at slowly teaching you and later making you master methods to approach any obstacle that comes into your way. And if you feel like it, the advanced and challenge chambers are a really piece of cake, but it is such a relief once you see those sweet achievements shining in your library, believe me on that. But Portal is not special only because the game itself could teach your grandma how to beat the game, but also by it's genius design. I don't really know any other games that could make me feel like a lab rat, as much as Portal does. The white shade of the chambers are so futuristic, yet so empty and claustrophobic, that it really makes player wonder, what kind of place it is and what's behind it. What or who is the lovely and terrifying AI voice talking to me all the time? Is anyone staring at me through those windows? Who exactly is watching me with those cameras? Throughout the whole game, you are in a facility you have no clue of what it might be, drowning in isolation and loneliness. And the only true friend you made along the way, is a cube, with heart on it. After hours of suffering through many tests, all by yourself, you get a friend. And after few minutes, You need to give it up on it. It can get cruel and unforgiving, but at the end, you win. And GLaDoS will forever be one of the best characters ever. She is such a unique figure, with such a depth behind her image.  \n\nAnd if you feel smarter after completing the game, advanced chambers and challenges, you have a full right too.

Si no quieres leer todo te lo resumire. Es un juego que no puedes perderte. Escribo esto nada más terminar el juego por que siento que se lo merece; entre al juego con no demasiadas expectativas, si, habia escuchado que era demasiado bueno pero aun asi no esperaba que lo ejecutara tan bien.\n\nEl juego a envejecido muy bien a ser verdad. Finales de 2017 y no le pega factura de ningun tipo. El doblaje a nuestro nativo idioma es algo plenamente decente, no presenta molestias.\n\nEste es un juego puzzle que se basa de plenas mecanicas, lo hace tan bien que se vuelve disfrutable y deseas más a cada paso que das. Es una idea sencilla, no creo que haga falta explicarla, todos sabemos de que trata. Pero la manera en la que la vuelve progresiva es demasiado satisfactorio. Sin tutoriales, sin ninguna ayuda asfixiante para el jugador es igual a un desarrollo bien hechos y puedo decir ciegamente que en este juego asi es.\n\nLos puzzles si bien no son complicados (ojo no hablo de que sean sencillos, probablemente en más de uno te preguntaras que hacer) incluyen poco a poco todo lo que vayas aprendiendo. ¿He mencionado lo gratificante qué se siente ya? Bueno, si, nuevamente, es confortante cuando las cosas salen bien, o cuando realizas algo a la primera y rapidamente. Una historia concisa y sencilla, aunque en el proceso resulta extremadamente inquietante y con más dudas que respuestas. \n\nEl juego te durara aproximadamente unas 3 o 4 horas a lo mucho, depende de que tan rapido seas. Entiendo que esto sea un impedimento para mucha gente, si tienes problema con ello aqui te va mi recomendación. Espera a las ofertas de Steam en donde lo encontraras a un precio ridiculamenrte bajo, el juego no se irá, tranquilo. \n\nEl unico inconveniente que podria mencionar es la nula re-jugabilidad para mi punto de vista. Suerte, y recuerda, una de las obras maestras de Valve.\n","timestamp_created":1510545891,"timestamp_updated":1510545891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36479368","author":{"steamid":"76561198383584489","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":169,"last_played":1629058695},"language":"brazilian","review":"Incrivel foda d mais\n","timestamp_created":1510520686,"timestamp_updated":1510520686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36478420","author":{"steamid":"76561198289590972","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1079,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":332,"last_played":1572506771},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un buen juego, buenas mecanicas y te hace sentir los solo que estas en el juego.","timestamp_created":1510517587,"timestamp_updated":1510517587,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36476046","author":{"steamid":"76561197985225716","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":149,"playtime_forever":228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":78,"last_played":1655375589},"language":"english","review":"Very cool concept.
