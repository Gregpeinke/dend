You run around maps as different classes (called perks) and kill these zombie-like ZEDs. They are experimented on humans gone through various tests and torture by a scientist now known as The Patriarch.\n\nYou reach the last wave and you will verse him. Once you know his tactics, he gets fairly easy to avoid but if you are new to the game I would strongly suggest playing with other people you know.\nThis game is fun with friends and can be with randoms as well.\n\nThe perk selection you get is quite vast and with the amount of DLC and support that Tripwire Interactive did for this game (for about 5-10 years or so if I recall) there is so much to choose from.\n\nPerks include:\n\nCommando (Assault Rifle type class)\nSharpshooter (Sniper class)\nBerserker (Melee class)\nFirebug (Flamethrower class)\n\nand so much more...\n\nDifferent perks can be ideal for different situations. Tired of those pesky crawlers? Go Firebug and set the ground ablaze! Finding those Stalkers annoying? Go Commando and spot them before they can even get to you! Having trouble with Fleshpounders? Go Support, grab a shotgun and let them have it!\nCan't control Scrakes? Go Berserker and learn the moves of swaying back and move, hitting particular buttons like mouse3 and mouse2 and effectively combat and stun your enemy.\nDon't like taking the Scrakes or Fleshpounders up close but wanna see some limbs fly?

Your goal is to survive 4,7 or 10 waves of enemies, while earning money by killing them (or by healing your teammates) so that you can buy powerful weapons during the minute of calm at the trader between the waves. After, you'll have to defeat the Patriarch, who is the sole responsible for the chaos. You can choose different difficulties: Easy (which is really to learn the game), Normal, Hard, Suicidal and Hell on Earth.\n\nEnemies are thougher depending on the difficulty but you too can evolve and acquire advantages like spawning with a better weapon than a pistol or armor thanks to the level system. You have 6 of them and it takes time. However, you have different classes: medic (no powerful weapon but more resistance  and better health), commando (rifles and can see stalkers from apart), support (big guns and better welder), demo (everything that is explosive), berserker (melee and also can't be grabbed), sharpshooter (sniper and headshots more efficient) and firebug (flame everywhere).\n\nEnemies are varied: from the simple Zed to the infamous Fleshpound that can kill you quickly, without forgetting the Scrake and the chainsaw, the Gorefast that cuts you in pieces, the Crawler that loves your feet, the Stalker who is hidden, the Husk that launches fireballs, the Siren that is hurting your ears (and your health)....\n\nAnyway, the game in its actual state contains many maps (some are official, others done by modders) and mutators with Christmas-themed or Halloween-Themed or Circus-Themed enemies (because they were parts of special events). The maps are very varied: fair, tunnel of love, Santa's workshop or cave, asylum, Horzine labs, urban town, mountain, hospital, etc..\n\nBut you'll ask me: what about the DLC? Well, all the DLC are cosmetic. True, you have new weapons in them and they can be used for achievements. However, you can do them with the standard weapons, that are enough like the AA12 for example. And you can unlock avatars by playing with themed mutators for example or owning other games. And that's how you own two Mr Foster (the normal and the steampunk).\n\nKilling Floor in solo holds interest if you want to level without having a team to check or to win map achievements in Normal/Hard. An higher difficulty is better with a team, however, keep in mind that some of the players aren't using the perks for the team but for themselves. I've seen many medics choosing this perk for the advantages it's giving in terms of resistance or health but not healing at all the team for example. It's annoying as hell and if I seems to be upset by this kind of behavior, it's because I'm a medic first in this game, because I feel more useful by healing my teammates than beginning to put pipe bombs, welding the right doors or being a specialist of the crossbow. Healing is important in that game and if a medic is there, he's more powerful for the heal than the rest of the team. Not using of that fact can result in premature death on high difficulty.\n\nAnyway, with Killing Floor 2, I don't know if there are still a lot of players there. I still need to win Suicidal and Hell on Earth achievements, as I've all Hard and Normal and that all my perks are lvl5+. But it's still worthy to play. As long as there are servers and as long as the solo mode is there, Killing Floor is really a very strong co-op game. However, make sure that you're not discouraged when level 0. By patience, by learning and by leveling, you'll find more and more pleasure to survive these waves.","timestamp_created":1303075897,"timestamp_updated":1453282696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589511096477508545","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"958271","author":{"steamid":"76561197983045874","num_games_owned":1533,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":5234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5234,"last_played":1348210800},"language":"english","review":"For 10 bucks..

Starší ročník, ale když se zrovna večer nudíte a nemáte do čeho píchnout určitě zabaví. Téhle hře není nic moc co vytknout, protože je tak strašně jednoduchá, že tam není žádný bug ani chyba takže takhle no. Prostě obyčejná střílečka do mutantů ani Co-op tam není nějak záživné jak slibují v traileru, určitě jsem si zahrál lepší co-op střílečky.","timestamp_created":1302422094,"timestamp_updated":1391814023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"798616","author":{"steamid":"76561197978677370","num_games_owned":714,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":10033,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7539,"last_played":1404435673},"language":"english","review":"ZOMBIES!

Whoever liked zombies mode in condition zero in the p2x community should like it. Personally this is my favorite game. You think Zombie mod was hard? Think twice, this one have perks for each role you can be in the part of a 6 man squad. Think about an experienced leader who know's wich perks are good against the kinds of monsters to encounter. Different difficulty wich improve not only the health damage but also the movement speed of the experiments spawning each waves attempting to eat you up. Looking for a challenge?
