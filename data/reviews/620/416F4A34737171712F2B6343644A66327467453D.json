[/h1]\n\nI have played this game before I played the perevious one, which was a bad decision. NEVER PLAY PORTAL 2 BEFORE PORTAL ONE. Looking at how old this game is, it is still very impressive about how many people are still playing the game right now. \n\nThis game's story is outstanding. In the first game, the story was very mysterious. For example, when you start Portal 1 for the first time, you start to ask many questions, for example: Why do I wake up in this glass box? etc. But, the reason this story is a masterpiece is because the second game answers some of those questions, but in a way so that it creates more questions. This is why people have been nagging for a third game for years.","timestamp_created":1546279687,"timestamp_updated":1546279687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47993683","author":{"steamid":"76561198419502542","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":672,"last_played":1601842076},"language":"latam","review":"Si eres ese tipo de persona que le encantan los juegos de puzzle con giros en las mecanicas.\n\nTe encantara este juego\n\n:)","timestamp_created":1546279435,"timestamp_updated":1546279435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47993435","author":{"steamid":"76561198129910587","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":279,"last_played":1638255876},"language":"russian","review":"В этой игре прекрасно все!!!","timestamp_created":1546278831,"timestamp_updated":1546278831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47993337","author":{"steamid":"76561198315832614","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":3224,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":876,"last_played":1635270746},"language":"english","review":"Best single player game and co-op at the same time! \n\nRecommand it :D","timestamp_created":1546278569,"timestamp_updated":1546278569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47992866","author":{"steamid":"76561198415723337","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1364,"last_played":1609426879},"language":"russian","review":"ЭТО ШИДЕВР!!!!\nСоветую всем!!!\nПЛОХО ЧТО ВАЛВ СКАТИЛИСЬ, но я в них верю!","timestamp_created":1546277457,"timestamp_updated":1546277457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47992697","author":{"steamid":"76561198196507410","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":267,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":267,"last_played":1545660191},"language":"russian","review":"Для людей с IQ выше 100","timestamp_created":1546277044,"timestamp_updated":1546277044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47992537","author":{"steamid":"76561198162619204","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":853,"last_played":1617643233},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo bom pq eu tenho um amigo indio e ele conseguia ver ele mesmo através dos portal e acho que era espelho mt loco tem até uns robo que fala n sei como fala mas eles fala se vc quer comprar um jogo compra pq esse jogo tme história geografia e mt mais","timestamp_created":1546276718,"timestamp_updated":1546276718,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47991966","author":{"steamid":"76561198313549459","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":572,"last_played":1547143449},"language":"french","review":"EXCELENT!\nJuste Excelent!

Great Story. Not only do I like the plots in the story and the unexpected turns of events (like escaping with Wheatley) but it's also hilarious, especially when attempting some of the achievements.\n2. It gets you thinking. Though I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone who get severe motion sickness (for obvious reasons beyond Valve's control), it's a good puzzle game. You really have to think how you would complete the level.\n3. Co-op. If solving a level is too easy in your opinion (though I kinda doubt it in some levels) then try solving a level with a friend. It's a lot more challanging. Also, you can gesture to your partner which is also good at getting certain achievements and getting GLADoS ticked off which is absolutely HILARIOUS!!!!\n4. Steam Workshop integration. You have the ability to play maps made by the community which can be a good way to solve some new challanges.\n5. Very good graphics dispite it being a 7 year old game.\n6. Has a level editor found in the \"Community Test Chambers\" button. It's always cool to create your own levels!\n\nLast of all, I really love Wheatley's accent. (And Iskall85 does a good impression of it. Find an example in Hermitcraft 6).\n\nJust one minor downside: It can be very easy to get bored of the game once you complete the game (the reason a lot of people have around 10 hours of play time) because the main story mode doesn't go on forever and then gets a bit more difficult to enjoy which means people get bored of it and play something else. Valve have actually tried to prevent that sort of thing with co-op, achievements, a level editor and Steam Workshop Integration. But, I've been playing co-op one time and been designing a level another time and have really been enjoying playing it :) I encourage you random guy reading my review to do the same.\n\nI definitely recommend the game dispite that downside. Even more so on a sale!","timestamp_created":1546249134,"timestamp_updated":1548055942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47980425","author":{"steamid":"76561198795964510","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":72,"playtime_at_review":666,"last_played":1660052751},"language":"russian","review":"VALVE посторались спасибо за всё","timestamp_created":1546244571,"timestamp_updated":1546244571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47979789","author":{"steamid":"76561198422107697","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":715,"last_played":1546242188},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game with an amazing storyline.

He was ready to kill such human by gassing up the room, but gets shocked by the fact that such human was the same one that killed his lame \"Duck-Roll\" meme back in the early days of 4chins and replacing it with an 80's song. (Spoiler Alert: In Portal 3 it is revealed that he was the one behind the \"Gnome'd\" meme made in an attempt to recover his meme-position. Sadly, his meme didn't get popular until a few years later after the disappearance of Portal Lady) \n \nHe knew that gassing her wasn't a very good-enough punishment for such cruel meme-killer, so he decides to pretend to be all friendly with the last surviving human from the final Fallout so he could get her to fall on the Rick Roll room to punish this beast by making her listen to the meme that she used to destroy the Duck-Roll meme for the rest of eternity. \n \nLittle did he know that the Robot Lady from the first game has been waiting for the both of them pretending to be dead. But in reality, she was eating a diet of the meme that Portal SIut created back in 2007 so she could somehow turn it into Carbon Dioxide as a weird and fetishy punishment for such \"sh¡tty\" meme. (Get it? \"Sh¡tty\"? haha... Only one person is gonna laugh at that crappy joke...) \n \nYatta Yatta Yatta, fast forward after a few Shenanigans and portally adventures, when she thought it was finally time to finish this monster of a creature, she finds that both the British testicle and the cake lady destroyed her Carbon Dioxide capsule, which got her so depressed that she decided that the only solution left was to just kill her in a generic way, but that plan also failed; and she got her head Rip and Tear'd by them two. Cake Lady was getting ready to go back to the outside world where she could create and destroy so many memes again like she did back in her golden age of memery, but the British Testicle was ready to bamboozle her by stopping the capsule right there and playing such song from the 80's, but failed miserably after the robot lady tricked him into destroying the capsule as she felt that being meme'd on a potato was just too Humiliating for her. \n \nYatta Yatta, Cake B¡tch and Robot SIut watch a few episodes from the old meme show about Artificially colored ponies that talk about friendship and do magical tricks all day. They both realize that indeed; Friendship is Magic™, and they both decide that being virgins was so 2011, so they instead decided to become lesbians. And so they planned to get rid of the last males in existence by sending them into space for all of eternity, and they succeed in doing so.  \n \nand just when we thought that we were gonna have a happy ending in which they both become lesbian couple, Robot SIut gets socially anxious about being in love with the one and only human left in the entire world because she fears that she'll end up getting neglected and feel sadness for the rest of her life. So instead, she decides that it's better if she sent Pie Lesbian into the outside world where she can find all the dead memes left within history and destroy them all by making them more obnoxious, and never see her again. \n \nThe end.
