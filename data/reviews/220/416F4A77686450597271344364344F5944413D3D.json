This is THE game, Halo,Gears of War, almost every modern shooter would not be half the game it is if not for the visionary design of Half-Life 2. You can ask any designer in the action games genre and there's no doubt Half-Life 2 will be at the top of their most influensial games. This game went where the first couldn't, Valve pushed the technology and even too kthe time to make an engine that, to this day, looks amazing and plays smooth on most any system.

Graphiquement on a le Source Engine version 2010, pas le plus beau mais qui restitue bien les environnements divers que l'équipe artistique à rendu réaliste au possible dans l'univers de science fiction propre à Half-Life. Niveau gameplay on a un FPS classique, mais l'ajout du Gravity Gun et des mécaniques de jeu orientées physiques (jouer avec le décor pour tuer les ennemis par exemple) crée une particularité, presque une révolution du gameplay. Une liberté quasi totale. La durée de vie est excellente, le prix est faible (préférez l'Orange Box qui a l'intégrale HL2 plus Portal et TF2 pour le tout petit prix de 20€) et la qualité est exemplaire. On pousse plus loin l'intrigue avec de nouveaux personnages.

They create a new level, a standard to which all things following it will be compared. Often, these boundaries are then broken by another equally brilliant item that comes along in the next few years. \nHere stands one such item that since 2004 has not been bested. Half Life 2 is, in my opinion, the best game ever made. That title belongs to many classic arcade games for some, but I find the positives and almost absolute lack of negatives of HL2 as undeniable.\nTechnically, it excels in both it's engine and it's level design, clearly a work of artisans. An unparalleled physics engine that uncannily represents realism is played against a superbly detailed world that plays host to a haunting beauty that I cannot describe with mere words. Whether it's your first steps into Ravenholm, the first time you hurtle a barrel across the scrapyard with the gravity-gun or the first time Alyx smiles at you, everyone who has ever played HL2 has a fantastic memory of how it looks and plays.\n\nThe story also deserves a special mention: Finding itself somewhere between a sophisticated psycho-thriller and a Phillip K. Dickian future, it will leave a brilliant sense of space and threat in you for days.\n\nThere is nothing in my opinion that ascends to the height of Half Life 2 in terms of story and mechanics. It paces itself beautifully, starting slowly and exploding into a Wagnarian flurry of motion and emotion that defies mortal description. \n\nIf you haven't played this game, then you really must. It is something deeply special that I sincerely think all gamers should worship as a piece of genius. Play, live and enjoy it.","timestamp_created":1303914226,"timestamp_updated":1389741358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3856233","author":{"steamid":"76561198028183241","num_games_owned":403,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1452197246},"language":"english","review":"One of the top 10 greatest games of all time and you still need to read recommendations. just get it already.","timestamp_created":1303860754,"timestamp_updated":1303860754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531645596027374268","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3511031","author":{"steamid":"76561198023963012","num_games_owned":472,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1146,"last_played":1508888138},"language":"english","review":"Once upon a time, Half-Life 2 was THE game to play if you wanted a single player experience. The graphics were incredible, the weapons were all fun to use (especially the famous gravity gun), and it added more to the cinematic approach that the first Half-Life had. It was the gem of that era, but that era is long gone. \n\nPlaying Half-Life 2 without modding today doesn't give the same excitement that it did years ago. The once impressive graphics now look old, especially when you notice the re-use of character models throughout the game. The weapons are no longer as cool, as Valve themselves topped the Gravity Gun with the portal gun years later. The cinematic portions are now a chore as many other games have tried being more cinematic, except unlike Half-life 2 they allow you to skip it. \n\nI'm not saying that the game itself is bad, in fact you can still have some fun shooting combine soldiers. However, the game unfortunately can no longer live up to the high standards it set up for itself years ago.","timestamp_created":1303834272,"timestamp_updated":1385880051,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.386663347482681274","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3762692","author":{"steamid":"76561198027092920","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1455,"last_played":1656294959},"language":"english","review":"Best pc game ever made","timestamp_created":1303739553,"timestamp_updated":1303739553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499445050954818726","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4306629","author":{"steamid":"76561198035359110","num_games_owned":4139,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":122,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":122,"last_played":1368860400},"language":"spanish","review":"La historia y ambientacion no me gustaron tanto como en la primera parte, pero fue el titulo que estreno el afamado \"source engine\", un motor tan potente que incluso a dia de hoy sigue dando guerra.

From the urban-swamps of City 17 to the haunted, infected town of Ravenholm, and from the seaside coastline of Highway 17 to the prison of Nova Prospekt, all the environments flow together, providing a simple, yet riviting base story for the player (and, if you're curious enough, and extremely deep back story).\n\nAll in all, Half-Life 2 is a must-have for nearly every PC gamer, especially for shooter fans, and is an experience you aren't likely to forget.","timestamp_created":1299561655,"timestamp_updated":1299561655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473372787237167358","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3591704","author":{"steamid":"76561198025063073","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2900,"last_played":1576925502},"language":"english","review":"No better source for your daily dose of headcrab!","timestamp_created":1299386207,"timestamp_updated":1299386207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"865004","author":{"steamid":"76561197980461374","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1145,"last_played":1328169600},"language":"english","review":"LITERALLY, THE BEST FPS EVER, HANDS DOWN.","timestamp_created":1299306558,"timestamp_updated":1299306558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1441346","author":{"steamid":"76561197993280915","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":89,"playtime_forever":2088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1183,"last_played":1519592592},"language":"english","review":"\"COME ON GORDON CRANK THAT THING\"\n","timestamp_created":1299045644,"timestamp_updated":1299045644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3158815","author":{"steamid":"76561198018369912","num_games_owned":477,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":364,"last_played":1480259385},"language":"english","review":"Épico!!!","timestamp_created":1298766349,"timestamp_updated":1298766349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1054437","author":{"steamid":"76561197985444671","num_games_owned":465,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":860,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":846,"last_played":1369033200},"language":"english","review":"Probably the best game of the last decade.
