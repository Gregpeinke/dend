В чём заключается сущность этой новой власти, которой не хотят или не могут понять ещё в большинстве стран? Сущность её, привлекающая к себе рабочих каждой страны всё больше и больше, состоит в том, что прежде государством управляли так или иначе богатые или капиталисты, а теперь в первый раз управляют государством, притом в массовом числе, как раз те классы, которых капитализм угнетал. Даже в самой демократической, даже в самой свободной республике, пока остаётся господство капитала, пока земля остаётся в частной собственности, государством всегда управляет небольшое меньшинство, взятое на девять десятых из капиталистов или из богатых.\n\nПервый раз в мире власть государства построена у нас в России таким образом, что только рабочие, только трудящиеся крестьяне, исключая эксплуататоров, составляют массовые организации — Советы, и этим Советам передается вся государственная власть. Вот почему, как ни клевещут на Россию представители буржуазии во всех странах, а везде в мире слово «Совет» стало не только понятным, стало популярным, стало любимым для рабочих, для всех трудящихся. И вот почему Советская власть, каковы бы ни были преследования сторонников коммунизма в разных странах, Советская власть неминуемо, неизбежно и в недалеком будущем победит во всём мире.\n\nМы хорошо знаем, что у нас ещё много недостатков в организации Советской власти. Советская власть — не чудесный талисман. Она не излечивает сразу от недостатков прошлого, от безграмотности, от некультурности, от наследия дикой войны, от наследия грабительского капитализма. Но зато она даёт возможность переходить к социализму. Она даёт возможность подняться тем, кого угнетали, и самим брать всё больше и больше в свои руки всё управление государством, всё управление хозяйством, всё управление производством.\n\nСоветская власть есть путь к социализму, найденный массами трудящихся и потому — верный, и потому — непобедимый.\n\n","timestamp_created":1658153864,"timestamp_updated":1658153864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119010504","author":{"steamid":"76561199205649966","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1143,"last_played":1657554248},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo da minha infância, eu passava horas jogando ele, e agora pude zerar ele finalmente e ainda platinar.

Overall I would give it 4.5/10.\n\n[u]GAMEPLAY[/u]\nToo easy, yes I played on Normal difficulty, but still... you are literally spammed with medkits and ammo for the most part of the game. The only usable weapons for long range (revolver and crossbow) have too rare ammo so most of the combat will happen in close/medium range where the shotgun is always the best choice no matter what. Big disappointment in comparison with the first game where you had many weird and interesting weapons that you would always switch around. On the bright side the gravity gun was pretty fine and fun to use in some of the physic-based puzzles. Which brings us to frustration time when game does not care about hinting you what roughly you should be doing, so you have to search everywhere for the elusive ladder that blends into bland environment. Then you get the exact opposite when some character, NPC or obviously arranged objects keep slapping you in the face with 'DO THIS, YOU SHOULD BE DOING THIS, DO IT NOW'. Also there's boring part where you drive a ship and easy-lackluster part at the end of the game.\n\n[u]ENEMIES[/u]\nSame as with weapons, the enemies are big disappointment in comparison to the first game. There was big opportunity to make something alien-like and interesting, yet they made zombies (yawn), few types of combines (just augmented humans) and one type of alien creature. Not counting the 'boss' enemies, those gets repeated few times in almost identical 'boss' fights and that's all. \n\n[u]STORY[/u]\nThe Alien invasion story part of the game is just shallow - Boohoo aliens enslaved us, go defeat their tower to free us, Gordon.\nAnd then the family story part of the game? They present you with strong woman character out of nowhere and you have basically no reason to care about her, once you don't then the rest of this story is completly irrelevant to you.\n\n[u]AESTHETICS AND SETTING[/u]\nYes, it has decent graphics (even excellent for it's time), but I would rather look at any GoldSrc game than at this dark, bland style. The setting is trying to be super edgy and morbid which I find kinda cringy. It also gets ruined by Ravenholm part, that's just your generic lame horror shooter. The game revolves around suffering of humankind, but does not explain much of the alien empire causing it, you are just presented with Wallace Breen as the bad guy and his human-like troops. Why even is there concept of some alien superpower when it makes no sense after the story of the first game? I would rather run around Xen and activate some alien technology than having to look at boring destroyed city and depressed people over and over again.","timestamp_created":1658083975,"timestamp_updated":1658083975,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.428571432828903198","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118970886","author":{"steamid":"76561199120576628","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":276,"last_played":1643619164},"language":"russian","review":"Прекрасная игра.","timestamp_created":1658082563,"timestamp_updated":1658082563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118970223","author":{"steamid":"76561198066682443","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":696,"last_played":1658081655},"language":"polish","review":"JEST OK","timestamp_created":1658081664,"timestamp_updated":1658081664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118970002","author":{"steamid":"76561199051356019","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1658927084},"language":"spanish","review":"Un clasico de steam, lo recomiendo por que tiene una trama interesante \nLoa graficos no son los mejores pero a quien cño le importa","timestamp_created":1658081353,"timestamp_updated":1658081353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118969029","author":{"steamid":"76561199076317353","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":508,"last_played":1657724419},"language":"english","review":"very gud","timestamp_created":1658080031,"timestamp_updated":1658080031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118968958","author":{"steamid":"76561198135300972","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":701,"last_played":1659030395},"language":"english","review":"­","timestamp_created":1658079935,"timestamp_updated":1658623090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118968743","author":{"steamid":"76561198027314706","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1047,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1047,"last_played":1658079369},"language":"russian","review":"Дизлайк за тиммейтов ботов и муравьиных львов, которые бегают за тобой и постоянно блочат!

Probably because most people unfortunately judge games by graphics, or because it's children who cannot handle a little bit of challenge. If this game wasn't a sequel to an already infamous title, I doubt people would praise it so hard. It's almost like people enjoy it only for this reason alone – it's more modern looking continuation of a title they liked when they were younger. I am speaking as a person in their twenties who played both games for the first time in a span of two weeks.\n\nThe first game was a very pleasant surprise for me. I enjoy some good mysterious atmosphere and that game nailed it. Gameplay was enjoyable, lots of interesting enemies, level designs and weapons. And to be honest, I liked the graphics much more. I just prefer polygon people over those uncanny, ugly, horrifying abominations, alright. But more about that later.\nThe whole game gave me three emotions: Frustration over where the hell am I supposed to go, feeling thirsty for more combat that never satisfied me, and raw emotion of SHUT THE F*CK UP anytime annoying NPCs showed up.\n\nThe story was unbearable. Half-Life 2 had a very stale atmosphere and themes that are basic and boring. Accidentally unleashing alien entities into this world because you're playing with something you don't fully comprehend? Awesome. Humanity being dominated by superior race and now people need to unite to survive in this boring post apocalyptic world and I am supposed to pretend I care? Meh. And now they need to add this stupid annoying woman with her daddy issues and I just... Why, why do people think I care about those characters. I seriously hated them. They were annoying – wouldn't shut the f*ck up. Like seriously, most of the time you just wish there was some hint at what are you supposed to do only to figure out you just couldn't find a stupid ladder for ten minutes. But when this b*tch shows up? You get the physics gun. And you wanna try it out. And her? CLIMB HERE, COME ON, CLIMB HERE, UP HERE, COME ON COME ON. Shuddup. Then you go to the next part, COME ON CATCH THE BALL CATCH IT CATCH THE BALL COME ON GORDON. Okay so you gonna pretend you wanna make this game as immersive as possible, so you don't give any objectives, but you make the characters spam the same stupid line every ten seconds. Too bad cuz that ain't how people work. How am I supposed to root for human race when the humans are so annoying. There was a lot of times I thought \"man, nobody bothered to play through this before they released it, so they didn't realize how annoying this game really is.\" I think there's no need to talk about the story much because it was simply so cringy, but honestly, the part at the end when Mossman did the thing was so so sooo ridiculously bad, I honestly thought they tried to be funny by creating such a stupid scene.\n\nSo now let's move to the gameplay. I already mentioned how annoying it was to search for ladders and stuff. That's like the main part of this game. Figuring out where to go and where the hell you are. The locations aren't even enjoyable or interesting, unlike the first game. Unpopular opinion (just like all these opinions I'm afraid), but Ravenholm was not spooky but rather cringy. I didn't appreciate this game's attempts to pretend it's a horror game, creating a very generic, painfully slow segment.\n\nThere's two segments where you ride a boat or a car – for waaay too long. The boat was incredibly boring, the car had at least some interesting moments when you had to stop in some buildings. But you just keep anticipating the good combat. Well, too bad. There's none. When you finally get excited, you realize it's all over and you gotta search for some ladder again. Comparing to the first game, there's no variety of enemies at all. Boring zombies or Combines. And they are DUMB. I lost count of how many times they exploded themselves – by literally running into a grenade they just threw. There was absolutely no buildup in difficulty. We both played it with my boyfriend at the same time, and it was like the second chapter when he said \"this is too easy\". I was still hopeful and said \"it's just the beginning\". Nah, the game literally has the same difficulty the whole time, and when it could get more challenging, they give you a squad of random people. Oh how I missed the solo experience when idiotic companions showed up. The final segment is the easiest one so don't get your hopes up there's gonna be something like a final challenge. When there's finally some part with more enemies, the game tries hard to convince you to set up turrets rather than fight them off yourself. Well, I didn't bother and effortlessly defeated them myself, because the game is just so easy. Yeah, true, I only played the normal difficulty, but I cannot imagine the easy mode. And also, I don't consider weapons dealing less damage to be a good difficulty balance.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, there came a point where I only used the shotgun, because the others couldn't compare. In the first game I switched around the weapons a lot. And you had some cool alien weapons, especially in Opposing Force. In this game there was just the bug egg that only worked for one segment, and it was also the only thing you could use cuz it was kinda too op. Sometimes you are forced to use the physics gun, other times you think you should but you can't, and it's just really confusing in some situations. Honorable mention: When you are in the museum or whatever, and have to turn off the generators, there is a room with sensors that activate turrets and seal the room. Well, I thought I had to use the physics gun, it just made sense to me, so I threw a picture from the wall into the sensor, activating it, sealing the door in the process. I didn't know what to do next, so I just went and disabled the other generator. Then I asked my boyfriend what am I supposed to do with the closed door and he was like \"you f*cked that up\". So yeah, I had to do the generators part all over again, because the developers didn't think about people trying other options and accidentally making the game unplayable, not even giving a hint I just need to do it again. This simply shouldn't happen.\n\nI am glad I can say I played Half-Life 2. I made my opinion. It is one of the most overrated games ever, and I wonder how it was originally supposed to be like.\nSo, if you thought the first game was simply magical and this one is meh, you are not alone, brother.","timestamp_created":1658075382,"timestamp_updated":1658075980,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190507411956787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118964478","author":{"steamid":"76561199211947391","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1658072874},"language":"schinese","review":"只能说不合我的口味，怪物设计的太吓人了，但是除去这点游戏本身线性剧情和FPS打怪是真的好玩，我会把它通关一遍的，目前还没通关，它最吸引我的是剧情，这也就是我强忍着对怪物的不适也要通关的原因，希望到后面剧情能给我更多的惊喜吧，特别称赞它的画面，04年做到这样也太牛了，但如果画面升级到CS:GO的水平就更好了\nCan

Also the game has some puzzles in every stage. For example you need to find a car battery to connect with other two batteries that already are connected each other. This car battery is hidden in an old rust naked car outside of the bulding you need to connect the battery. It has parts like this in all the stages and sometimes you need a walkthrouth video to see the solution. In general is a cool game that i play it for the first time in 2022 and i like it very much.
