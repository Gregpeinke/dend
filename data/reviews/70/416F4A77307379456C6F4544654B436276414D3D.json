Yes ONLY if you want to experience the original half life in it's goldsorce glory.\n\nThe actual review:\nThe game starts out great. It's a lot of fun to play and is very nice. I don't have much to comment on here aside from it being just as people told me it was. A great game.\nUnfortunately past Office Complex is where I begin to have issues with the pacing, difficulty, and various other aspects. It really begins to show it's age late game. I found myself just wanting it to end. Getting stuck, unsure where to go, low on health and ammo frequently, constantly reloading a save because of one wrong move that I had no idea would kill me. The finale felt extremely rushed and boring. The final boss almost pitifully easy.\n\nI recommend this only if you want specifically the goldsource version of half life for mods or what have you. If you just want to play half life or are new to the series. Go play Black Mesa. It's a massive improvement over this in both graphics and almost every other aspect while remaining very faithful despite having brand new additions.

He is needed for an experiment that winds up creating the worst day at work ever. You know how in the original Doom, the UAC was doing experiments involving portals from Phobos to Deimos, and they end up having demons from Hell invading? Well, something kinda similar happens here: while experimenting with with a strange crystal, Gordon finds himself accidentally initiating a \"resonance cascade,\" which brings aliens from another dimension to Earth, wreaking havoc in the facility. After sh*t hits the fan, its up to Gordon to find a way to close the interdimensional portal, while also dealing with a special unit of the United States military sent to deal with the aliens, as well as silence all Black Mesa personnel.\n\nAs I stated before, this was a groundbreaking FPS in the late 90s. Enemy AI is more complex than its contemporaries were, and thus you need to be more careful with how you progress in the game. Set entirely in first person, there's a strong narrative focus here, with NPCs being a somewhat important way to progress the game, along with various setpieces in each level. Oh yeah, and the levels are interconnected rather than pushing a button and moving on the next level immediately. \n\nThe atmosphere of these levels are fantastic, and the puzzles will get you thinking. The combat meanwhile, is great, due to the weapons you get to use. While some enemies are frustrating, at the very least there is a variety of them, which means things will never get to stale in that regard.

legendary Half-Life existed to me only as whispers and mentions on the bespoke wind. I had never played it or  thought I'd play it. \n\nEventually I found it, bought it... and even though I have not come very far *at all*, I already find it impressive, I can understand why it's so esteemed, and I can recommend it.\n\nIn terms of FPS's, I am very inexperienced, so the best I can offer is this: Compared to the big-name FPS's I've seen clips of, Half-Life is (relatively) slow-paced. Big sustained shootouts are unlikely; this game is largely around picking and choosing where and when you shoot, rationing your munitions, and using the environment to your advantage.\n\nIn terms of story and lore-building, Half Life succeeds in an immersive way. Spoken word between fictipersons, announcements overhead, blink-and-you'll miss it sightings, big signs, visual context such as machines being present working correctly or incorrectly to various degrees, are used to make this odd sci-fi story was really happening around -and to - me.\n\nIn terms of cons, I can't think of many, largely because I have not gotten far. The most immediate that come to mind are that if you're looking for a hero, you won't find it here. The playable guy Gordon allows- and sometimes outright does- some very awful things in order to progress, by necessity. [spoiler]As an example there's a device that a scientist has cleverly perched upon to stay safe. He insists on staying there, which frankly makes sense considering the circumstances. However, that part he's perched on is conductive of lightning.\n\nInstead of offering an option to help him off and help him find shelter somewhere else in the facility, the game requires us to intentionally reactivate the device, which will cause the scientist to be shocked to death. For me personally this was stomach-churning, which to be fair was likely the intention given the scary elements of the story and setting.[/spoiler]\n\nThere is much to discover in Half Life 1, and if anyone's interested in PC gaming history, I recommend it. Among other things it could be darn well worth it to see and even play for oneself the game that help launched Valve as we know it today - without which this platform we write and read and share and make history on and through which we can access more games than we could have ever dared imagine possible in the 90's, might not exist.","timestamp_created":1654461119,"timestamp_updated":1654461119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116542456","author":{"steamid":"76561199229930631","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":412,"playtime_at_review":2307,"last_played":1660586714},"language":"english","review":"its cool","timestamp_created":1654457935,"timestamp_updated":1654457935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116540806","author":{"steamid":"76561198298088207","num_games_owned":349,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":14232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6452,"last_played":1657140984},"language":"english","review":"no velocitycap therefore i like it","timestamp_created":1654455615,"timestamp_updated":1654455615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116540592","author":{"steamid":"76561198888479174","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":988,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":988,"last_played":1654455163},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel ist sehr gut.

Основная идея игры заключается в том, что бы исследовать новый мир и выжить там до самого конца. В процессе исследования игрок встречает людей и других монстров. Игра никак не связана с событиями, происходящими в фильме \"Грань будущего\", и, как отметил издатель \"Грани Будущего\" Ли Уоннелл, она вообще не связана ни с каким фильмом. Сюжетное повествование довольно невнятное, при том, что в нём развернулись события, к которым не было никаких предпосылок. Главный герой обучается на инженера-программиста и проходит инструктаж в компании \"Хьюлетт-Паккард\" на базе \"Чёртово колесо\". На территории комплекса расположены офисы, лаборатории и квартира Г.Ф. Лавкрафта. \nВаш персонаж подвергается воздействию неизвестных науке лучей, вызывающих ускорение и замедление времени. Оказавшись среди смертельно опасных гостей, вы спешно эвакуируетесь к себе домой, но в спешке забываете часть багажа в Набережных Челнах. Теперь вам нужно спасти его любой ценой.\nСерьёзность сюжета дополняется  серьёзным геймплеем. \nHalf-Life - это бесконечное пеший и велосипедный прогресс. Череда счастливых, но опасных для нас моментов. Противостоять врагу необходимо с помощью оружия, находящегося в левой части экрана. Когда оружие отображается в руке персонажа, его можно сменить на любое другое. Исключение - снайперская винтовка GLaDOS Slammer. Большая часть арсенала атакует пулями. Сама же пуля представляет собой предмет, который разрушает препятствия и наносит урон. Медицинский скафандр вашего персонажа время от времени разряжается от тяжести и жары, поэтому приходится его подзаряжать за счёт самоконтроля игрока.\nЛокации обильно детализированы путём наложения многослойных шейдерных моделей. Геймдизайнер Эрик Дёркс лично побывал в каждой локации несколько раз. Графика выглядит более живой, чем хотелось бы, но пусть это останется на совести авторов. Некоторые этапы игры проходят на продуваемых южным ветром участках. Создаётся ощущение. что создатели хотели, чтобы вы и сами рванули в Мексику. На уровнях часто встречаются объекты, которые игроку сначала нужно взять в прицел, а затем уничтожить. \nПройдя по следам от ботинок, можно найти особые предметы - например, патроны, позволяющие открыть дверь лифта. \nИгра получила довольно неплохую звуковую дорожку. Саундтрек соответствует звуку низких частот, которые и придают атмосфере игры ощущение полноты. \nМногие нововведения, такие как миникарты, русификатор интерфейса. физика камня, а также полное управление персонажем без посторонней помощи, вы сможете увидеть только в Half-Life. \nВысокая сложность, связанная с незнанием юзером физики и биомеханики - это один из проблемных моментов в игре. Помимо этого, в Half-Life присутствует многопользовательский мультиплеер.\nВ один прекрасный день мой отец принёс домой диск с игрой, который он приобрёл так в называемом бесплатном супермаркете. Я и сейчас помню тот восторг, который я испытал. сев за компьютер. Я тогда очень много времени проводил за ним, сидя перед экраном монитора и смотря в глаза своему отражению в стекле. В 2002 году жизнь моя сильно изменилась: я вышел на пенсию, семья развалилась.
