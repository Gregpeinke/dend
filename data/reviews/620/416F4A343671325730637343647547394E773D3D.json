Here goes nothing, and I hope you rate this up. If you already know a thing or two or hate reading, visit my Pros and Cons section as it helped many customers decide if this game is right for them!\n-------------------------------\n[b]Intro[/b]\nYou know how when you are on vacation and say, \"I am so glad it isn't winter right now.\"? Yeah, that sums up the power this game has on you. When you play the game, it is so...crisp (Vacation-like) and when you have to leave, it is like that miserable winter I was talking about.\n-------------------------------\n[b]Summary:[/b]\nThis game, as you should know from some other reviews and through the fact that it is one of the best selling games of all time, leaves an effect on the player. It is a beautiful story-line. You play as a female test subject through the campaign. She (I won't spoil her name) is forced through many tests GLaDOS (a powerful robot who took over Aperture) has prepared for her. You learn a lot about this character as you portal around puzzles of rooms, and a lot is learned about yourself. The programmed-to-be \"idiot\" (whom you will find out through the game) is something to look out for as you think he is helping you escape. It is a clever twist. You will learn that the industry you are escaping from used to be a shower curtain/part factory. Yeah, It will all make sense when you play. \n-------------------------------\n[b]Multi-Player[/b]\nThen there is the multi-player mode with Atlas and P-body who are trying to free the humans or whatever. That itself (with a partner) is totally worth a lot of Friday nights. Now that they are implementing items/load-outs into the game (or hats/taunts/clothes/flags to those who are uncertain of the term), the game will be more interesting. Now, I may not have many hours, but I assure you that I have beaten multi-player in about 4 hours, and the single player in 3. I mean, the rest of my hours come from exploring more/community maps. And that is the amazing thing about this game...no matter how many times you have beaten it, it is still fun. Also playing multi-player with a different friend every time makes you find a lot out about their creativity/teamwork/leadership/mental abilities.\n-------------------------------\n[b]Other important things[/b]\nThe many achievements with variety are also something to look on about. There are many things you will NEVER notice no matter how many times you play unless you YouTube some of it. The deeper you dig into the story-line, the more interesting you find the game. There were many rumors that we are still uncertain of, which makes this excellent.\n\nTo dumb it down:\n-------------------------------\n[u][b]Pros[/b][/u]\n+Amazing graphics for a non-stop beautiful game-play. \n+Wonderful audio and music for a great experience. \n+Well-designed maps and challenges. \n+Unlimited maps (user-created). \n+Fantastic story-line. \n+Many users own this game. (Lol I remember the commercials). \n+Holiday sales make buying this game super affordable.\n+Gender neutral.\n[u][b]++Helps with cognitive brain activity[/b][/u].\n-------------------------------\n[u][b]Cons[/b][/u]\n-Limited story-line (I wish there was more to it, but there is always Portal 1). \n-Some levels take seconds while others take many minutes. (Not really progressive difficulty wise in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing here [spoiler]to me[/spoiler].)\n-Limited campaign exploration. (Some repetitive looking levels here and there.) \n-Restricted to the short story line. (However, there are some mods which are amazing, but if you want more, you have to manually download them instead of them being included with the game.)\n-------------------------------\n[b]My opinionated review[/b]\nI would say the cons are so minor that I shouldn't even have mentioned them because it may not make you buy the game. DO NOT let that happen. Get this game. I recommend buying during a sale to get Portal 1 and 2 for a cheap price together for the full experience (because they raised the price of this game recently). This is a classic game and will go down in history as one of the best - revolutionizing the way we think/game. It was such an amazing thought that I hope you guys consider for yourselves.\n-------------------------------\n[b]Rating[/b]\nOut of 100, there is nothing wrong with this game. You may not like it if you aren't creative, don't have friends to play it with, or can't appreciate an amazing \"Portal transportation\" concept. But listen, you will fall in love with this game and stack hours to it. There is no community to worry about other than wonderfully made maps from users like you. Definitely get this game if you don't have it - that being said, my review shouldn't even matter. I would give this a [spoiler]97/100[/spoiler] after all of that. I hope you read everything before looking at my rating.\n-------------------------------\n[b]Finally[/b]\nThanks so much for reading, so I hope you share the love and rate this review up, as it took some thought to make. If you are still wondering whether you should get the game or not...well it always will be a must-have, and YES! Get it!\n~thedubmark\n(I write reviews now :))","timestamp_created":1424592159,"timestamp_updated":1593180411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":342,"votes_funny":56,"weighted_vote_score":"0.933791577816009521","comment_count":42,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14590041","author":{"steamid":"76561198090159525","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1424585852},"language":"schinese","review":"买了很多，这个游戏 值得买！","timestamp_created":1424590540,"timestamp_updated":1424590540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14589566","author":{"steamid":"76561198086808027","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":512,"last_played":1437694971},"language":"english","review":"19.99 could be a bit steep for a short game like this.

Я соглашусь со всеми людьми, написавшими положительные отзывы и добавлю в вашу копилку умиления Portal 2 свою маленькую историю. Может быть кому-то она поможет. \nМоя девушка не большая любительница компьютерных игр, но я решил, что Portal ей понравится и дал поиграть на своём компьютере. Результат превзошел все ожидания, я даже жалел иной раз, что показ ей эту игру, потому что больше времени за компом стала проводить она. Обе части она прошла и была весьма довольна. Даже самооценка поднялась от удовлетворения при успешном решении сложных испытаний ГЛэДОС и Уитли. И всё было хорошо... Но спустя некоторое время, по причинам, не связанным с компьютерными играми, наши отношения разладились... Мы перестали понимать друг друга, всё время ругались, наши интересы разошлись и кроме ругани мы уже не видили никаких точек соприкосновения. И вот однажды я подумал, а что, если мы попробуем поиграть в Portal 2 вместе? Один раз эта игра нас сблизила, может поможет и теперь? Мы создали второй аккаунт в стиме, купили ещё один Portal 2 и стали играть... Господи, ни один психолог в этом мире не сделал бы для нас то, что сделала эта игра! Я хочу выразить огромную благодарность всем, кто причастен к её созданию. После совсемстного прохождения кооперативных уровней мы научились понимать друг друга без слов. И не только в игре, но и в жизни. Через месяц мы сделали себе татуировки с роботами, а в мае у нас тематическая свадьба, где мы будем в костюмах роботов и с портальными пушками. Многие считают нас сумасшедшими, но мы любим друг друга и любим эту игру. Когда у нас будут дети, девочку мы назовём Челл, а сынишку - Уитли. Ещё раз огромное спасибо всем, кто приложил руку к созданию Portal 2, вы - лучшие.","timestamp_created":1424423287,"timestamp_updated":1424423287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14556596","author":{"steamid":"76561198175559425","num_games_owned":411,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":4403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1029,"last_played":1638094833},"language":"english","review":"why cant they add glados and wheatley GLAdos and defctive turrets why not please add that in the next update :(\n","timestamp_created":1424422797,"timestamp_updated":1424422797,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14556490","author":{"steamid":"76561198138049620","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2394,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1438,"last_played":1650697044},"language":"english","review":"Just good game.
