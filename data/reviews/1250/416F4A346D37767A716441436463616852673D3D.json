Shortly after I decided to buy the game for obvious reasons. \n\nI've been revisiting the game for pretty much every holiday update toghether with my friends and I've always had an amazing time. I've never taken the game too serious and always kept it at a casual level. But lately, since none of my casual friends play it anymore, I decided to take it up a notch and actually learn about the game and its mecanichs. And for the first time I suddenly realized why some people have up to 3-4k hours in this game.\n\nThere's a whole world of techniques and setups you can use to clear a level, the complexity of this game is beyond of what you can see at a first glance. Of course it doesn't have the skill cap of a game like, let's say CS:GO, but it's not as far behind as some people may think.\n\nI've played this game nonstop these couple days and I will keep going for a while, and hopefully get more knowledge about the game so I can take down the Suicidal/Hell on Earth difficulties on a more frequent notice.\n\nAn absolutely amazing game, which I hope will keep getting updates sometime after Killing Floor 2 is out of early access, because it certinaly deserves to live on.","timestamp_created":1446314583,"timestamp_updated":1446314788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18794924","author":{"steamid":"76561198120143088","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":160,"last_played":1631441977},"language":"english","review":"awesome shooting game\nand i like this game\n","timestamp_created":1446306741,"timestamp_updated":1446306741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481481492519378662","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18794656","author":{"steamid":"76561198129897122","num_games_owned":391,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":1399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":655,"last_played":1535278547},"language":"english","review":"This game is awesome,recommended this game to everyone","timestamp_created":1446305915,"timestamp_updated":1446305915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18793013","author":{"steamid":"76561198014789247","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3800,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3763,"last_played":1419519853},"language":"koreana","review":"혼자했을떄는 재밋는지 잘몰랐는데 친구들이랑 하니까 재밌더군요..","timestamp_created":1446301499,"timestamp_updated":1446301499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18790893","author":{"steamid":"76561198135502484","num_games_owned":305,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":679,"last_played":1466561757},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito Bom !!","timestamp_created":1446295366,"timestamp_updated":1446295366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18790243","author":{"steamid":"76561198060872489","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":4270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3581,"last_played":1654021147},"language":"brazilian","review":"MUITO LEGAL É PRA QUEM GOSTA DE JOGO DE MUTAÇAO E ARMAS E TAMBÉM TEM DLCS DE ARMAS E ROUPAS","timestamp_created":1446293270,"timestamp_updated":1446293270,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18788505","author":{"steamid":"76561198152814947","num_games_owned":391,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":794,"last_played":1510408188},"language":"russian","review":"10/10!","timestamp_created":1446287384,"timestamp_updated":1446287384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18784428","author":{"steamid":"76561198054766153","num_games_owned":933,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":2061,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1782,"last_played":1513840056},"language":"english","review":"Edit: After playing this game for an extended amount of time, my opinion has not changed from the impressions I describe below. For a game to have such good first impressions and keep up those impressions definitely says something.\n\nI'm writing this review after my first session of the game. While I've only played for 3 hours at the time of this review, I gotta say this game feels amazing. One of my friends and I have been wanting to check this game out for a while and got it on sale. We had played Left 4 Dead 2 a bunch and while that game has an undying charm, we wanted something a little fresh. So after jumping into this game, my first impressions are how satisfying it feels to shoot the guns (mainly due to recoil and other such effects), how satisfying it feels when you get a headshot, how the presentation is more visually pleasing (more noticable gore than in Left 4 Dead), and how you start out with minimal weapons (just a 9mm and a knife) and you get better weapons the better you do. This gives a more pleasing motivation and advancement than hitting a switch to get in an elevator and fighting 50,000 enemies just to get to the next destination. Also, I played this game on a low-end laptop that usually lags during a co-op game of Left 4 Dead, especially when there is a horde of enemies. But Killing Floor has so much more going on visually with the enemy animations and the gore and yet even playing with 6 people I got very little lag. So this game is easy on performance while giving a very satisfactory presentation. In just one 3 hour gaming session, I think I might like this game even more than Left 4 Dead itself. Maybe. Though I suppose they have very different objectives. This game was well worth picking up on a sale, and heck, it would be totally worth buying at the full price of $20 in my opinion, though with Killing Floor 2 out now, I suspect most of the Killing Floor community will move on to the sequel. But since I'm playing with friends, that doesn't really lower the value to me personally. In conclusion: this is one of the best feeling shooters I've ever played and I highly recommend it.","timestamp_created":1446270003,"timestamp_updated":1452448066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18783853","author":{"steamid":"76561198075179850","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":38932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1716,"last_played":1611461453},"language":"spanish","review":"Para ser un juego del 2009 el motor grafic es genial, no le encuentro bugs, tiene gran cantidad de armas, en el modo multiplayer es verdaderamente brutal y alocado, me encanta  sin lugar a duda  lo recomiendo lo unico q note es que no tiene una historia pero cuando sobran los mutantes y las balas no importa.

Granting several rewards as you go, such as damage resistances, speed and carry weight bonuses, etc. Your typical RPG affair.\n\nAdmittedly the levelling system is a massive grind for some classes, commando was a notorious pain due to excessive target goals, but this does appear to have been addressed by the developers since I first bought the game. This is obviously good for new players. I just thought it bared mentioning the last level or two are exponentially tougher to get if you care about that kind of thing.\n\nThe game continues to be updated, for free, with maps, skins and guns; which is fantastic. Servers are almost always friendly and welcome mature players who like a drink and casual play. This is often even so far as mentioned in the server MOTD's. I consider this game to have been the single best entertainment investment i have ever made, granted i purchased it in a sale for about £3.50 the amount of hours i have gotten out of it for those pennies speaks for itself.\n\nThe simpleness just works, the querky Brit sound bites are classic (and even refreshing as a 20 something British gamer); and even though the game is getting on and it's sequal is in early access now it still has a strong community and is satisfying to play.\n\nA brilliant, simple, arcade like \"zombie\" horde mode FPS that if anything is convinient to have around for the fact it is so easy to pick up and put down at one's leisure (one can customise server browser filters including preferences to game lengths of 4, 7 and 10 waves)).\n\n10/10 in the context of its age and niche.
