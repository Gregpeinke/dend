Ce jeu est la définition même de ce à quoi un jeu vidéo doit aspirer, d'un point de vue créatif : enseigner au joueur sans un seul mot.\"\n\nMais il faut bien le dire : Portal 2 n'est pas qu'un digne successeur, il fait passer le premier pour une demo tant le jeu décuple de qualités.\n\nLa première fois que vous essaierez Portal, vous n'aurez pas simplement affaire à une expérience vidéoludique différente. Valve a une manière de faire le jeu vidéo assez carrée, ce sont de véritables techniciens du jeu vidéo. Promouvoir un moteur physique à travers un jeu, réutiliser régulièrement les mêmes interfaces et assets... L'optimisation de leur travail se ressent énormément au travers de leurs jeux. Mais Portal 2 est différent. Portal 2 est le jeu le plus artistique que Valve ait pu créer.\n\nVous vous réveillez dans un logement bien plus confortable que dans le 1, puis vous entendez une voix vous apprenant à contrôler votre personnage. On vous demandera de retourner dans votre lit et puis... Vous vous réveillez à nouveau en vous rendant compte que des milliers d'années ont passées.\n\nLe scénario du jeu restera cryptique tout du long, bien qu'il soit raconté plus directement dans le 2. Cela ne vous empêchera pas de devoir refaire le jeu afin de mieux comprendre certaines choses de ce scénario qui est pour le coup, vraiment poussé.\n\nLe gameplay de Portal est évidemment l'intérêt principal du jeu et se base sur un principe très simple : vous passez un portail, vous ressortez par l'autre. S'ajoute à ça différentes règles et mécaniques que vous apprendrez au cours du jeu, comme par exemple le fait de passer très vite à travers un portail vous permettant de ressortir très vite, et donc de vous propulser vers une plateforme inaccessible.\n\nCe deuxième opus décuple ce gameplay puisqu'il rajoute un système de gels (vous découvrirez à quel point c'est génial), des cubes permettant de dévier les lasers, des ondes vous faisant flotter dans une direction, des propulseurs... Bref, en plus d'avoir enrichi le gameplay, ils ont aussi réussi à le dynamiser à travers plus de mouvements, de réflexes et de précision.\n\nCe jeu apporte une bande-son extrêmement maîtrisée comparé au premier, la musique colle très bien avec le thème du jeu et arrive à parfaitement contribuer à l'ambiance. Néanmoins, la musique des crédits de fin, bien qu'elle soit excellente, ne détrône pas la cultissime \"Still Alive\".\n\nLes graphismes du jeu n'ont rien de bien extraordinaire, bien que le moteur soit âgé, ça reste tout à fait moderne, même plusieurs années après. La direction artistique est réussie, les animations sont très détaillées et bien mieux travaillées.\n\nPortal 2 explose sa durée de vie à travers deux principales nouveautés : le mode coopération, où Valve a créé de véritables puzzles étant réalisables seulement à deux joueurs, et le mode créatif où vous aurez la possibilité de créer vos propres puzzles. Vous pouvez très bien jouer aux puzzles postés par des créatifs sur le workshop.\n\nIl n'y a presque rien à reprocher à ce jeu. Original, pacifiste, drôle, difficulté équilibrée, rejouabilité presque infinie, l'antagoniste GLaDOS extrêmement bien écrite... Valve nous propose une autre manière de voir le genre du jeu de puzzle.\n\nPortal 2 est, d'un point de vue objectif, beaucoup mieux que l'original, et proche de la perfection. Ce jeu réunit tout le savoir-faire des scénaristes de Valve, tout ce savoir-faire que l'on a pu voir dans Left 4 Dead, Half-Life, Team Fortress... Le jeu a un équilibre incroyable entre les différents piliers d'un jeu vidéo : Scénario, gameplay, musique, rejouabilité... Rien ne flanche. Il existe une harmonie entre le technicien et l'artiste dans ce jeu.\n\nPortal est un modèle, Portal 2 est une redéfinition du jeu vidéo.","timestamp_created":1520393961,"timestamp_updated":1520393961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40621336","author":{"steamid":"76561198068244497","num_games_owned":308,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":25379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17790,"last_played":1553824709},"language":"english","review":"If you don't own this game by now just buy it already.

Keep that in mind when buying it. This adds some nice graphics and some very creative mechanics which could have interacted to create some mind blowingly complicated puzzles. Although, the key phrase is \"could have.\" This was the most disappointing aspect of the game as they have introduced mechanics such as lasers, some sort of light pathways, friction and gravity modifying liquids along with the portals but largely failed to combine all these to their full potential.\n\nMost generally, puzzles may involve a few of these new mechanics individually until you reach an objective and i found myself spending more time looking for the ONE tiny half hidden spot where you need to place a portal rather than solving complicated puzzles. There is just so much wasted potential.

There more turrets, more Cake (not really), potatoes, birds, and mods that you can download for reletively low cost. (I suggest Portal Stories Mel, and Apeture Tag) which are amazing as well. The game looks amazing, there are some cinematic cutscenes, some cores (what you pulled off of GLaDOS last game.
