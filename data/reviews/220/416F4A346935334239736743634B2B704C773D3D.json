He eludes the Combine forces and meets Alyx and Barney,and joins the Lambda Resistance.  He gets to Dr. Kleiner's lab and assists them in attempting to get a teleporter to teleport him and Alyx to Dr. Eli Vance's lab. The teleportation fails,and he goes through City 17 on foot to get to Eli's lab.  He arrives at Black Mesa East and meets up with Eli, where he is captured and taken to a combine prison,Nova Prospekt.  Gordon goes through a zombie infested town named Ravenholm and is given a Dune Buggy,which he uses to travel to Nova Prospekt.  Eli,Alyx,and Gordon escape,the combine teleporter they used exploding in the process.  Gordon and Alyx learn they were in a \"slow teleport\"during which a week has passed. In their absence,the Resistance mobilized against the combine, turning City 17 into a battleground.  Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel,with Gordon,aided by Barney and D0g,goes to the Citadel.  He gets caught in a Combine\"confiscation chamber\",which destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun,the energy enhancing it's capabilities and turning it into a superior weapon.  He is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office,where he is holding Eli and Alyx captive.  Breen explains his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine.  Breen tries to escape through a portal,but Gordon destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen is annihilated in the resulting explosion,but just before Gordon and Alyx get killed,time is frozen,and the G-Man appears,praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel,and puts Gordon back into stasis.  \n\nThe characters are pretty cool,even if some of the characters can tend to be annoying*looks at Barney*\n\nThe music is pretty cool,tho the game mostly relies on ambiance.\n\nThe weapons are pretty good,just really your standard FPS weapons,except the Gravity Gun is added,which lets you move almost any object at will.

Лучший шутер, в который я играл (хотя я не очень люблю шутеры)! Вот вы видели игру, которая может предложить отличные экшн, сюжет, геймплей, головоломки и физику??? Думаю, кроме Half-Life  таких мало. В общем, жаль, что нету GOTY. Но еще раз скажу, это-лучший шутер всех времен и народов.","timestamp_created":1413056593,"timestamp_updated":1413056593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12450348","author":{"steamid":"76561198121806082","num_games_owned":768,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1264,"last_played":1604272986},"language":"english","review":"I would recommend this because, I found it very interesting...

Die Umsetzung von Steam in VR hat mich schon sehr überzeugt. Man muss es sich vorstellen als wenn man den Big-Picture Mode vor sich als Leinwand hat. Dort funktioniert das Headtracking zu 100% und man kann dann bei HL2 (nach einer einmaligen Konfiguration) als Virtuel Reality Mode starten.\nDas Menü selber unterscheidet sich nicht von dem \"normalen\" Modus aber sobald man im Spiel drin ist wird man von vielen Unterschieden und neuen Eindrücken \"geflashed\".\n\nDas Intro ist wie gewohnt, mich hat es am Anfang aber leicht verwirrt da der 3D Effekt (Sogar richtig gutes 3D...) im \"Intro\" (wo der G-Man redet) meine Augen zuerst überfordert hat.\nSobald man dann selber \"Hand\" anlegt und im Zug rumläuft, beziehungsweise aussteigt, merkt man die ersten richtigen Unterschiede...\nDie kleinen Roboter die einen Fotografieren kommen in 3D noch besser rüber und dank der Intuitiven Steuerung hat man wirklich das Gefühl das man gerade am Bahnhof steht und von ihnen \"geblitzdingst\" wurde :P\n\nDie ersten paar Minuten ist man manchmal leicht verwirrt (so war es bei mir und einigen Freunden die zum testen da waren) und man hat ein komisches Gefühl  was sich aber schell wieder legt sobald man sich etwas an die neue Optik gewöhnt hat.\n\nJetzt die größten Besonderheiten (für mich) in VR:\n- Headcrabs:\nLamarr... Gott verdammt habe ich mich verjagt und intuitiv die Hände vors Gesicht gehalten als mich Dr. Kleiners Headcrab angesprungen hat...\n\n- Springen und Fenster\nEs ist ein total geniales (bzw reales) Gefühl wenn man, zum Beispiel, aus einem Fenster klettert während man auf der Flucht vor den Combine ist. Beim ersten Sprung aus einem Fenster habe ich gezögert da ich nach unten blickte und es als zu hoch empfand... (Es ist schwer dieses \"Gefühl\" zu beschreiben)\n\n- Kämpfen\nDas kämpfen ist auch aufgrund der Steuerung viel Intensiver geworden.\nMan steuert mit der Maus nur noch die Waffe in seinem Sichtfeld und das Blickfeld wird komplett von der Ocolus per headtracking bestimmt...\nDank diesem System hat man ein sehr gutes Aiming/Gefühl und verliert sich dank Headtracking umso mehr in dem Spiel...\n\n- Der erste Barnacle\nJa diese Dinger die an der Decke hängen und Chillen bis man ins \"Seil\" läuft...\nIch war so abgelenkt von dem Spiel und meinen Achievements (die auch in 3D angezeigt werden :P ) das ich in den ersten direkt reingelaufen bin. Als ich hochgezogen wurde, war ich total verwirrt bis ich nach oben guckte und panisch die Crowbar schwang... Hört sich total unspektakulär an, in dem Augenblick ging mir aber richtig die \"Pumpe\" :D\n\nEs wäre viel zu viel jetzt alle möglichen Situationen aufzuschreiben die mich überrascht oder derbe beeindruckt haben.\nDeshalb möchte ich das Review jetzt hier grob zusammenfassen bzw verkürzen :)\n\nHL2 VR:\n\nPro:\n- 3D\n- Gute intuitive Steuerung <3\n- Easy to start (ist bei VR derzeitig nicht unbedingt gegeben)\n- Sehr beeindruckendes Spielgefühl\n- Headcrabs\n- Jump-\"Rätsel\"\n\nContra:\n- leichtes Motion Sickness am Anfang (Meistens Gewöhnungssache, deshalb sollte man es unbedingt testen)\n\n\n12/10 Ego-Shooter (+2 for VR)","timestamp_created":1412935079,"timestamp_updated":1412945604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.658256947994232178","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12432099","author":{"steamid":"76561198021794512","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":2105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":850,"last_played":1639033314},"language":"english","review":"10/10\nIt's ok\n-IGN","timestamp_created":1412924301,"timestamp_updated":1412924301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12431669","author":{"steamid":"76561198071220218","num_games_owned":875,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":2148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":974,"last_played":1628957423},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente juego y espectacular si hablamos de la fecha de lanzamiento de este juego, vale cada centavo. \nGabe cabrón, ya anuncia el half life 3.","timestamp_created":1412920299,"timestamp_updated":1413341875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473997831344604492","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12429992","author":{"steamid":"76561198034246419","num_games_owned":552,"num_reviews":92,"playtime_forever":1652,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1652,"last_played":1412042234},"language":"english","review":"Though a bit of a dated experience now in terms of FPS titles... this is a landmark puzzle game with plenty of FPS action for those looking for a good experience.","timestamp_created":1412904821,"timestamp_updated":1412904821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12426448","author":{"steamid":"76561198134034597","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":85,"last_played":1427798605},"language":"russian","review":"Супер игра.
