TOP TIP PLAY THE EXPANSION PACKS. JUST FANTASTIC.\n\nI have been a fan of the bioshock games for a number of years and have played most of them on consloes and pc alike. Bioshock infinate on the PC is simply amazing, The graphics are beautiful and seemless, the gamplay is flowing and the combat is exciting.

Эта игра - свежий глоток в игровой индустрии, прорыв. Новый Bioshock вызывает такой же восторг, как после просмотра таких шедевров как: \"Аватар\" Джеймса Кэмерона, трилогия Бэтмена Кристофера Нолана, \"Властелин колец\" Питера Джексона... И не сравнить с другой видеоигрой. Прошлые две одноименные части ни как не связаны с третьей по счету игрой.\n\nС первых минут игры мне не хотелось сразу же начинать первую миссию, перестрелять всех злодеев и поскорее добраться до титров. Моё внимание привлекло окружение, я хотел исследовать его, любоваться пейзажами. Показалось на миг, что и сюжет не важен, в принципе. Но это не так. По мимо красивого, живого мира в игре, сюжет так же великолепен. Предстоит играть за детектива Букера ДеВитта, которому за вознаграждение предлагают спасти девушку по имени Элизабет, которая обладает сверхъестественными способностями. Вместе они должны выбраться из Колумбии - высокотехнологического города расположенного высоко над облаками.\nГеймлей ни чуть не изменился. В арсенале имеются огнестрельное оружие, крючья для ближнего боя и те самые способности вылетающие из рук. Можно поджигать противника, подбрасывать в воздух, бить током, натравлять стаю ворон и т. д. Только теперь чтобы обрести эти способности, не нужно колоть себя шприцем, а достаточно выпить определенный элексир.\n\nВ итоге, Я просто не представляю какие эмоции будут после полного прохождения игры, если после Девяти часов вызывает такой восторг, но знаю точно - будет круто. Покупайте лицензию, чтобы следующая игра была подобной или ещё шикарней!\nВсем приятной игры!\n\nМоя оценка:10 из 5","timestamp_created":1415558505,"timestamp_updated":1542980284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525215744972229004","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12864267","author":{"steamid":"76561198159322216","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":943,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":641,"last_played":1416772533},"language":"english","review":"I have to review this game in 2 different ways:\n\n\"Technical\" point of view: a quite decent FPS, with some exploration.

No es tan genial como ponen las reviews pero está entretenido. Tiene unos graficazos que combinados con el estilo artístico no dejan de sorprender. Las voces en español son muy respetables (la música tiene bastante menos protagonismo que en Bioshocks anteriores).\n\nLos controles son algo extraños, aunque nunca ha sido una saga que se juegue \"bien\". Le falta fluidez y velocidad al movimiento, las acciones tienen bastante lag. Aún así, es más un juego de exploración que de tiros.\n\nPor desgracia, la ambientación es bastante mas fantástica y ligera, sin los momentos tétricos que tenía el primero. Es un juego más de historia grandiosa que de pequeñas historias que den coherencia al mundo. Y el final es bastante paja mental tipo Perdidos (que conste que a mí me gustan este tipo de historias) pero le pega poco al juego y no la desarrollan hasta la última hora.\n\nMención especial al personaje de Elizabeth que te acompaña: fantástica animación e interacción contextual con el entorno y ayuda a mejorar el juego desde que aparece.\n\n¿Recomendación?

It's just full of detail and backstory and references, it's simply brilliant. Then we have the mechanics of the game itself. The attention to detail is huge, the world is expansive, and there are two things in paticular that stand out:\n\n- In this game, compared to the first two, there is alot less going through menus and working on powerups, it's alot more streamlined and you barely notice it as you go through the game.\n\n- While they replaced 'Plasmids' with 'Vigor' (They are the same thing, effectively), there is alot more options for you to explore with the new system, and the fact that you can switch them at a moment's notice is an added bonus.\n\nOne thing I could say for an improvement to this game, is that if there was more free-roaming available to you in the game. It's a very linear game, and I can understand why, but I sometimes felt a bit restricted in what has the potential to be one of the greatest ever video game worlds. \n\nCompared to the previous two games (Which I played on console, not PC), I would say this game is a definite improvement, and the switch from the the underwater city of Rapture to the floating city of Columbia is effective, I feel, and to be honest, I didn't really like the whole 'underwater city' in the first two games.

I love the game and it holds a special place in my jagged exterior that people call my heart. I will remember the journey this game took me on.

They will take you by the hand and deliever you to somewhere else and new. \n\nNow here comes my recommendation it is a good game. A Great Game even. It came out during 2013 which in my opinion was a very slow year. AS 2012 had some of the best games of all time. It was a great suprise. I would definately recommend getting this game during a sale also buy the DLC for more entertainment and more of a direct link to the first game Bioshock.\n\nHaving finished the game, I can proudly say that it was a great game, but the problems are there. Mostly rapid FPS drops even on Geforce 770. To Random Sound problems. \n\nThe game is polished but it lacks certain things. Aside from that you will enjoy it! Most definately and beware of the cage.","timestamp_created":1415387078,"timestamp_updated":1415387078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12832204","author":{"steamid":"76561198055900109","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":677,"last_played":1415375992},"language":"russian","review":" На мой взгляд это прекрастная игра, в ней замечательно все : и графон, и гемплей и особенно сюжет. \nИстория рассказанная игрой навсегда останеться в моём сердце, когда я прошёл её я растроился , растроился не из-за событий в игре  , а потому что закончилась история, одна из лучших ,виденных мною.\nБольше не будет Букера, Элизабет , их приключений - все история закончилась , продолжения не будет.

И так, начнем. Ну и  по традиции все считать моим ИМХО, с которым вы вполне можете не согласиться)\nОна прелестна! \n1)В нем красивая, приятная глазу графика!\n2) Уникальная боевка, аналогов мною не замечено (первый биошок не предлагать)\n3)Невероятный!... даже не так Великолепный, опять не то... я просто не знаю как охарактеризовать столь глубокий и насыщенный сюжет, как невероятными поворотами так и деталями, которые порой трудно разглядеть. \n\n   О сюжете можно говорить очень долго ибо BioShock Infinite подобен прекрасной женщине в которой есть загадка и она не спешит ее раскрывать, предлагая почву для размышлений и воображения.) А последние 10 минут игры вызывают стоячие овации.\n\n    Подводя вывод для тех кто еще не приобщился к числу посвященных, ВЫ обязаны ее пройти тем более что вот-вот выйдет полное издание с русской озвучкой и погружаться в сюжет станет еще комфортней не отвлекаясь от игрового процесса.\n\n    Что же касается дополнений \"Морской могилы\" или \"Погребенных в море\", кому как удобней, то у меня нет однозначного мнения на этот счет, они(их 2 эпизода) сильно отличаются от оригинального BioShock Infinite и я не могу это объяснить не проспойлерив сюжета...\n(ВНИМАНИЕ! МНОГО СПОЙЛЕРОВ!)\nНу а для тех кого они не пугают продолжаем)\n\n   Начнем с того что они явно сделаны не так качественно как основная игра, сюжет несколько хромает... а спавнящиеся враги немного раздражают. И если в оригинальной игре возвращение в Восторг расценивалось как дань фанатам серии, для ностальгии, была и уверенность что сие действие проходит где то в середине 1 части на что намекает отсутствие энергетика в автомате, опущенная батисфера(с ней вроде тож какая то интересная особенность, вроде не каждый ее запустить может), ну и на заднем плане умирает Большой папочка, а рядом стоит одна из сестричек. То  дополнения вызывают когнитивный диссонанс с потерей понимания времени происходящих событий (в втором дополнении мы проезжаем на лифте мимо Букера с Лизи застрявших в лифте), а концовка прямым текстом намекает на предстоящие события 1 части... У героев проблемы с мотивацией, попытки сюжета ответить на некоторые вопросы, генерируют вокруг себя еще больше...Как желание связать любой ценой Колумбию с Восторгом.\n\n   О концовке дополнения как заключительном аккорде трилогии хочется сказать отдельно, я ею разочарован...она не рвет шаблон как концовка оригинальной части, не может похвастаться эпичностью как и хепиэндом, как первая часть трилогии и в каком то смысле в третьей...Она трогательная и мрачная, но совсем не то чего ожидаешь от жирной точки в конце истории. Хотя чего уж там таить, мне просто искренни жалко Элизабет...(Хотя возможно это коварный план Левина)))) Хотя и она сама вызывает у меня недоумение и ряд вопросов. Как и странное совпадении цифр в коде от маяка и на доске у близнецов когда нам предлагают кинуть монетку. Так и странные метаморфозы с брошью на шее у Элизабет в конце оригинальной игры, она то становиться противоположной то вообще исчезает) Не перестаю удивляться творению Левина с его командой Оригинальная часть Инфиниты вышла шедевральной)\n\nВообщем если для кого-то \"слишком много букф\", то игра шедевр и ее срАчнА нада купить и поиграть! А дополнения, по мнению афтора не торт, но к ознакомлению желательны)\n Всем всего!

That is just my reccomendation.\n\nNow the gameplay is not so much, it gets a bit boring and tedious after a while and the gun selection isnt big and in some bits you will struggle with ammo, the gun play feels alot like early 2000 shooters except instead of having a huge range of weapons in your inventory now you can only have two. ofcourse gears and vigors enhance it a bit but not much in the case of gears and vigors relly on salt which runs out really easy an isnt always easy to get.\n\nso in total, if you are not too worries about the gameplay it is a good game and all in all is fun to play, i would reccomend this.\n\nScore: not giving any since i dont believe in the score shit.","timestamp_created":1415304510,"timestamp_updated":1415304510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12819754","author":{"steamid":"76561198151267103","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":721,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":721,"last_played":1415389509},"language":"english","review":"10/10.

Давным давно ему было поручено найти девочку Элизабет, которую похитили еще совсем крошкой и увезли в Колумбию. То есть можно было сказать, что она без вести пропала... Но незадолго до начала игры парящий город вдруг снова дал о себе знать . Выяснив местонахождение снижающегося города, Букер отправился туда, чтобы закончить давнее дело о пропавшей девочке. Правда, сейчас, в 1912 году, она стала уже девушкой. И будет активно помогать нам спасать ее... и заодно и нас.\n  Причина похищения пока неизвестна, но наверника будет связана с необычными способностями девушки.Эти же способности и помогут нам выкарабкиваться из различных неприятных ситуаций. То есть мы будем грубой силой, а Элизабет будет нашей поддержкой, которая в свою очередь будет вскрывать нам замки и материализовать объеты из прошлых времен.\n Сколько, я не старался найти недостатки, но их нет. Умный искусственый интеллект, ничего не скажешь про них. Приходиться часто менять тактику против *ИИ*. Графика качественно вылизанная как у кота яйца, очень яркая и сочная. Сразу видо, что разработчик старался над своим проектом.\n   Если вы не играли BioShock Infinite рекомендую поиграть в неё.
