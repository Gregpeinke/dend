In the original series the army kills the scientists and go after Gordon Freeman, but the game does not give the reason why. You get knocked in the first minutes and aimlessly go until you see that the army is leaving the Black Mesa Lab and you hear the classic \"Forget about Freeman\" line but from the other side as the game leaves you with more questions. I think this game should have been the game where you get some answers as you play as the \"Opposing force\" and give a different face and meaning to the \"bad guys who you shoot on sight\" from original Half Life.\n\n There is a few new mechanics like soldiers with professions etc. So it is an upgrade from the main game and Blue Shift.\n\n But for a Half Life game?, you don't have to play this game to get the Half Life experience.

It adds more weapons, mechanics, and good level design. Every part of the game has been improved upon, that being said there is one major problem,\nEverything in this game is pointless, sure it fleshes out the story a bit but no new weapons ever return, nor do any new enemies. For as fun as this game is it will forever be a footnote to the first game and that's a shame because it's really fun.\nThough a lot more feels pointless than the entire game. For example you get the sniper and then immediatly head underground for the rest of the game. Why give players the sniper when after the first fight it is in it will never be used again? I feel that way with a lot of the new weapons, it's a lot of nothingness that you will only use when you run out of ammo, which was never an issue for me. If you liked Half Life then you will like this game and they are commonly sold together (i know i got them in a bundle). If you are coming from Black Mesa though this game may be a bit of an odd one for you. \nHonestly, it's probably my favorite half life game but it will always be overshadowed by the main series.

The game? Yes. Is it worth 5 bucks? Maybe. Is it better than Half Life 1? Defintely not.\n\nI knew that this was originally a DLC, and that it isn't supposed to be long, but 8 hours? This doesn't even reflect the actual time it takes to play this (I am pretty slow when it comes to FPS games, and I also had to load my saves a lot).\nThis game gives you a new perspective, you are now playing as the \"meanie\", the one sent to massacre Black Mesa and kill Freeman. I like this new perspective and find it a good addition to the lore of the franchise. \n\nYou get new weapons and new enemies (which are challenging, I have to admit). The weapons are really cool and useful (Also, you get 3 new Alien buddies instead of just one like in the base game).\nMy favorite part of the game was the first boss, the Pit Worm, mainly because it was just one long puzzle. Yeah I am aware that it's a straight copy of the Tentacles from the main game, but who cares. It made me use my brain.\n\nOther than the fact that it's short, the only thing that made this such a letdown was the ending. Not the cool Gman cutscene, but the final boss. It took me more than an hour to beat a 15 minute boss, mainly because my rockets went through the boss instead of actually hitting it, which made me think that I needed to target other parts of the boss's body instead of the parts that actually take damage. The boss was so boring that I thought that I still had 8 more hours ahead of me, And I was so disappointed when I saw the Gman appearing in front of me and the credits starting to roll by.\n\nOverall, it was a fun revisit to the Half Life world, but it was just hyped too much.

It tells the story of the military sent to clean the alien threat from Black Mesa while eliminating any witnesses. You are Adrian Shephard and you don't actually take part in the \"eliminating witnesses\" part. Instead, you are a badass soldier who is very much like Gordon Freeman, a one man army with a wopping selection of weapons to choose from. You gain more than Gordon does and each one is creative to a degree and somewhat helpful to traversing the terrain or unleashing hell.\n\nThe story is simple, as described, but like Blue Shift, your actions interlock with Gordon's as he is causing chaos around Black mesa. You always seem behind him, but eventually move onto a different path as another bunch of alien races interfere with a war between the US military and Black Mesa itself. There's less of a horror side to this expansion, as you feel more like Marcus Fenix, feeling almost bulletproof. It's a blast playing as this soldier, there's so many more enemies to blow away and more varied ways to eliminate them. Overall though, it's more Half-Life with some great additions, even if it can feel a bit much at times.\n\nThat's a lie. This game ramps up in difficulty at some point. The new aliens are there to push you against a corner and the Black Op soldiers punish your ammo. You'll see less standard, recognisable enemies. They are nothing to your arsenal. The difficulty is welcome at times but other times the AI is too quick to react to your movement and they will fire first when you turn a corner. \n\nBesides that, the only other negative I have is how there's less dialogue. You don't have scientists telling you what's happening or what you're meant to be doing at times. I got stuck in an elevator shaft with hanging sparking wires indicating danger. I didn't know I had to climb the safe rope to get higher as I saw a welcoming path at a lower level and so there I spent a while walking in circles wondering where to go next. Who would think a rope would be climbable in a Half-Life game, especially when it looks just like the sparking wires next to it.\n\nBut yes, this game is great and offers a good side story with about 3 hours worth of gameplay if you take it slow.
