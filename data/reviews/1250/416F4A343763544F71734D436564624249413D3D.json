It also has a LOT of different maps to play as well as different difficulty levels to choose from. Killing Floor has well over 250 achievements to get, with about half of them being map based. So if your playing a map say, called Forgotten, you can play that Forgotten map on Normal for an achievement, then, on Hard for an achievement as well as Suicidal and Hell of Earth diffculties for achievements. Alot of achievements in the game ! The Character perks can be slow going, but its up to you to find a map that is easy to master and spam that map over and over to get your Characters up as fast as you want. Some are easy to do, others are slow and painful. You can set up a listening server and have up to 5 friends join your server. This will increase the amount of enemies that come at you, and having a strategy to ensure everyone lives all 10 waves, plus the last wave, the Boss wave. Killing Floor goes on Sale A LOT and you can get the Killing Floor Bundle for 1/2 to 3/4 off. \n\nI bought the Killing Floor bundle on sale for $24.99 and its worth the price. It has just enough DLC and maps in there to make it worth the purchase. I used to play just MW3, and this game gives me a break from the long hours of MW3. The typical Killing floor game lasts from 30 minutes up to maybe 1.5 hours if you choose 10 waves and depends on the difficulty level you choose. \n\nDo yourself a favor after purchasing this game and play it on beginner, solo. You can customize your settings making it easier to remember them all. There are a TON of settings. Set the important ones (especially quick heal) and leave the rest alone.\n\nOverall, I am near/over 120 hours on this game, and its still pretty fun. I have maxxed out a few of the seven perks/characters to level 6 (level 6 is max) and it was a challenge for sure. Some level 6 characters will allow you to spwan in with a weapon and/or carry lot more weight so your weapon selection can do you wonders. The level 6 Medic, Support Specialist and the Firebug on level 6 spawn in with decent stuff. The others I am still working on.\n\nOverall, not too bad a game. The only quirks I have about the gane is that the Listening server doesnt allow you to set a MAX PING, or easily kick problem players. They should allow for IP tracking, latency, and IP blocking for seurity and fair gameplay. \n\nIf your looking for a Classic style old-school game that requires a lot of heads up, keep moving action, and has strategies like running to the TRADER to sell weapons that U have found/picked up before the last zombie dies, and then run to cover and come up with a plan of defense for 160+ zombies of different sizes versus 4-5 players, its a hoot, especially on hard, suicidal and hell on earth settings. I enjoy the game, and the duration of each game is just about right. I think you will enjoy Killing Floor as well !","timestamp_created":1388961143,"timestamp_updated":1388961143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8581493","author":{"steamid":"76561198045967415","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1977,"last_played":1529289714},"language":"english","review":"Killing floor is fun and has so much replayability","timestamp_created":1388960390,"timestamp_updated":1388960390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500567495822906494","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8580928","author":{"steamid":"76561198051729174","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":12087,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10954,"last_played":1413530486},"language":"russian","review":"дикая смесь адового yжаса и феерического веселья!","timestamp_created":1388958349,"timestamp_updated":1388958349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496069371700286865","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8580706","author":{"steamid":"76561198070011746","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":23703,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17196,"last_played":1450808445},"language":"russian","review":"рекомендую игру всем кто ценит в игре не графическую составляющую а геймплей.","timestamp_created":1388957584,"timestamp_updated":1388957584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8580375","author":{"steamid":"76561198075445603","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2811,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2504,"last_played":1423184840},"language":"english","review":"This game is very very very very very very addicting make sure you dont have anything to do for the day before you buy it.","timestamp_created":1388956344,"timestamp_updated":1388956344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8579976","author":{"steamid":"76561198069498552","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1495,"last_played":1499719026},"language":"french","review":"je conseille tres bon jeux de zombie","timestamp_created":1388954951,"timestamp_updated":1388954951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8579186","author":{"steamid":"76561198042625652","num_games_owned":438,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":1036,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":520,"last_played":1431755353},"language":"english","review":"Amazingly addicting if you have friends to play with.

However in recent times Killing Floor has been slipping, with weapon DLC being the biggest issue and the fact that the competition has been improving.\n\nHowever with that being said, I'd still reccommend Killing Floor as the co-op zombie game to get. The graphics, whilst not beautiful, suffice in the task at hand. A lot of weapons feel meaty with the crossbow being my particular favourite, watching heads get taken off with that thing fills me with glee. The plentiful selection of maps provide good variety and the varied enemies means it has a lot of replayability. Surviving a tough round makes my brain reward me with endorphins and the game rewarding me with LODS OF EMONE. The character DLC is a mixed bag, some of its worth it and some of it isn't. It can take a bit of trial and error to pick one worth the dosh.\n\nGo on, give yourself a treat and purchase Killing Floor but be sure to make sure your friends have it.","timestamp_created":1388946915,"timestamp_updated":1388946915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8577275","author":{"steamid":"76561198036025577","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":861,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":137,"last_played":1422988703},"language":"swedish","review":"fuck shit up så de så","timestamp_created":1388945500,"timestamp_updated":1388945500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8575788","author":{"steamid":"76561198073639748","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7061,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2600,"last_played":1541452236},"language":"german","review":"voll geil","timestamp_created":1388940425,"timestamp_updated":1388940425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8575773","author":{"steamid":"76561198087710400","num_games_owned":520,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1478207958},"language":"russian","review":"Жалкий клон L4D для нищих, никогда не покупайте это дерьмо.","timestamp_created":1388940353,"timestamp_updated":1388940353,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471747875213623047","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8574454","author":{"steamid":"76561198085582977","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10050,"last_played":1588336719},"language":"thai","review":"นุก","timestamp_created":1388935262,"timestamp_updated":1388935262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8571872","author":{"steamid":"76561197993915165","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":394,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":387,"last_played":1394125457},"language":"french","review":"Formidable jeux de horde, des mecanique de jeux très basique mais ce retours au source (steam..ahah!) cher au dev' fait du bien ! 8/10 pour moi","timestamp_created":1388924795,"timestamp_updated":1388924795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8571109","author":{"steamid":"76561198074083070","num_games_owned":881,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":45370,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22656,"last_played":1558735048},"language":"hungarian","review":"Aki szereti a coop partykat és nem veti meg a zombi mutáns hentet annak tudom ajánlani ezt a játékot nekem bejön a stílusa mégha  sokszor vonaglik is a játékmenet és monotonná sikerül, de ez sokszor függ a csapatmunkától is ... ;)","timestamp_created":1388921563,"timestamp_updated":1388921563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472517728805541992","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8570948","author":{"steamid":"76561198109206904","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204,"last_played":1417599603},"language":"russian","review":"d","timestamp_created":1388920859,"timestamp_updated":1388920859,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494055479764938354","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8570250","author":{"steamid":"76561198085143523","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2412,"last_played":1476400473},"language":"russian","review":"on't buy this game.

though each wave of blood-soaked carnage with the end goal of killing the end boss the Patriarch and hopefully getting everyone through alive.\n\n Gameplay is really punishing, this is not COD you cannot run off, chasing after that fleshpound without your team backing you up the rambo approch is not recommended or you will find youself quickly outnumbered.\n The guns act and behave rather realisticly and are all well balanced gameplay wise, even the starting m92fs beretta is really soild and can pop the weaker enemies heads with ease.\n\nThe classes are cool as well the sharpshooter for instance is more adept at using rifles and pistols while the berserker has an affinity for melee weapons  and the support specializes in shotguns, certain classes are more adept at killing the bigger foes while some are more crowd control, this brings a really cool team based aspect to the online multiplayer where the sharpshooters must protect the medic so he can heal the rest of the team and so on.\n\nThe music is epic for an fps game as i feel it really sets the tone and style of the game all the while enhancing the brutal combat as you mercyilesly dismember and decapitate hordes of bloodcrazed abomitations  its mostly comprised of metal and i really do wish more fps games had a metal ost epic!\n\nBut alas for all of it awsome things it does right there are a few lil imperfections here and there mostly in the voice acting,its not that the delivery of the lines are not bad nothing that makes me cringe anyway but i do feel that they couldve had the actors do a few
