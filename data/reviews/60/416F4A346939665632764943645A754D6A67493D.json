Valve's very worst game. There are plenty of their games that I don't like all that much, but this is a game that's so bad it just has zero people playing it. Ever. I can't believe that this is still being sold for £3.99, let alone the \"mostly positive\" review summary. Maybe it's meant in the way that people are mostly positive that Ricochet is a pile of donkey crap! \nIt's a unique idea for sure. The maps have this bizarre fever dream atmosphere, like you're trapped in limbo jumping across these giant discs for eternity. It might've been fun twenty years ago. MIGHT HAVE. There's not even any bots to play with. But hey, at least you can... create your own server... and uh, pretend to play with people using your imagination. That's about as fun as Ricochet is.

But I was dead wrong.\n\nThe game ricochet is a grand masterpiece with the likes of the original Half-Life and Half-Life 2. My dream for this game is to see a source port be officially made by Valve one day, and have esports teams form around it.\n\nWhen I first played Ricochet, I noticed that the player's control of jumping was removed. I later figured out that it was because on the jump pads at the edges of the platforms in the map were what moved the player vertically. In my opinion that is such a great game mechanic because it gives less worry to the player about dodging the projectiles from other players. There are games like Team Fortress 2 where you must try to dodge almost every single bullet, but with ricochet, I must add that it is impossible to aim vertically, but only horizontally. In a single server, there could be on each platform a different 1v1, where each player has to fight it out between each other, and no one else can interfere. The name of the game, \"Ricochet\", comes from another one of the game mechanics where the discs you throw can bounce off of walls. You can use this game mechanic to use with a little bit of skill like playing a game of pool to hit an enemy player across the map. I think that this game should have much more maps available from the developers themselves, and the community. I would also like to see a \"Competitive\" gamemode added to the game so that pros like myself could duel it out to see who is the best Ricochet player alive.\n\nThat is, me and some Brazilian guy, the only 2 people who ever play this game.","timestamp_created":1593114152,"timestamp_updated":1616892312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502297103404998779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71159385","author":{"steamid":"76561198438268213","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1632540643},"language":"english","review":"this game is amazing, but the thing is, it's dead as hell.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game too many times, or play nearly as long as some of you. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you\n","timestamp_created":1592368869,"timestamp_updated":1624240055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70803893","author":{"steamid":"76561198064689660","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":51,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31,"last_played":1592180413},"language":"english","review":"this helped me overcome by long-lasting depression","timestamp_created":1592180259,"timestamp_updated":1592180259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i9fV2vICdZuMjgI="}
