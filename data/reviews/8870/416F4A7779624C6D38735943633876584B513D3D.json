Infinite is a competent shooter with alright gunplay enhanced by the ability to use \"magic\" abilities to best your foes. Overall play is clean and fast, though the \"rinse and repeat\" nature of the gameplay will become clear very quickly. If you liked the gameplay in BioShock 1 and 2, you can expect more of the same here.\n\nThe gameplay offers nothing new or world-changing. BioShock 1 and 2 have most of the combat elements down pat and there is a very cool \"rail\" feature whereby the player character can zip along suspended rails throughout the game's floating city. It is a really fun mechanic, though if you've played Metroid Prime 3, you will find this mechanic lacking.\n\nLooking at the whole product, the story seems to be what the developers wanted the main focus to be. And this puts the game back on its heels, in my opinion. The story is alright but it's standard fare for time-travel/dimensional travel stories and rapidly begins to wobble under the weight of its many convoluted (and sometimes poorly explained) threads.\n\nOverall I can recommend this game to fans of BioShock and fans of First Person Shooters. If you're looking for a non-linear experience that rewards the player for exploration, look elsewhere. This game exemplifies the qualities of many modern first person shooters, which is neither good or bad. It simply is, and if you like those types of mechanics you're going to love BioShock Infinite.","timestamp_created":1404068880,"timestamp_updated":1404068880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10949958","author":{"steamid":"76561198061593724","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":357,"last_played":1396034138},"language":"russian","review":"Игра представляет собой коридорные уровни где вы убиваете, от силы, 10 разновидностей врагов в различных комбинациях.

O Enredo é super bem bolado, e apesar de não ser o meu jogo favorito da série, vale a pena jogar. Acho que o unico ponto negativo aqui, em minha opinião, é que Bioshock perdeu um pouco do clima sinistro que o confinamento em Rapture proporcionava.

It's likely one of the most visually stunning games I've had the chance to play and it's certainly not its only forte. The plot is, in my humble opinion, exceptionally well written and how much you relate with the characters makes this a very emotionally involving gaming experience. I bought the game and both its prequels without a second thought, knowing it's definitely worth the money.\nI found the gameplay quite adaptable and smooth. Controls are fairly easy and the instructions throughout the game were helpful and done in a less-annoying way. My only complaint with the controls was the speed of which the camera moved. At times it felt somewhat dizzying but I think it might be due to my inexperience with first person shooting games since I am generally used to third person cameras. \nThe game has a spectacular soundtrack from songs we all know and grew up with to some fantastically composed original pieces. I found the instillment of the tracks with their respective scenes very well-done; it spoke directly to emotions. \nThere were some incredible plot twist; some of which I've seen coming and some, I had no idea about. All in all, it's nice to be surprised about a story you've involved yourself with. \nDespite the closedown of Irrational Games, I am hoping the franchise will continue because I certainly would like to experience more of Bioshock.","timestamp_created":1404065990,"timestamp_updated":1404065990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10948295","author":{"steamid":"76561198078725896","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":652,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":652,"last_played":1404064274},"language":"english","review":"Had to read the explanation of the ending on the wiki after beating the game.\n10/10 would play again.","timestamp_created":1404065857,"timestamp_updated":1404083450,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10948268","author":{"steamid":"76561198115600796","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":986,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":398,"last_played":1416023467},"language":"spanish","review":"Entretenido, satisfactorio, asi de simple!","timestamp_created":1404065810,"timestamp_updated":1404065810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10947635","author":{"steamid":"76561198024527245","num_games_owned":350,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1406523359},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game.","timestamp_created":1404064604,"timestamp_updated":1404064604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10947548","author":{"steamid":"76561198076459407","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1273,"last_played":1479273675},"language":"english","review":"dat everything tho","timestamp_created":1404064441,"timestamp_updated":1404064441,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10946730","author":{"steamid":"76561198096049976","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":100,"last_played":1416744722},"language":"russian","review":"10\\10","timestamp_created":1404062949,"timestamp_updated":1404062949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50113379955291748","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10946719","author":{"steamid":"76561198081412087","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":546,"last_played":1425309816},"language":"english","review":"Wow!

I could go on for hours about the disappointments and shortcomings of both Infinite's story and gameplay, but for those looking for a quick review:\n\nCons: \n\n-Plot that starts out solid and then becomes overly tangled and changes focus unsatisfyingly\n-Combat gameplay that, while not bad on its own, has taken a *huge* step back from the previous installments, and that I would describe as 'fun, but mediocre'.\n-Amazing setting and fascinating enemies that the game completely avoids ever explaining or focusing on in any detail. Many characters and enemies have great potential for interest but then fall flat. Never did I think I could be so disinterested in the city of Columbia itself, too.\n-Childish and borderline offensive attempts at tackling important issues of race and class\n-Every character is modeled very consistently with the environment except for Elizabeth who inexplicably has a gigantic melon head, teeny tiny waist with no room for internal organs, big baby anime eyes, and a wonderfully cozy looking push-up bodice.\n\nPros:\n-The game is gorgeous, indisputably. Almost worth playing just for the visuals alone. Fantastic design and attention to detail was clearly used in creating the city... but that just makes it more disappointing when no one talks about it.\n-Voice acting is fantastic, as is the soundtrack.\n-Gameplay is pretty solid, if not terribly innovative. Traveling by Sky-hook is certainly invigorating and a fresh take on quick traveling, although not super helpful in combat.\n-Elizabeth follows you through a large chunk of the game but doesn't get in the way. In many ways she's a help rather than a hindrance, and I was glad to have her around most of the time.\n-The first chunk of the game is incredibly fun, and everything up to and including helping Elizabeth escape her tower (sans the infamous baseball scene) is a blast.\n\nAll in all, I don't recommend this game to my friends and tend to be vocal about my dislike for this game and how it was handled, but I also admit I have a lot of biases. I was very excited, for YEARS, for this game, but once I hit a certain point I realized how I wasn't enjoying it as much as I'd hoped... and then the flaws only stood out more and more. In the end, I think anyone buying this looking for a fun shooter in an interesting environment won't be disappointed. It's definitely fun, just not particularly deep or innovative, as much as Irrational and Ken Levine would like you to believe.","timestamp_created":1404011386,"timestamp_updated":1404011386,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512897908687591553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwybLm8sYCc8vXKQ=="}
