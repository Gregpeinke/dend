The gameplay is fantastic appart from a couple of sequences with vehicles which I seem to be the only one to have disliked, the scenario is not perfectly knit, but it remains immersive and if everything is not explained your brain should fill in the holes easily. I have greatly enjoyed this game and I recommend it to anyone who did not try it, you should get sucked in until you finish it, the willing sensation of disbelief is strong in this one.","timestamp_created":1409496473,"timestamp_updated":1409496473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11934338","author":{"steamid":"76561198063712067","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":609,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":609,"last_played":1417218605},"language":"english","review":"Why are you looking a the reviews?","timestamp_created":1409489813,"timestamp_updated":1470084110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11934299","author":{"steamid":"76561198073492048","num_games_owned":291,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1466715729},"language":"english","review":"if you haven't played Half Life 2 your life is not complete","timestamp_created":1409489581,"timestamp_updated":1409489581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11930187","author":{"steamid":"76561198105988269","num_games_owned":954,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":2072,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1762,"last_played":1579696260},"language":"english","review":"WHERE IS HL3?????
