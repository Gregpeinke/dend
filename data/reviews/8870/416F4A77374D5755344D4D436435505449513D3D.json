Nearly all of my friends and other people I spoke to who had played this game enjoyed it and the game was critically reviewed well, so I may be a bit alone here. I thought this game took a pretty big step backward in overall game design and pacing compared to the previous Bioshocks. There were large chunks of this game where I did nothing but shoot enemies, then there were large chunks where the game decided it wanted to tell a story for a while and just guided me around Columbia. But the chunks weren’t mixed in throughout the game. They were just…chunks. It also took out the excellent level design that I loved from the first two games where upon entering a new area, you had to be aware of your surroundings and the enemies you were fighting and use the appropriate plasmids to lay traps and what not. Infinite mostly just had large open areas filled with enemies that you had to kill with… whatever. Again and again and again. \n\nI didn’t think Columbia had the charm, atmosphere and polish that Rapture did so well in the earlier games either. I also experienced some balancing issues with this game. I pretty much had my character maxed out in everything about halfway into the game and was mowing down anything in my way without much thought or effort. \n\nThere’s so much more this game could have done with mixing up gameplay/artwork/music with their parallel dimensions theme too. A lot of lost potential. To its credit, the ending of this game was pretty cool though.\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","timestamp_created":1390614102,"timestamp_updated":1394536860,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8835698","author":{"steamid":"76561198081759257","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":905,"last_played":1421352420},"language":"english","review":"Possably the greatest game and game series of this generation....

Weapon selection and approach to combat can be great diversified depending on the gear you wear and items you choose to upgrade. \n\nFantastic game. 100% recommended.","timestamp_created":1390608026,"timestamp_updated":1390608026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8835359","author":{"steamid":"76561198075821868","num_games_owned":487,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":261,"last_played":1605668986},"language":"english","review":"Elizabeth","timestamp_created":1390607110,"timestamp_updated":1390607110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":151,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574482083320617676","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8835267","author":{"steamid":"76561197980935185","num_games_owned":591,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7885,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1120,"last_played":1532310668},"language":"english","review":"Awesome Game.... amazing scenery and story line","timestamp_created":1390606394,"timestamp_updated":1390606394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8835241","author":{"steamid":"76561198068316854","num_games_owned":396,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":466,"last_played":1571083732},"language":"english","review":"Bonnerific!","timestamp_created":1390606260,"timestamp_updated":1390606260,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8834939","author":{"steamid":"76561198047031240","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":5454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3188,"last_played":1404196328},"language":"spanish","review":"El mejor juego del 2013 para mi.","timestamp_created":1390604265,"timestamp_updated":1390604265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8834540","author":{"steamid":"76561197998645623","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":961,"last_played":1406500550},"language":"german","review":"Göttliche Grafik und spannende Geschichte.

The AI is terrible, most of the weapons and vigors are horribly underwhelming or otherwise useless and the game just fails so hard at trying to be an RPG in addition to a shooter.\n\nStill though, despite it's ridiculous amount of blatant plot holes it actually manages to have a decent story, albeit one that hides behind a thin veil of false complexity by simply trying to confuse the player as much as possible up until the end with it's alternate universe nonsense.

Первая половина игры реально напоминала аттракцион. В хорошем смысле этого слова: замечал за собой, что постоянно вжимаюсь в диван - как будто я на американских горках, а не перед монитором. И дело не в \"покатушках\" по рельсам - они как раз больше раздражали, чем радовали. Происходящее на экране первые 6-8 часов действительно захватывает.\n\nПосле середины игры сценаристы стали вплетать приёмы, с помощью которых можно было бы объяснить вообще всё что угодно. Это нечестно, так как убивает на корню любую интригу - как ни выстраивай сюжет, всё равно выход есть и очевидно каким он будет. Неудивительно, что в Голливуде зарубили экранизацию - в сущности, кроме действительно интересной альтернативной вселенной, у BioShock Infinite ничего нет.\n\nКак FPS игра откровенно посредственная: типов врагов мало - берут количеством, поездки по рельсам в процессе битвы добавляют мельтешения и ощущения аттракциона, но по сути только отвлекают. Именно по этим причинам вторая половина Infinite прошла для меня достаточно скучно, несмотря на все виды (а виды тут шикарные).\n\nНо именно из-за первой половины игры её и можно порекомендовать.

Well, in the theme of constants and variables, it was | had been. \nBioshock Infinite is the type of game that you live through rather than play through. It's the experience. You could go even farther, and say that it's an average shooter with little strategy involved (compared to the firs Bioshock for example), and no survival urgency. All that doesn't hurt the title much because the story is THAT good. I'm not exaggerating by calling it one of the best games I've ever played, comparing the thrills and gut wrenching to the likes of the Metal Gear Solid and chosen Final Fantasy games. It has a very smart plot and makes you want to play the game a second time through with even more attention to EVERY SINGLE WORD or IMAGE you perceive. Add to this the brilliant voice acting duo of Troy Baker And Courtnee Draper Cover, and amazing art design of Columbia, and you have yourself a winner. \nThere are different types of gamers that demand different things out of games. I must imagine that a lot of people didn't have the patience for a game with a long narrative introduction, and parts of it happening for example on a sunny carefree beach with music and people dancing. But those that got caught up in the magic never regretted it.\nThe Bioshock series shows us humanity at it's best and worst, sometimes even in the same single character.

It is a little bothersome with the whole only 2 weapon slots meaning you only really specialize into two guns that you choose early on and hold on to the whole game. But, the best part was most definitely the ending. It still sticks with me and I beat it almost two weeks ago. I also love how it doesn't feel like an escort quest due to Elizabeth's actual helpfulness and enjoyable character. She seems more like an actual person than just a wailing, troublesome lump of flesh that gets in your line of fire and whines about it. I like seeing how she develops from this innocent, fresh-faced girl to a more hardened woman as she progresses through the game and faces the realities of the world around her. 9.3/10 for annoying ending final fight holdout area and restraint of gun slots.","timestamp_created":1390507147,"timestamp_updated":1390507147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8821511","author":{"steamid":"76561198113997459","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":832,"last_played":1528728436},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite has one of the strongest and most imaginative stories I've come across.
