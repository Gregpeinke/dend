Excetuando-se pelos gráficos não tão modernos, o que não faz diferença alguma em um jogo tão incrível e interativo como esse. Acho muito superior a jogos como Battlefield e Call of Duty ou até mesmo Halo que é da mesma categoria de FPS com ficção cientifica. Tudo porquê Half Life consegue criar uma campanha ótima e história muito interessante, o que leva muitos jogadores a ficarem fascinados com as conspirações e teorias que envolvem o cenário.\nÉ a segunda vez que zero a saga completa, do Half Life 1 ao Hl2 ep 2 e posso dizer que faria tudo de novo. Resolvi jogar da segunda vez pois achei que o Half Life 3 teria sido lançado até que eu terminasse: ilusão. Estou aqui frustrado com esse jogo maravilhoso que não teve ainda sua sequencia final.

delle piu belle serie di giochi che conosco,la grafica e' molto bella e gli effetti della fisica ancora meglio nonostante non sia uno degli ultimi motori di gioco.Non richiede un pc di ultima generazione ,dicamo medio per girare bene:con il mio i7 870 e scheda grafica gtx 460 e 8 giga di memoria faccio 200 fps nel test.Quello che mi e' sempre piaciuto sono i vari enigmi che incontrerete per accedere a certe aree e l'aspetto umano che da al giocatore la sensazione di avere a che fare con persone vere con tutte le loro emozioni .Provate a puntare in faccia la pila alla bella Alyx e

to say, this is a good continuation from the Half-Life 2 plotline in what happening in the after match and hopefully the reason was Half-Life 3 has still not been released, so much plotline to explore!
