It streamlines a great deal of what people loved about the original Bioshock and once again delivers an incredible world with a fresh take on the classic hero saga.\n\nThe gunplay and abilities remain mostly unchanged - with similar upgrades and play-style balances that allow you to traverse the landscape in a manner of your choosing. The game seems a bit more linear than the first, which I don't mind quite as much as others. I appreciate a game that's a bit more directed than ones that leave you to your own devices.\n\nFor me though, the biggest draw is the story and the characters. Between exception sequences of cinematic livelihood and character exposition iks a game that really feels like you are in the middle of something so much bigger than yourself.  Even though the game is more linear and highly scripted in certain areas, the character immersion is there, making you feel that you have agency in how the game will conclude, even if the scope of actual changes are rather limited.\n\nThis game is incredible, from the level design and the incredible world of Columbia down to the characters, weapons, combat, and voice acting. Every facet of this game is truly a work of art, and the ending is so intricately planned that it will quite literally leave you speechless!","timestamp_created":1388133724,"timestamp_updated":1520365719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8327876","author":{"steamid":"76561198031155029","num_games_owned":527,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2012,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2012,"last_played":1387450651},"language":"english","review":"Fun game, however it is very short without the DLCs.

Having just finished the formulaic Max Agony 7, I saw the plot twist from a mile off. You'd have to be Neil Kinnock to not see that Max was really a bald guy all along. So with that in mind here is Beushock Unlimited, the 4th installment in the Screwing Dante series. I've always been a fan of Ken Lemon's work, so I was eager to pick this copy up and play it, with no interruptions. You play as Dimwitt Brooks, a loan shark with limited brain function but a heart of gold. His 401k has been depleted by the dreaded Space Clocks, in an attempt to make the last 20 years of his life somewhat uncomfortable. Initially, I didn't know what to make of the plot, but then again I had doubts about the plot of Beushock Toxic when Mr. Lemon said it was going to be a remake of a reboot of the 2nd game; but we all know how that turned out, so I thought I'd at least hear him out on this one. As Brooks progresses through the game he gains his 401k back in installments, giving him powers called Randymids. This gives him the ability of being able to better invest his capital. Without giving away the ending, he gets his money back and lives happily ever after. So what did I think of the game? Well, it's hard to evaulate this as a game really. I'd say it's more like a work of arse. However, if someone put a gun to my head and told me to replay Max Agony 7, I'd  immediately give it three shattered pelvises out of femur.","timestamp_created":1388128485,"timestamp_updated":1388128485,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.437062084674835205","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8326360","author":{"steamid":"76561198042204521","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":502,"last_played":1604728501},"language":"english","review":"I recommend every bioshock game.

I wish the capacities would have been a bit bigger - I was a decent shot, but found myself constantly having Elizabeth throwing ammo at me. The guns themselves were very similar, ugly, and mostly limited in their power. The only gun that stood out to me was the revolver. The game itself is worth it - especially if you can catch it on sale.","timestamp_created":1388124185,"timestamp_updated":1388124185,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8325224","author":{"steamid":"76561197963519651","num_games_owned":383,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1215,"last_played":1482962692},"language":"english","review":"I'm not normally one to jump on major bandwagons. I usually assume triple A titles don't deserve the hype. I thought HL2 was overrated. I didn't finish the first bioshock, not because it wasn't a very good game, but because I got bored with it after a while. The difference between Bioshock and Infiinte is that it sucked me in from the beginning moment and gave a phenomenal storyline and set pieces until the end. I never thought that I would be okay quitting the game without being able to save, but it turns out I did because I genuinely wanted to replay parts of it. I can't say enough about how great the story is, but I'll try. As the narrative unfolds and the characters develop they deal with deeper and richer themes. What's great is how these themes interact with each other and feed the chaos until you reach the end.\n\nTL; DR - This is better than Deus Ex 1 - gasp, I know.","timestamp_created":1388123889,"timestamp_updated":1388123889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53947371244430542","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8324669","author":{"steamid":"76561198054515032","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":275,"last_played":1400637407},"language":"english","review":"This game is absolutly amazing!

The game itself was a visual treat and though I'm an athiest, the heavy themes of religion and even race were so impactful for me so as to simply show that even utopia has its flaws.\n\nThe gameplay—specifically in regards to the vigors (spells)—is in my opinion way more smoother here than in the previous bioshocks. Mechanics in this game actually make you want to set up traps using a variety of vigors since pretty much any spell can become one a trigger-type trap. Furthermore, I felt that weapons depleted at a reasonable rate so as to motivate players to pick up and use other weapons, unlike in Bioshock 2 where my rivet gun was almost always full on ammo. Note also that the player can only hold 2 weapons at any given time in this game too.\n\nThe truly unique and most memorable part of this game for me was Booker's companion, Elizabeth. You will never complain about her combat abilites because she doesn't partake in it directly. In a way you will never even really notice that she is with you at times in combat, yet she aids in conjuring up cover and finding resources for you. In fact you will be thanking her when she hands you that extra coin she had just found which allows you to buy an upgrade that you previously didn't have enough for, or throwing you a health pack when you are just about to die. She is truly a gem of an AI and character in general; it even felt for the first half of the game like I was playing along with a Disney Princess. I mean come on, she even dances and sings in the game along with the fact that she looks like one!\n\nGet this game, it is awesome.

Your enjoyment of this game will hinge largely on your ability to suspend your disbelieve and to not think too much about the mechanics or interactions of/with the game world. Hopefully you also have a very strong believe that “it’s about the journey, not the destination” (which I can’t explain further because of spoilers). This game wants you to think about its ending and the impactions ONLY, and not too much about the game itself.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly average, competent but not engaging. Gunplay feels very limited despite the large selection of guns due to the player’s inability to hold more than 2 guns at a time and limited resources mean that you’ll only get to upgrade certain weapons. The fun of using vigors wear thin after a while and combat just becomes a chore as you mow down waves of enemies to get to the next plot point. The Skylines are the only fun mechanic in the game but isn’t prevalent enough to make a significant difference to the overall combat experience. Overall, gameplay doesn’t feel quite satisfying enough to justify a recommendation. It’s not terrible, but since combat is the only gameplay mechanic other than savaging for resources, its mediocrity is pretty detrimental to the overall experience of the game.\n\nThe story is smart and complex but suffers from pacing issues. Most of the plot bookends the game, sandwiching several hours of boring filler where little to nothing of consequence occurs. And although the game’s twist is lauded by many to be the best in recent memory, it’s honestly not that surprising when you discover the game’s themes, nor is it very unique or unexpected for a sci-fi fantasy plot. The game is also very linear, where you basically follow the plot railroad from point to point. There is little consequence to any of your actions or choices in the game and the player has absolutely no influence on the plot.\nOverall the story had very little impact on me, and even though there were several emotional moments near the end of the game, the story ultimately feels meaningless and empty, neither happy or sad, nor triumphant or disappointing. It’s still a very smart story but fails to connect with me on any emotional level.\n\nThe game’s environments are beautiful and striking, but since the same can be said about most AAA titles nowadays, so such praise is entirely superfluous and entirely dependent on the player. It’s neither the most aesthetically impressive nor the most technically impressive game I’ve seen.\n\nUltimately, I feel that the game is an interesting thought exercise packaged in a fairly mediocre game.

Blew my mind!\n\nBioshock Infinite takes the gaming to a whole new level of design, taking you back to the mid 20th century, with a bit of Tainted Love and other musical sounds of the times! Even though it doesn't look anything like the city at the bottom of the ocean (Rapture), it has a lot to do with it, not only through the design of things but also through the storyline! And with the exceptional turn of events, it blows your mind completly and at the same time amaze you.\nThis also may prove a point about many things in, at least, our reality! How many are there really?\nIt gives life to that one theory from one of the brightest minds in the planet. Stephen Hawking.\nThis game is very unique, not by it's design and gameplay but also it's storyline. It is so refined with theories besides the main one.\n\nNow I'm being honest about this review. This is basically one of my favorite games of all time. \nIt might not have the most sensational gameplay when fighting people, but it still is what I payed for.\nDamn it is even more than I was expecting honestly.\nAnd I wouldn't be writing this review if it wasn't true. Trust me\nI've been a Bioshock fan since the first came out. Yea, the game of it's year.\nBut when the second bioshock came out, it teared a bit of my heart. It was really poor from my perspective, not what I wanted to see ( apart from seeing a big daddy's perspective ).\nI can say I got revived by Infinite, and it was, for sure, one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nSo if you are considering buying this game, you are a fan of Bioshock 1 but you are still not sure because the second one was a BIG disapointment, seriously: buy it. Worth even more than it's current price. Also buy the season pass. Besides saving $, you get 2 dlcs that twist your mind even more. And that is also where you go insane.","timestamp_created":1388106041,"timestamp_updated":1634571194,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626244604587554932","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8318887","author":{"steamid":"76561198047125712","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1027,"last_played":1421984851},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is an amazing game and i recommend it to any person especially one that is looking to play a game for its story!

I had my 7.1 Surround headset on and simply got lost for two days straight, this game really pulled me in.","timestamp_created":1388089919,"timestamp_updated":1388089919,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8312271","author":{"steamid":"76561198051780192","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":666,"last_played":1469390754},"language":"german","review":"k","timestamp_created":1388089775,"timestamp_updated":1388089775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8312161","author":{"steamid":"76561198000201101","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1044,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1006,"last_played":1388672738},"language":"french","review":"Digne sucésseur des épisodes précédents !","timestamp_created":1388089533,"timestamp_updated":1388089533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524383604526519775","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8311672","author":{"steamid":"76561198000415283","num_games_owned":744,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":370,"last_played":1559321732},"language":"hungarian","review":"Szerintem az év egyik legjobbja lett.","timestamp_created":1388088507,"timestamp_updated":1388088507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8311669","author":{"steamid":"76561198027936245","num_games_owned":405,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":90,"last_played":1415737409},"language":"english","review":"I might be the last person to play this game, but it was great.
