I don't know a thing about it. I wouldn't be able to advise you on expert tips, like the Crossbow has a 7.8x multiplier for headshots, or the Scrake is resistant to explosives, but vulnerable to the Katana. I don't even know what a Scrake is, or that he has a chainsaw for an arm. All I can tell you, is that anyone who has played this for 700+ hours, must be a psychopath, who obviously enjoys killing zombies way too much. I would be wary of such people, unless of course you have a penchant for similiar activities. If that is the case, you will enjoy this game ...... or at least, that is what I have been told, because I wouldn't know?\n\n\n[u][b]November 2015 Addendum:[/b][/u]\nNow that I have reached 9999.9 hours, what label could be used to describe me, if a [i]\"psychopath\"[/i] is only 700+ hours?\n\nMalcolm Gladwell has eminently suggested, 10000 hours of practice is necessary to [i]'master'[/i] a pursuit. Throughout the 6 years of playing Killing Floor, I have observed my performance improve steadily.  When I reached the 4k hour mark, I felt I was becoming one of the better players in the game.  At 6k hours, I expected my performance to plateau, but every 1000 hours thereafter, I still noted refinement in my style and I was surprised by this. After 9k hours, I was completing tasks that I couldn't imagine possible, even after the fact.  Players were questioning if I could die.  Even I began to wonder, but after testing with a couple of grenades: yep, I can still die!\n\nWith 6 more minutes of gameplay, I should acknowledge Mr Gladwell's theory, with a quote from another Darth and say [i]\"the circle is now complete .... now I am the master\"[/i]!  A noble mentor, such as Obi Wan Kenobi, would ponder the effect of Killing Floor and comeback with [i]\"only a master of evil, Darth\"[/i].  Perhaps that is what someone should be called, if they have 10000 hours of Killing Floor gameplay; a [b]\"master of evil\"[/b]!  I should go with Obi's wisdom and save my soul.   I should NOT play that final six minutes!  [i]The circle is not complete! You have failed Tripwire Interactive, I (still) am a 'noob-i'![/i]\n\n\n[u][b]November 2017 Addendum:[/b][/u]\nTwenty four months after last playing Killing Floor, I thought I'd reminisce and have a little fun.  Why not play that final six minutes and become the game's [b]\"master of evil\"[/b]?  I thought to myself; [i]\"it is my destiny\"[/i]!\n\nWhile browsing online matches, I noticed a few servers used mutators that allowed unlimited ammo, health and armor that regenerated .... What!?  There were enough of these that I wondered why. Could they actually be whitelisted (i.e. exploit servers)?  I had hoped Tripwire Interactive would never do this, but have they now?  To confirm, I killed some stalkers with a Bullpup and my stats were retained after I left the server; these mutators were indeed whitelisted!  I was horrified, but not surprised, because Killing Floor is just money to Tripwire (the company was sold by the original creator years ago) and they have no pride in software that's been purchased by everyone already.  I feel they sabotaged KF, so that players would be more inclined to try the sequel (KF2), which many have told me is a disappointment.\n\nI could only find one legitimate higher difficulty server in the whole world; a Suicidal game with a ping of 400!  I held my own, but I felt unsure what to do.  It was my muscle memory that covered for me and I was able to contribute to the win despite feeling lost.  The Patriarch was '[i]locked[/i]' by me with a ping of 400; it felt ridiculous and strange!  It was an uncomfortable experience, watching your body play, while your conscious mind spectates.  Afterwards, I played on a local server on Hard.  Someone actually recognised me here, but I didn't know who they were.  I found the game boring and after completing the next wave I left.\n\nMy brief reminisce is not to say I think Killing Floor is awful; it is still a remarkable accomplishment, despite it now being owned by people who do not care for the software's integrity.  For me, I've clearly played this game for too long – well obviously! – 10001 hours now.  The time I've played however, reflects Killing Floor's ability to keep you immersed in it's challenges – that is of course, if it's played the way it was meant to be, rather than using whitelisted cheat servers.","timestamp_created":1291118007,"timestamp_updated":1512982645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":17,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626920163631439209","comment_count":30,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3091810","author":{"steamid":"76561198017286419","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":17288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14311,"last_played":1601018616},"language":"english","review":"-Core Review-\n\nGameplay . 6 (with friends 8) average = 7\nMusic . 8\nArt . 7 (outdated)\nMechanics . 6 (outdated)\n\nTotal . 7\n\n\n-Nice Words-\n\nKilling floor is a fine game if you want to grab some friends and kill thousands of mutants. The music is very intense and surprisingly fitting to the game itself. Art style is a little old now, considering the game itself is a little old now. However it is perfectly fine for what the game is. Mechanics are old, the engine is old, the game is old, old old old. YES it's old, but good! mm back to mechanics, yes they are old, yet it is extremely satisfying to blow mutants heads off, or chop their limbs off in slow-mo. Over-all it is a great game to play with your buddies. I would recommend it to anyone who likes gore, and killing lots of things in short amounts of time.\n\nStill, get it on sale.\n\n\n-Personal Experience-\n\nI had just gotten out of playing L4D2 for a while and I was in the mood for another zombie-like shoot em up. So naturally when my friend Michael suggested this game to me, I hopped on board very quickly. Not knowing what to do was half the fun, and exploring about the game, learning the different maps and different perks was an experience on its own. For the first 20 or so hours I never even fought the boss, but when I did, man I was not ready.\n\nWhen the first of the events started that was a real blast and every event after that was something nice to come back to and try to complete. Now however I'm running out of custom maps to play and events to do. The workshop addition is nice, organized way of offering skins and maps, but I am definitely more excited for the release of Killing Floor 2.\n\nThis game has grown more of a classic to me now, after so many hours of playing, I occasionally go back to play it, and it never disappoints. All I hope is that Killing Floor 2 will be better than this game, from what I've seen it looks like it will be the same stuff over again, with updated mechanics and (slightly) upgraded graphics. In which case, I will not be playing it.\n\n\n**= Old Review =**\n\nThis game is siiiick, grab a buddy (maybe a beer) and shoot some zombie ass.
