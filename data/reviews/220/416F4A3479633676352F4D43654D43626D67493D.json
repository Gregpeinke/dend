Для своего времени - это прям прогресс. \n - Физика. Всё-таки движок Source делает своё дело\n - Взаимодействие с окружением. Я имею в виду, что необязательно убивать врагов из оружия, которое вам даёт игра. Можно взять разбросанные рядом вещи, кидать ими во врагов. Да, это не так эффективно, но факт того, что так тоже можно, радует.\n - Локализация. Добротная озвучка персонажей.\n - В некоторых местах придётся подумать. И это радует. Люблю \"умные\" игры :)\n - Разнообразие локаций. Тут вам и канализации, и ж/д станция, и улицы Сити-17, и стрёмная деревня с зомбаками, и пляжи, и лаборатории. \n - Разнообразие геймплея. Помимо обычного стреляния игра предлагает вам покататься на некоторых видах транспорта. Довольно драйвово и эпично.\n - Саунд. Крутое музыкальное сопровождение.\nМинусы:\n - Сюжет. Мне не очень понравился. Обыкновенный, ничем особо не примечательный.  В начале игры уже можно предсказать, что будет в конце.\n - Некоторые персонажи сделаны глупо. Например главный злодей. Дядька не может дать отпор девушке, ну камон, я в это не верю ( в конце игры). Аликс немного раздражает своими странными диалогами. Мне больше всех понравились Барни и Кляйнер - самые живые персы, как по мне. \n - Игра довольно коротка. Мне кажется, можно было её сделать и побольше\n - В своё время, проходя первую Халфу, она зашла мне больше, чем вторая часть. Та игра была сложнее, интереснее. Эта игра довольно лёгкая. \nОтличный шутер, ставлю ему 8/10, если хотите убить вечерок-другой, советую пройти это.

To this day, I have not played one that even comes close to looking or feeling as good as Half-Life 2 does on a PC. Hell, I played it originally on a crappy Mac Book and it still functioned and looked great. It's incredible that Valve's Source Engine can support realistic and accurate water reflections where as most modern games seem to not even try.  \n\nIn summary, multiple facets of this game elevate it to, as most individuals who have played this game and spoken to me about it would say, \"god-tier\" status. The story is dark and engrossing, with characters who, I'm not naming any specifically, make no sense, yet carry a lot of weight within the universe and its surrounding lore. The shooting is, well, it's shooting, and it's best done with a mouse, not an Xbox controller, considering how frenetic the combat can and will become most of the time. The graphics, like I mentioned earlier, are incredible, considering how long ago the game came out. If you tell me the facial animations on Alyx's face when you first met her didn't blow you away, you're just outright lying. The puzzles, like in most Valve games, involve an interesting physics engine that can do some pretty wacky things. Sometimes it seems practical, and sometimes trying, as in your patience. Start putting this in a bowl, mix the heck out of it, and what do you get? A game that was for the fans, not just for the money. What happened to these kinds of titles? Seriously!\n\nNow, I'm not a Valve fanboy who scours the internet for any trace of what might be a leak of Half-Life 3, but I can honestly say, I'd love to see what they'll do next. To be honest, I think Half-Life: Alyx might be the reason 3 never actually came out. They had a vision of VR, they went for it, and that's what came of it. Once I've had a chance to play it, meaning, when I manage to get my hands on a decent headset, I'll be sure to play it and review it.\n\nConclusion....buy HL2, it's fantastic and you will love pretty much every minute of it!","timestamp_created":1596953865,"timestamp_updated":1596953865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74012914","author":{"steamid":"76561198438148487","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1398,"last_played":1630783030},"language":"russian","review":"ачповн","timestamp_created":1596953482,"timestamp_updated":1596953482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74009894","author":{"steamid":"76561198261827885","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2768,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":380,"last_played":1618387091},"language":"spanish","review":"Una obra de arte","timestamp_created":1596948086,"timestamp_updated":1596948086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74008830","author":{"steamid":"76561198304144509","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":73,"playtime_at_review":631,"last_played":1660580228},"language":"english","review":"It was absolutely AMAZING!!!

By looking at my play time, you may think that I replayed this game once, maybe even twice. Yet, I only played it once. I still can't belive I got that much time out of this game. I am so used to singleplayer games to be over in 8-10 hours and then nugging me over to the multieplayer with some form of RNG lootboxes. I got the game in the Half-life complete bundle on sale for $8, which was well worth it. This game is a must have for any Steam uses, like the SNES with Super Mario World, and the Switch with Breath of the Wild.
