However the plot is bizzare and makes less sense the more you think about it. Like all the time-travels and multiverses are cool and stuff, but adding them to the world of BioShock was unnecessary and forced in my opinion. BioShock has never been about them, it was about the terrors of progress and how good intentions lead to disasters. BS Infinite undoubtedly involves these topics, but the game feels like it doesn't belong to the franchise. They tried to fix it in the Burial at Sea DLCs, but only made it even more complicated and odd. I'm not going to spoil the plot here, maybe I'm just missing something and I don't want to mislead anyone with my bold assumptions. Nonetheless, BioShock Infinite as I have previously mentioned looks and plays amazing, so it deserves its high ratings","timestamp_created":1632409271,"timestamp_updated":1632409271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99837871","author":{"steamid":"76561198033741483","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1632214804},"language":"french","review":"mérite un 12 pour la DA qui rattrape ce navet de gameplay","timestamp_created":1632406625,"timestamp_updated":1632406625,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99836851","author":{"steamid":"76561198199799817","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":446,"last_played":1632405078},"language":"turkish","review":"Kesinlikle oynayın.","timestamp_created":1632405186,"timestamp_updated":1632405186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99835984","author":{"steamid":"76561198422727773","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1233,"last_played":1632403826},"language":"russian","review":"Ничего не понял,но очень интересно","timestamp_created":1632404103,"timestamp_updated":1632404103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99834098","author":{"steamid":"76561199072120483","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1638385356},"language":"english","review":"Just Get the Damn Bundle, man....

A jogabilidade é ótima mesmo jogando no controle.\n\nA trilha sonora é muito boa, estilo \"música antiga\", que combina perfeitamente com a ambientação da história.\n\nA história é relativamente complexa mas bem instigante. Conforme você progride no jogo há várias reviravoltas e um final que não sei bem se eu entendi. Provavelmente quem tenha jogado os outros jogos deva compreender melhor, mas nada impede que você comece por este.\n\nAs legendas em português ajudam, mas haverá situações onde ou você foca no tiroteio ou morrerá lendo a legenda. O jogo tem opção para exibir algumas traduções de placas e outdoors da cidade, porém não funciona na maioria delas.\n\nEu joguei na dificuldade \"Média\" e achei desafiador em certos momentos, principalmente no final. Nessa dificuldade você pode ter duas armas de fogo por vez além dos \"Vigores\" (que são sua \"magia\" do jogo), com vários tipos que você pode alternar a qualquer momento. As fases costumam ter sempre o mesmo padrão no que diz respeito ao surgimento de inimigos, e depois de um tempo torna-se previsível.\n\nSe você gosta de FPS e quer algum que seja rico em história, com um tema futurista mesclado com coisas antigas, recomendo este jogo.

The gunplay itself is far more engaging than the other two games, but the gameplay as a whole felt kind of wrong. Making gun ammo limited so you have to switch weapons (and limiting the guns you can carry) is a fine idea, but its poorly executed. Often times you'll get stuck using the vastly inferior \"vox\" variants of guns you've upgraded, and these weapons aren't worth the money to upgrade. Then there's the problem with vigors, which are just plasmids for people who are afraid of needles and genetic deformation. From a gameplay perspective, they're fine, but from a story perspective they're just downright stupid. The tie between vigors and plasmids via burial at sea (where they remove the injected plasmids, giving the whole thing a lazy reskin vibe) feels kinda like cheap fanservice and a cop out from writing more actual story, but given the rest of infinite's storyline, that very well may be a good thing. The story tries all sorts of wild twists, all of which are more confusing than engaging. The last act of the game lacks a satisfying final fight AND final cutscene, instead trying to leave players shocked, but instead leaving them unsatisfied.

Sure it lost that certain charm from the previous games being under the sea, but damn, we are above the clouds in this one. But the game is fun, dynamic, and all over the place at certain points, but overall a good sequel, prequel, alternate dimension kind of game. Which ever you prefer. Only thing i don`t get is, why you can only have 2 weapons at a time, instead of a weapon wheel and upgrading them all along the way. For a 8 year old game, it looks and sounds great. And that fast paced shooting holds up really well. If you can get this game on sale with dlc-s , give it a go. It`s very good!","timestamp_created":1632332415,"timestamp_updated":1632658803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99796644","author":{"steamid":"76561198088689919","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":858,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":858,"last_played":1632330098},"language":"spanish","review":"quee too loco con el final","timestamp_created":1632330126,"timestamp_updated":1632330126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99795858","author":{"steamid":"76561198807942544","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1374,"last_played":1616044029},"language":"schinese","review":"射击手感很一般啦，不过却意外的契合画面风格，想象了一下在蒸汽朋克的世界里用ttf2的丝滑射击，emmm还是很违和的。复古的手感配合上各种奇怪的异能配合，其实挺有味道的。场景氛围美轮美奂，剧情走向跌宕起伏，再一个就是伊丽莎白，太可爱了！","timestamp_created":1632329084,"timestamp_updated":1632329084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99795648","author":{"steamid":"76561198433613153","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":680,"last_played":1644236141},"language":"schinese","review":"为了美丽可爱的伊丽莎白，这个该死的游戏就值得推荐","timestamp_created":1632328779,"timestamp_updated":1632328779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99795270","author":{"steamid":"76561198008220397","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":5226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5226,"last_played":1632316727},"language":"english","review":"Very good.
