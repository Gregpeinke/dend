previously reviewed Portal, and in that review, I claimed that the only puzzle game better than Portal is Portal 2.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that the sequel blows what's already a stellar game out of the water. I'm going to need several paragraphs to accurately describe just how good of a puzzle game, nay, how good of a game, Portal 2 is.\n\nA game is not a game without gameplay, and all other aspects, including graphics, story, characters, and setting are all meaningless if the gameplay isn't good. Fortunately for Valve, Portal 2 delivers exceptional gameplay, with the Portal Gun shining once again in a series of levels that are a well-balanced mix of actual test chambers and dilapidated pathways between them. The puzzles make you think, but not enough to make you quit the game. It's also incredibly fun to be launched out of a portal at high velocity, something you get to do a lot more of in this game than its predecessor. Combine that with the various new tools you have to work with to get by as the game goes on, as well as impressive level design and rich setting, and you have a wonderful single-player experience. The developers really outdid themselves on this one.\n\nWhile the puzzles alone make this as good as the first Portal, it's the characters that make this game even better than the first. GladOS is back and more spiteful than ever, with dialogue that made me laugh the whole game. On merit of GladOS alone, the writers deserve to get big heads. To top it off, Ellen McLain is better than ever, not only making GladOS more alive than ever, but really selling everything about her character. It isn't just GladOS that makes this game phenomenal though. Wheatley, a new addition to the robotic crew of Aperture Science, is just as endearing as GladOS, while remaining entirely different and amazing in his own right. Despite shifts in his interactions with the player, you never feel like it isn't Wheatley, and honestly, I relate to his cluelessness on a personal level. Stephen Merchant nails the role, delivering a performance that I still can't get out of my head. And I can't talk about incredible characters without referencing the recorded messages of Cave Johnson, voiced by the legendary J. K. Simmons. Man, though he never interacts with the main character, Cave Johnson remains a fan favorite due to his \"everything is possible\" personality mixed with his complete disregard for safety. Sure, it didn't affect his employees well, but when it boils down to it, not even he was exempt from his attitude about his passions, and ultimately, that makes him a character that we find ourselves respecting, even if we would never look up to him. And J. K. Simmons was possibly the only man who could make me like a flippant CEO. He knew the role, and performed the heck out of it. Combine that with superb voice acting from the announcer before GladOS returns, both the good and the broken turrets, and the brief Caroline cameos, not to mention the noises Dee Bradley Baker makes for Atlas and Peabody, the characters and their stellar characterization make this game a masterpiece.\n\nPortal 2 improves on the original in quite a lot of ways, and story is one of them. Almost non-existent in Portal, Portal 2 gives the player purpose in their puzzle-solving adventure. While not terribly complex, it serves as more than enough to get the player personally invested in the outcome. Full of tense moments, riddled with witty remarks, laden with subtle foreshadowing, and driven by a quest that taps into the human desire for freedom, you'll be sucked into the story. To top it off, the game's finale is quite possibly one of the most memorable in all of gaming, which just wouldn't have been possible without the efforts the story team went through to make something magnificent.\n\nAll this alone would make Portal 2 one of the best games of all time. But Valve even added a co-op testing course that takes place immediately after the events of the main game. The levels are substantial, and the humor continues to be top-notch. There's even a small storyline, though while it's a little more substantial then that of Portal, it's mostly for flavor. Which isn't to day it's bad, in fact, I quite enjoyed it. The meat of the experience, the complex levels that require two players to beat them, are delightfully difficult, and extremely satisfying to complete, so long as your partner is someone you have fun playing with. I imagine playing with a random player has the potential to turn sour, but that's through no fault of the game itself. Overall, the multiplayer experience was well worth the addition, and it serves as a sparkling gemstone in what is already the crowning achievement of Valve.\n\nIf that's not enough, the game has immense replay value. There's enough content to forget how the puzzles play out after a while, and even if you do remember it, the story is still a blast to experience, thanks to the characters Valve created. The co-op mode provides even more replay value, especially if you haven't played the levels with a specific person before. And if that's not enough for you, the community chambers available are extensive, available in both single and multiplayer, and ranging in difficulty from cakewalk to M. C. Escher designing Ocarina of Time's Water Temple.\n\nTo top it off, it has a soundtrack that perfectly encapsulates the vibe of the long-abandoned Aperture Science. It's mostly atmospheric, but it makes the whole game feel alive. The game even has not one, but two songs performed by Ellen McLain right at the end to send you off, including another excellent composition by Jonathan Coulton, \"Want You Gone.\" The song isn't quite as popular as \"Still Alive,\" but it's a good tune nonetheless.\n\nSeriously, the game is that good. With excellent gameplay, amazing sets, levels that work the brain, a killer cast, engaging gameplay, a co-op mode that's its own beast of content, a fantastic soundtrack, and a ridiculously high level of community content, Portal 2 deserves to be remembered as one of the best games ever created. For the best possible experience, I do recommend playing Portal first, which is a great game in its own right, but I'm not joking when I say that its sequel is bound to make the history books.","timestamp_created":1627257113,"timestamp_updated":1627257113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96376103","author":{"steamid":"76561199004637358","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1645592502},"language":"english","review":"combustible Lemons! and a talking potato...","timestamp_created":1627257053,"timestamp_updated":1627257053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96375929","author":{"steamid":"76561198201332222","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1927,"last_played":1635494473},"language":"english","review":"Absolute classic.

2 ist ein kreatives Spiel, das im Einzelspielermodus und im Koop - Modus Spaß macht. Dabei müssen Rätsel gelöst werden. \nIm Grunde ist das Ziel stets das Gleiche: Durchquere den Raum vom Eingang zum Ausgang. Dabei steht einem eine Kanone zur Verfügung, die Löcher, so genannte Portale, in Oberflächen schießt. Wenn man das erste Portal betritt, erscheint man am Standort des zweiten Portals. Im Grunde ist dies eine simple Idee, die aber m.E. gerade deswegen genial ist. Die Kampagne im Einzelspielermodus wird durch eine interessante Hintergrundgeschichte und einem lustigen, unterhaltsamen Begleiter kurzweilig gestaltet. \nDas Spiel kann frustrierend sein, wenn man die aktuelle Lösung noch nicht erkennt. Andererseits ist es immer wieder ein schönes Erlebnis, wenn man eines der Rätsel lösen konnte.","timestamp_created":1627221271,"timestamp_updated":1627221271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96349670","author":{"steamid":"76561198211239237","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":702,"last_played":1653403078},"language":"schinese","review":"等一个好兄弟来和我一起玩呀","timestamp_created":1627220879,"timestamp_updated":1627220879,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96349581","author":{"steamid":"76561198176638615","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":622,"last_played":1618169698},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1627220773,"timestamp_updated":1627220773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96349255","author":{"steamid":"76561199037407197","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":709,"last_played":1627220107},"language":"ukrainian","review":"гра хоть довга но цікава , концовка зовсім топова і сумна","timestamp_created":1627220343,"timestamp_updated":1627220343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96349085","author":{"steamid":"76561199027953427","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":742,"last_played":1656228995},"language":"schinese","review":"请不要打差评，因为这是Steam上评价最好的游戏","timestamp_created":1627220136,"timestamp_updated":1628178588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96348131","author":{"steamid":"76561198095843714","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":256,"last_played":1627218886},"language":"english","review":"Best!","timestamp_created":1627218901,"timestamp_updated":1627218901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96348084","author":{"steamid":"76561198980887713","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":981,"last_played":1627468428},"language":"russian","review":"прикольно","timestamp_created":1627218846,"timestamp_updated":1627218846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96347704","author":{"steamid":"76561199167905180","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":598,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":577,"last_played":1656515677},"language":"english","review":"This game is fun alone or with people.
