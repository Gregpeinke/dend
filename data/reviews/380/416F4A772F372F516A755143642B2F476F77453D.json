2:Episode One is Valve's dissapointing but acceptable name for the sequel to their masterpiece; Half-Life 2. Made in 2005, everyone who played and beat Half-Life 2 was hungry for more story after finishing Half-Life 2. Valve released this \"semi-filler\" since it was short and not much story was to the game but it was important to the storyline. It also comes with Half-Life 2 deathmatch; a multiplayer Half-Life which is already dead since Valve doesn't support the game anymore, and skill ceiling is higher than most multiplayer games. Half-Life 2:Episode One's story is about our silent protaganist; Gordon Freeman and his friends and followers escaping the about to explode citidale which I won't spoil for you. \n\nSince the game was made in 2005, most computers these days should be able to play the game without much difficulty, gameplay is still the same from Half-Life 2 which the main difference is the storyline. The achievements are fair and simple to accomplish if you are dedicated to get them so achievment hunters are welcomed to play. Over all, I recommend Half-Life 2:Episode One to people who love the Half-Life series, love classic games, have low-quality computers, want unique gameplay, are achievement hunters, have a bit of money over a large sale, and love FPS genre of games etc.","timestamp_created":1530758660,"timestamp_updated":1530758660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575221240520477295","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43306981","author":{"steamid":"76561198086591563","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":100,"playtime_forever":684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":178,"last_played":1553464004},"language":"english","review":"Way shorter than the other games but still a good story.

I know this review is untimely as heck, as are most of mine, but what the heck happened between HL2 and HL2E1.  \n\nFirst of all, who came up with the idiotic naming convention?  Wouldn't Half Life 2: Episode 1 be the first episode of Half Life 2?  Rather than some sequel to it?  I'm sure that's not a particularly fresh observation, but I honestly have no idea what people want when they beg for Half Life 3 to come into existence.  Half Life 2: Episode 3?  Based on current naming conventions, if the next game was significant enough to be an actual sequal to Half Life 2 and the episodes, I imagine that game would be called something like Half Life 2: Episode 2: Episode 1.\n\nAlright, on to actual problems with the game!  \n\n-I absolutely hate it when I pick up a new weapon and it automatically replaces the weapon in my hand.  This happened with a grenade while I was merrily firing my shotgun and because of that I accidently threw the grenade and blew myself up.\n\n-Support character is an idiot.  It's hard to tatically advance backwards (AKA retreat) when she's standing in the doorway.  Her other sins include dying and making me restart the section as opposed to fist bump whoever killed her.\n\n-Not a single new enemy or idea since HL2.  HL2 was almost as much puzzle as it was shooter.  This game was Call of Duty with even worse enemy AI.\n\n-Weapon placement was haphazard.  This feels like a weird complaint, but HL2 and even HL1 excelled in this area.  The grenade story above is a good example.  I believe HL2 introduced grenades to deal with enemy snipers holed up in windows.  In this case it was just in some random room, no different than all the other samey rooms I've already been through.  The first time I got a rocket launcher is another example.  It was quite some time before I used the dang thing.  And of course I used it to fight one of those lobster space ships that I've shot down a thousand times now.\n\n-Excessively linear compared to HL2.\n\n-Not a whole lot going on in the story department.  I feel like it could be safely skipped and you'll still understand this mythical HL3 thing that supposedly may someday happen.  I haven't played it yet, but if it follows the pattern established by this game I imagine all that happens in HL2E2 is Gordon and what's her face make trip to Wal-Mart.\n\n-Length.  I know it was made to be episodic before Valve abandoned it after episode 2, but the game being this short just means I had all of these problems jam packed into 4 hours.\n\nOverall, this really feels like a game that could have been thrown together over the weekend with Valves B-Team considering they didn't have to create a single new asset.","timestamp_created":1529902615,"timestamp_updated":1529902615,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.434496372938156128","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43004925","author":{"steamid":"76561198375976999","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":1277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1277,"last_played":1554200299},"language":"english","review":"I Wasn't a HL fan but then i kinda started playing and watching hl2 and this is such a fricking old school game and such a good fucking game, Too bad ep 3 isin't released but this is such a good game i wish i buyed hl2 when the bhop, prop flying, and like putting stuff on npc's so they teleport where they are suppostu, I wish those bugs were still in the game but we still have abh Accelrate back hopping,  This is a simple trick too lazy to explain it, But ye i recommend you buying the ob orange box when it's on sale, back in feburary it was like lmfao 2 dollars so i buyed it cuz why not i thought half life was gonna be intresting and it was, this fricking game was released in 2004 i think or in 2014 So fucking old but such a good game.","timestamp_created":1529848799,"timestamp_updated":1529848799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43003660","author":{"steamid":"76561198311097418","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1520530126},"language":"english","review":"Too many tight hallways","timestamp_created":1529846466,"timestamp_updated":1529846466,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42996550","author":{"steamid":"76561198834291285","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":693,"last_played":1549983040},"language":"english","review":"A very cool expansion pack,though as my Half-Life 2 review,still pretty boring.\nAnyways,in this expanion pack you dont get any new weapons,like in Opposing Force where you had all kinds of weapons,this DLC feels more like Half-Life Blue Shift,no new weapons,and isnt as repetitive as Half-life 1,i still recommend it though.","timestamp_created":1529830276,"timestamp_updated":1547053330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42980163","author":{"steamid":"76561198361381058","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":404,"last_played":1517336994},"language":"czech","review":"Nejkratší díl Half-life 2 slouží spíš jako nějaká taková vložka mezi Half-life 2 a Half-life 2 episode two.
