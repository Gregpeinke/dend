The writing and voice acting was absolutely hillarious and the puzzles were challenging without being overly frustrating.  I havn't tried coop yet, but that option is there, and there is a very user friendly editor to make levels to challenge your friends.  I was able to make a neat little level for my kids successfully without even reading an instruction manual.  I went through the entire game and did not notice any bugs, nor did I get into any situations forcing a reload.  Mistakes are mostly recoverable (except when you die obviously).  Overall this has been a very enjoyable game so far!","timestamp_created":1408911115,"timestamp_updated":1408911115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r7DphMgCdvaaLQ=="}
