Valve made a sequel, which considered this game as a Game of the decade. Game is set in a distant future, somewhere in Eastern Europe, about twenty years after the Black Mesa Incident from the first game. \nThe main character is a scientist named Gordon Freeman, who's kicking some major *** with his partner Alyx Vance. Freeman, who hasn't aged a day since he disappeared after the Black Mesa Incident because he was in stasis, appears on a train heading to City 17. A couple of citizens talk about city life and the process of being transferred to City 17. Arriving there, Gordon meets armed police officers known as Civil Protection. Gordon is forced to escape City 17, with Civil Protection officers in hot pursuit.\n\n+Game is aged well in the year 2004, it can also be placed near new titles with AAA graphics which we got now.\n+Controls feel great, movements are very solid, no mouse skip or autoaim.\n+Storywise this game is like a blockbuster filled with action. if we get to the last part of the game, you can really be excited using your super powered weapons. It's not an immersive storytelling like game wants you to believe but you feel like you're into this game yourself and play as you rather than Gordon Freeman.\n+Soundtrack is well made, give you that special mood for killing zombies abd combines, same goes for sfx\n+First Valve game on this engine, presentation and the beggining of source engine legacy began with this.
