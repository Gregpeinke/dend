However, they make use of another portal for ships and those coming from this portal consult Black Mesa. Scientists hoping for help from the army begin to be slaughtered by the soldiers, the state decides to destroy everyone in this factory that went wrong. Gordon Freeman, on the other hand, has fun fighting the creatures coming from the portal with the soldiers and tries to escape from Black Mesa. totally this way\n\n[h1]\nPros and cons\n[/h1]\nPros:

Sure it was very revolutionary at the time, but it is very much like Doom and honestly I'll take Doom over it any day. However, it is worth a shot if you like classic FPS.","timestamp_created":1613371377,"timestamp_updated":1613371377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86684748","author":{"steamid":"76561198796425254","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":611,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":611,"last_played":1613084936},"language":"english","review":"Dumpster scientist best scientist","timestamp_created":1613365204,"timestamp_updated":1613365204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86683194","author":{"steamid":"76561198876024514","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":768,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":486,"last_played":1650127045},"language":"english","review":"Black Mesa","timestamp_created":1613363315,"timestamp_updated":1613363315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86676802","author":{"steamid":"76561199014441037","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1713,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":573,"last_played":1652907427},"language":"english","review":"---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☑ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☑ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☐ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☐ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☑ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☑ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☐ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☑ Nothing to grind\n☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☐ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☑ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☑ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☑ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☑ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☐ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☑ 10","timestamp_created":1613355787,"timestamp_updated":1641120688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86676126","author":{"steamid":"76561198816198106","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1614559728},"language":"english","review":"cool snark snacks","timestamp_created":1613355028,"timestamp_updated":1613355028,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86674568","author":{"steamid":"76561197985499940","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11761,"last_played":1652544430},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely flawless classic.

Ich weiß gar nicht, wo ich anfangen soll, so gut wie es mir gefallen hat. Ich könnte eigentlich nur positive Dinge sagen.\nDas Gameplay macht echt viel Spaß, die Waffen und Gegner sind sehr abwechslungsreich und ich habe mich immer gefreut, wenn ich eine neue Waffe bekommen habe oder wenn ein neuer Feind-Typ dazugekommen ist. \nDas Leveldesign gefällt mir auch sehr gut. Man hat stets einen graden Pfad, dem man folgen kann, der aber manchmal nicht allzu offensichtlich ist, also muss man manchmal ein kleines bisschen sein Köpfchen benutzen, um den Weg zu finden. Ich finde es auch sehr gut, dass man manchmal Levelobjekte bewegen muss, um weiter zu kommen oder unnötigen Schaden zu vermeiden. \nDas Spiel ist in mehrere Kapitel aufgeteilt und einige sind besser als andere, obwohl ich von keinem behaupten würde, dass es schlecht ist. Das letzte Kapitel kann aber schon etwas nerven und der Endboss enttäuscht mich etwas. Dieses epische Spiel, hätte auch einen epischen Endboss verdient. Apropos Bosse: Einige der Bosse lassen sich nicht durch stupides raufballern töten, sondern erfordern, dass man im Level bestimmte Aufgaben erfüllt und die meisten Bosse haben etwas, das sie besonders macht angesichts der Tatsache, wie man sie bekämpft. \nDie Story wird durch Gespräche mit diversen Wissenschaftlern und Wachmännern erzählt und man kann noch etwas mehr erfahren, wenn man die Gespräche einiger Soldaten belauscht, bevor man sie angreift. Ich persönlich finde die Story sehr interessant und ich wollte immer wissen, was nun als nächstes in Black Mesa passiert :). \nDie Grafik ist natürlich nicht die modernste, da das Spiel von 1998 ist, aber mich stört es keineswegs. Ich finde sie sogar recht hübsch, weil sie auf mich einen gewissen Charme hat. \nDas einzige, was mich ein wenig stört ist, dass Gordon Freeman anscheinend auf Buttersandalen unterwegs ist, da er immer noch ein paar Meter rutscht, nachdem man aufgehört hat, die entsprechende Bewegungstaste zu drücken. Dem lässt sich aber leicht entgegenwirken, indem man die entgegengesetzte Bewegungstaste kurz antippt, während man die eigentliche loslässt. Wenn ich z.B. gerade nur mit \"D\" laufe und stehen bleiben möchte, tippe ich kurz \"A\" an, während ich \"D\" loslasse. \n\nDas Spiel ist wirklich großartig und es kostet nicht viel. Also warum hast du es dir noch nicht gekauft? Du kannst nur gewinnen, also kauf's dir jetzt sofort!","timestamp_created":1613352006,"timestamp_updated":1613353287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86671602","author":{"steamid":"76561199063836777","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8433,"playtime_last_two_weeks":79,"playtime_at_review":2660,"last_played":1660530958},"language":"english","review":"good game\nsome jank\nbut not a lot\n8/10","timestamp_created":1613349356,"timestamp_updated":1613349356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86667838","author":{"steamid":"76561198036402457","num_games_owned":288,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":425,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":405,"last_played":1616541109},"language":"english","review":"half life","timestamp_created":1613344398,"timestamp_updated":1613344398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86666086","author":{"steamid":"76561198048720750","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1779,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1779,"last_played":1587395583},"language":"english","review":"BEST","timestamp_created":1613342356,"timestamp_updated":1613342356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwotas0fcCdrbNygI="}
