This game is amazing and really flexes the brain, with low res (for computers that can't handle high end graphics which is amazing and considerate) to hours of consistant game play with custom maps, and so much more. This game is fun for those that like puzzles and puzzle solving, working alone or with others, amazing story and of course cake!

There is far more room for thoughtful, slow puzzle-solving (with bursts of exhilarating movement and aha! moments) than Portal 1 (which I revisited and, yeah, the earliest puzzles with shifting built-in portals and timed events are actually more difficult in a \"man, this is annoying\" kind of way).\n\nCo-op is differently lovely and was incredibly fun, but having a more focused/experienced partner helped a lot. Sometimes my partner would figure out a path to the exit before I could figure out what was going on, so we'd leave and I'd be clueless. This lends a lot of replay value (the cutscenes are short and as usual, no respawn penalty, so restarting from level one doesn't seem daunting or exhausting), as with each different partner, you'll figure out different things in a different order with each partner having different or new strengths. Sometimes you use your partner pretty much as a moveable weighted cube, just standing on things or pushing buttons you're told to push while the other guy does all the thinking. Sometimes real collaboration and timing is a necessity. Balancing of each partner's strengths and weaknesses becomes a real aspect of the game and leads to actual, in-reality, relationship-building. Your frustration or reliance on (or competitive streak against) the other character carries over into how you cooperate in real life via voice comm to progress.\n\nThe access to Steam Workshop community maps makes this game endlessly playable, even if co-op may eventually wear thin after a few run-throughs with different people. There are some excellent maps out there, and ones which introduce different architecture than what you're used to--new approaches to vertical gameplay or problem-solving methods.","timestamp_created":1452531649,"timestamp_updated":1452531649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20471592","author":{"steamid":"76561198143070465","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":424,"last_played":1550534016},"language":"french","review":"ce jeu est littéralement un rubik's cube 100x100 c'est tellement complexe qu'a la fin du niveau on jouis de notre victoire et sa c'est cool donc si vous aimer gagner au bout de 3h sur le meme niveau c'est par ici que vous devez aller","timestamp_created":1452531566,"timestamp_updated":1452531566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20471340","author":{"steamid":"76561198058704818","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1547679344},"language":"english","review":"favgame","timestamp_created":1452530584,"timestamp_updated":1452530584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20471233","author":{"steamid":"76561198062168544","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2788,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1546,"last_played":1517853266},"language":"russian","review":"Please Valve, Portal 3","timestamp_created":1452530256,"timestamp_updated":1452530256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20471099","author":{"steamid":"76561198272750966","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":165,"last_played":1639420530},"language":"russian","review":"shitty game","timestamp_created":1452529864,"timestamp_updated":1511004153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20469843","author":{"steamid":"76561198198055153","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1718,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1718,"last_played":1625829632},"language":"english","review":"3","timestamp_created":1452525261,"timestamp_updated":1631120557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20469786","author":{"steamid":"76561198144267615","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1178,"last_played":1577719782},"language":"schinese","review":"就冲我HD3200也能全程30+帧运行也要给好评\n在steam上你见过几个M分比传送门2高的？\n联机是亮点，单人模式伟大的剧情更是亮点\n我之前没有接触过HL系列 但是仅靠传送门就让我对这个系列产生了浓厚的兴趣\n\n不吹不黑 不玩这个你不算来过steam","timestamp_created":1452524992,"timestamp_updated":1452524992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559412539005279541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20469524","author":{"steamid":"76561198072705248","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":339,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":146,"last_played":1487178704},"language":"english","review":"Haven't played the single player yet, but the co-op multiplayer is so much fun it's unbelievable!

So overall I think [b][u]Portal 2 has pretty great story[/u][/b]","timestamp_created":1452440041,"timestamp_updated":1452440298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20449244","author":{"steamid":"76561198112302314","num_games_owned":308,"num_reviews":172,"playtime_forever":777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":97,"last_played":1604931868},"language":"polish","review":"Polecam bardzo serdecznie.","timestamp_created":1452438873,"timestamp_updated":1452438873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464130431413650513","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20448561","author":{"steamid":"76561198198376682","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":103,"last_played":1462164309},"language":"polish","review":"Świetna kontynuacja pierwszej części","timestamp_created":1452436876,"timestamp_updated":1452436876,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20447551","author":{"steamid":"76561198021679288","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":951,"last_played":1452621679},"language":"french","review":"Que dire de ce jeu, il est au top et digne du portal premier du nom! L'histoire ce suit et on retouve de nouvelle égnime plus dur que dans le 1.\n\nQuestion durer de vie, l'histoire principal est assez prenante et pour ma part, j'y ai passer 8 heures d'affilé sans m'en rendre compte, donc jusqu'a que j'ai le générique de fin. Après il y a les modes défis comme dans le 1 mais il sont moins prenant pour ma part, part contre on peut ce comparé a tout le monde et surtout ces amis ce qui et vraiment bien. Bande son vraiment bien, et graphiquement au top.\n\nLa nouvauté est le mode multi joueurs, bien conçu et il faut vraiment avoir une bonne coop sinon on perd du temps.\n\nBref que du plus pour un jeu qui a de quoi nous tenir pendant des heures, si on en a envie.\n\nENJOY ;)","timestamp_created":1452433995,"timestamp_updated":1452433995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20447361","author":{"steamid":"76561198108068747","num_games_owned":313,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":2037,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":860,"last_played":1596455467},"language":"polish","review":"Zajebista gierka \nGram o 3 w nocy\nWchodzi stary\nWypieprzam komputer z listwy \nI sie dzieje\nGram dalej","timestamp_created":1452433508,"timestamp_updated":1452433508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20446809","author":{"steamid":"76561198054748626","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1086,"last_played":1469357777},"language":"english","review":"Best Game Ever","timestamp_created":1452431867,"timestamp_updated":1452431867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20446719","author":{"steamid":"76561197976079116","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":451,"last_played":1452350765},"language":"french","review":"Si vous avez aimé le premier alors vous allez adorer celui la !!!\nJe le recommande","timestamp_created":1452431572,"timestamp_updated":1452431572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20446605","author":{"steamid":"76561198260764943","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1433,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1577914522},"language":"russian","review":"Моя любимая игра от Valve =)","timestamp_created":1452431240,"timestamp_updated":1452431240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20446438","author":{"steamid":"76561198011334643","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":456,"last_played":1626955945},"language":"koreana","review":"부순다\n나는\n터릿을\n\nCrash\nme\nturret","timestamp_created":1452430726,"timestamp_updated":1452430726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt8LnldICds7/TQ=="}
