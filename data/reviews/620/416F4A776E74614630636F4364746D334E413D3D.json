Portal 2 on the other hand is just so much better.\nFor starters it's a lot longer than the first installment, has a co-op option, and more difficult puzzles.  \nThere were moments I really had to think for a few minutes and take another good look around on how to proceed and get the puzzles solved, which I really appreciate in a good puzzle game.\nBesides that, the game has a really good story with a couple of nice twists and turns.\nI mean who would've thought I would actually walk around with an AI potato? Genius! :D\nAlso, the ending!\nWho knew turrets had other talents besides shooting holes in you?\nSeeing that alone made the time and effort all worth it!\nAnd of course the humorous comments you get to hear when you're playing.\nIt just lightens the often ominous atmosphere of your surroundings just when you start to wonder if you are ever going to get out this alive.\n\nIn short, if you haven't played this game yet, DO SO NOW!\nIt's worth every penny!\nThe only thing I have to complain about is that I'm still waiting for my cake!","timestamp_created":1420199462,"timestamp_updated":1420201177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13781673","author":{"steamid":"76561198059519395","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1273,"last_played":1574283852},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego de Valve es increible, su historia me encanto pero se hacia aburrida a ratos.
