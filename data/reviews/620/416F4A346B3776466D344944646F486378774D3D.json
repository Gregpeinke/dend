The new is non playable, crashes, drop of frame rates, and much more as is known. Asked for a refund since I bought it for PS5 and sony is refusing because the game was downloaded and played for less than 2 hours. Told me that the publisher does not acknowledge the new trilogy as non playable and so no refund. I feel scammed. They are multi million dollar companies and steal from players that trusted on their services with hard earned money and refuse to get back what they took? Don’t get me wrong! I understand that if people buy a game and play it shouldn’t be refunded because the person even not enjoying the game, the game is working but on this case, the trilogy is broken, have to exit the game several times because cutscenes freezes the game, cars spawn everywhere and explode, kill the character even on a mission, and much more. They should be accountable legally. This is stealing.\n\nSmall addition to my context: I was mad while writing this and I'm sorry if I did not specified this before!\n\nI get that the game was made and sold by Rockstar Games and I got it thru my PSN account for PS5 version. I don't blame Sony for the broken game, I blame Rockstar! My beef with Sony is that when I spoke to the manager, he told that he understands my side and wanted to help but the policy does not allow this since the game was downloaded or played, even tho under 2 hour mark of gameplay. I understand Sony does not want to take a hit since is Rockstar making the sale, but is also my understanding that Sony is allowing this to happen. The manager said that they are getting thousands of complaints, but unless Rockstar acknowledges that the game is broken, Sony won't do anything.\n\nSome people are blaming me for buying a game I thought would remind me of the old good days. Yes I did not have seen any review before because I was trying to get a first hand experience with this remasters and get that wow feeling like it was my first time. I regret this, but it is what it is.\n\nPlease stop saying that I am a Xbox fanboy, because I only play PlayStation, and to be honest, I don't even belong into this stupid console war. Anyone should be playing where they want without being insulted on their choices. I don't mind Xbox but I grew with PlayStation and that is the platform that most of my games are and is where I feel happy to play when I have a chance.\n\nWhy people need to insult me for being frustrated against a multi-billion dollar companies that have the chance of doing what is right instead of doing something shameful like this? The terms of Service specify that if you download or play a game is non refundable any more and I get it, but at least expect the game to be working! In this case is not and so I was sold a faulty copy of something that is not working as intended. If you get a phone, a computer or even clothes and after two hours or less you find out that is not working or not being able to get the proper use of that exact thing, you have 14-30 days to return and ask for a refund or replace that exact thing. Sony could make a refund in wallet and I would gladly spend that money into another thing on their store. All I ask is for the game to be on working condition or at least playable.\n\nI understand that this is not happening to everyone and that the game is playable to some users. I'm happy it is and I wish that would also be my experience but is not and so, please do not insinuate I am lying to get a refund. I have proof that the game is non playable and I can get even more proofs by just playing 5 minutes. My point is, if it is working for you, please feel free to enjoy and share your achievements, but for me is a nightmare and so I feel frustrated as any of you blaming me would be if you were in my shoes.\nFUCK SONY, AND FUCK ROCKSTAR GAMES!!!!\n\n\nTo everyone who understands my side, thank you so much! People shouldn't judge if they don't know exactly why it happened or how it is happening. Just chill! You are not getting anything from defending this companies that would do the same thing to you just like they are doing it to me. All I am asking is to get my working product or getting the money at least into my account so I can spend it somewhere else,like another game or one of their subscription products like PS Plus or PS

(The emoticon didn't work :sad:)\n[hr][/hr]  \n\n\n[b]Review:[/b]\n\nYou are curious about the game Portal 2? It is just an awesome game, developed by Valve in 2011. Though it's quite old for a game, it is still awesome for modern standards. The Game is built around the Portal universe, but you don't have to play the first part (but I recommend it). It is not as buggy as the previous part, for example, you can't shoot a portal if you're inside a portal.\n\nLost inside the puzzle rooms is sometimes your lot. Even though it's sometimes quite complicated to find the solution for the puzzles (especially with the gels -> it still destroys my brain), it is still awesome.\n\nThe re is a workshop with a strong community with awesome puzzles which are often better than Valve's puzzles (which are still amazing). There is also a coop mode which is pretty fun if you have friends.\n\nGame play is also awesome. There is a story that is quite good and the level editor is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. It is possible to build quite complex puzzle rooms but you also have the option to build complex logical contraptions. For example, I build a four-bit full adder and included it inside a puzzle (which is quite fun imo). You can find it in my workshop.\n\n\nI waited till I reached the 42 in-game hours. Why?
