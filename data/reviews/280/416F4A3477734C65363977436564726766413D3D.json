There's something about it that doesn't add up to what the original GldSrc edition had; whether it's the numerous bugs: including game breaking glitches like scientists getting killed when they shouldn't be, and guards not using retinal scanners. This ruined the overall experience for me, and i does not feel like an actual reboot of the game. Countless bugs aside, with the water reflections and effects of the source engine and ambient lighting mixed in with the original 90's models just makes the game feel.... ugly. The original game did not have stunning visuals (Which is understanderable since it came out in 1998) it felt good to play and with the same styled explosions and effects it all went together quite well. To any people looking to buy this game, keep in mind: This is NOT a remastered version, but just  a direct port to the source engine.\n\nWell, that's all I have to say about the game. If you want to play Half Life, definately go for the original GldSrc release and not the source engine remake. If you want a complete remaster, go play Black Mesa. It's a fantastic remaster built in the source engine. With great lighting, voice acting, textures models etc, it's great. With a couple changes to maps here and there, it still stays true to what the original game had.","timestamp_created":1498762998,"timestamp_updated":1499187310,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.430559784173965454","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33003758","author":{"steamid":"76561198028012093","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":230,"last_played":1565543128},"language":"english","review":"If you want to buy for gmod......Do It!\nIf you don't want.....DON'T DO IT!\nbuy the first game!\nand btw....multiplayer is dead!","timestamp_created":1498760807,"timestamp_updated":1498760980,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481675416231155396","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33003036","author":{"steamid":"76561198275154286","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":478,"last_played":1499377568},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor jogo para se começar no mundo do FPS!","timestamp_created":1498759858,"timestamp_updated":1498759858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33000244","author":{"steamid":"76561197962892152","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":108,"last_played":1498755902},"language":"english","review":"This version is terrible with full of bugs.

Ahora, mi voto es negativo porque (aunque el juego sea bueno), efectivamente NO LO RECOMIENDO. Recomiendo, en cambio, jugar al Half-Life original de 1998. ¿Por qué digo esto? Porque si bien existe una mejora gráfica (el motor del juego pasa a ser Source), de repente aparecen muchos problemas que no estaban en el original. En mi caso:\n-En la primera partida que inicié, no se cargaban los modelos de las armas. Podía disparar y recargar pero sin ver la mano sosteniendo el arma en cuestión. Un tanto desconcertado, creé una partida nueva (eligiendo el capítulo en el que estaba [una de las mejoras que ofrece esta versión Source es poder elegir capítulos para jugar partes específicas del juego, muy útil cuando ataca la nostalgia y se quiere rejugar algo]) y en adelante funcionó bien.\n-La velocidad de desplazamiento del personaje se ha modificado, ahora va MUY rápido. Eso estaría bien para recorrer los amplios niveles que presenta el juego de no ser por otros dos problemas añadidos: todas las superficies \"resbalan\", por lo que al dejar de correr Gordon sigue avanzando un poco más, y todas las paredes rebotan. Esto último es MUY frustrante en las secuencias plataformeras como la ladera de la montaña o algunos momentos en Xen, ya que la vieja técnica de pegarse a la pared de repente ya no sirve porque rebotamos contra ésta y caemos a una muerte segura. La solución es jugar toda esa parte caminando (manteniendo apretado Shift, por defecto), lo que puede tornarse desesperante dado que es muchísimo más lento que el desplazamiento normal.\n-Me resultó imposible abrir la consola manualmente. A pesar de activar la opción avanzada para esto, no hay manera de asignarle ningún botón desde el menú de opciones (y, obviamente, probé presionando tecla por tecla para comprobar que NINGUNA activaba la consola del desarrollador). La solución a esto fue agregar el comando \"-console\" a los parámetros de ejecución en Steam, lo que ocasiona que la consola se abriera SIEMPRE al iniciar el juego.\n-No tiene subtítulos. El primero tampoco los traía, así que no es un gran problema, pero el tema es que el juego OFRECE la opción de activar subtítulos (y no sólo eso, pueden ser subtítulos de sólo diálogo o una transcripción textual de cualquier sonido ambiental, ideal para aquellos con discapacidades auditivas). Un tanto ilusionado, activé los subtítulos dialogales para notar desde el primer momento que éstos no iban a mostrarse. El audio sigue siendo el mismo que en el Half-Life original, por lo que algunas voces siguen sin entenderse particularmente bien (en especial para quienes no tenemos al inglés como lengua nativa) pero contribuye de buena manera al efecto nostalgia por el que la mayoría lo jugamos.\n\nEn definitiva, ante los detalles mencionados, concluyo que el juego es bueno, pero no tanto como el original (aún apesar de sus gráficos renovados [que no son excelentes en absoluto, no hay punto de comparación, por ejemplo, con Half-Life 2] y de la característica de poder elegir el capítulo a jugar) por lo que mi recomendación es no comprar esta versión Source sino la de 1998.","timestamp_created":1498628501,"timestamp_updated":1498628501,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":61,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.7965584397315979","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32900990","author":{"steamid":"76561198046600681","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1498610354},"language":"english","review":"This port of the original Half-Life has a ton of glitches.
