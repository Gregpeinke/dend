If I had to say something useful, I would say that Portal does a lot with a little and I find it hard not to recommend.\n\nThe main game is short and is worthy of further playthroughs as it is satisfying to fly through levels that used to stump you; and not because the security camera or radio achievements are worth attaining, they require minor problem solving and failed to interest me anywhere near that of the bonus maps.\n\nThe bonus maps are split into two categories, advanced maps, and challenge maps. The advanced maps consist of existing level layouts that have been modified to make the chambers more difficult (if you enjoyed the main game then you will probably enjoy these, I certainly did). The maps are fun and may take you a while to figure out without feeling too disorientating, frustrating, or irritating.\n\nSpeaking of irritating, let’s move on to the challenge maps. The challenge maps feature unaltered chambers from the main game but are made  [i] challenging [/i] with the addition of a selectable objective on top of the chamber’s traditional completion. Some of these objectives are enjoyable, some are not. I liked the challenge of trying to complete each chamber in the fewest number of portals, but I did not like trying to complete each chamber in the fewest number of steps, as such, I never completed this section of the game.\n\nThat’s about it, I’m afraid. I like this game; I just don’t have an awful lot to talk about. It’s charming, very well made, and Ellen McLain does an incredible job at voice acting.
