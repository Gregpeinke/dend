I can't recommend this game enough, if you haven't played it for yourself, get it now, you will not be let down.

Don't take that as this isn't a good game, quite the opposite, i was actually massive surprised how much i liked this game and how quickly i became attached to the story of Booker Dewitt and Elizabeth. I'll be honest, the only reason i own and played this game is because i bought the Bioshock collection on sale, originally only to replay the first two games. I did actually love playing this game, but it is in many ways the polar opposite of Rapture. Columbia, the new main city, is a bright and sunny steampunk inspired city floating in the clouds, filled with a post-civil war america architecture and clothing style, and the higher class of educated citizens, it is a far leap from the drug addicted splicers of rapture living in the dank and dark remnants of the once utopian art-deco Rapture. Infact, Columbia almost seems to actually spit in the face of Andrew Ryan, being Ruled and led by a religious zealot, and citizens worship former heads of government openly in the street. Ultimately, This is still a great game, and has fairly similar gameplay, with a few differences, such as the skyhook combat, and only being able to carry 2 guns, but even though it does make a short reference to rapture near the end of the game, It is a story in it's own right, and had nothing to do with the first two games.","timestamp_created":1569308912,"timestamp_updated":1569308912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55253503","author":{"steamid":"76561198076713203","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1585024197},"language":"spanish","review":"Una obra maestra de principio a fin.

I am not a very good shooter player. I thought that the first Bioshock was one of the greatest stories I've ever played. Bioshock Infinite had an in-game story that was compelling and had many elements that made me want to keep going. The music was fascinating, the world building intriguing, the art style great. The mechanics of the game were nothing that improved upon the previous games in my opinion. I recently game back to the game to play the DLC and played the original story again. The second playthrough was much less satisfying. I suppose any time you deal with time, some of the logic gets fuzzy. Burial at Sea added additional story components that did not positively add to my experience. I thought that the first episode cheapened Bioshock Infinite. I felt that the second attempted to fix the problems with the first. My feeling at the end was that the entire thing was pointless. I'd say play Infinite if you liked Bioshock, I would skip the DLC, however.","timestamp_created":1569096370,"timestamp_updated":1569096370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55218409","author":{"steamid":"76561198334530556","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":140,"last_played":1569609310},"language":"russian","review":"Обожаю главных героев, которые оказываются в хуeвой ситуации или странном месте, и такие: \"вау...\" \"какого...\", а потом пускают шутейки будто так быть и должно, подумаешь город летает, обычное дело в Казахстане.\n\nСтрельба и анимации напоминают boderlands, а атмосфера пусть и светлее чем в предыдущих частях, но местами все ровно гнетет.

Throughout the game the adventure does feel a little bit like a large amount of side quests, but that is needed to tell the story they wanted to.\n\nI loved the story and the skyline ideas. The skyline drop attacks are so much fun to use. Although a very basic combat system, it becomes more advanced as the game progresses. The city feels really filled out, and some of the scenery and settings are insanely beautiful \n\nSpoilers (small ones):\nI felt the last vigor was given far to anti-climatically and the shock vigor was  a huge pointless (in my opinion) side quest, though I enjoyed it.","timestamp_created":1568944672,"timestamp_updated":1568944672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55191329","author":{"steamid":"76561198276242066","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":995,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":692,"last_played":1570669160},"language":"english","review":"Let me start off by saying that FPSes are not normally my type of game (I generally stick to strategy games). Because of that, I can't tell you about whether the cover system is as great as Gears of War's or whatever, although I didn't have a problem with anything in combat (for the record, I played on Easy Mode and haven't gone on to play the DLC yet, though that will be happening soon).\n\nWhat I can tell you about is story. This game stunned me. The way in which this game's story was told stunned me. Every theme, every scrap of dialogue, every song, perfect. You get a sense of a complete world that functions without you from the very first moments of the game and little details that serve the story in interesting ways and fill out the world are everywhere. \n\nAs someone who knows a fair amount about US history (although I'd never claim to be an expert), they get certain bits of the period just right. For instance, one of the villains, a jovial yet irredeemably evil industrialist, is reminiscent of a cross between the robber barons Edison, Carnegie, and Pullman. It all works.\n\nReturning to gameplay, an issue I have with games like these sometimes is direction. I sometimes can't figure out which way to go. The navigation button was something I used often, and, although a bit confusing, I got the hang of it quickly. This went some way towards mitigating a confusing moment or two. I had a brief issue figuring out where to go next in a large chasm criss-crossed with Skylines (think roller-coasters with you as the car), for instance, but I figured it out quickly.\n\nThat's just an incredibly minor nitpick, though. This game is deeply, deeply cool, but it's more than that. It is art, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.","timestamp_created":1568940120,"timestamp_updated":1568940120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55188269","author":{"steamid":"76561198344185812","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":783,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":554,"last_played":1623508602},"language":"turkish","review":"MUHTEŞEM!","timestamp_created":1568922006,"timestamp_updated":1569263817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55185052","author":{"steamid":"76561198031767185","num_games_owned":1564,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1050,"last_played":1511410113},"language":"italian","review":"Penso si possa definire la quadratura del cerchio di questa fantastica trilogia.
