Half-Life  and Half-Life 2 is what started all my computer gaming. the way this game really challenges you and adds physics is what made it such a compelling game to play compared to what xbox and ps2 offered at the time. it truly sucks you into its one of a kind story. with believable banter, sometimes slighty corny. sometimes funny. i still remember when i first started playing Half-Life 2 on my familys desktop when i was in highschool. the graphics and water blew me away on the realism. the sound echhos and dynamic lighting.  my only reaction to when i completed the series was sadness that i couldnt play more. and to this day im still waiting on the final chapter        Half-Life 3","timestamp_created":1397259731,"timestamp_updated":1397259731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9789489","author":{"steamid":"76561198041879153","num_games_owned":343,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":830,"last_played":1578515170},"language":"german","review":"Munter ans Werk Mr. Freeman.

The guns had a phony feeling about it... - this is a core mechanic for fps so it must be good\n2. The way the story was delivered - perhaps if the character could talk the story could've had more impact on me... even the that robot named DOG was more interactive than me... AM I A GOD DAMN TOASTER!?\n3. The physics... - I spend most of my time trying not to break the physics and the rest was spent stuck in table or not being able to run over a wooden plank...\n4. The atmosphere - to me it felt like the game didn't know what it wanted to be or where it wants to be \n5. The vehicle levels - why are they here in first place... stupid fillers they just overstayed their welcome...\n6. The difficulty - even though I played the whole game on hard it wasn't challenging... it was more challenging not to get stuck in table than to finish the game. I mean, c'mon it is a \"cross universe/dimensional empire\"  vs a \"tiny toaster man\"  it has to be harder than this\n\n[b]What I did like about it...[/b]\n1. Ravenholm - best part of the game if you ask me.\n2. The combine - they seem like good antagonistic force.\n3. The hidden ammo and medkits - sadly there was not that much need of them, because there were more medkits and ammo scattered everywhere than I can use. There were even people who were giving me medkits...\n4. Did I mention Ravenholm?\n5. DOG - My favorite character so far from the half life series ( And father grigori being my second favorite ) oh how I would love to see father grigori riding DOG into battle...\n6. The bug commanding part - even though it got frustrating not long after I recivied that ability... it was still cool\n7. Being able to carry all the weapons with me - something I really love \n\nMaybe if they put some cutscenes or make the character talk I could fall in love with the story more... put more weight to the weapons... remove or shorten the vehicle levels by 80%... and create better atmosphere with more smooth change between the levels... and do something about the difficulty levels...

The name derives from its combining three separate operations comprising harvesting‚Äîreaping, threshing, and winnowing‚Äîinto a single process. Among the crops harvested with a combine are wheat, oats, rye, barley, corn (maize), soybeans and flax (linseed). The waste straw left behind on the field is the remaining dried stems and leaves of the crop with limited nutrients which is either chopped and spread on the field or baled for feed and bedding for livestock.\n\nCombine harvesters are one of the most economically important labor saving inventions, enabling a small fraction of the population to be engaged in agriculture.\n\nHistory\nScottish inventor Patrick Bell invented the Reaper in 1826. The combine was invented in the United States by Hiram Moore in 1834, and early versions were pulled by horse or mule teams. In 1835, Moore built a full-scale version and by 1839, over 50 acres of crops were harvested. By 1860, combine harvesters with a cutting width of several metres were used on American farms. In 1882, the Australian Hugh Victor McKay had a similar idea and developed the first commercial combine harvester in 1885, the Sunshine Harvester.\n\nCombines, some of them quite large, were drawn by mule or horse teams and used a bullwheel to provide power. Later, steam power was used, and George Stockton Berry integrated the combine with a steam engine using straw to heat the boiler. Tractor-drawn, combines became common after World War II as many farms began to use tractors. These combines used a shaker to separate the grain from the chaff and straw-walkers (grates with small teeth on an eccentric shaft) to eject the straw while retaining the grain. Early tractor-drawn combines were usually powered by a separate gasoline engine, while later models were PTO-powered. These machines either put the harvested crop into bags that were then loaded onto a wagon or truck, or had a small bin that stored the grain until it was transferred to a truck or wagon with an auger.\n\nIn the U.S., Allis-Chalmers, Massey-Harris, International Harvester, Gleaner Manufacturing Company, John Deere, and Minneapolis Moline are past or present major combine producers.\n\nIn 1911, the Holt Manufacturing Company of California produced a self-propelled harvester. In Australia in 1923, the patented Sunshine Auto Header was one of the first center-feeding self-propelled harvesters.[8] In 1923 in Kansas, the Curtis brothers and their Gleaner Manufacturing Company patented a self-propelled harvester which included several other modern improvements in grain handling.[9] Both the Gleaner and the Sunshine used Fordson engines. In 1929 Alfredo Rotania of Argentina patented a self-propelled harvester.[10] In 1937, the Australian-born Thomas Carroll, working for Massey-Harris in Canada, perfected a self-propelled model and in 1940 a lighter-weight model began to be marketed widely by the company.[11] Lyle Yost invented an auger that would lift grain out of a combine in 1947, making unloading grain much easier.[12]\n\nIn 1952 Claeys launched the first self- propelled combine harvester in Europe;[13] in 1953, the European manufacturer CLAAS developed a self-propelled combine harvester named 'Herkules', it could harvest up to 5 tons of wheat a day.[14] This newer kind of combine is still in use and is powered by diesel or gasoline engines. Until the self-cleaning rotary screen was invented in the mid-1960s combine engines suffered from overheating as the chaff spewed out when harvesting small grains would clog radiators, blocking the airflow needed for cooling.\n\nA significant advance in the design of combines was the rotary design. The grain is initially stripped from the stalk by passing along a helical rotor instead of passing between rasp bars on the outside of a cylinder and a concave. Rotary combines were first introduced by Sperry-New Holland in 1975.[15]\n\nIn about the 1980s on-board electronics were introduced to measure threshing efficiency. This new instrumentation allowed operators to get better grain yields by optimizing ground speed and other operating parameters.\n\n\n\nA John Deere 9410 Combine with grain platform attached.\n\n\nA John Deere Titan series combine unloading corn.\nCombine heads[edit]\nCombines are equipped with removable heads that are designed for particular crops. The standard header, sometimes called a grain platform, is equipped with a reciprocating knife cutter bar, and features a revolving reel with metal or plastic teeth to cause the cut crop to fall into the auger once it is cut. A variation of the platform, a \"flex\" platform, is similar but has a cutter bar that can flex over contours and ridges to cut soybeans that have pods close to the ground. A flex head can cut soybeans as well as cereal crops, while a rigid platform is generally used only in cereal grains.\n\nSome wheat headers, called \"draper\" headers, hi use a fabric or rubber apron instead of a cross auger. Draper headers allow faster feeding than cross augers, leading to higher throughputs due to lower power requirements. On many farms, platform headers are used to cut wheat, instead of separate wheat headers, so as to reduce overall costs.\n\nDummy heads or pick-up headers feature spring-tined pickups, usually attached to a heavy rubber belt. They are used for crops that have already been cut and placed in windrows or swaths. This is particularly useful in northern climates such as western Canada where swathing kills weeds resulting in a faster dry down.\n\nWhile a grain platform can be used for corn, a specialized corn head is ordinarily used instead. The corn head is equipped with snap rolls that strip the stalk and leaf away from the ear, so that only the ear (and husk) enter the throat. This improves efficiency dramatically since so much less material must go through the cylinder. The corn head can be recognized by the presence of points between each row.\n\nOccasionally rowcrop heads are seen that function like a grain platform, but have points between rows like a corn head. These are used to reduce the amount of weed seed picked up when harvesting small grains.\n\nSelf-propelled Gleaner combines could be fitted with special tracks instead of tires or tires with tread measuring almost 10in deep to assist in harvesting rice. Some combines, particularly pull type, have tires with a diamond tread which prevents sinking in mud. These tracks can fit other combines by having adapter plates made.\n\nThe cut crop is carried up the feeder throat (commonly called the \"feederhouse\") by a chain and flight elevator, then fed into the threshing mechanism of the combine, consisting of a rotating threshing drum (commonly called the \"cylinder\"), to which grooved steel bars (rasp bars) are bolted. The rasp bars thresh or separate the grains and chaff from the straw through the action of the cylinder against the concave, a shaped \"half drum\", also fitted with steel bars and a meshed grill, through which grain, chaff and smaller debris may fall, whereas the straw, being too long, is carried through onto the straw walkers. This action is also allowed due to the fact that the grain is heavier than the straw, which causes it to fall rather than \"float\" across from the cylinder/concave to the walkers. The drum speed is variably adjustable on most machines, whilst the distance between the drum and concave is finely adjustable fore, aft and together, to achieve optimum separation and output. Manually engaged disawning plates are usually fitted to the concave. These provide extra friction to remove the awns from barley crops.","timestamp_created":1397076172,"timestamp_updated":1397076224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53500974178314209","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9773524","author":{"steamid":"76561198110700070","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1813,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":319,"last_played":1587572758},"language":"brazilian","review":"SIMPLESMENTE INCRIVEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\npra quem conhece a historia do half-life sabe que vale muito apena jogar todos os jogos da saga\n\na historia √© muito interesante, o modo de jogo, os inimigos e aliados muito mais esspertos do qe no primeiro jogo, e √© claro que porque simplesmente √© \"o\" Half-life 2","timestamp_created":1397074007,"timestamp_updated":1397074138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9772808","author":{"steamid":"76561198046478517","num_games_owned":446,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1421,"last_played":1576349139},"language":"english","review":"Prepare for unforseen consequences...","timestamp_created":1397068149,"timestamp_updated":1397068149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9772144","author":{"steamid":"76561198033085455","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":438,"last_played":1431279399},"language":"russian","review":"–û—Ç–ª–∏—á–Ω–∞—è, –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–∞—è –∏–≥—Ä–∞! –†–µ–∫–æ–º–µ–Ω–¥—É—é!","timestamp_created":1397062615,"timestamp_updated":1397062615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570747196674346924","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9770960","author":{"steamid":"76561198107954402","num_games_owned":604,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1583283968},"language":"english","review":"Great needs more anime.","timestamp_created":1397053141,"timestamp_updated":1397053141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504504501819610596","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9769887","author":{"steamid":"76561198070289075","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":664,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":567,"last_played":1475914019},"language":"russian","review":"–∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–Ω–∞—è –∏–≥—Ä–∞, —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—É—é –≤—Å–µ–º","timestamp_created":1397043100,"timestamp_updated":1397043100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9767439","author":{"steamid":"76561198121217818","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1079,"last_played":1587405089},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games ever made.

(Damit meine Ich zum Beispiel, dass ein Pfeil auf der Karte, dir den Weg zeigt, wie bei Call of Duty). Die Physik ist sehr realistisch und es wurde m√∂glichst darauf geachtet das Spiel mit der Physik zu verbinden. Damit meine ich, dass Du bestimmte Objekte benutzen kannst, um dir einen Weg zu bauen, oder um mit Bestimmten Items, die Gegner t√∂ten kannst.. Die Story ist auch sehr gut, da es auch eine bestimmte Schwierigkeit im Spiel gibt. Du musst beispielsweise darauf achten, dass Du sparsam mit deiner Munition umgehst und das Du auch die richtige Waffe verwendest f√ºr einen bestimmten Gegner. Dies macht das Spiel sehr taktisch.

The AI is a strong point, and although there is little variety of enemies, you don't have a repetitiveness feeling while playing. The Source Engine needs no comments, even after almost 10 years of launching the graphics and physics effects are still convincing. The sound effects are also great.\n\nIt's in the plot that the game stands out even more, the story is great and is able to keep you immersed in the storyline like few games can, there is a good dose of mystery about some events and some of the most epic and charismatic characters. Gordon Freeman is arguably the most badass and emblematic protagonist of the gaming world, without even saying a single word. The secondary characters are also well-built and charismatic.\n\nI highly recommend for those who haven't played. In case of not having played the first and its expansions, is good to seek a source with information about the events prior to this title.\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1396335540,"timestamp_updated":1396335540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580333292484283447","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9688828","author":{"steamid":"76561197992217508","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1548727976},"language":"english","review":"OMG this was an awesome game i just beat it ending means theres gotta be a HL3 COMING OUT :D but no joke there is going to be a hl3 there has to be ending was a cliffhanger!","timestamp_created":1396297860,"timestamp_updated":1396297860,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9688428","author":{"steamid":"76561198117320524","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":925,"last_played":1423940446},"language":"russian","review":"–ò–≥—Ä–∞ - –æ–≥–æ–Ω—å. –ñ–¥—É —Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å—é —á–∞—Å—Ç—å.","timestamp_created":1396295150,"timestamp_updated":1396295150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm6XrjMUCfNb6JA=="}
