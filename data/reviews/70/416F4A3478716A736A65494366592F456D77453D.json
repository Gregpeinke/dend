From, the start you are being transported through the Black Mesa facility to help with this project they have been working on. Till everything goes downhill. Aliens began invading the facility. The scientists waited for help from the government. Instead the government start killing everything on site. So, it was up to you (Gordon Freeman) to destroy the Alien hive and there leader.

I played both the retail and steam version, and this pretty much is somewhat buchered. Of course they added things for next gen compatability but it's not bad, it's just missing things.\n\nStory : The story follows Gordon Freeman, a scientist that works with the Black Mesa institute as he goes to work in a test chamber to harness the power of Xen Crystals. The story follows the aftermath as Gordon has to move level to level in the facility to escape. - Story gets 8/10 for the plot, although it feels very basic. You learn more overtime though, which is a nice touch, and was one the earliest games to introduce story-telling with action and did it well.\n\nGameplay : The gameplay is pretty good. It's a FPS, and controls and responds well with a challenge. You have platforming and puzzle solving as well, along with a long range of 12 weapons to work with that all are pretty unique. NPC's are a thing with Scientists and Barneys, but they have a HORRIBLE AI, where they walk into walls and bump into things, which is the big issue. - 9/10. \n\nGraphics : The graphics are pretty standard. It's a nice asthetic throwback to the 90s with it's low-poly style, and aged well. Although there is an option for High-quality HD models from the Xbox port of the game (I think it's from this, I can't remember.), but I prefer the original. The problem though is that the HD models affect hitboxes such as headshots and certain bodyshots are a no-go. - 8/10.\n\nReplayablity : Replayablity is varied. You have some stuff you could go back to, such as Multiplayer but not much else, such as Deathmatch or whatever. - 6/10. \n\nOverall : I would rate it a 8/10. I would reccomend this for next-gen PCs, but the original retail is a version you would like. It has things that were removed and has a weird resolution, but it's better then this version. Although this is a great port, and it get's a 10/10, it's a classic that will never be forgotten.","timestamp_created":1521083006,"timestamp_updated":1640224034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.62595134973526001","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40820488","author":{"steamid":"76561198257411993","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1485,"last_played":1617679820},"language":"english","review":"jees\n\n","timestamp_created":1521078074,"timestamp_updated":1521078074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40820396","author":{"steamid":"76561198202828135","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":635,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":634,"last_played":1527303514},"language":"thai","review":"เกมส์โครตเก่า แต่ยังเก๋านะ สนุกเกมส์แนววิทยาศาสตร์ มี Zombie กับอีกหลายๆ เล่นเองจะรู้","timestamp_created":1521077617,"timestamp_updated":1521077617,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40818437","author":{"steamid":"76561198052524437","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":262,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":57,"last_played":1528068901},"language":"russian","review":"Классика... она вечна...","timestamp_created":1521066756,"timestamp_updated":1521066756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598540186882019043","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40806289","author":{"steamid":"76561198143091968","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1229,"last_played":1521022699},"language":"english","review":"go nuts dude!   if you wana see the game. try youtube  jack nexus :D i recorded my playthrough.","timestamp_created":1521025310,"timestamp_updated":1521025310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40806027","author":{"steamid":"76561198217904299","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":95,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":95,"last_played":1520421888},"language":"schinese","review":"这让人神魂颠倒的中文配音！","timestamp_created":1521024206,"timestamp_updated":1521024206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40804491","author":{"steamid":"76561198067350094","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4576,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1198,"last_played":1578715181},"language":"english","review":"This right here is the reason Steam even exists.","timestamp_created":1521016706,"timestamp_updated":1521016706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40802675","author":{"steamid":"76561198122175845","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50,"last_played":1656640001},"language":"spanish","review":"Xen.

Gordon Freeman, o protagonista, é apenas mais um dos empregados graduados no MIT que trabalha na poderosa Black Mesa Research Facility, mal sabia ele que o futuro da humanidade, daquele dia em diante, estaria em suas mãos. Chegando atrasado para o trabalho, Gordon é prontamente equipado com sua HEV, um ícone da série, e colocado na câmara de testes. Pórem algo dá profundamente errado e, numa Resonance Cascade, vários aliens do mundo de borda Xen são teleportados para  a Terra, atacando a instalação. Gordon, munido com seu pé de cabra e a proteção de sua suit, parte em busca de socorro para seus companheiros, sendo encaminhado para enfrentar uma entidade misteriosa, e por um fim na invasão. \nVamos às qualidades do game:\nPara a época (1998) Half Life revolucionava em muitos aspectos, com uma engine nova (a Gold Source), baseada na engine do Quake, apresentava uma dinâmica de gameplay inovadora e única, sendo apontado como revolucionário até os dias atuais.
