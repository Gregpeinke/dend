[/h1]\n\nOn a blog post from completely out of nowhere, Laidlaw, the brains behind arguably the greatest narrative driven FPS game of all time, released on his blog the final puzzle piece to the great mystery of the mythological Half-Life 3. A letter for the fans to finally settle the 10 year mental prison of confusion all gamers have undergone.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot place the entire letter here as Steam has a certain word limit for reviews (and believe me it is a pretty lengthy letter). Instead what I'll do is place the last paragraph of both versions of the letter here, the first original one with encrypted wording from Marc himself from his blog and the edited version with the names of the characters we all know and love edited by Jackathan on GitHub\n\nThe least I can do as a Half-Life fan and dedicated member of the community is post something here. I deserve no credit for this what so ever.\n\n\n\nThe link to his blog is right [url=http://www.marclaidlaw.com/epistle-3/] here [/url]. currently at the moment his blog is overflooded with traffic which goes to show how big these news are\n\n[url=https://github.com/Jackathan/MarcLaidlaw-Epistle3/] Here [/url] is the GitHub link as well\n\n\n\nFor all new members of the franchise, view at your own risk as this is one of the greatest narratives ever told in gaming. For everyone else, enjoy.\n\n[h1] Epistle 3 (Marc Laidlaw's original version) [/h1]\n\n[spoiler] And here we are. I spoke of my return to this shore. It has been a circuitous path to lands I once knew, and surprising to see how much the terrain has changed. Enough time has passed that few remember me, or what I was saying when last I spoke, or what precisely we hoped to accomplish. At this point, the resistance will have failed or succeeded, no thanks to me. Old friends have been silenced, or fallen by the wayside. I no longer know or recognize most members of the research team, though I believe the spirit of rebellion still persists. I expect you know better than I the appropriate course of action, and I leave you to it. Except no further correspondence from me regarding these matters; this is my final epistle.\n\nYours in infinite finality,\n\nGertrude Fremont, Ph.D. [/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1] Episode 3 (Jackathan's edited version) [/h1]\n\n[spoiler] And here we are.

Главная особенность второго эпизода — большие открытые пространства; лесная местность даёт игроку свободно путешествовать на новом автомобиле, а геймплей становится менее линейным: согласно задумке, с разнообразной тактикой ведения боя каждая битва будет непохожа на предыдущую. Кроме лесных территорий, игрок пройдёт заброшенные шахты, гнездо муравьиных львов и ракетную базу — все эти локации так же будут отличаться своей масштабностью. Во втором эпизоде нет такого сосредоточения на кооперативной игре, как в первом: хотя сюжетно игрок проходит всю игру вместе со своей напарницей Аликс Вэнс, во многих игровых событиях она по тем или иным причинам не принимает участия. Кроме Аликс, игроку предстоит сражаться бок о бок с дружественными вортигонтами. Сюжет эпизода начинается там, где заканчивается Episode One. После взрыва Цитадели поезд, на котором уезжали Гордон Фримен и Алик Вэнс, попадает под взрывную волну и терпит крушение. Им приходится добираться до главной базы Сопротивления — комплекса «Белая Роща» — своими силами. Главная цель — доставить в Белую Рощу данные, добытые в Цитадели, где содержатся секретные планы руководства Альянса, а также код частоты сверхпортала, образовавшегося над разрушенным Сити 17. Этот портал должен вновь прочно связать Землю и вселенную Альянса, что грозит человечеству приходом подкрепления инопланетных захватчиков и повторением Семичасовой войны. Однако, используя код частоты волны портала, у повстанцев есть возможность закрыть его при помощи ракеты со спутником, на котором установлен «зен-резонатор», запустив его из Белой Рощи. Но все усугубляется тем, что разведка Альянса обнаружила базу и туда уже направляется ударная армия. Фримен и Аликс вынуждены поторопиться, чтобы успеть доставить данные и предупредить повстанцев о надвигающейся угрозе.\nЗа графику 10/10.\nЗа Game Play 9/10.\nЗа Сюжет 10/10.\nМоя общая оценка 10/10.","timestamp_created":1502791537,"timestamp_updated":1502791537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.681830108165740967","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34249908","author":{"steamid":"76561198160428987","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":81,"playtime_forever":561,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1562265174},"language":"turkish","review":"ab episdoe 3 nrde bulamıorm","timestamp_created":1502776875,"timestamp_updated":1577737277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34242924","author":{"steamid":"76561198075208572","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":18,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1499439356},"language":"koreana","review":"이것도 좋아 하지만 3가 나온다면 존나 좋을거같아.다시 제작 발표하자 ㅈㅂ","timestamp_created":1502742571,"timestamp_updated":1502742571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34242482","author":{"steamid":"76561198000737014","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1920,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1896,"last_played":1642531465},"language":"english","review":"Just replayed for the 5th-ish time I think?\n\n3 things about this game:\n\n1) While Valve broadened their scope by making the game a little more non-linear (really just via the driving section and the finale boss fight), I think it's rather over-linearized in terms of how it plays out, moreso than other HL games. While playing this game the first time I often felt like there is only EXACTLY one very convenient solution to every problem (I get the feeling that this is played off as part of the G-Man's existence but that honestly feels like a cop-out). The gun level/ aka crouching yard full of zombies is a great example of how the EXACT PATH you must take is perfectly laid out even though it's supposed to be a \"messy\" place, from the exact path of starting to the grenade dropping finish. Other Valve games have similar features, but I definitely felt that this one was the most tightly \"scripted.\" \n\nTo that end, completing the game feels like an easy, easy task.\n\n2) That being said, it is the most refined, exciting and refreshing game I've ever played. It's so well done. The gameplay is as fun as anything I've ever played...and the sections are broken up so much more nicely than Half Life 2 (I love HL2 but it's repetitive compared to EP1 and EP2). \n\nIf uber-scripted moments are the tradeoff for this masterpiece of a game - I more than gladly accept. But I would love more obfuscating of what's actually occuring in-game to get me to my solution.\n\n3) Valve not releasing Half Life 3 (or whatever) is a travesty.

I love Steam because of Steam Link, controller and Steam plataform but not because of portal TF or half life ( i do like Portal 2 but i got stuck and never finished ) \n\nI wanted to say that because there is probably more than a million reviews and I come from a different background. Many say this was their childhood ( mine was metal gear, final fantasy, tekken and bascially playstation and early nintendo ) and in PC ( star craft, deus ex ), wanted to make my review more of observations than just saying pros and cons ect. \n\n1. Half Life is hard, compared to modern FPS, I played in easy and it was comparable to med\\hard in newer FPS. \n2. The game wants very badly to sell yo it's fisics, it's almost like a really long gravity gun demo. ( I like the gun and it's uses are innovative but sometiemes felt forced, like they are saying \" you could use guns I guess,,, but HERES A BIG BARREL OF GASOLINE with the gravity gun you'll make a big BOOM! \" )\n3. some of the weapons like tha basic pistol/shotgun and SMG are really uninspired and look like the were checking boxes in order to comply with FPS standards, ( I love the shotgun but it's just a very plan and boring looking shotgun ) \n4. The graphics don't age, I mean eventually they will age but overall the game is fine and good looking, it's amazing what some good fasescans and good art design can do, newer games should take notice ( or bethesda with their oldish models in their open world games ). some of the guns are the exception but overall everything is amazing. \n5. voice acting can be taken for granted but people should remember back when this game came out voice acting wasn't done by big hollywood actors, Voice acting was done and worked but considering the time I think the voice acting here is pretty amazing. considiering is not a new game even secondary actors sound really good. \n6. The level designs are ingenious, what makes them good is that they feel authentic you never feel like you are going just point A to point B they use great design and variaty of enemies and obstacles to make you feel like walking through a warehousue is interesting.  \n7. zombie variety is good, am not a fan of Zombies, but if I were i'd have to say the whole concepts of crabs detaching and sometiems attacking or just randomly walkig about  or crab tossing hosts makes for interesting and very dynamic zombie fighting. \n8. Alyx Vance is a solid hero, making her important in EP 1 and 2 was smart, I think she was ahead of her time a little bit, most heroine are not like her, she is not over sexualised, she is shown to be braved and not a damsel in distress and she is excellently voiced. \n9. The non speaking hero concept is old school so I don't hold it against the game but I belevie a talking Freeman would be better, because he is a scientist part of the concept of playing a high IQ character would be to have him talk give ideas or be a leader, he really just feels like a marine character following orders. \n10. I really like the no bosses concept of the game, it means they try harder to make the obstacles be the bosses not one specific character. \n11. G man is a daring character, and it's fourth wall breaking style gives the games story layer. BUT I hate ambiguity having a character just show up and say somewhat cryptic things and not really there  being anything else about him is strange.\n12. My original observation of this game without playing too far in it was that this game was famous for it's innovations ( gravity, facescans and voice acting to hollywood levels, inmersive sci fi plot ) than just for beign a good shooter. My observation were close but the one thing that suprised me was the puzzle/levels/obstacle designs, it's no Tomb Raider ( I dont think it was trying to be ) but considering it had to maintain a level of consistency ( running away in sewers, inside buildings, destroyed urban areas ) they were able to turn areas that didn't look like much into nice little plataform puzzle type sections and did it frequently enough that it breaks away from beign just heavy shooter. \n\nIf it wasn't for level design and the variety of enemies attacks i'd consider this game slightly Overrated, But when you consider how difficult it is even for todays games with higher budgets to do great level design, great graphics ( for it's time but pretty enough for now ), including a branching story and be challenging and I can confirm now that HL2 and it's sequels are the real deal. \n\nSo basically it is a really good game, great even and althou I wouldn't name my first born Freeman like some would, and my top favorite game list still unchanged ( witcher 3, Mass Effect 2, Last of us, Final Fantasy 6 and 7, dishonored 2) I would say to anyone that it's worth giving it a shot if you havn't at this point played it. \n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1502017207,"timestamp_updated":1502017207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34055654","author":{"steamid":"76561198293391696","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":8573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":638,"last_played":1657388982},"language":"turkish","review":"O kadar güzel ki heeepsini bitirdim.","timestamp_created":1502009325,"timestamp_updated":1502009325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34055536","author":{"steamid":"76561198240143344","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1624354258},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая игра моего детства))","timestamp_created":1502008837,"timestamp_updated":1502008837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34052145","author":{"steamid":"76561198384387182","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":76,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":76,"last_played":1500205967},"language":"schinese","review":"虽然是老游戏  但画质依旧感觉很nice","timestamp_created":1501992304,"timestamp_updated":1501992304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34048229","author":{"steamid":"76561198354992301","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":824,"last_played":1501973341},"language":"spanish","review":"Malditasea al final, joder.
