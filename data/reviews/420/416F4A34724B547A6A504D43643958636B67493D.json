In other words the plot has become so thin at this point that it's practically invisible. From fake out deaths, to Deus Ex Dog, swinging in and out whenever our protagonists need to be saved or get into trouble respectively. The entire plot line about G-man and and the Lovecraftian alien races at play remains completely untouched aside from a brief cameo by G-man who spurts out a cryptic phrase and that's it. Instead the plot is entirely on the incredibly boring resistance against the combine. The Mcguffin this time is launching a rocket and the entire game is \"run here to launch the rocket! Now run there to launch the rocket!\" There is no overarching plot and Gordon basically does as he is told, completing menial tasks that really don't relate at all to any larger story.\n\nThis could have been great, but instead it just ended up mediocre and forgettable.","timestamp_created":1594154943,"timestamp_updated":1594154943,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502013444900512695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72253716","author":{"steamid":"76561197992515893","num_games_owned":592,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":666,"last_played":1594153674},"language":"english","review":"The More Half-Life the more joy in life.

[/h1]\nHL2E2 Felt better than the first episode, because It didn't feel like it was mostly in the dark, There wasen't alot of new concepts and enemies to the game and the feel just felt like the close ending of The First ending. However HL2E2 said \"fuck it\" and just did something completly better than E1, they put you in a new environment, The forest, which brings a much better feel to the game. It introduced new enemies, and all around its one of the best Half Life Games I've played. Hands down I'd play it again.\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\nIts sad they're bad parts to this game. I felt the strider part was just way to tough even on easy mode, your constantly crashing into things and It becomes a paint when you die. The Hunters are tough as all hell making it harder to beat the striders, then you have to deal with those magnasums which you need to shoot at, while they are clinged onto an enemy thats moving.\nThat just sounds hard as hell.\n[h1] My opinion [/h2]\nThis is a must have game, its amazing, its fun.
