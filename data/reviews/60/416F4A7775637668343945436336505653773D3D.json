Luckily I got it in bundle. There are few servers running that actually have people playing. When you get onto one of those you relize that there are no dedicated servers for this game. Everyone on the server is running 100+ ping. Everyone is named Player for some reason and no one demonstrates any kind of skill in game. I ended up at the top of the leader boards within 2 minutes of joining a server, with 300 ping. Without anykind of tutorial or campaign your left to figure things out by yourself. I still don't understand what I'm doing but I guess I'm doing the right things because I'm destroying everyone on the server.\n\nWhen you get tired of playing laggy multiplayer, you want to play with some skilled bots.

All the servers are empty, the game mechanics and graphics are old and outdated, and it's just plain boring giving that the game has no \"bots\" option. I know it's a really old game, but seriously, I don't know why anyone would want to play this game anymore. It's like trying to play \"Chutes and Ladders\" or \"Bingo\" with your teenage friends. They probably haven't played those games in over 10 years and won't want to because they think its \"outdated\" or \"boring\" to them. I'd say the same for Counter-Strike for being an old game, but that game at least has an undieing community left from, even if the game came out BEFORE Ricochet. Ricochet though... yeah, there's not much of a big enough community that can sustain this game (If there was anything of a \"community\" left) Ricochet over the years wasn't able to keep the \"special key\" that's kept players STILL PLAYING Counter-Strike 1.6, and without that, well...\n\nSure, I bet when this game came out it was HUGE. I can see that with the amount of servers still operating even after over 15 years of this game being released. But like I said, they're empty. I think it's about time that we just lend our closures to this dead game and just focus on other games that have WAY more content than what Ricochet has to offer. Sure, it's innovative, original, and... JK, no. It's pretty much ripping off one of Tron's titles that involves \"throwing discs\" (except for the maps and map mechanics, that, at least, is very creative)\n\nOh, and BTW (sorry to say), this was probably the worst Valve game I've ever played.

Witcher Three has literally nothing on this.  Anyways when I was little boy I often dreamed of throwing discs at people and bouncing around.  Frisbee was a start but not what I truly desired.  Then I found it.  Ricochet.  Arguably the most graphicly intense game I've ever played.  You'll need at least two gigs of Ram.  And a GTX Titan Z.  Much like Ricochets gameplay, my review is bouncing all over the place.  Which brings me back to the flashback story.  After I tried Frisbee I found Ricochet.  But it took me years to build a monster capable of handling this beast.  And when I finally connected this year.   I WAS ASTOUNDED!  The community was so alive and large!  I found one player every sixty servers.  I was impressed at the hype and community that Valve had managed to build such an amazing fanbase.  They really should sue Tron but I think they take pity.  And with that I started playing a match.  It was like reaching enlightenment.  Discs were flying everywhere!  Left and right!  Even more left and right!  One perfect feature that adds to my immersion is the inability to throw discs up or down.  Because frankly that's just not how they were meant to be thrown.  Dank you Valve for this Magnum Opus of game development!   Final Verdict is a Yes out of Maybe.

From reviews I would've thought it's just one of those \"10 minutes at a time\" and at first that was true. For the first match I played. However, very soon after that, my friends bought Ricochet as well after seeing me play so we got into a server with about 15 other people and had the fun of our lives. It is highly addictive as nicotine. The graphics are nicely done for the time and never once did I think the game is ugly. There isn't much variety in the gameplay, but it is fun and you will come back to it daily. Good thing is that if you have friends this game is an ABSOLUTE BLAST and you will love it for however long you play it. One time I played the game for 100 minutes straight, until I realised I was playing too much.\n\nGet this game... NOW!\nAnd the game isn't dead, as the people say. It has a great community with really funny people, and sometimes the servers can have more than 15 players, and that is fucking chaos when you don't even know what is happening, but usually there's about 10 people playing overall, so bring your friends over and have fun.","timestamp_created":1451557703,"timestamp_updated":1451557703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20127710","author":{"steamid":"76561198254258744","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":87,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1562862327},"language":"russian","review":"игра крутая, но игроков мало.","timestamp_created":1451509803,"timestamp_updated":1451509803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20123759","author":{"steamid":"76561198091181672","num_games_owned":705,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":145,"last_played":1590251230},"language":"english","review":"What else is there to say other than game of the year.
