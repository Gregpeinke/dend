It's gaming experience is dark, viserally frightening and frequently so intense that it will have you looking over your shoulder just to confirm there isn't a zombie behind you.\n\nThat is why it is so incredibly awesome!\n\nSo, without any further delay here are my top 10 reasons for why you should definitely buy Left 4 Dead:\n\n1. The survivor characters are well thought out and very relatable.\n2. The game has excellent replayability, even in campaign mode.\n3. The achievements are carefully crafted, challenging and completely addictive.\n4. It does what a zombie game should do: scare the crap out of you.\n5. Multi-player is encouraged, rewarding but not always necessary.\n6. The varying difficulty levels actually make a difference (just look at my hours on expert)\n7. You can play as special infected in multiplayer mode!\n8. The level and campaign design is amazing.\n9. It's one of the best zombie FPS games ever.\n10. It's just so much bloody fun!\n\nMy only criticism is that sometimes the available weaponry options feel restricted and limited, but that just adds to the challenge.\n\nYou don't just play Left 4 Dead, you experience Left 4 Dead.\n\nSo experience it today!","timestamp_created":1385528278,"timestamp_updated":1385528313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":55,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.785337626934051514","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7777482","author":{"steamid":"76561198038910835","num_games_owned":3520,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":15241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14583,"last_played":1573560239},"language":"spanish","review":"Está prohibido no tener este juego.\nEl modo versus es lo mejor!","timestamp_created":1385513402,"timestamp_updated":1385513402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612388670444488525","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7774837","author":{"steamid":"76561197979979604","num_games_owned":1552,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":516,"last_played":1362988800},"language":"english","review":"Most multiplayer cooperative games require all players to be more or less in the same level.

Even if you play it single, there are so good (and funny) dialogues that feel some kind of deeply socialised partnership. Actually, after few trials you somehow know that you are usual member of the \"apocalypticcy survibal crew\" . \nAdditionally, every NPC has own style, personality, and recognizable value system, belief and precipously portretet character. NPC-s are never boring, you'll not noticed any kind of fepetitioning sequence, even if I recognized appropriate sentence, because it is usually happened in a kind of new situation.\nAlso, this game is somehow react on your way of playing, so sonmetimes you'll find a lot of unexpectzed situation - as you usuali have on higher level. In my opinion this is very good, because on that way game cannot become a kind of boring content.\nI warmly  recommend L4D to any gamer (not only to FPS lover, 'cause I'm personally NOT FPS lover...)), In my opinion, L4D1 is bacsed on deeply humanisticly oriented game, warm stoy of usual humans, who give us a hope, even that things go worse. \n\nAččthough it seems to be uncorrest - but legitimate - previously written L4D1 recomendation CANNOT be used as a concept of L4D2 RECOMENDATION, but rather as very opposite.
