The game retains all of the game play elements from Portal 1 and adds lots of new features such as bridges made from light beams, and splashing paint gel which accelerate your speed or make you jump higher. \n\nIn the single player campaign, you play as Chell. As with the original Portal, your character can take a small amount of damage before they die, thankfully like the original you don't take fall damage still. The aim of the story mode is to explorer the Aperture Science Lab, which is filled of complex puzzles that have a clear exit point, but there are also other parts of the game which are not so clear leaving the objects less clear.\n\nThe tutorial at the start of the game explains all of the game play elements very well and gets you well prepared for the on coming puzzles; and whenever there is a new element introduced, the game does a very good job of making you aware what it does without shoving a tutorial screen in your face every time.\n\nPortal 2 is powered by the Source engine, like all of Valve's more recent releases (Half Life 2, Left 4 Dead, TF2), and it looks stunning. You will find it hard nowadays to find a game that looks as well polished as Portal 2, all of the colours, textures and visual effects are done perfectly. \n\nStory-wise is the feature in Portal 1 that I thought it fell down on, however in Portal 2 they knocked it out of the park. It follows on from the story line set in the original and goes beyond the level of detail and complexity that you would expect. I needed to find out how it ended once I started playing, and the ending is just beautifully crafted. \n\nThe difficulty is like most puzzle games, if you are good at them, it will just come naturally. It definitely has a better difficulty curve when compared to the original, but even still at times I had to revert to a walkthrough to pass through some puzzles (shame on me eh?) but there is nothing here that can't be solved if you sit and think for a couple of minutes each time.\n\nThe single player story mode took me about seven hours to complete, this to me is a perfect length for a game of this type, the game ends at a high point and I was 100% satisfied with the outcome. There is also a co-op campaign included which will also add a good number of hours.

While the game has a serious tone, the dialogue is absolutely hilarious.\n\nThis is a much longer game than the original.
