Что начинает надоедать? тогда вот тебе пулемет на катер, с ним веселее! И под любую механику подкидывают разнообразные уникальные ситуации! Органично вписаное обучение. Мы даем тебе грави пушку, а следом за ней идет целый уровень где ты вдоволь сможешь потренироваться орудовать с ней, распиливая зомби напополам пилами! И так везде! \nЕдинственное что не прошло проверку времени так это музыка. Может это субъективно, но по мне саунд здесь просто отвратный.

This is the type of game that paved the way for modern games that we see nowadays. Triple-A titles only hope to have half of the success that Half-life 2 had. Ever since the success of Half-Life 2 fans were eagerly waiting for Half-Life 3 but it has never been announced. Perhaps because the game's developer — Valve knows that they will let down its players because they can't make a game better or even as good as Half-life 2. Still, to this day, Half-life 2 never ceases to amaze me.\n\nHalf-life 2's gameplay is groundbreaking when the game first released. A perfect mix of action and solving puzzles with every puzzle having different characteristics and difficulty. The most memorable, a weight puzzle that needed heavy objects and upon completion would raise a ramp that the player could jump across with their vehicle. Although I admit, some puzzles plagued me for a while and I was forced to look it up. The AI is quite advanced for its time, enemies soldiers try to flank your position and lay down covering fire. I am surprised by at least a dozen of awesome environments to play in, ranging from cities, sewers, deserts and even an enormous 2,569-meter tall tower called \"The Citadel\". This tower dwarfs the Burj Khalifa which is currently the tallest building on Earth at 828 meters. The setting of the game is amazingly interesting. It takes place in a world that has been conquered by an inter-dimensional organization called the Combine, where its goal is to dominate and enslave the whole Multiverse. On Earth, they do this by manufacturing 17 machines and soldiers. They also make use of 11 alien species. These are the enemies that the player is forced to fight against. The more interesting of these include: huge spider-like machines, headcrabs that aim to jump onto Human heads and take their control of their bodies and zombify them, an alien species that hide deep in sand awaiting prey, a ball-type mine that follows vehicles and an aerial robot that uses its saw to cut up enemies. This seems like the resistance has an impossible task. However, not everything brought by the Combine are enemies. The previously enslaved Vortigaunts, are an intelligent alien species that allied themselves with the resistance to fight against the combine. To have a chance against the Combine, the player fights with many weapons. Starting from ineffective weapons such as a crowbar and a pistol to pulse-rifles, rocket launchers and the iconic gravity gun that has the ability to manipulate gravity of certain objects. This can be used as a weapon and usually the most fun and outrageous way to kill an enemy. This is why half-life fans adore this iconic weapon.

Игре уже 14 лет, однако при этом она до сих пор держит высокую планку качества.\n\nИгра является продолжением первой части. Спустя несколько лет, G-man вовращает Гордона из стазиса, решив его использовать в своих целях. За время отсутствия Фримена, прошли довольно глобальные изменения в мире. Планета была захвачена могущественной инопланетной организацией, именуемой Советом Альянса. Большиство людей, стали жертвами и рабами захватчиков, однако были и те кто пытался сопротивлятся. Небольшие отряды повстанцев, не теряли надежду спастись и вернуть Землю обратно. Роль главного повстанца сыграет бывшый сотрудник научного комлекса Black Mesa.\n\nПервое, что на тот момент бросалось в глаза, это новый движок Source. Помимо прекрасной графики, крутой анимации, движок имел отличную техническую составляющую. Большая качественная работа была проведена с физикой. Все предметы, оружие, техника, повинуются физике, с учётом их массы, трения и силы тяжести. На этой основе сделано немало различных простеньких головоломок.\n\nТем не менее игра является классическим представителем жанра шутер от первого лица. Так же игра сохранила все классические традиции первой части. К примеру за действиями игры, мы наблюдаем исключительно из глаз главного героя, без каких то видео-вставок или разрыве во времени. Так же Гордон Фримен молчит на протяжении всей игры. Ну и конечно загадка серии номер один, таинственый человек в костюме с кейсом.\n\nПо части геймплея, игра нам предлагает куда больше разноообразия нежели первый HL. И если в первом, место действия в основном проходило на територрии научного комплекса в пустыне, где большую часть времени, игрок проводил в стенах лаборатории, то во второй части, разнообразие локаций на порядок выше. Захваченый, полуразрушенный город восточной европы, побережье, мрачный атмосферный городок Рейвенхольм, тюрьма, огромная Цитадель. Все эти места помимо всего прочего, красиво воссозданы, а в некоторых прекрасно передана атмосфера(Рейвенхольм).\n\nЕсли в первой части основными противника были инопланетные существа, в перемешку с солдатами, посланными на зачистку лаборатории, то во второй таковыми являются солдаты Альянса. Сражениям с зомби и другими существами уделено куда меньше времени. Тем не менее игра постоянно держит в напряжении, а качественно поданый геймплей и продуманный сюжет мотивируют играть не прерываясь, до самого конца.\n\nКроме основной геймплейной составляющей игры, а именно перестрелки с врагами и убийство мутантов, игра так же предлагает нам и другие развлечения. Часто встречаются не сложные, однако вполне продуманые логические задачки, нам дадут возможность покататся на багги по побережью и на воздушной подушке по каналам города.\n\nВ игре не много оружия, однако представленных экземпляров вполне хватает, для того чтобы устроить настоящий беспредел на улицах Сити 17. Хотя модели оружия другие, однако типы и виды остались такими же. Ломик, пистолет, дробовик, атомат, арбалет, базука и гранаты. Однако, ещё было добавлено устройство под названием Грави-пушка, которая полностью заменяет все функции ломика. Теперь один из символов Half-Life, стал самым бесполезным предметом в инвентаре Гордона.\n\nНесмотря на то, что большую часть игры прийдется ходить в одиночестве, и сражаться с врагами собственными силами, во второй части у нас будут союзники. Это некоторые повстанцы, Аликс и её Пёс, и даже Муравьиные львы. Сам же AI был намного лучше проработан. Как враги так и союзники вели себя вполне адекватно. Редко когда замечал баги или какие то проблемы с этим.\n\nОтличная игра, прекрасное продолжение серии, красивая графика, реалистичная физика, хорошо продуманный сюжет и яркие персонажи.\n\nОценка: 10/10","timestamp_created":1515881852,"timestamp_updated":1515881852,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.666898250579833984","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39321876","author":{"steamid":"76561198239529514","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":824,"last_played":1515881083},"language":"english","review":"A great sequel with better plot and more weapons.
