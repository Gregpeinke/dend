It is a masterpiece of video game story telling and all those things other people said.\n\nThe above being said there's no reason you shouldn't get this game right now. \n\nThe one down side worth mentioning is the combat and loot system. The former is hampered by the open world nature - you end up with grainy long range combat or close up melee combat so close you can't really tell what you are doing, which some probably consider a quirk of this series. The other issue is the loot system. Again part of the series but the scrounging everywhere for health and coin gets old and breaks immersion.","timestamp_created":1562904917,"timestamp_updated":1562904917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54046459","author":{"steamid":"76561198061579842","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":812,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":812,"last_played":1562903028},"language":"english","review":"There is BioShock and Bioshock 2  completely god tier games and then theres Bioshock:Poopoopeepee special edition.\n\nThe game is not Bioshock at all besides the wack lore that I bet your going to hate after you go ghost hunting with mom. Theres no reward or feedback when upgrading weapons and the perks are now in some stupid wardrobe you cant even see. The weapons and wizard juices all suck and are uncreative with almost all of them having the same stupid trap system your never going to use. They removed medkit inventory so you can only heal from the bannana you found on some dead guy. Instead of being able to rush or tank through your precisous medkits you saved up you now are playing a duck and cover game waiting for your urine sheild to take a bullet and hit again or you might need to eat another bannana.\nDLC more like erectile disfunction my god. They ruined everything every little chance of making it good and just slaped it like a new born ready for the frier. They put freaking stealth missions in bioshock that are manditory in b i o s h o c k.

I wanted to tell someone what I thought, but for a moment I had absolutely no idea. I'd experienced a kind of excited panic, then total delight, then momentary confusion, and then a rush of extraordinary sights, powerful scenes and sudden twists that left me struggling to keep up.\n\"The plot really does jump the shark. It jumps a lot of sharks. It jumps BioShark Infinisharks\"\nInfinite is wonderful. Every single person who can play it, should play it. It's a fascinating and gruesomely fun adventure in a genuinely unique, magnificent place. But the plot really does jump the shark. It jumps a lot of sharks. It jumps BioShark Infinisharks. That's not uncommon in cinematic first-person shooters, but I mention it now because the game's mysteries are such a big part of its appeal.\nYou're on a flying city of magical racists in 1912, and that soon drops to being only the fifth or sixth most puzzling thing about your situation. Who are those two? Why are they talking about me? What's with the giant cyborg bird? What does AD stand for? How does he know... why does she think... when did they... why can I shoot crows from my hands? And how do these pants help me reload?\nThe intro says you're Booker DeWitt, a private investigator tasked with retrieving a girl named Elizabeth. But I played more like a crazed amnesiac looter, scouring the city for spare change and story clues. In cheerful contrast to the original BioShock's deep-sea madhouse, the flying city of Columbia is still thriving, still beautiful, and still populated – albeit with magical racists. That means it can give you little pieces of these puzzles in more interesting ways, and hoovering them up into a wonky jigsaw is a joy.\n\"You get to know Columbia as a tourist: a dazzling dream of an impossible city in an impossible place – tranquil, prosperous and happy.\"\nI think it still would have been, even if a tear had opened in the fabric of spacetime and future alterno-Tom, stroking his goatee, had told me that the plot ultimately doesn't add up. So I'm telling you in the hope that you'll still enjoy the process of assembling that wonky jigsaw, without being quite so disappointed when the game itself cuts all the nobbly bits of the pieces so it can cram them together the way it wants to.\nReally, it's just a pleasure to have a game this substantial to explore – and one that gives you the breathing room to do so. You still spend a lot of time killing things in BioShock Infinite, but it knows when to give you space. You get to know Columbia as a tourist: a dazzling dream of an impossible city in an impossible place – tranquil, prosperous and happy.\nShops, blocks and districts waft wonkily through the air, listing as they cruise in to dock with each other. Bells chime, children play, locals picnic. There's a fair on, and everyone's out in their 1912 Sunday best. The sun is dazzling, the views are breathtaking, and everyone you meet is chattering happily. As heavy metal clamps lock a tailor's shop in place, I realise the times on the sign outside aren't their opening hours: they're arrivals and departure times.\nYour arrival is one of gaming's few truly perfect scenes: a chapel, floors awash with holy water, stone walls echoing with the calming harmony of a gospel choir. Stained glass dioramas flood the space with brilliant gold light, and the heat from a hundred candles creates a gentle haze. The only hint that you're not actually in the afterlife is an occasional, very distant clanking, as some chunk of the city drifts against its restraints. It's more than atmospheric; it's exquisite. That kind of ridiculous artistic flair runs throughout: staggering works of sculpture, transformative use of light, perfectly judged ambience, and music that both nods to the plot and subtly changes the mood. The mileage this game gets out of the song Will The Circle Be Unbroken alone – all four times it's used – deserves some kind of award.\n\"Your arrival is one of gaming's few truly perfect scenes\"\nColumbia is a less restrictive setting than BioShock's Rapture, and each district has a different vibe. That makes your adventure through it fascinating, and each new area exciting to discover. Even close to the end, you're visiting remarkable new places with radically different moods.\nI keep wanting to say that it's 'directed' brilliantly, the elements fit together so well. But that's not the right word, because the other thing it does well is keeping you in control. There are no cutscenes, no switching to third person, no agency-limiting tropes like mounted gun sections. The few times you're not free to move are generally when your character physically wouldn't be.\nMaintaining that respect for the player, even when you need to tell a character-driven story, is a rare and wonderful thing. Like Half-Life 2, Infinite doesn't feel like a game made by frustrated filmmakers. It feels like a game made by people who know how to make films, and decided to make something else.\nEarly on, the times when combat does break out are the low points. There seems to have been some internal rule against adding any exotic weapons, so Infinite's guns stick religiously to convention: pistols, shotguns, three types of machinegun, rifles, grenade launchers and a rocket launcher. None of them let you choose an ammo type the way BioShock did, and only the revolver and shotguns are really satisfying to use. Those aren't available in the early fights, when guns are your primary tools.\n\nIt gets better the more you drink. You acquire magical abilities by downing Vigors, which come in beautiful custom bottles relating to what they do. A lot of the early ones just let you disable and damage a group of enemies – by swarming them with crows, setting fire to them, or floating them into the air. But they get more interesting.\n\"There seems to have been some internal rule against adding any exotic weapons, so Infinite's guns stick religiously to convention\"\nCharge lets you dash to a group of enemies and hit them with explosive force. Return to Sender absorbs incoming damage while you hold the button, then releases it as a projectile when you let go. Undertow can knock enemies back with a wave of water – often the end of your day, in a flying city. Or you can hold the button down to reach out with Donnie Darko-style tendrils and yank distant snipers to your doorstep. The water even holds them still while you line up a headshot.\nSome of them form natural combos: soaking wet Undertow victims are really hoping that you're not going to- oh, you're electrocuting them before they can get up, classy. Enemies currently being pecked to death would like to request that you don't set the crows... well, they're on fire now, but for future reference.\nThere are only eight Vigors, and they're all free when you find them. You only specialise when you buy upgrades: expensive but significant perks for each, some of which introduce new rules.\nI wasn't wild about Murder of Crows until I bought the perk that creates a nest every time someone dies during the pecking process. If anyone steps on it, that nest erupts in a new flock of crows. If anyone dies during that crow storm, you get new nests! Plenty of fights involve new waves of enemies flooding into the same area, and this self-perpetuating cycle of flapping and screaming and dying is a guilty pleasure.\nYou can tweak your abilities a little more with Gear – like the aforementioned pants that mysteriously help you reload. I also carry three magical hats, two spare shirts, a spare pair of shoes, and I've now upgraded to pants that make me explode when I land from a great height.\nThe system is insane and wildly incongruous, but it does allow for some entertaining configurations. If someone walks into one of my crow traps, I can then land on them to set the crows ablaze. If they try to hit me, my hat electrocutes them.

В первый раз эмоции били через край, второй раз было чуть менее ярко. И все же - игра потрясающая. Придумать такой наркоманский сюжет, и чтобы он понравился..сценарист заслужил свой хлеб. Боевка проста, и тем не менее - это чуть ли не единственный шутер, который я прошел с удовольствием. Элизабет - одна из лучших союзниц-напарников, прекрасно ее прописали. Стрелять весело и просто, жаль, что с собой таскать можно не больше двух пушек. Оружие можно  улучшать, система с супер способностями прикольная, хоть мне понравилось использовать лишь одну-две из них. Авторы игры молодцы - разбавляют стрельбу диалогами с Лиз, в игре полно интересных сценок. \nПомню, когда играл в первый раз в игре были два неплохих дополнения. Их тоже советую заценить тем, кому понравился Инфинит.","timestamp_created":1562571297,"timestamp_updated":1562571297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53956250","author":{"steamid":"76561198323650581","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":854,"last_played":1559938669},"language":"schinese","review":"作为一款单机游戏，在我看来只有2个方面可以打动玩家的心，一个是游戏性，另一个就是叙事性。(群嘲一波美末2)\n而生化奇兵无限将这两者完美的糅合在了一起，\n游戏性方面作为一款2003年的游戏，虽无法再与2020年的华丽大作们拼画面和玩法，但作为一个FPS突突突游戏完全是合格的。\n叙事性方面更是无敌，从一开始的追踪敌人，解救小女孩，到玩家满脑疑惑的一路探寻，再到最后的解开身世，豁然开朗，剧情环环相扣，紧紧抓着玩家的心，着实让我惊艳无比。\n\n感谢这14个小时的陪伴，感谢伊丽莎白的救赎。","timestamp_created":1562570237,"timestamp_updated":1593417913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53955132","author":{"steamid":"76561198428812971","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":45,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1562653750},"language":"schinese","review":"原来是小屏幕的，后来变全屏之后就进不去了，进游戏就闪退到桌面，游戏还在的，但是就会闪退到桌面，有啥办法没","timestamp_created":1562565706,"timestamp_updated":1562565706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53954416","author":{"steamid":"76561198187547557","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1610550662},"language":"spanish","review":"el mejor juego que he jugado se lo recomiendo muchisimo <3","timestamp_created":1562562540,"timestamp_updated":1606427022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53954347","author":{"steamid":"76561198305935923","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1630358830},"language":"brazilian","review":"Esse jogo é simplesmente incrível","timestamp_created":1562562207,"timestamp_updated":1562562207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53952821","author":{"steamid":"76561198215962168","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":6757,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1527,"last_played":1609034941},"language":"brazilian","review":"simplesmente sensacional.
