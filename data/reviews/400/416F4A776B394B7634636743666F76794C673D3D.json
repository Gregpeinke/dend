Amazing graphics considering the time period and the selective breeding mechanics are unrivaled even to this date. Definitly one of those epics that ages well with time. Plot line is a bit shaky in places and some of the games logic isnt really explained, but that doesnt stop Portal from being a great game. Once you beat the game you get access to extra levels, as well as having to play the existing levels in Gaben mode, which sets specific challenges you have to meet.

The writing in this game is top notch and the puzzle progression is at a good pace so you always feel slightly more challenged than the prior puzzle. It is a pretty short game in terms of start to finish playthough, but it has a lot of extra challenge rooms and achievments to tackle when you are done. If you can get it for under $10 it is worth the money to buy it.","timestamp_created":1412032738,"timestamp_updated":1412032738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12294582","author":{"steamid":"76561198083574984","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":390,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1427439285},"language":"english","review":"My favorite puzzle game so far","timestamp_created":1412030598,"timestamp_updated":1412030598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12294289","author":{"steamid":"76561198032788858","num_games_owned":1104,"num_reviews":678,"playtime_forever":197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1343804400},"language":"russian","review":"Кулинарный гайд.\n\nОтличнейшая головоломка, в которой уклон делается на взаимодействие с вашей лучшей компьютерной подругой - Glados. Именно за счёт этого все трудности преодолеваются на ура, ибо с нетерпением жаждешь услышать следующую шуточку от ИИ. 19 головоломок, плюс крайне неожиданный конец, плюс дополнительные усложнённые миссии ждут ваших решений.

Simply put, this game is amazing. The first person gameplay grants a unique perspective as you attempt to solve various puzzles using your Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. This is far more than simply a puzzle game, however. As you progress through the game, you will receive instructions and advice from an Artificial Intelligence named GLaDOS. It is this interaction, as well as the dark twist the game takes about halfway through, that has made Portal the classic that it is today. The only weakness this game has is how short it is; a dedicated player will be able to complete the game in less than 3 hours. Never fear, completionists will still have plenty to do as beating the game the first time unlocks multiple challenge stages which either change certain elements of the level for increased difficulty or require you to solve the puzzle in the fewest steps, shortest time, or with the fewest portals.\n\nIn conclusion, everyone should play this game. Since Steam keeps dropping the price, there is no excuse not to and anyone who considers themselves a true gamer needs to have this classic under their belt. The cake is a lie.","timestamp_created":1412024345,"timestamp_updated":1412024345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12293458","author":{"steamid":"76561198050212463","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1412708975},"language":"english","review":"This is one of my favourite games, quick to learn the controls.
