The addition of the backstory behind the aperture science facility and the narration from the characters really made this game.

Portal 2 is essentially the same as portal 1, but now a full AAA title, a bigger story, a fantastic well written antagonist, great humor and atmosphere. There are some new game play added, but the idea is still the same -  Get out of the (areas) by using the portal gun. Some puzzles are really quite clever.\n\nIf you like the first portal, you must have this one too. Now it also has a co-op game and steam-workshop that ads a lot to the game, but the campaign alone is well worth the price of the admission.\n\nEven though the source engine might be a little dated, it still works absolutely perfect in this game. I never found myself thinking the game was old. What the games is trying to achieve, it does really well. It is quite a gloomy and sad place in a way, even though there is lots of clever and fun humor.\n\nI found myself coming back to the game at times, even though I have completed it. It just feels nice to complete again, and the antagonist(s) is(are) that good you don't mind hearing her(him) again.\n\nRuns well on most PCs and still manages to look great. I have no complains about this game. It is a very smooth experience.

Move, jump and hold item. That's it.\nThese controls could be explained to a monkey. And he would understand it perfectly.\nBut that is a good thing. Better to keep the controls simple.\n\nThe game itself, Is an improved version of portal 1. Some added gameplay features. But what was the biggest add-on was a full length story. Portal 1 had a nice story, but it was short.\nPortal 2. Is like 10 portal 1's in one. Lengthy story that gives you more insight on who Glados is. Who you are, And how Aperture science, became Aperture science. \nAnd it does with new amazing gameplay elements, like Jump pads. Gels, Lazer beams, Gravity beams and i could continue. \nBut the best thing this game does it it's learning cuve. It start fairly simple. and slowly grows. Each new chapter gives you something new. And then it spends some time giving you the chance to familarize with it. Then adds some previous elements. before going to a new element to the game. It's nice because you aren't thrown into a big puddle of mess straight away.\n\nThe story is just amazing.\nI could talk about the story for hours. But I won't\nthe story has humor, something a lot of game stories lack these days. And this is it's strongest point, storywise. Witty new jokes, that sometimes even could go unnoticed. But will make you laugh each time you hear it. \nThe characters in the game are just there to love.\nEven Shell, she doesn't say a word. You just get attached to it. And the best thing is. Each character. no matter how minor. plays an important role in the game. Even as small as a raven play a big role in the games story. This certainly wasn't something that was overdone.\n\nReplayability.\nIt endless.\nIt litteraly is.\nPlaying the story missions a couple of times is always fun. Just to hear the witty comments about combustible lemons makes me laugh each time.\nBut also the Steam community adds to the replayability. Each day tons of new levels get uploaded to try. Some pure gold, Others should be buried under a deep pile of.... well you can finish it.\nBut just playing a level someone else created is amazing. Some just let you think in a completely different way. This is a good thing.\n\nAll and all.\nGreat game. Great story, great replay value. Even if it would cost €100, it would still be worth his money.","timestamp_created":1388024864,"timestamp_updated":1388024864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8284305","author":{"steamid":"76561198068369003","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":139,"playtime_forever":677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":677,"last_played":1388015448},"language":"russian","review":"chell  ay lav yu giz","timestamp_created":1388023755,"timestamp_updated":1388023755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482725232839584351","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8284096","author":{"steamid":"76561197996137132","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":5539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1097,"last_played":1614813209},"language":"brazilian","review":"Very nice!","timestamp_created":1388023235,"timestamp_updated":1388023235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8283832","author":{"steamid":"76561198090816610","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1041,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1041,"last_played":1388025424},"language":"english","review":"After I played original Portal game, I knew I'll buy the second game!
