is what happens when a perfect combination of narrative, level design, gameplay and interactivity meet. Not to mention the (at the time) mind blowing graphics. This is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of all of Valve's work and truly one of the greatest games I've played as of yet. It simply does everything right- the story keeps you immersed and the characters are all memorable, with dialogue and cinematics being one of the most interesting parts of the game, other than being just a break from combat (which happens all too often nowadays). The gunplay feels just right, and every weapon in your ever-increasing arsenal is great in its own way- different situations will call for different weapons. The gravity gun deserves mentioning though, as it is just pure awesome and allows you to truly use your environment to your advantage (hurling explosive barrels, slicing through enemies with sawlades, throwing enemy grenades back, etc.). There are also no cutscenes- every single event takes place through the eyes of Mr. Freeman, which is an approach that Valve absolutely nailed. As I mentioned before, the game continuously encourages environment interaction, and not just with the gravity gun. The clever puzzles throughout the game are an example of this. The enemy variety and artificial intelligence is also incredible. All in all, an amazing game. And, as a side note, WE WANT A SEQUEL ALREADY!!!!","timestamp_created":1395340413,"timestamp_updated":1402897966,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9573834","author":{"steamid":"76561198126037117","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":643,"last_played":1395333444},"language":"russian","review":"Великая игра .

Pourtant, c'est de loin celui qui, encore aujourd'hui, vous donne une impression de liberté de mouvement jamais égalé. Les nouveaux joueurs pourront prendre leur temps pour assimiler le gameplay et les anciens se jeteront dedans tête la première et parcoureront les niveaux avec une aisance familière, presque abusive par rapport aux standarts des FPS d'aujourd'hui.\n\nCe jeu vous mets dans la peau d'un homme de sciences devenu légende suite aux évènements du premier jeu. On y parcourt les niveaux au level design travaillé et aux situations et personnages mémorables avec des phases de shoot ainsi que des moments calmes propices à l'exploration et à la résolution de puzzles simplistes mais originaux.\nLa particularité de ce jeu passe d'ailleurs par son moteur physique atypique puisque basé sur une version modifié du Havok pourtant très utilisé ailleurs. Mais ici, c'est différent sur un aspect bien particulier. principalement le simple fait qu'il soit possible d'empiler des objets les uns sur les autres et de pouvoir interragir avec qans que ça soit le bordel... Oui, ça semble ridicule mais pourtant, très peu de jeux à ma conaissance permetent une telle chose sans causer de gros soucis.\n\nBref, ce jeu est une bouffée de fraicheur dans le monde du FPS que je recomande à tout le monde d'essayer. En plus il est régulièrement à 2€ bordel...
