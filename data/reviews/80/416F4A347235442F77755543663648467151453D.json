Condition Zero is a bare bones, single player focused mod of the famous Counter-Strike mod for Half-Life. There are a total of 18 missions (not including ones made by users) that you can tackle along with 4 difficulty settings. Each mission is set on a different map and the variety of locales is definitely a plus. There are three objectives for each mission and in order to complete the mission you must accomplish the objectives AND beat the Terrorists by at least 2 rounds. However, the AI can be completely wonky at times which is more of a detriment to you than the opponent (especially on the later missions when the teams are unbalanced, e.g. 8 vs. 6). It can be pretty infuriating losing because the AI spent 30 seconds crouched in a corner then walks right by a person from the enemy team without even noticing them. Due to this, trying to complete the later difficulties is an extreme undertaking and requires a great deal of skill to carry your team to victory while still accomplishing all the objectives. Especially since the objectives change with each difficulty setting and some of the later ones are ridiculous (e.g. \"get a kill with a knife and survive the round\", or \"kill an enemy blinded from a flashbang and survive the round\"). Overall, it's a fun unique experience for fans of the original Counter-Strike that are looking for a more single player oriented game, but that does not make up for the lack of content and poor AI. \n\n6.5/10\n\nNow as for the Deleted Scenes portion....that part is fantastic. You play through 12+ missions each with specific objectives and settings that are surprisingly detailed (for the time this game was released). The set-pieces and little reactions some of the enemies have as they die, such as plummeting out of a window to fall on and be impaled by a spire, are really a great touch. This is where the love and care went when this game was made.

It's very simple. But, I enjoyed it a lot since building your team up from just you and a few chumps is fun, I like the basic little stats system, and I think it's a shame that the game gives you so much money to play with that you never need to do eco rounds or anything, and it seems that there's no 'campaign' for terrorists, just CTs, but... ultimately, it's fun.\n\nAs long as you're interested in just playing some bots for a while, it's fun, maybe a good warmup. Very simple. I beat all of the 'tours of duty' and none of them were very hard, I think the AI tries to make up with its lack of skill with quantity, so you can very easily counter them by picking the highest skill level guys. If you're lucky, they can even solo rounds for you, as long as you do teh challenges.\n\nBelow is my review for Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes\n\nPretty fun singleplayer campaign, but it gets pretty repetitive and it feels like instead of the developer plotting and planning out a long string of missions to put together, everyone in the team just made a bunch of assets and then everyone went off and did their own thing.\n\nThere's a few issues.\n\nThe difficulty across missions is just all over the place, there's no ramp, some missions are hard, some are super easy. It's rare, but sometimes you'll actually just have to keep reloading saves or even reload a save from earlier in the mission if you have a hard time with something you didn't expect.\n\nOne example is the missile launcher guys. One shot from those guys is enough to basically force you to reload your save, either because you just died instantly to them or because your hp and armor are so low you're about to die anyway. The only instance I found this wasn't the case, I think, is the very last mission where there's a few missile launcher guys, but all of them are firing at you generally in locations where they won't hit something behind you. The real problem is the GIGANTIC explosion. It's just a pain since often you'll be reloading more than a handful of times.\n\nThe missions are all designed pretty well, I think, but again since it was clearly just a bunch of guys building a random assortment of levels, there's actually a lot of overlap between missions. There's quite a few missions where you have to chase down a target and shoot him until he dies. In one case, you actually have to cheese him by like nudging left and right while in cover so he doesn't fire on you while you just repeatedly headshot him. There's only a couple of stealth missions and they don't even remain stealth for very long.\n\nThe tutorial outlines a very large variety of gadgets that they want you to get accustomed to, like things such as remote detonated explosives, the defusal kit, a radio, a fibre optic cable like in SWAT for peeking under doors, and maybe one or two other gadgets I can't remember. Most stuff isn't really used that much, and not super well, the explosives are generally only used to open up a doorway so you can continue progressing, which is a shame since they could have been used for different and more interesting things, perhaps.\n\nThe M60 is absolutely busted. It has almost perfect accuracy, way better than any of the regular Counter-Strike weapons, and it recovers fast and does huge damage. As befitting a big LMG, but when in the hands of the AI it's just absolutely ridiculous, if you let them fire on you for more than a few seconds at any range, you're probably dead. While not every mission even has this gun, a few missions have them just all of the place.\n\nA few missions are very railroaded and walking off the beaten track is either punished or impossible, but in more than a few of them you're all but required to do it just to find more stuff to keep on going. Sometimes it's just more ammo, but in some cases it's as much as a weapon drop, and in Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes, each mission only has each weapon ONCE. If you miss a weapon, that's it, you're not going to find it along the way if you didn't manage to find where it was hidden. It's not really a big deal since you can complete every mission without them, but it does make it a bit trickier when you're being given ammo for weapons you don't have.\n\nThe way armor/HP work is very punishing. Armor is usually difficult to come by, and with it most enemies will do next to no damage to you, but as it decreases, damage to your HP will rise, until at 0 enemies can kill you from full HP in only a couple of bursts if they're lucky. Headshots on you seem to sway the screen in such a way as to throw your aim off, which is extremely frustrating if you're just trying to shoot a guy and your shots all miss just because he keeps tagging you in the head.\n\nThe repetitive nature of some of the missions really kind of makes the game a bit of a struggle, and by the end they REALLY got carried away with the parkour.

É quase como se Counter-Strike e Call Of Duty tivessem um filho.\nCSCZ traz o modo Campanha de vários outros FPS's para Counter-Strike, porém sem uma história ou um propósito, apenas missões Single Player com bots para diversão ou até treinamento do jogador para o online. As missões são simples e fazem o jogador seguir um caminho que não lhe é muito convencional, explorando outras mecânicas do jogo, como usar armas diferentes do habitual ou fazer objetivos além do tradicional mata-mata.\nA progressão de dificuldade é bem feita, aumentando a cada cenário o número de inimigos a serem enfrentados e a complexidade das missões. Além disso, conforme você vai avançando, você também pode melhorar sua própria equipe, podendo escolher soldados de rank elevado para se equivaler à equipe inimiga.\nPorém, é exatamente em um ponto crucial que o jogo falha: inteligência artificial. Os bots do jogo não são tão espertos, principalmente os da sua equipe. Conforme você avança no jogo, isso melhora um pouco, mas em momento algum chega a ser no mínimo bom. Isso diminui um pouco o fator diversão, mas ainda não é um motivo para não recomendar sua compra.\nCounter-Strike: Condition Zero é um jogo divertido, leve - roda em qualquer computador fraco em qualidade medium-high - e nostálgico. Recomendo demais, principalmente se você quer voltar a jogar o clássico CS 1.6, mas não tem com quem jogar na sua Steam.","timestamp_created":1535728429,"timestamp_updated":1535728429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44488438","author":{"steamid":"76561198174308033","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1535632588},"language":"schinese","review":"我就说评论说的AI拆弹救人质三维什么的，原来童年玩的零点行动只是世界地图那个任务，原来零点行动还有传统CS玩法的版本。\n买了后有两个游戏，CSCZ是与人机打，传统CS玩法；DELETED SCENE则是世界地图做反恐任务那个。\n事先看了评论，英文输入法加大写开了进游戏，win10没闪退过。\n（现实哪支部队会让一个士兵冲前线 1 V 100 ？）","timestamp_created":1535726398,"timestamp_updated":1535726398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44484404","author":{"steamid":"76561198131334126","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":131,"last_played":1446846451},"language":"spanish","review":"Esta bien.","timestamp_created":1535713402,"timestamp_updated":1535713402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44479264","author":{"steamid":"76561198149004825","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":121,"last_played":1441395755},"language":"thai","review":"I FUCK YOUR MOTHER","timestamp_created":1535689165,"timestamp_updated":1535689165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447761178016662598","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44472560","author":{"steamid":"76561198143779585","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1524566407},"language":"russian","review":"[table]\n[tr]\n[td][h1][i]⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Корешу на ДР⠀[/i][/h1]\n[h1]───────⚪───────────────────────────────────[/h1]\n⠀▐▐ ⠀►▏ ⠀⠀──○─ 🔊 ⠀₁:₂₅ / ₃:₅₀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ᴴᴰ⚙ ❐ ⊏⊐[/td]\n \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVYFvOo952Q","timestamp_created":1535658981,"timestamp_updated":1535658981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44469143","author":{"steamid":"76561198396308278","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":1980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1613309499},"language":"russian","review":"ну такое","timestamp_created":1535647652,"timestamp_updated":1535647652,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44451616","author":{"steamid":"76561198825817864","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1532980461},"language":"english","review":"Not the famous one in Counter-Strike series, but you will love this if you are a fan of the series.","timestamp_created":1535576607,"timestamp_updated":1535576607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44444191","author":{"steamid":"76561198262424969","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":830,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":827,"last_played":1559056865},"language":"schinese","review":"win7旗舰版，不知道为什么玩儿一段时间就会闪退，很难受，尤其是后期比较难的战斗。","timestamp_created":1535551243,"timestamp_updated":1535551243,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578043639659881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r5D/wuUCf6HFqQE="}
