The gameplay is similar to Quake with all the same weapons and pickups except for the Half-Life's trademark crowbar as a melee weapon. The game is very fun to play and you can get into it pretty easily. Learning some of the most advanced techniques mimicked from Quake such as bunnyhopping can be tough to learn but other than that the game is not hard at all to play. However, the game doesn't really have that many active players and you won't have the same kind of fun playing it as Valve's other titles. On the whole, the game is fun but gets repetitive later on.","timestamp_created":1479893404,"timestamp_updated":1479893404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561310350894927979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26433236","author":{"steamid":"76561198126635790","num_games_owned":319,"num_reviews":193,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1421757515},"language":"russian","review":"⁧⁧ ⁧⁧ ⁧⁧ ⁧⁧ ⁧⁧","timestamp_created":1478345000,"timestamp_updated":1483526832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55568307638168335","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26406409","author":{"steamid":"76561198140941848","num_games_owned":735,"num_reviews":226,"playtime_forever":651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":651,"last_played":1473497247},"language":"schinese","review":"男子酒驾连撞八辆车 跑进饭店厨房装作厨师炒龙虾","timestamp_created":1478209576,"timestamp_updated":1478209576,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":19,"weighted_vote_score":"0.218121424317359924","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26244056","author":{"steamid":"76561198020256474","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":127,"last_played":1625231337},"language":"english","review":"great game but no one play it anymore :(","timestamp_created":1477568298,"timestamp_updated":1479675897,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26175856","author":{"steamid":"76561198207136439","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":56,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1641947106},"language":"russian","review":"Такое чувство, что поиграл во вторую кваку","timestamp_created":1477197271,"timestamp_updated":1477197271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25998466","author":{"steamid":"76561198196442865","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1494820124},"language":"english","review":"Best isolation multiplayer game  ever.","timestamp_created":1476283558,"timestamp_updated":1476283558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25856812","author":{"steamid":"76561198102093684","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":34,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1491960768},"language":"english","review":"Please can we have more people playing this game!?","timestamp_created":1475599844,"timestamp_updated":1475599844,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25829718","author":{"steamid":"76561198302816909","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":83,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48,"last_played":1483524082},"language":"english","review":"Kickass game, wish it had more players.","timestamp_created":1475446391,"timestamp_updated":1475446391,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25823624","author":{"steamid":"76561198301505438","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2058,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":140,"last_played":1657311175},"language":"english","review":"This isn't the best game in the world, but dam is it fun.

However RCBot got some complicated configurations, but it's useful for your bot to work various ways.","timestamp_created":1456772172,"timestamp_updated":1456772172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21547309","author":{"steamid":"76561198051708454","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":166,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":116,"last_played":1460316893},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um quake na versão da valve que pelomenos deu certo","timestamp_created":1456760940,"timestamp_updated":1456760940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21494902","author":{"steamid":"76561198172689266","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1456566816},"language":"english","review":"+Likes","timestamp_created":1456566995,"timestamp_updated":1456566995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21395567","author":{"steamid":"76561198097976538","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1456179116},"language":"english","review":"Dead Comminuty :(","timestamp_created":1456183485,"timestamp_updated":1456183485,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21391930","author":{"steamid":"76561198104050564","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":117,"playtime_forever":152,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":125,"last_played":1484793035},"language":"english","review":"It's a fun game now and then, but the game need more players.
