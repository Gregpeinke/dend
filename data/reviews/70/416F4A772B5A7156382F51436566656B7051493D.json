Acho que eu tinha sei la uns 10 anos quando conhece Half-Life kkk.\n\nHalf-Life é basicamente o pai moderno dos FPS, o chamo assim porque muitos comparam FPS “antes de Half-Life” e os jogos “após half-life”\nHalf-Life uniu toda a base dos shooters fps da época e introduziu conceitos inovadores pra epoca, ele meio que moldou um gênero que hoje possuiu franquias bilionárias. Antes se pararmos pra analisar sobre as historias dos jogos de tiros, elas eram simples e meio que deixadas para trás enquanto uma musica de fundo rolava e inimigos apareciam pra tudo que é lado. Half-Life  imerge você em um personagem, trazendo pequenos detalhes de sí, explica onde trabalha, envolve uma trama com mistérios, faz você questionar o que diabos esta acontecendo naquele lugar, o que só ao passar de fases você vai ira descobrir aos poucos. \nEu digo para alguns amigos que Half-Life é como se fosse 2 jogos em 1. Pois a primeira vez que você joga ela jamais será igual a segunda. Isso se deve aos quebra cabeças que aparecem para você solucionar em um determinado local para que você consiga encontrar uma saída do mesmo. Isso é muito presente na franquia, e até mesmo expandido para outros jogos da VALVe como Counter-Strike Coundition Zero Deleted Scenes e Portal.\nSe você curte jogos de tiros anos 90, ficaria impressionado se nunca ouviu falar desse clássico. Jogue-o de uma chance e conheça a franquia que revolucionou o gênero. E se curtir, jogue suas duas expansões.\n\nPS: Existem MOD’s para versões legendadas e até mesmo um Pack de Dublagem Amadora BR. \nPS²: Se você não curte gráficos clássicos, talvez iria curtir o game Black Mesa.
