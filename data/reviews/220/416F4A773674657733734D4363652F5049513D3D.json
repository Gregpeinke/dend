I have played through this game before, as well as the expansions and I highly recommend them. I haven't yet played the first Half-Life so I might do that also. \n\nOne part that annoyed me though was that I kept dying for no reason when trying to move around this particular train. The only way around it seemed to be to use the 'buddha' console command. To turn on console commands, go to the keyboard section in the options menu, then press '~' to open it up. With the 'buddha' command you will drop to 1 hp but you won't die. After you get around the train you can turn it off by entering the command again. I normally don't like cheating, so it really annoyed that I had to do this. Oh well, the rest of the game is truly epic.","timestamp_created":1390969802,"timestamp_updated":1621113290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8896194","author":{"steamid":"76561198112240047","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":382,"last_played":1518665160},"language":"english","review":"If you like action, gunplay, puzzles, or if youre just looking for a great story, this is the game for you!

I remember when I bought the Orange Box on PS3 I was just amazed! 5 years later replaying it on PC it just adds to the amazing quality of the game. I loved every single second of it and is one my most favorite games of all time. Half Life 2 is a tense, thrilling, and all around amazing game that should be played by everyone.\n\nNOT FOR: People who don't like FPS's. I would still recommend trying it out, but if that's not really your thing, I don't think Half Life 2 would change your mind all that much. However keep in mind that this is more of an old school first person shooter, unlike say Call of Duty. This game doesn't tell you where to go or how to get there, maybe not as much as the original Half-Life, but still a far cry from the crazy hand holding a lot of modern games have today.\n\nFOR: People who want to play or try out a different stlye of FPS. This is not Call of Duty. No constant checkpoints or arrows showing you where to go. While this may prove frustrating for some...(It was for me the first time I tried it.) It proves to be extremely rewarding. On a other note this game doesn't have regenerating health which up's the challenge factor considerably. Even on easy you can every easily die if you don't react fast enough. \n\nIN CONCLUSION: I hope this review finds you well and if you want some other games like Half Life 2, make sure to get it's sequels Episode 1 & 2 . Also try out Portal and Portal 2 as they are in the same universe. (The Portal series is a puzzle game so it's different, but it's in the same story universe.)

Almost everything about this game is perfect. The pacing is great, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat from the moment you step out of the train in City 17 right up until the epic conclusion. The guns are punchy, not to mention the Gravity Gun's awesome power. The story is immersive and fantastic, and the entire game feels like a journey, partly due to the fact that there is never a cutscene that you have to sit through. Valve's Source Engine has put so much life into this game, especially the characters. The facial animations are believeable, to the point where I would feel empathy for the characters, the physics are good (Yet sometimes laughable) and the gameplay is fantastic. You are immersed in a living, breathing world right from the get-go.
