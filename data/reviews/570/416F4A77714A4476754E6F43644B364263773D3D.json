But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy the Formuoli","timestamp_created":1487995332,"timestamp_updated":1487995332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30157222","author":{"steamid":"76561198325349358","num_games_owned":0,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":481207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":609,"playtime_at_review":78207,"last_played":1659531523},"language":"spanish","review":"Dota 2 es lo mejor no es solo un juego es un arte donde pones a prueba tu capacidad mental","timestamp_created":1487994831,"timestamp_updated":1487994831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30157178","author":{"steamid":"76561198132321301","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":6111,"last_played":1660052648},"language":"russian","review":"Toxic game in the world.\nДОБАВЬТЕ ПЕРЕКОВКУ!!!","timestamp_created":1487994606,"timestamp_updated":1638180176,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30157120","author":{"steamid":"76561198342335668","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":57682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50665,"last_played":1628499759},"language":"english","review":"The game is great and fun This review has NOTHING to do with half life 3\n\nBut there are heroes that are broken \nthis is why i kind of do not like the game\n Slark and Riki are the two of the most bull heroes that are broken\n\nAnd also the game is kinda stupid.

в игру 3 года и 6 месяцев, достигнув в аккаунте 51 уровня, попробую написать краткий отзыв. Игра неоднозначная, есть как плюсы так и минусы, но минусов всё же больше (моё мнение). Попробую разобраться в них. В Dota 2 нельзя качественно играть 1х1, 2х2, 3х3 она не рассчитана для этого. Как я считаю режим 1х1 (соревновательный) самый интересный (для саморазвития), а его тут попросту нет. И выходит ситуация как в лифте, если кто-то испортит воздух, то не понятно кто это сделал так как в нём находится пять человек и все начинают себя выгораживать, и указывать пальцем на кого-то другого (часто невиновного). В других играх всё понятно особенно когда играешь 2х2. Игра условно бесплатная кажется плюс, но на самом деле это минус. Почему? Да потому, что устанавливают её все кому не лень без ограничения по возрасту и по финансам. Это как дешёвый кабак с хорошей выпивкой в который люди идут доганяться после закрытия более менее приличных заведений. Что там твориться мы все прекрасно знаем. Каждый день выходят патчи с ненужным (как по мне) контентом, который покупают единицы, а балансные патчи выходят не так уж и часто, но устанавливать приходится и те и другие. Для людей у которых слабое интернет соединение это минус. В меню есть голосовой чат, которым можно пользоваться во время сражения. Плюс? Конечно плюс. Но вот Вам отсюда выплывает и минус:) Слишком много негатива и никому ненужного срача. В игру заходишь отдохнуть и расслабиться, а как следствие получаешь порцию негатива который тебе вообще не нужен. И это замечание человека, которого не очень то в последнее время и ругают. Мне неприятно слушать когда и других обзывают. Когда я слышу слово Dota 2 именно этот негатив в первую очередь и приходит на ум так как он отлаживается надолго. И это лишь только верхушка айсберга если говорить про игру. А что остаётся в остатке? Есть конечно и плюсы, но упоминать их не вижу смысла так как про них все уже знают, все играли и видят её достоинства. Dota 2 задумывалась изначально как командная игра, но когда ты ещё не собрал команду так, чтобы в онлайне постоянно было хотябы три толковых человека, заходить в неё смысла нет. Рекомендую ли я её другому игроку? Конечно. Но без фанатизма. Есть и другие интересные игры, что удивительно ничем не хуже Dota 2 если вспомнить таковые и поиграть. Далеко не хуже :) Играйте и развивайтесь!","timestamp_created":1487982887,"timestamp_updated":1488382772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30154236","author":{"steamid":"76561198319593484","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":86906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21823,"last_played":1656458516},"language":"russian","review":"TOP","timestamp_created":1487982874,"timestamp_updated":1487982874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30154169","author":{"steamid":"76561198149947444","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":87179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44701,"last_played":1586611935},"language":"russian","review":"четкая

On the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) Defense of the Ancients modification for Warcraft III, now transferred into Valve's Source engine. The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.\n\nIf you're not aware of the basics of the burgeoning MOBA genre, two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map. Each team needs to work together with the goal of ultimately destroying a central structure--in Dota 2's case, the Ancient--in the opposing team's base. With most games lasting around the 40-minute mark, and occasionally edging past an hour, watching the enemy fortress dramatically crumble and sink to the ground feels like an exhilarating payoff.\n\nAiding these two teams, named the Radiant and the Dire, are waves of AI assistants, called creeps. Batches of creeps spawn at 30-second intervals and charge merrily up the map's three pathways. In the clumps of remaining land lies a jungle, where numerous AI opponents spawn, offering lucrative benefits to players who take them on successfully. Finally, and in a bid to stop both teams from simply marching into one another's base, each team gets three powerful towers on each lane that easily shred through enemy players at the start of the game.\n\nYour individual ability to control and affect the rhythm of the game comes from how well you handle your hero. You mostly control a single unit in Dota 2, though there are exceptions: some heroes can summon controllable allies, such as bears, gargoyle babies, or wolves; one exceptionally versatile hero can split into three; and one item lets you take control of certain creeps. For each rule in Dota 2's impressive house-of-cards design, there's usually at least one character who completely ignores it, or finds a way around it via one of 130-odd items available from the in-match shop. For instance, try negating magic attacks with the black king bar, returning damage with the blade mail, or pounding out two ultimate abilities in quick succession with a refresher orb.\n\nThe aim for most players is to accumulate as much gold and experience as possible, with income being delivered mostly by scoring the killing blow on enemy creeps and players. It's almost always easier to gang up on stray enemies as a group, which is why it's rarely a good idea to run about on your own. Then it's a case of splashing all your hard-earned money on some ultra-powerful items from the shop, while levelling up your base stats and abilities, and then clobbering the enemy team into submission via a few five-versus-five team fights. Rarely does it feel that simple, however.\n\nAt the time of writing, 102 of the original Dota's 112 heroes have made their way into the sequel. Each hero has a handful of unique abilities and generally works best in a specific role, such as supporting other players as Omniknight, roaming around the map looking for opportunistic kills as Spirit Breaker, or evolving throughout the course of the game into an all-powerful vehicle of carnage and destruction as Phantom Assassin.\n\nThere's only one map, unlike in many other MOBA titles, although Valve has not ruled out the addition of more over time, and has previously offered game-changing modes with seasonal events at Halloween and Christmas. But Dota 2's single sprawling map sets itself apart from the competition by being larger, more intricate, and packed with greater detail than the rest of the genre. Unlike in League of Legends, the jungle area is riddled with far more tangling pathways, the lanes feature additional shops selling exclusive items, and savvy players are given more opportunities to use the environment to hide, flee, and ambush their opponents.\n\nOften the game's dizzying scale is seen as off-putting or simply too complex, but the truth of Dota is that it can be entertaining as a new player to just sit down and let all those extraneous factors play out around you. Getting down to the brass tacks of the game with a group of like-minded friends is a lot of fun: start by buying your characters' recommended items, try your best not to get caught out of position, and get into the habit of buying observer wards. And watch out for Riki.\n\nAs you'd expect from Valve, this is a beautifully presented game, with the Half-Life and Portal maker running victory laps around its competition in terms of UI, voice acting, and showing how to deftly add real personality to its characters. Only recently has the developer turned its attention to gently easing new players into the proceedings, however, and even now, mastering the basics feels like learning to swim by jumping in at the deep end. Efforts are being made to remedy this, though: right now there are a couple of tutorial levels, some well-designed AI bots, and a newbie playlist that restricts hero selection to just 20 of the most frequently picked characters. And with community-created hero guides now built directly into the game itself, Dota 2 is much easier to get started with than it has been in the past.\n\nPlay a match every evening for a couple of weeks, and you start to see how Dota 2's wealth of disparate systems and mechanics combine into their own harmony, and you begin to understand how there are hundreds of elements that affect the game. Dota 2 is a tense war of accumulation and attrition. The biggest problem, which is coincidentally where the real excitement of the game lies, comes from struggling to process and interpret dozens upon dozens of mitigating circumstances while simultaneously trying to keep your cool.\n\nIt is a complicated and exhausting game, and for the first few weeks, it's challenging just keeping up with the general rhythm of a match. But invest enough time into Dota 2, and you develop an almost unconscious ability to keep up with the game--performing actions such as sending the slightly fiddly in-game courier over to the faraway \"secret\" shop to get some rare items, for instance. After a couple of hundred hours of Dota 2, what once felt like spinning plates just happens automatically.\n\nWhile Dota 2 has transferred the core of the original Dota into a cleaner, modern engine, the fact remains that losing is uniquely painful. Death in Dota 2 not only gives your opponent money, but robs you of some of your own and leaves you waiting up to a minute to respawn. By the time you've trudged back across the game's massive map--or spent money on a teleportation scroll--your opponent is now stronger and richer. Die two or three times in quick succession, which is easily done, and a match of Dota becomes a painful experience where you spend the next half hour getting bullied by an increasingly superior enemy. Other games in the genre have tried to mitigate this punishment, but Dota 2 positively revels in its complexities. The rich just get richer.\n\nThe original Dota was an unexpectedly powerful blend of clashing genres and disparate elements that ended up taking over the world, and Valve's successor retains the original rules and characters while adding in a cheery free-to-play model and slick production values. The experience of playing Dota changes day by day--some evenings will be exhilarating, while others will kick your morale to the curb--but there are few games as worthy of your time investment as this. Those who choose to commit to Dota 2 will find many happy hours within this immaculate update.\n","timestamp_created":1487977098,"timestamp_updated":1487977098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30152501","author":{"steamid":"76561198180411855","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":388891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":161619,"last_played":1653466026},"language":"english","review":"im having so much fun about this game","timestamp_created":1487976610,"timestamp_updated":1487976610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30152364","author":{"steamid":"76561198201237926","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":214959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1712,"playtime_at_review":84916,"last_played":1660554940},"language":"polish","review":"fajna gra na walke z nudom morzna pogadac z ruskimi polecam","timestamp_created":1487976128,"timestamp_updated":1585040879,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.421455949544906616","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30152322","author":{"steamid":"76561198216645704","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":296560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":27,"playtime_at_review":140479,"last_played":1659529717},"language":"russian","review":"Збс","timestamp_created":1487975990,"timestamp_updated":1487975990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30152141","author":{"steamid":"76561198318560913","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":64296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9247,"last_played":1650993410},"language":"spanish","review":"EL MEJOR JUEGO DE TODOS, muy entretenido y divertido, te hace pensar en estrategias, y todos los juegos son un mundo diferente,nunca tendrás 2 partidas iguales","timestamp_created":1487975411,"timestamp_updated":1487975411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30152102","author":{"steamid":"76561198020250629","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25461,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19457,"last_played":1505341967},"language":"russian","review":"Мне очень не понравилась данная игра, не хотел бы оскорбить разработчиков, но в игре полно минусов над которыми нужно хорошо потрудиться.
