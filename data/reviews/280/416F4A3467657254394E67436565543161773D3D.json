Buy the original, not the source version.\n\nI played this because I happened to have it on an old Steam account, perhaps because it came in some package deal - I don't remember anymore. It is still worth playing in such a case. But it also helps that I played the original so much before that I remembered the scripted events by heart. If it weren't for that, I'd be missing a decent amount of the story to bugs, and that is sad. The other bugs are tolerable but the story is such an important aspect of the game that this would be reason enough alone to implore you to play the original.\n\nI also have to report a game breaking bug that basically forced me to use cheats to advance the game (at the fire pipe at the end of Surface Tension - the door doesn't open).

If you want to know why this game is a fucking joke, by all means, proceed. \n\nHL Source is the only bad Valve game ever released. It's honestly unbelievable how awful and fundamentally broken this one is, Valve managed to take their most iconic game- not to mention the one which launched their company to stardom, and absolutely deprive it of quality. For 10 bucks, what do you get from HL Source? An unplayable mess full of broken scripted sequences, broken NPCs, unbalanced weapons and damage systems, infuriating glitches, levels so broken you can't win, levels so broken you can't lose, just a total disaster. I hate to repeat myself so much, but this game is a broken mess. Even the Garry's Mod content is pretty lackluster, you'd be better off with a free mod like Half Life Renaissance. Oh, and for fans of the HD models that came with Blue Shift, don't even bother. For one they seem to be modified from the original release (why bother with such tiny changes?) and most importantly, the models are incomplete showing wireframes, and even the sounds on the guns like the M4 and SPAS-12 are missing altogether. \n\nThe \"selling points\" of HL Source include a HL2 style chapter select, improved Source Engine lighting, HL2 style water, and ragdoll physics. That's it. For ten bucks. How could Valve have gone so wrong? Counter Strike Source and Day of Defeat Source offered complete Source remakes of their predecessors, so why are we stuck with this awful port instead of a real remake, like the mod Black Mesa? And more importantly, why hasn't Valve even bothered to make this garbarge at least functional? It's full of little distracting mistakes any HL series veteran will notice immediately. Just a mess.\n\nI will say the Deathmatch multiplayer is fun. You can actually get this in a pack of other Source multiplayer titles without having to get HL Source. DMS has a lot of the same problems as Source, but luckily the abudance of great community made maps makes it worthwhile. \n","timestamp_created":1484369450,"timestamp_updated":1484369450,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.377602487802505493","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29224457","author":{"steamid":"76561198162534450","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":242,"playtime_forever":158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":147,"last_played":1518057412},"language":"english","review":"WE WANT HALF-LIFE 3 !","timestamp_created":1484316787,"timestamp_updated":1484316787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471428543329238892","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29221733","author":{"steamid":"76561198273552887","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":790,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":416,"last_played":1487958966},"language":"russian","review":"хорошая игра в духе старой школы лучше графика чем в первом халф лайф, 5/5","timestamp_created":1484306956,"timestamp_updated":1484306956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504252254962921143","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29221469","author":{"steamid":"76561198172991661","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":206,"playtime_at_review":1011,"last_played":1659466818},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego lo jugue cuando salio por primera vez y es mi juego de shooter preferido.

Pro mě je Half-Life nuda. Ano, chápu, je to stará hra, ale znám stejně staré hry, co mě baví mnohem mnohem víc např. Thief, NFS 3, Tomb Raider 3, Caesar 3 nebo legendární Commandos.\n\nNikdy před tím jsem hru nehrál. Když jsem všude možně četl, jak je to jedna z nejlepších her, donutilo mě to si jí koupit v balíčku HL Complete. Když jsem viděl vzhled jedničky, radši jsem si rovnou zapnul Source. Nešli mi v něm české titulky, tak jsem si to musel stáhnout a hrát non-steam. Bohužel Source hře moc nepomohl. Vzhledově je to lepší, to ano, ale tahle hra je nyní už pouze určena lidem, co jí hráli při jejím vydání, nebo na hře vyrůstali.\n\nČekal jsem nějaký epický nebo hlubší příběh, ale toho se mi prakticky nedostalo. Místo toho jsem dostal v dnešní době již nudnou, koridorovou střílečku, u které jsem si už po 2 hodinách začal říkat \"Doufám, že už bude brzo konec..\". \n\nSpoiler! (jestli je to teda vůbec třeba...)\n\nPříběh je jednoduchej a nudnej, žádná extrémní zápletka. V laboratoři, kde pracujete, nevyjde experiment s teleportérem a otevře se brána do jiné dimenze, odkuď začne přilejzat mimozemská havěť. Vaším úkolem je to zastavit. Po cestě k tomuto cílí střílíte po všem co se hýbe. Puzzly tomu vůbec nepomáhali, akorát mě štvali. Na konci vás čeká boss, u kterého zničíte 3 krystali na zdi co ho chrání, zpoza kamene ho roztřílíte, dáte mu ránu do hlavy a konec. Naprostá nuda. I CoD mají promyšlenější příběh. \n\nPohybování je otřesný, Freeman je jak na ledu nebo co. Souboje nejsou nějak zajímavé, NPC jsou tupí, prakticky se vůbec nekryjí a když se skryjete vy, tak běží přímo naproti vám a když vylezete, zastaví se uprostřed a prostě a jednoduše tam stojí a střílí, dokud je nezabijete. Soundtrack je hodně zvláštní. Absolutně mi k tomu nesedí snad ani jedna skladba, co v tom zahrála. Jediné, co ve hře tak nějak ujde je level desing. Bohužel to platí jen pro některé levely. Někdy to jsou prostě jen nudné a prázdné chodby.\n\nPokud jste hru nehráli a hrajete moderní hry, ani si jí nekupujte, nemá to moc smysl. Hra je podle mě hratlná jen pro nostalgiky. Po hrách, které už mám za sebou, je pro mě Half-life jedna z nejhorších a nejnudnějších her, co jsem kdy hrál. Chtěl jsem ji dohrát, abych si potom mohl zahrál dvojku, ale nakonec koukám, že to byla ztráta času a mohl jsem jít rovnou na dvojku.

It does not have 10 to 20 minute cutscenes with loads of dialogue, nor is it a team multiplayer that you respawn in several times per round, but it is the beginning of the fps with a plot and the chaotic environment of Portal 2, which coincidentally both use valve's Source engine, albeit rougher image quality in Half-Life because it has been ported to this engine while it was in its early days. It does become a little addicting once you start playing because you start at ground zero and have to work your way out of [strike]hell[/strike] the facility to escape while others around you are much less fortunate. It isn't the prettiest game out there, nor is it one with a story so intricate that writing it down would result in a book larger than the Harry Potter series, but it is gripping enough that just by playing the first game, (and Half-Life can never be mention without mentioning Half-Life 3) I can understand why fans want a Half-Life 3.

This game however has zero cut scenes and really no help on how to complete an objective which i really like. Also shows how a game can be great without all the fancy graphics and cut scenes. You play as a scientist named freeman and you need to progress through the Black Masa complex after something goes completely wrong. Has a great pace of movement speed and enemies who are very accurate when they shoot you. The Ai/NPC's are not all that stupid. They know how to duck to cover and rush and kill you with out just standing still so you have a clear shot on them. Marines you fight can be brutal at times especially when you are out numbered and out gunned. Even in today of 2016 I enjoyed this classic very much and actualy preffer this type of game over plenty of new ones of today. Just because a game looks good doesnt mean its going to be good. I always wondered why this game was a legend and now I understand. Ill tell you this there will be moments when you will get stuck and this game isnt that easy.

A mis 28 años, eso no podía quedar así.\n\nHalf life es un juegazo, con buenos gráficos y efectos sonoros para su época (imaginen mis lagrimas al asumir lo anciana que estoy).

Fácil por la cantidad de municiones que te dan, pero es el que más puzzle tiene, dolor de cabeza inminente.

(I have not run into any gamebreaking bugs (I am at the dam in Surface Tensions) I found 3 bugs: the box jumping puzzle the last box slides into the wall, does not affect gameplay. When opening the storm drain in Surface Tensions you can get stuck on top the valve, but I got off by using the grenade launcher.  I saw 2 Marines walking into eachother but that was right after a loading screen and they got out when they saw me.\n\nNow onto my review.\n\nHalf-Life Source is a very well made game. (before steampipe) I would highly recommend doing my above method to play this game for anyone looking to get back into Half-Life, but thinks the graphics could be better. The water and skies look amazing, the lighting is good, and without the High Def Pack (It comes with the Steam version, enable it, it makes the game look very good)  the guns, the models, and textures are decent. I have found the recoil is  different (It reminds me of going from CS 1.6 to CS:S) but besides that normal gameplay is very much the same as The GoldSrc version.
