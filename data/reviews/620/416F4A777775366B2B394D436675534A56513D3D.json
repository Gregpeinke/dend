One of the best I've played. It is a great brain game, when at the same time, it has a fantastic story, with great animation. It also happens to be very creative. Worth the 20$? Hell yes. Buy it right now.\n\n[b]In Long (SPOILERS AHEAD):[/b]\nThis game was great. It was detailed, it had a great story line, and it had characters in it that really engage you into it like it's real. However, nothing's perfect. The strongest points of this game would be: The story line, the characters, and the puzzles. The part of the game I disliked the most was Chapter 6 (The Fall), and the beginning 7 (The Reunion). The reason is, I bought this game for more of the puzzle and thinking aspect, however chapters 6 and 7 mainly consisted of rummaging through the sewers of the Aperture lab trying to find portal-able walls. I personally found it just annoying, and was not stretching my brain at all. It was purely frustrating, and on those chapters, I mostly used tutorials. However, even though I disliked this part, it did not ruin the game. Actually, it was pretty frustrating at first when GLaDOS was taken over by Wheatley because I was filled with excitement that I was about to win the game, but boy was I wrong, since that was maybe a third into the game. However, I of course was happy for the game to go on. So, the best parts of the game definitely were the puzzles, or what GLaDOS and Wheatley referred to as \"tests,\" and the worst (but still good) parts were chapter's 6 and 7.
