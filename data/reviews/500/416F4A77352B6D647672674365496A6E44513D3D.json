Then you should buy this game. Left 4 dead is a really exceptionable game. This is a true pc game. The control setup feels like it was made for the pc.

With a coop campaign, versus, survival, and a single player, you should never get bored of this game. There's tons of ways to play this game, not just the different game mechanics, but there are 6 maps for each one. Including the 4 difficulties you will never tire of this game. Another great thing about this game is, since it heavily demands you play with other people, teamwork can be really amazing. That said, you can always get people who don't know how to play, or don't know how to work as a team. Also this game has alot of girefers, and they pop up alot on expert games. If you're playing on expert, you should start with 4 people, or it's guarenteed they'll find you at some point.","timestamp_created":1342372305,"timestamp_updated":1342372305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3608207","author":{"steamid":"76561198025204521","num_games_owned":380,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":562,"last_played":1358323200},"language":"english","review":"Left 4 Dead, an amazing FPS Zombie game. it may be really hard on normal, but fun none the less, I recommend eveyone to buy this game is they have the money.","timestamp_created":1342349600,"timestamp_updated":1342349600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2607785","author":{"steamid":"76561198009958261","num_games_owned":706,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1419,"last_played":1362038400},"language":"english","review":"If you dont own this, buy it.
