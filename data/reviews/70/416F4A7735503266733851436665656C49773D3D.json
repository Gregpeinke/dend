You don't feel like a stiff terminator-esque killing machine, but instead a guerilla rebel. With grace and agility you duck, weave and really feel like you're truely fighting just to survive. You encounter perilous situations in which you have to be decisive and avoid direct confrontation. Which is great because near the beginning, it's empowering as you blast your way through lesser hostiles that don't pose much of a threat on their own, but the scenarios thrown at you later in the game are utterly chaotic. Enemies clash in vicious open conflict when it is often smarter to let the contenders wear each other thin before you bound from hiding to mop up the victors. It is a beautiful and articulately crafted game, where obvious attention has been given to the placement of every box and headcrab. Every weapon feels distinct and has a specific use, even the meager security pistol you collect at the start comes in handy to accurately pickoff a nasty trip mine tucked just around the corner of a hallway. The only thing i will say is that i have yet to fully complete the game because of a bug in a chapter called, 'Lambda Core' in which you are supposed to activate two seperate water pumps in order to flood a reactor in order to reach a ladder. I replayed this chapter several times and even played through the ENTIRE game a second time after re-installing the game to remedy the glitch... to no avail. Definitely worth the $10 asking price- a classic example of quality game development only seen recently in games like dark souls.","timestamp_created":1394898004,"timestamp_updated":1394898004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9482582","author":{"steamid":"76561198104207935","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2735,"last_played":1438586446},"language":"english","review":"I think Half-Life is quite an amazing game and for any that have not played it, I think that you should give it a shot. It's good in almost every way because it keeps you excited for almost the entire game by giving you new and exciting weapons that can be used for tactically defeating your foes. There's also many unique mechanics that require you to interact with certain things to defeat foes. One of my favorite parts is that it is extremely non-linear. There are many twists and turns you can take to get you to your destination, although, the question is which path to take, but that's up to the players to decide. Last but not least is the final boss, the final boss looks really destructive and he is, at least for the start of the fight. After a while it gets a bit tedious and he's not doing much to you. This is the worst part of the game, in my opinion, because you spend thirty minutes shooting at him repeatedly until he dies after you've shot 1/10 of all the ammo in the game (just a bit of overexageration). If you can get pass the final boss and the really short endings that I don't find to be worth going for, then you should definetely give this game a chance for some epic fun through the most of the game.

Just so you know that if you are put off by an 15 year old marvel, due to the graphics, there are \"remade\" editions. The game is very well supported by its fan base, which it earned back in the '90s and '00s.\nStory telling taken into consideration, having played Half Life would help one's understanding of the story when playing Half Life 2. Like, A LOT. Without the knowledge of the events in Half Life, you have no idea who Barney is, Doctor Kleiner, Doctor Vance or the HEV suit.

Вооружившись монтировкой в роли доктора физических наук, выпускника MIT, Гордона Фримена мы стараемся.... Выжить. Выжить среди бесконечных коридоров секретного исследовательского комплекса Black Mesa, жарких песков пустыни в Нью-Мексико и чуждых глазу пейзажей другого мира Zen.Выжить среди тысяч вторнувшихся в наш мир враждебных существ, сотен солдат, посланных не шибко умным правительством зачистить научный комплекс и перебить заодно лучшие умы человечества. И попытаться спасти наш уютный мир Земли от захвата чуждым извращённым разумом Нихиланта.\n\nНо это всё - сюжет. Одиночная игра. Которая заслуживает восхищения и претендует на реиграбельность. Побродить по любимым коридорам лаборатории, вдохнуть полной грудью слегка затхлый воздух и пристукнуть монтировкой парочку назойливых хедкрабов интересно и после десятого по счёту прохождения. Но в игре есть и немного другой мир. Быстрый, динамичный режим мультиплеера. Который все ещё жив. И надеюсь, будет жить всегда. Ибо в нём можно окунуться в детство. Походы с друзьями в компьютерные клубы и эпичные сражения в crossfire.\n\nСпасибо Valve за отличную игру. Кстати сказать - дебютную. Без неё не было бы Steam. И очередных шедевров. \n10/10","timestamp_created":1393524289,"timestamp_updated":1393524289,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61885756254196167","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9281171","author":{"steamid":"76561198042054874","num_games_owned":334,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":2372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2335,"last_played":1526272131},"language":"english","review":"Get it.","timestamp_created":1393519838,"timestamp_updated":1393519838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9276497","author":{"steamid":"76561198092716798","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1035,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":668,"last_played":1470140427},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life - очень хорошая игра. Игроку предоставляется уникальный геймплей с союзниками, вагонетками. Сюжет интересный и хорошо продуманный. Нет, в отличии от современных игр, длинных и нудных справок. Игра осваивается с ходу, и оправдывает звание экшена. Хорошо также и то, что hl занимает всего 50 с небольшим мегабайт, и отлично работает на любых компьютерах. Интересен также и мультиплеер, можно попрактиковаться в умениях.

Именно поэтому тебе приходиться слушать каждого кого ты встретишь на пути что бы получить хоть какую нибудь информации о том что вообще происходит здесь и как с этим справляться.Плюс в этой игре надо обязательно думать.Что мене особенно нравиться.Именно этого щас не хватает нашим современным играм.Где и нужно только бежать и стрелять в то что движется. Да я не спорю щас возможно и появились те игры где все это есть и где подано все на много лучше чем в Half-Life.Но откуда нам знать что другие разработчики не позаимствовали какие то зачатки идей от Valve которые они попытались вложить в эту игру но почему то только частично.Ибо как известно все что новое хорошо забытое старое...Да ,можно сказать что :- ой на то время небыло нормальных игр и мне приходилось играть только в нее . Но есть одно \"но\".Прошло много лет с тех времен когда вышла эта игра и все стали забывать про этот стиль игры которую нам преподнесли Valve.Но бац спустя не мало лет в свет уже выходит сына по имени \"Half-Life2\". И его ждет тот же самый оглушительный успех который когда то получила первая часть. Даже учитывая то что у Valve были большие проблемы до выхода игры.Ее как вы уже знаете украли еще в алфе версии.Но разрабочики не пали духом.Они сели и полностью переделали игру и она пристала перед нами в новых красках.Более яркой и заманчивой чем было до этого. И снова фанаты проснулись и снова начали ее восхвалять.Это я все к тому что в этот промежуток между первой частью и второй оказывается и не было ни каких оглушительных игр в этом прекрасном жанре и что сколько времени не прошло все равно все будут помнить эти бородатые запоминающие игровые моменты которые им пришлось пережить во время прохождения.Если вы не пройдете эту игру и вам покажется что она скучная...То знайте ваш мозг совсем уже засох и не в состоянии решить головоломки 90-х годов.Удачи !=) Сложность только hard !","timestamp_created":1393289064,"timestamp_updated":1393289064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":41,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.778377175331115723","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5P2fs8QCfeelIw=="}
