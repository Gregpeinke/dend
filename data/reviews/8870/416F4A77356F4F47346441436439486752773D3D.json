Great storyline with a very interesting ending. Gameplay was fun, sort of reminded me of Assassin's Creed meets Fallout with less of an RPG feel. Felt very similar to the 2008 Tomb Raider that I also bought not too long ago. Anyway, great buy, definitely worth shelling out a few bucks for. Can't say anything about the DLC seeing as I'm still on the fence whether to buy it or not, but I would highly recommend this game, especially if you're into trippy endings.","timestamp_created":1446526340,"timestamp_updated":1446526340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18851350","author":{"steamid":"76561198160631293","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1519064434},"language":"russian","review":"Good game","timestamp_created":1446525713,"timestamp_updated":1446525713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18849865","author":{"steamid":"76561198111382127","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1448824934},"language":"english","review":"This game breaks your brain lititerly breaks in to million different pieces\n\nYou can't replay this game after the ending.\n\nElizabeth is the best friend ever. \n\nSkylines should be in real life\n\nI found a pineapple on one of my enemy's body \n\n12/10 \nBest game i have ever played. period","timestamp_created":1446517599,"timestamp_updated":1446517964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18849087","author":{"steamid":"76561198044210264","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":689,"last_played":1572928429},"language":"english","review":"Easily the best ending to a game i've ever scene.

Honestly don't read this unless you've played the game already, it's either gonna ruin the game for you if you decide to buy the game regardless or it you will miss out on a great game. See? This is all you needed, I \"recommended\" it, now get out.\n\nI feel... mostly disappointed. In the game, in myself in the disgusting \"Clash in the Clouds\" DLC. Seriously don't play that. Infinite is not bad, it's really not. Maybe if I hadn't watched a Let's Play of it when it came out... maybe it would have been different. The story is ok, it's not all that thrilling once you realize that some things don't quite fit together but it doesn't have glaring plot holes so I don't think people that play it for the first time will really notice what I mean. For me, four things \"broke\" the game for me. \nThe glitches, there are a bunch and for a game whose value is SO tied to Elizabeth it didn't help that many of the glitches were tied to her.\nThe pacing(and the dialogue). Infinite was too fast paced in my opinion, it goes from plot point to plot point without fully developing the characters in between.\nExample{BIG Spoilers}:\n\n[spoiler]Towards the end of the game Comstock tell Liz to ask Booker about her finger, he freaks out and kills him, he says that he will prove he had nothing to do with her finger by destroying \"the Syphon\"(no need to know what that is) to unlock Liz' powers. Thing is, how did he know that destroying the Syphon would in any way help prove his innocence? Who knows, but it gets worse, when they are finally about to destroy the Syphon after the most annoying battle in the game, the narrative is flipped and he asks Liz \"if she's sure\" to which she answers \"it's the only way\". HE wanted to destroy the Syphon. Eh, whatever, there is more of that in the game, my big issue is that it could have been fixed with 3 more lines of dialogue where they think about how to solve the problem instead of just doing something, anything, to advance the plot. It makes the game feel rushed, which it didn't really need to be.\n[/spoiler]\n\nThe battles, this one ties in with the pacing. Battles are everywhere, you fight all the time and you fight everybody. Sure you can skip most of them but that just means running through the enemies and hoping you get to the next area without having to open a lock which is only possible after you clear the enemies. Irrational, why are you trying to push the whole \"Booker is a genocidal maniac\" angle so much?\n\nBut in the end, the one thing that made this into a mediocre game for me was that I couldn't make myself like Liz, there were times where I felt compassion for her but that was it, I had no urge to \"save her\" if it wasn't for a feeling of \"well I guess it'd be kinda shitty of me to just leave\". [spoiler] And I wasn't happy when she choked my like a baby in it's cradle [/spoiler] In the end this is why I recommend this game, most people will be able to look past mistakes this game makes because they will like her, I envy those people. I don't remember what I felt for Liz when I watched that Let's Play years ago, I wish I did, did I fell in love with the character or was it the same? In the end I didn't love her like Liara, I didn't identify with her like Jodie and I didn't want to protect her like Ellie. I feel bad about it, so I guess that's something. A unique feeling for a... unique character.\n\nIt's a good looking game, it's a nice game.
