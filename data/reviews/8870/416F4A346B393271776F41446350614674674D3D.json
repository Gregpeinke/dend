It's clearly a COMPLETELY different game compared to the original two games. Different isn't bad, but when the game isn't connected to the original Bioshock series, besides a GLORIFIED fan service reference to the original Rapture city. Besides it being a cash grab in a sense, the story is a complex multiverse mess. With adding the multiverse, it weakens the original universe we originate from. \nDon't get me started with the OVERRATED ending.\n\nOVERALL:\nThe game-play is more than fine, it's a weaker version of the combat mechanic in the original series. Infinite is visually gorgeous, it certainly keeps the beautiful scenery from the original games. Unfortunately the story falls flat when the multiverse is brought up upon. \n\nIn the end, I don't recommend this game one bit of you're expecting a classic like the first two Bioshock games.

She's Rapunzel, but manages to avoid being an overly-goofy, fish out of water.\n\nThe pitched battles can be quite difficult, as you are usually attacked by a lot of enemies at once, and it's not easy to use the keys for movement, melee attacks, and aim with the mouse at the same time.  \n\nThe game feels simpler than the earlier ones in this series.  No real puzzles or choices.  Just walk forward, collect stuff and shoot people.\n\nThe moral ambiguity of Rapture is missing.  It's clear who the bad guys are, here.  Even so, the average person in this setting is unthreatening, and so shooting up a bunch of their policemen feels more like murder than defending myself from splicers did.  \n\nThere are a lot of things that I would like a better explanation of, but the main character doesn't ask very many questions.  \n\nThe game is entertaining enough but the experience of it doesn't feel as compelling as the earlier games.\n\nChanging my review to negative after playing the game more.  The pitched battles in the game are not fun, and there are a lot of them.  It doesn't really matter if you die in the battle because you come right back, and you don't need to plan, because Elizabeth tosses you whatever you need.  At some point, I quit listening to the story, because the story is irrelevant.

have been playing these kind of games since 4ever. I played doom (the original one) when it came out. I cant remember to be so frustrated and bored at the same time with an rpg. Especially not with a game that got so extremely good references in the past. \nSo here is my opinion - and it will be quite different to what you probably have read before: this game sucks. The story is void so far. (As I played it.) You ll get chunks of lore through tapes that u play. But you wont be able to make sense of it. The girl at your side throws you goodies now and then. She holds a secret, but why would you care? Her actions are not interesting, a personality she does not have, really. Play sands of time: there you have a persona... The gameplay is not balanced not thought trough. If you die, you can resume basically from the point you died. It does not matter. Just wear that foe down - no matter how many lives it takes. You cant dodge the foes, you cant hide. The foes have no strategy nor IQ. But they are faster than you. And you cant tell the enemies that hit you really. It is a mess when hell breaks loose. Very, very frustrating. But hey, just play again. Who cares really if you die. There is no \"load saved game\" button. Simply not necessary. That means the game is so badly balanced that the lesser players do not mind about it because they will do progress no matter what. The game programmers did not have to worry about balancing because they put in this fail-save-mode of resurrection. The way you get ressurected does not even make sense since it is your friend who helps you out. In the middle of the battle this brittle girl somehow pulls your half-dead body out of the lead-loaded battleground, fixes you together and off you go again. Makes no sense! Therefore not fun. About the story: I have no idea what happend in Bioshock 2 or 1. I never felt so clueless about what is going on around me! There is NO explanaition. All the people I kill... why am I where I am, why did I signd up for this contract, who the frack am I anyway??? Void. Does not matter. Just respawn already. Listen to the clues we give you and at the very very end - believe us - it will make sense. In a pseudo-interesting way with paralel realities and shit that will pull your socks of! Believe us! Just play to the very end!! You ll see. \n Just beat your way though the levels where you have two play modes: Mode one: run around and check every dustbin (!) for goodies (you love to eat hot-dogs that you find in a trashcan, dont you?! Even if thy restore basically no health? Be a good boy, look for trashcans, be a good bum! Eat what other some random dude left behind. You re the big hero after all. Go on now, eat!) Mode two: face a horde of shitty pawns that you can easily control and - or defeat plus ONE opponement that is way to fast, can handle way to much punch, something you cant outrun or hide from. Just wear it down - no matter how many respawns it takes. Who cares?? Wear it down and after that you can run around and collect goodies and try to make sense of what you re supposed to do next. Dont try to make too much sense of it thouth. Be a good boy, check the trash! \nI really tried to like the game. It got so many good reviews... God knows what got into the journalists who gave that pice of garbage a thumbs up. I guess they never really played the game and copypasted what some other dude wrote before. Not that would be surprising... Who wants to swim against the tide anyway, right? \nGuess what: I do.","timestamp_created":1651622159,"timestamp_updated":1651622159,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114904744","author":{"steamid":"76561198814167257","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1280,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1280,"last_played":1651611888},"language":"spanish","review":"C obra maestra","timestamp_created":1651614419,"timestamp_updated":1651614419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114900082","author":{"steamid":"76561198876847383","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1651864631},"language":"russian","review":"ахуенная игра еще никогда так быстро 3 часа не скипал","timestamp_created":1651606927,"timestamp_updated":1651606927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114899688","author":{"steamid":"76561198943677454","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":599,"last_played":1651605945},"language":"turkish","review":"sevmedigim seyler\n\nhikayeyi anlamadım benim mallıgım yuzunden olabilir\naskerleri öldüre öldüre çok sıkılıyom\nbide mesela A yerine gittik oradan B yerine gitti, B de aradığımız şey yok A ya gidip geri B ye geliyoruz çok sıkıcı oluyo\nkarakterlere de ısınamadım \n\nsevdigim seyler\n\nelizabeth oyunda çok işe yarıyo mermi can mana verip duruyo yani işe yaramayan bi npc değil\noyunun dünyası güzel \nvuruş hissi iyi\n\nbüyük hevesle almiştim ama begenmedim :(","timestamp_created":1651606345,"timestamp_updated":1651606345,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114899142","author":{"steamid":"76561199149370920","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1556,"last_played":1652050687},"language":"brazilian","review":"Amei td","timestamp_created":1651605502,"timestamp_updated":1651605502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503225803375244141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114894415","author":{"steamid":"76561198348349264","num_games_owned":729,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":636,"last_played":1653071211},"language":"schinese","review":"战斗射击非常牛，射击手感很棒，剧情更是封神了，只是没有整块时间自己体会剧情，看了解读才看懂，真的神作！","timestamp_created":1651598399,"timestamp_updated":1651598399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114889117","author":{"steamid":"76561198404442893","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":858,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":532,"last_played":1653055293},"language":"schinese","review":"二刷依旧的很棒，谁又能拒绝一位时刻在身旁打辅助的妹子呢！","timestamp_created":1651590870,"timestamp_updated":1651590870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114888571","author":{"steamid":"76561198052209694","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2379,"last_played":1651872743},"language":"russian","review":"77\n","timestamp_created":1651590126,"timestamp_updated":1651590126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114887372","author":{"steamid":"76561198097898081","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2288,"last_played":1652406332},"language":"english","review":"Since I first played it on PS3, I've played through this game at least 5 times now.

I don't leave reviews usually but I thought I might specifically for this one. 5/5 rate for anyone.","timestamp_created":1651550134,"timestamp_updated":1651550134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114864923","author":{"steamid":"76561198823010910","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":462,"last_played":1651547136},"language":"english","review":"my brain hurts","timestamp_created":1651547262,"timestamp_updated":1651547262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114863088","author":{"steamid":"76561198178135355","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1625011744},"language":"latam","review":"god","timestamp_created":1651543744,"timestamp_updated":1651543744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114861213","author":{"steamid":"76561198206883767","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1541,"last_played":1651445750},"language":"spanish","review":"A pesar de los años, es un juego que no envejece, sobre todo por su gran historia distópica. 10/10","timestamp_created":1651540211,"timestamp_updated":1651540211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114860956","author":{"steamid":"76561198024738481","num_games_owned":890,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":738,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":738,"last_played":1621569676},"language":"english","review":"This ones my favorite of the three gameplay-wise.
