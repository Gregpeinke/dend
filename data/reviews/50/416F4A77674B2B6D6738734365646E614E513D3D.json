Добавлено больше врагов которые на мой взгляд получились намного сильнее чем в оригинальной игре, да и вообще сама по себе эта часть хардкорная как не странно бы звучало. Добавлены и новые оружия - холодные оружия, (Но с ломом не сравнится ни что) с которыми на много интереснее играть чем в оригинал. Теперь за место фонарика у вас будет ночное видение, с которым в некоторых местах удобнее играть, а в некоторых местах и нет. Ну и самая вкусняшка заключается в том, что с вами, в нескольких моментах будут бегать и помогать ваши соратники. Неплохой подход к геймплею. В этом Gearbox Software отлично постарались. \n\nСюжетная линия тоже завораживает, но вот правда диалоги получились тупые. Постоянно слышишь нытье солдат, которые каждый раз повторяют: \"Нужно сваливать с этого места\", \"Забудьте о Фримене! У нас тяжёлые потери! Мы отступаем!\". Это немного меня настораживает. Ведь они солдаты, нытье оставлять должны при себе. [/i]\n\n[i] Дополнение получилось хорошим, чем то и лучше оригинала, но не более того.

You could say it replaces the scripted sequences of a modern shooter with masterful tone and brilliant variance in level design. Also, the GoldSource engine holds up surprisingly well today at the highest settings; it doesn't look fantastic, but if you can stomach it for five minutes you tend to forget about it.

The bottom line is this is a great expansion pack.\n\nYou are a marine, Corporal Adrian Shepard sent into the Black Mesa facility after Half Life 1's protagonist Gordon Freeman uh accidentally created a rift in space / time and brought aliens in. Everyone talks to you in the game without cut scenes.\n\nWhen you start the game, Gordon in Half Life 1 is still there and your mission goes from being sent to kill him to fighting for your own survival. You visit portions of the first game yet changed, such as you will visit some of the entry tunnel from the first segment of Half Life 1. You will visit the dam from the original game. Everything changed with new challenges in each. There are plenty of puzzles some are different than the original game and others are more complex. Such as instead of having to use a push box once, you need to use it 3x pushing it from room to room.\n\nI'd say those old environments (destroyed with new challenges) are maybe 1/100th of the map content. The new environments feel fresh and they use a lot of lighting to make it look different. It feels fresh because the other universe is starting to be integrated into our own universe through the aliens making it and because Black Mesa had creature exhibits. There are new textures, you'll go through vine covered sewers where giant fat aliens have their nests.\n\nThere are also new gameplay elements that you will be introduced to in an optional training course. The training course is a very nice tutorial that will show you everything new such as ropes to climb and swing on. It's a very nice mechanic. The flashlight has been replaced by night vision goggles which are very nice. You also have new squad mates to find in the game that will aide you like the medic who can heal you on command, the engineer who will blow torch his way through some doors and your standard commandos. Each of these three will fight intelligently and won't just stand around getting shot. They will defend the territory if you command them to stand there.\n\nThat's another thing the enemy and friendly AI is great as always from the game. AI will run from grenades, throw their own grenades, flank you, run from your fire and other things. It's very nice.\n\nThere are a lot of new weapons. I was surprised. You start with new melee weapons, a new pistol with an optional laser sight, a new sniper rifle that can be quite useful, new alien technology (if you don't want to hear just skip to the next paragraph), such as an electrical gun, a cannon that looks like a BFG from Doom (only more awesome), an acid spitting alien, and a ceiling grabber (yes the enemy) that can be used as a hook shot!\n\nAll the old enemies are here too... but there are a lot of new enemies too (if you don't want it spoiled, skip on!), the new enemies seem to be faster and more dangerous. From waist high creatures that run to you, to taller electric shooting aliens controlled by ant like parasites, giant fat electrical discharging enemies... and their offspring, the list goes on, but you'll be surprised at some of the things the expansion comes up with.\n\nWith a 5+ hour play through the first time, I do wish it was a bit longer so they could divvy out the enemies a bit slower. But hey it's an expansion pack. The graphics are not improved and they still have bugs like getting stuck in the floor of elevators and lifts, but all of that can be overlooked. A lot has been added to make this expansion worth anyone's time.

Of course, you can't beat God (Half-Life, in this case) if you're an angel (OF), God is God for a reason! And that's the stupidest analogy I've ever made up, but bear with me, games like Opposing Force are never easy to make justice in words. But what I mean is, even though this game can't beat Half-Life, it was incredible. I'm not going to lie; I found certain things a tiny, tiny tiny tiny bit more \"WOOOAAHHH\" than Half-Life, but y'know... HALF-LIFE, MAN.\n\nSomething that amazed me from the game is the fact I was actually busting my ass to save every grunt I encountered. I loathed these bastards in Half-Life and Blue Shift; I mean, they killed the poor scientists/security guards and actually enjoyed it! It was so sad! And I'm so used to killing them that every time I encountered a group of HECU marines, I'd panic and start shooting them. Then I'd be like \"Oh. Right\", and pressed the F9 key (my reload last save). At first I didn't mind and let them die, but dammit, they grew on me, to the point I'd truly be attempting to save them. I just felt fond of them. Except for the grunt that pushes the scientist when he's asking for Freeman when you're about to board the Osprey in which you're supposed to escape. That grunt I killed. ALSO, TWO GRUNTS ABANDONED ME IN CHAPTER 11 (The Package). I WENT TO EXPLORE A ROOM AND WHEN I GOT OUT THEY JUST DISAPPEARED. Cunts.\n\nGetting more serious now, something that really impressed me from Opposing Force besides the guns, the Race X and the new \"puzzles\", was the large-scale battles you can have at times. If you take care of your squad, you can have a group of at least four grunts with you. So when you encounter a lot of enemies, the fights are phenomenal! Sadly, this only happened once to me, I was barely able to get three grunts to follow me most of the time because some grunts were just too stubborn and stupid to follow me. This is the strongest flaw I encountered in the game; the grunts' AI is really stupid in the vast majority of the time. And they were also generally pretty useless in battle, and I'm not even counting the times I died because of friendly fire. However, there was one time in which I was able to have an epic Black Ops-Shock Troopers-HECU battle. Replayed it about four times just to repeat the breathtaking sequence. Unfortunately, it was hard to achieve and generally I spent too much time in the game trying to get everyone to follow me, which is simply precious game-time wasted. This is quite disappointing, in my opinion, since the rest of the game is of such extreme quality. \n\nBeing someone who's mostly played modern games, I have to say Opposing Force (as well as HL and BS) looks really good and its graphics are not bad at all for being a nearly twenty year old game. And even if the graphics were terrible (they're decent, in my opinion), the game would make up for it with its fantastic atmosphere, gameplay, battles, bosses, guns, ambiance and so forth. I also adored Gordon's direct and indirect appearances; his \"employee of the month\" photograph (was that his office?), his constant mention by the grunts and finally his Chapter 6 (\"We Are Not Alone\") direct appearance: where you actually see him. I seriously replayed that sequence seven times. I LOVE WHEN GAMES CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER SO DIRECTLY. Thinking that while you're still fighting your way through Black Mesa, Gordon is beating the crap out of Gonarch and everyone (or everything?) else. Opposing Force is, quite simply, a passionate application of creative design. I seriously cannot wait for Tripmine Studios' remake. \n\nDefinitely recommend the game. But as I also said on my BS review; only play it if you have played Half-Life. Otherwise, the game might feel dull to you and you won't understand the storyline, and won't be able to fan-girl over Gordon's appearances/mentions... well... if you're a crazy fan.

Einfach nur ein geiler Zusatz, mit logischer und nachvollziehbarer Handlung und die neuen Waffen sind einfach nur geil.\n\nIch fange jetzt nicht mit dem Zusammenfassen der Story an, aber man ist Corporal Adrian Shepard, soll mit seinem Team Gordon Freeman ausschalten (warum auch immer), man gerät aber direkt in den Black Mesa Zwischenfall rein und muss sich dann mit großer Mühe und vor allem Geduld, da manchmal die Gegner einfach sau unfair sind, z.B. 10 Voltigores auf einmal) wieder entkommen. Am Ende kommt dann ein für Half Life typischer G-Man Monolog, und man erfährt wieder nicht, was mit der Hauptfigur passiert.\n\nDas Spiel macht für sein Alter alles richtig, bis auf die komische Funktion des Seilkletterns oder die Balance zwischen Schaden nehmen und Heilen. Mit den manchmal vielen Gegnern kommt man klar, wenn man sich mit dem Spiel zurecht gefunden hat. Die vielen Neuerungen gegenüber zum ersten Half Life, wie neue Waffen, das Seilklettern, odder tatsächlich ein erstes mehr oder weniger funktionierendes Teamsystem, machen echt Spaß und bringen etwas Abwechslung rein. Das Tutorial funktioniert auch prächtig. Man lernt alles, was man braucht, von Springen und Klettern, verschiedene Schusswaffen bis hin zum Kennenlernen seines Platoons, ist alles dabei. Am Besten am Tutorial gefällt mir, dass der Sergant am Anfang aus dem Film \"Full Metal Jacket\" zitiert.\n\nMit dem Spiel bin ich als geübter Half Life Spieler gut klar gekommen, auch wenn ich manchmal wegen den dummen Black Ops fast einen Anfall bekam. Aber ich hab mich zusammengerissen und denen die Fresse mit dem Elektrokäfer (meine Lieblingswaffe in OF) eingeschossen. Leider war das Spiel recht schnell vorbei, und ab dem Punkt, wo man alleine im Lagerkeller gegen die Black Ops kämpfen muss (ihr werdet es meken, welche Stelle ich meine), fühlte sich das Spiel irgentwie dahingerusht an, als ob es genervt wäre und alles schnell hinter sich haben wollte. Auf eine Fortsetzung warte ich bestimmt nicht als Einziger, aber vermutlich vergeblich. Der Multiplayer ist auch ok, aber nicht das Highlight, da oft viele Leute auf einmal einen hohen Ping bekommen.\n\nZusammenfassung: Mal die andere Sichtweise von Half Life 1, macht aber viel Spaß und ist das bisschen Geld absolut wert. Coole Waffen, coole Kämpfe, cooles Spiel. Wenn ihr Half Life 1 gemocht habt, kann ich euch das Spiel nur empfehlen, allerdings ist es kein Einstiegstitel in die Serie, da würde ich euch lieber HL2 vorschlagen.","timestamp_created":1422976407,"timestamp_updated":1422976407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14303350","author":{"steamid":"76561198140531353","num_games_owned":779,"num_reviews":141,"playtime_forever":500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":500,"last_played":1422268143},"language":"english","review":"Great expansion for the first Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1422918180,"timestamp_updated":1422918180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14297597","author":{"steamid":"76561198149614736","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":6934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":369,"last_played":1586971333},"language":"english","review":"laggy \n i try to play this game  but sometimes it lags more than my newer games","timestamp_created":1422893259,"timestamp_updated":1422893259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14296764","author":{"steamid":"76561198061858838","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2727,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2727,"last_played":1456430097},"language":"english","review":"Release in 1999 Half Life Opposinf Force was the first expansion to the ever popular Half life game. \nReally awesome game whit an awesome storymode that tells the player the story of Adrian Shephard and his journey inside Black mesa.","timestamp_created":1422889270,"timestamp_updated":1459192354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14269515","author":{"steamid":"76561198044291037","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":176,"last_played":1420856157},"language":"english","review":"I consider this to be among the one of the best expansions released during the time Half-Life was at its peak of popularity.

Also not much content (maps and mods) was produced for it compared to Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1422747763,"timestamp_updated":1422747763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14262719","author":{"steamid":"76561198152497403","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":586,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":586,"last_played":1420418315},"language":"english","review":"\n\nFirst-person-shooter mission packs are usually mediocre: Throw together a few new levels, put in some more guns, add a spider, and you've got a commercial add-on for your aging product. As such, it's appropriate that Gearbox Software's Opposing Force, the official expansion for the genre-redefining Half-Life, in turn sets a new standard of quality for future action-game mission packs.\n\nOpposing Force's story recounts the events of Half-Life, but from the opposing side's perspective as implied by the title. You are Marine Corporal Adrian Shephard. You've been sent to the Black Mesa Research Facility to locate and eliminate Gordon Freeman. As in the original, things immediately go awry, mistakes are made, people die, and your initial plan is replaced with a complicated fight for survival. It's a testament to the success of Half-Life that its story actually warrants retelling. The developers know that while Adrian Shephard has no idea what Freeman is doing, you do, and they pack the game with clues as to where you are in relation to Half-Life's hero. Your path initially converges with Freeman's, then takes some unexpected detours. Many of the original settings and incidents are referred to or revisited from a slightly altered perspective, and it's a ringing endorsement of their effectiveness that to give any of them away would lessen your enjoyment of the game.\n\nLike Half-Life, Opposing Force's greatest strength is its success at consistently delivering surprises. You can sense the designers' enthusiasm as one memorable scene unfolds after another, and it compels you to keep playing. Although Opposing Force is only about one third as long as its predecessor, it's packed with original content. There isn't much filler in the game, so while you may finish it in just over ten hours or so, the experience feels much more complete and satisfying than many longer games, which tend to be padded with hours of drearily similar firefights.\n\nDespite its relatively short length, there's plenty of shooting in Opposing Force. Instead of limiting you to fighting alongside no more than two of Half-Life's weakling scientists or security guards, you can now recruit a squad of up to eight marines. The marines have the same advanced artificial intelligence as when they were your enemies in Half-Life, so that some of the large-scale battles staged in Opposing Force are simply phenomenal. Even though the game doesn't require you to do so, you'll want to replay such combat sequences just to try out different strategies in an effort to reduce friendly casualties.However, although the game lets you lead so many companions, you'll likely never have more than four at a time thanks to the AI's finicky following behavior. Opposing Force's only significant flaw is that it's often difficult to keep your followers in line. In some instances they simply appear to become confused, and at other times there is an invisible line they will not cross. It's usually unclear which of these two reasons keeps your squad from moving forward, so you'll spend too much time trying in vain to keep it assembled. This is a shame, as the rest of the game is of such high quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposing Force adds nine new weapons to Half-Life's arsenal. There are a few additions to each original category - standard guns, experimental guns, and alien artifacts - and each is useful for the most part. An especially clever version of a grappling hook is put to good use in many of Opposing Force's action sequences and puzzles. The new experimental weapon's secondary firing mode transports you to a small section of the alien world Xen, where you can gather some extra health and ammo in the heat of battle.\n\nMost of the aliens in Half-Life weren't nearly as crafty as the enemy soldiers. Opposing Force introduces a new breed of alien warrior that is the marine's tactical equal, along with about ten other new allies and adversaries, including a few impressive boss monsters. Some of the new 3D models are merely window dressing but add to the game's rich atmosphere. A great number of scripted sequences have also been created for Opposing Force, which are often darkly humorous - the designers at Gearbox seem to harbor a real grudge against Half-Life's hapless scientists and dispatch them with sadistic ingenuity.\n\nOpposing Force doesn't include any new multiplayer game modes but is packaged with a set of multiplayer maps designed by a team of \"all-stars\" assembled by Gearbox, including such level design luminaries as Tom \"Paradox\" Mustaine and the Levelord. As you'd expect, these map designs are all at least competent. Most of the new weapons and character models are also available in the multiplayer game. However, the excellent single-player experience remains the best reason to get Opposing Force.\n\nWhile it doesn't add anything new to the graphics or technology of Half-Life, Opposing Force still manages to thrill through the impassioned application of creative design. It's the interactive equivalent of a page-turner; you'll finish it in a marathon sitting just trying to see what surprise lies around the next corner. Quite simply, the best first-person shooter ever released is now bolstered by the finest mission pack yet created.","timestamp_created":1422723255,"timestamp_updated":1422723255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524357914924621582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14258006","author":{"steamid":"76561198026125316","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":553,"last_played":1409726438},"language":"spanish","review":"Uno de mis shooters favoritos de antaño, cuando conoci half life por ahi del año 2000 no me imagine la posibilidad de jugar del lado de los swat.\nUsa el mismo motor del hal life original asi que tiene unas graficas bastante buenas aunque eso si muy \"cuadradas\" tenemos que tener en cuenta que en esos tiempos era lo mejor que se tenia en graficas y a mi parecer se sigue viendo bastante bien para ya tener minimo unos 15 años.\nLa jugabilidad es muy comoda, sus controles creo que ahora son un \"estandar\" en la industria de los juegos, la camara al ser en primera persona es igual bastante comoda y no se tiene el (horrible) problema de que haya puntos en los que pierdas de vista a tu personaje...\nEste juego es muy recomendable tenerlo sobre todo si ya jugaste hal life 1 y te enganchaste con la historia.\nLo malo.\nLo que realmente encontre malo en este juego fue el final, despues de terminar el juego segun recuerdo de haberlo jugado fuera de la paltaforma de steam salia una animacion y con eso se concluia el juego, en esta version terminas con el jefe final y no pasa nada, no corre la animacion y no puedes ver el \"final\" como tal, se me hace increible que no exista solucion a este problema pero bueno fuera de eso todo muy bien.","timestamp_created":1422705578,"timestamp_updated":1422705578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14225887","author":{"steamid":"76561198046409009","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1455468159},"language":"turkish","review":"Harika bir oyun nostaji sevenler için harika :D","timestamp_created":1422545612,"timestamp_updated":1422545612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513406872749328613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14223017","author":{"steamid":"76561198014511853","num_games_owned":239,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":519,"last_played":1602863017},"language":"english","review":"Classic FPS game you can't miss out on 10/10","timestamp_created":1422531269,"timestamp_updated":1422531269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14220042","author":{"steamid":"76561198043108500","num_games_owned":880,"num_reviews":588,"playtime_forever":56,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56,"last_played":1400952166},"language":"english","review":"Very great sidestory, very good gameplay, however poor multiplayer.\n\nWould recommend this to those that goes for story mode, and probably for mods too.","timestamp_created":1422509127,"timestamp_updated":1422509127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14217061","author":{"steamid":"76561198045846978","num_games_owned":557,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":348,"last_played":1441915494},"language":"english","review":"Opposing Force suffers from some irritating issues, but it's a good choice, especially for 2€.\n\n[+] It's half life for christ's sake\n[+] It's 1,5x longer than Blue Shift and has much more gameplay variety\n[+] G-Man behaves in a more intrusive manner than in the original\n[+] It's very challenging, makes the original HL look like a walk in the park...\n\n[-] ...but sometimes is simply unfair - some enemies are extremely overpowered\n[-] Many weapons.

Gearbox Software have made a thoroughly brilliant expansion for Half-Life which I could imagine, was no easy task, since it had to mirror the world of Half-Life whilst adding something new to the plate.\n\nIn Opposing Force the player gets to see the Black Mesa Incident from a different perspective. You play as one of the military specialists assigned to located and eliminate Gordon Freeman but the main objective ends up being to pull out of the alien infested and fragile Black Mesa Research Facility.\n\nThis expansion really well done and cleverly coincides simultaneously with the events of the original game. The gameplay is similar to the way the original plays but since you are playing the role of a military specialist (Adrian Shepherd is the protagonist's name), the game is tailored to meet these changes. You have a wealth of weapons and tools at your disposal with the trusty crowbar being replaced by a trustee wrench. The new weapons feel fresh and interesting to keep combat varied and fairly tactical. There is a new Desert Eagle for you to use and alien weapons such as the Barnacle tongue launcher to cling to higher places. A great deal of the weapons match what would be used by a United States Marine Corps military specialist.\n\nThe core health system has been kept the same with the player having main health and armour health. However, there are changes to this system such as using a Power Combat Vest (PCV) as opposed to normal HEV suits. Health packs, health stations and PCV stations aren't the only way to replenish health and armour. You now regularly find squad mates in the form of medics who can help you out in rough situations. The medic can be used to assist in assaults on the battlefield and you can also take advantage of them to administer first aid, ultimately refilling lost health. Another type of new NPC is the engineer which is crucial towards progressing further into the game. Like the medic you can have the engineer aid you in the game when it comes to firepower, but obviously not with first aid. The engineer is invaluable to get through heavily secured steel doors as they are equipped with the tools and expertise to accomplish this. I found these additions to be a neat touch since it gave the game a more tactical feel. And since there didn't seem to be a wealth of health stations and packs, the player is kind of forced to make use of the medic and the engineer.\n\nThe creatures of the mysterious and fascinating alien world of Xen are present in Opposing Force but there is a delightful number of new alien creatures for you to battle against. These alien creatures manifest themselves during the latter parts of the game and are known as Race X suggesting that they are separate from the world of Xen and are from a different world and dimension. The following are some of the names for the Race X creatures: Voltigore, Pit Drone, Pit Worm, and Shock Trooper.\n\nAs you would expect with an expansion pack the game is a little bit shorter than the original but still provides around 5 - 10 hours of enjoyment with solid gameplay and an interesting storyline which skilfully coincides with the first game. This is surprisingly a very good expansion and will leave you feeling satisfied.","timestamp_created":1421762063,"timestamp_updated":1421762850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14079385","author":{"steamid":"76561198162673146","num_games_owned":570,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":437,"last_played":1588122994},"language":"english","review":"I played this game after beating the orignal Half Life as well as Half Life 2 and all its episodes. Going in to Opposing Force, I didn't know what to expect. While I enjoyed Half Life 1, coming fresh from the updated and arguably superior format of it's sequels made me worry that the original game's engine wouldn't hold up to Source. Boy, was I wrong. Opposing Force is a fantastic expansion that, much like the original game it's adding to, holds up to the test of time and is an absolute blast throughout. I'd say I even liked it more than Half-Life 2's episodes. Definitely a must for anyone who enjoyed Half-Life 1 and is itching for more adventures in Black Mesa.","timestamp_created":1421744896,"timestamp_updated":1421744896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgK+mg8sCednaNQ=="}
