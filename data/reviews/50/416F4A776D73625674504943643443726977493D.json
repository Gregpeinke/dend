One of my favorite things to do in a video game is play the antagonist, experience the not-so-heroic side of things. This game nails that perfectly. From killing civilians to chasing Gordon Freeman ever-so closely makes this game an incredibly different experience that we've come to enjoy and know from Half-Life.\n\nAnother great element was the huge amount of new weapons and enemies that aren't seen in Half-Life. It gives this game it's own personality and really makes it stand out among the other games in the franchise. So many unique elements in this game, things completely exclusive to this game.\n\nOne of my least favorite things from Half-Life and Blue Shift were the Xen levels, however. But here, Opposing force did that well, too. You go to Xen for possibly a grand total of 5 minutes in this 6 hour game. It's not that I don't like Xen, it's just the level design in those parts consistently tended to fall apart in those segments.\n\nThis game also greatly encourages working with your squad. Whenever they present to you a fellow soldier in the game, shortly after, there will be a series of hostiles that you could take by yourself, but would prove to be a bit tough, even with all the weapons the game gives you, but would prove an absolute cake walk with a team. Which is great, because, this way, you don't feel like an all-powerful God that nothing can stop, instead you just feel like a guy... with bottomless pockets to fit 20 guns.\n\nMy only gripe is that at times the level design was a bit questionable. The path forward wasn't always that obvious, and sometimes kind of, well, dumb. It's not often that I feel this, and it's never that bad, it's just... odd at times.\n\nOverall, I give Half-Life: Opposing Force:\n\n9.2 Weaponized Barnacles out of 10\n\nYeah, the weaponized barnacles might have been one of my favorite weapons. If only we got it sooner in the game, and was given more freedom with it. Fingers crossed Crowbar Collective makes a remake of this game on the same caliber as Black Mesa.","timestamp_created":1592353021,"timestamp_updated":1592353021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70883850","author":{"steamid":"76561198411137054","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1592313851},"language":"english","review":"Old

I found Half-Life 1 to be mostly good, Blue Shift was forgettable, Half-Life 2 and Episode One were mediocre, and Episode Two was actually quite good. But I found them to be a bit uninspired mostly. So when I played Opposing Force I went in thinking that it would also feel pretty meh but I was quite pleasantly surprised about how good Opposing Force actually is. So this time Development duties were handed off to Gearbox, yes the same Gearbox who would later make Borderlands, While Valve was involved in the creation of this game, they took a backseat overseeing role as they were busy with other projects at the time. So with that out of the way, let's look into what makes this game fantastic, and see if there are any flaws to be found\n\n\nPros:\n\n1. The Story is very interesting, you play as Cpl. Adrian Sheppard of the United States Marines, he is on the mission to eliminate all Black Mesa Personel to cover up the Black Mesa incident, however upon arrival your helicopter is shot down and you're taken into Black Mesa, and things continue from there.\n\n2. The level design is really good here as it's a nice blend of horror, puzzle solving and combat, it's also paced rather well which is appreciated.\n\n3. There are a lot of new enemies featured here such as some new aliens as well as a Male black ops varient of the assassin enemy which are as deadly as the female counterparts from the first game. This adds some variety to what you will encounter in the game which is nice.\n\n4. Sheppard is equipped with Night Vision instead of a Flash \n\n4. There are also many new weapons such as a Sniper Rifle, a Light Machine Gun, A Desert Eagle, A Wrench, A Combat Knife, The Displacer Cannon (Bootleg BFG), A shock roach, The Spore Launcher and the Barnacle Arm alongside the returning Spas 12, Tripmines, Grenades, MP5 and 9MM Pistol. These new weapons breathe new life into the game and really are fun to use, it makes the game feel fresh, and as an added Bonus: The Magnum and Crossbow appear in the game's Multiplayer.\n\n5. Speaking of Which: Multiplayer is back and is great once again, you have the traditional deathmatch which is fun and you also have a CTF (Capture The Flag) which is nice, and there are some fun new maps.\n\n6. The game is also paced really  well which is nice as I feel Half-Life 1 dragged on for a bit too long and got slow at times, thankfully this doesn't have this issue.\n\n7. G-Man makes an appearence in this game and that alone is a plus, because G-Man is awesome.\n\n8. The game ends with a pretty epic boss fight, although the boss is easy once you figure it out, but still it's great that sheppard got to finish off with a boss, unlike Barney who got a bunch of mere grunts.\n\n\n\n\nSo that's it for positives, you may be wondering is there any negatives? well there is maybe 1 or 2, so let's take a gander\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n1. The Enemies still rely on Hitscan here instead of projectiles which once again can lead to you getting drained easily if you aren't being careful, which just sucks honestly as you'd think an issue like that shouldn't exist. I get that Hitscan at the time is common and even nowadays still is, but like I always say if it's well implemented like in Doom then it isn't a problem at all, in Half-Life though it just is badly implemented and at times feels unfair.\n\n\n2. Some sections of the game can be insanely brutal making it hard to pass by with any HP left which can lead you to getting shredded on the next one. This normally isn't an issue if one plays with quick saves but for someone like me who doesn't, you may be in for some bumpy rides. \n\n\nBut yeah other than those 2 small blemishes, this game is honestly oustanding and easily the best Half-Life game of them all. You should absolutely give this game a try, even if you're only slightly interested in Half-Life, I would recommend giving this game a look as it's just fantastic, absolutely seek this out and play it if you are a Half-Life fan or want to play all the games.\n\n\nHalf-Life Opposing Force is a well done expansion and earns a 9/10","timestamp_created":1591378342,"timestamp_updated":1652242399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70341666","author":{"steamid":"76561199018771839","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":602,"last_played":1608827068},"language":"russian","review":"мне понравилось всё спасибо за все half life что есть спасибо за продолжения half life, но есть минус вы выпустили half life alyx вместо half life 3, но я знаю что будет half life 3","timestamp_created":1591376231,"timestamp_updated":1591376231,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70325176","author":{"steamid":"76561198398192586","num_games_owned":293,"num_reviews":75,"playtime_forever":194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1591350430},"language":"russian","review":"Как дополнение – почти идеальная игра с несущественными минусами.
