But as this is my first time playing, and I've never watched a walk through before, I had no idea what happened in the game apart from the very basic premise. \n\nMy main gripe, which is in my opinion a big one, is that for a new player like myself with no prior knowledge of the game, playing it and progressing can be difficult at times. Sure, some of the puzzles I should've guessed, but other ones I had absolutely no idea what to do or where to go and would have to consult with a Youtube video to find out what to do next. The game doesn't really seem to give you any pointers, just leaves you on your own to get frustrated at what on earth do you have to do to advance.\nFor me, this does ruin the game quite a bit as instead of just enjoying playing through the story and completing the puzzles I am frustrated and lost. I'm sure this might be partly to do with the fact that I don't really play story-style games, but nonetheless I think that is a serious flaw of the game.\n\nIf you enjoy sci-fi, adventure and action and don't mind getting frustrated often, this is the game for you.\n\nIf you're just looking for a chilled out sci-fi or adventure game that is easy to follow, Half Life is probably not going to be as good of an experience as people rave about.\n\nFor me, I still enjoy the game, not as much as I was expecting but I am still enthusiastic to play it.\n\n7.5/10","timestamp_created":1592153429,"timestamp_updated":1592153429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70785290","author":{"steamid":"76561198453149197","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":713,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":713,"last_played":1592152140},"language":"english","review":"It was not easy to finish","timestamp_created":1592152163,"timestamp_updated":1592152163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70783846","author":{"steamid":"76561198995747067","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":273,"last_played":1624888228},"language":"turkish","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1592150208,"timestamp_updated":1623759080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70781688","author":{"steamid":"76561198063156945","num_games_owned":451,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":287,"last_played":1645899764},"language":"english","review":"yeS","timestamp_created":1592147329,"timestamp_updated":1592147329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70778713","author":{"steamid":"76561198340660427","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":6928,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2361,"last_played":1634982189},"language":"english","review":"Gordon Feetman","timestamp_created":1592143377,"timestamp_updated":1592143377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70774351","author":{"steamid":"76561198021189329","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":1289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":385,"last_played":1592686017},"language":"english","review":"yeah it's a classic","timestamp_created":1592137522,"timestamp_updated":1592137522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70774326","author":{"steamid":"76561198109201663","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1007,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":949,"last_played":1592226694},"language":"schinese","review":"流程好长，容易迷路，怪物有点精神污染，玩着容易头晕，配合BGM这就是个恐怖游戏","timestamp_created":1592137488,"timestamp_updated":1592137488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70774155","author":{"steamid":"76561198798425182","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1448,"last_played":1643402538},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 1 is one of the best fps games ever that i played,the story is very good,soundtrack is very very very good that i fell in love with it.

It starts in 1998, most of the popular games at the time were Quake and Doom. In those games you play as super soldiers. Super hero-like characters with powerful strength. When Half-Life came out, you literally spawned playing as “man on his way to work”. It was a new concept compared to any other game, and even more relatable to the player. You didn't have super-strength, you didn't have mind-control. You were a normal scientist with a hazard suit. The suit, named HEV suit or Hazardous Environment Suit. It was the only real power that the main character, Gordon Freeman had at his disposal. It's a suit that's not meant for war, simply working in hazardous environments. \n\n\tWhen you start the game, you are greeted with a long train ride to your workplace. You are Gordon Freeman, a man with a PhD in Theoretical Physics. Along the train ride, you witness the advanced AI. You see NPCs (Non Playable Characters) at work, at break and interacting with each other. Having normal human conversations, such as “Do you know who ate all the doughnuts?” And generally complaining about work environments or equipment failures. \n\n\tYou work at Black Mesa Research Facility, a government facility located in the New Mexico desert. It's a top secret facility working on all sorts of super cool futuristic technologies. A massive underground facility with housing, amenities and even their own TV and news entertainment. They have a small security force that works all over the facility to protect it from any failed Frankenstein-like experiments.\n\n\tWhen you arrive at your train stop, you are greeted by a friendly security guard who lets you out of your train and warns you that you are late to work and they are soon going to start a big experiment. Once freed from the train car, you enter the lobby of Sector C. You are then greeted by NPCs who tell you that you are late and must go to the test chamber. Once you have put on the HEV Suit and arrived at the test chamber, you begin the experiment. As predicted, it goes very wrong. You unintentionally create a portal to another planet prompting the native species to invade earth.\n\n\tFighting your way through the facility, you learn that the military has been ordered to cover up everything. They do this by eliminating everyone associated with the failed experiment. When the military fails, the CIA special forces are there to do the same thing. They are even ordered to eliminate the leftover military forces who originally failed. All while this is happening, the player is mysteriously stalked by a man known as The G-Man. A tall pale man in a blue suit carrying a black leather briefcase. Nothing is really known about him and how he relates to the main game, but it's speculated that he plays a major role.\n\n\tI rate Half-Life 10/10. It is an absolute perfect RPG with an engaging story. Although at the time it took them 6 years to release Half-Life 2, I was not born yet so it did not affect me! I got to play the half life series back to back and I enjoyed every bit of it! I’ve bonded with many friends over the Half-Life series and even the games based off of Half-Life such as the Counter-Strike series, HL Deathmatch, Ricochet, Day Of Defeat and Gary’s Mod.
