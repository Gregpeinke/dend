The challenge itself is part of fun, and no, expected in the beginner mode, victory is not a guarantee, what makes it rewarding.\nThe only shortcoming is, I think, the perk system (the more you make kills in your class the more efficient you become in that class), which basically means one has to go the upper difficulty levels to find back the level it enjoyed at the beginning of the game.\nIn brief, it is a game where the players understand they're here to have fun, and basically you do have fun.","timestamp_created":1388097409,"timestamp_updated":1388097409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8315983","author":{"steamid":"76561198074996642","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":125,"last_played":1403212815},"language":"english","review":"So amazing and heart racing!!!!!!!!!!!\n:) i love it!\n","timestamp_created":1388097248,"timestamp_updated":1388097248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8315958","author":{"steamid":"76561198009385542","num_games_owned":800,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":747,"last_played":1365577200},"language":"english","review":"Better than L4D2","timestamp_created":1388097212,"timestamp_updated":1388097212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8315898","author":{"steamid":"76561198034576561","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":554,"last_played":1480733802},"language":"english","review":"One of the coolest games ever!","timestamp_created":1388097096,"timestamp_updated":1388097096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8315677","author":{"steamid":"76561197998306462","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1825,"last_played":1356854400},"language":"english","review":"Formerly was an example of what DLC should be like.
