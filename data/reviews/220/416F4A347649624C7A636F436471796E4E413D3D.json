Fighting large arrays of enemies ranging from antlions, to zombies, to the combine. There are many levels and chapters that never stop changing the gameplay. All the weapons have a purpose (with the exception of the 9mm pistol, late game.) The maps are very well decorated and the A.I. is very smart. The game is truely gameplay inspired since there are 2 cutscenes in the whole game. (beginning and end) Looting is a big thing, i found myself looking for crates to find ammo and health. The physics are amazing and the gravity gun isnt as OP as thought. There are vehicle sessions allowing you to drive with very well done driving mechanics. ( the airboat gun is so OP ) Theres also a compeling story. Though it may get confusing for those who havent played the first half life since there are so many references to the first game. Its also fun to just play with the gravity gun, ( i made a cooking show in the sandtraps chapter ) There are 14 chapters, each about 1-3 hours long. There is alot of content, unless you are a fan for multiplayer or co-op which is not featured here. (which was kinda obvious considering this is a half life game after all.) Thankfully there is a great save system that lets you save anywhere. I mostly used it when i died and got to where i left off, after being set back a little. There are puzzles in the game you must solve to get past a point or to get some much needed loot.\n\nHOWEVER, this game aint perfect. Because theres no minimap or more cutscenes its hard to tell us where to go. I got confused and where to go and had to look to tutorials on how to progress because the maps fail to tell you where to go. The game has its share of glitches but not too many. One of which, stopping every scripted event (including a door opening -.-) The game IS challenging but to me, i felt that it was too much at times. *SPOILER* There is a part where you fight striders and then a combine base. But the strider would see you if you tried to attack the base of combine, the striders couldnt die because there wasnt enough rockets spawned in the map to kill 2 striders. So you had to fight the base with a strider on you with combine shooting at you ALSO. *END SPOILER* Loot in the game becomes more and more futile as you get better guns because you really will only use the AR and shotgun the most and therefore you will look for AR and shotgun ammo. The 9mm pistol NEVER gets used (late game) unless ammo for another gun is a problem.\n\nOverall, a great game. Alot of good things about this game with not too many downsides ( but rly, the maps are really WAY too confusing ) So i can recommend this to someone who enjoys a challenging FPS,Puzzle,Adventure,Action game. I give this a strong 8/10, Great game!\n\n","timestamp_created":1420153893,"timestamp_updated":1420153893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13770490","author":{"steamid":"76561198067951574","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":449,"last_played":1494707524},"language":"spanish","review":"Nada , mas que decir, excelte juego.","timestamp_created":1420152993,"timestamp_updated":1420152993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13770125","author":{"steamid":"76561198004911969","num_games_owned":309,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1572,"last_played":1419203188},"language":"english","review":"This game made me who I am today. \nSeriously. \nIt was the first game that I played through and completed. \nAs a young girl in middle school, Alyx Vance was such a great role model. \nThe struggle of staying true to yourself when you're pressured by your peers is real. \nI know this is just a video game but, really, this game is everything, and I know I'm not the only one who was outstandingly impacted by this. \n\nIf you like strong female role models, scary zombies, and saving the world, play this game.","timestamp_created":1420151845,"timestamp_updated":1420151845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536878228187561035","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13768855","author":{"steamid":"76561198129053332","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":985,"last_played":1629450309},"language":"russian","review":"как сделать игру русской?","timestamp_created":1420148162,"timestamp_updated":1420148162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13767525","author":{"steamid":"76561198133061449","num_games_owned":411,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":523,"last_played":1486160269},"language":"english","review":"Now I understand why this is one of the best games ever made!","timestamp_created":1420144377,"timestamp_updated":1420144377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521143019199371338","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13765915","author":{"steamid":"76561198024117461","num_games_owned":704,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":495,"last_played":1417619319},"language":"english","review":"Has some annoying \"wait for this person to walk all the way over to you to press a button then walk there and press that button\" moments but overall pretty good kill-baddies FPS with enjoyable gunplay, sandboxy physics and decent story","timestamp_created":1420139757,"timestamp_updated":1420139757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13764806","author":{"steamid":"76561198077309207","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":127,"playtime_forever":1279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1220,"last_played":1570404271},"language":"portuguese","review":"Melhor Jogo da década 2000-2010 para Computador!","timestamp_created":1420136639,"timestamp_updated":1420136639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13764802","author":{"steamid":"76561198129159034","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":560,"last_played":1494907926},"language":"english","review":"This game has to be one of the worst games Ive ever played.

My god is the gameplay amazing.\n10/10 for creativity. A nuclear physicist, armed with only a crowbar and gravity gun, deserves high praise.\n9/10 for game types. Multiplayer would have been a nice feature, but Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, and the length of single player definitely makes up for it.\n10/10 for sounds. The sound effects in this game are phenomenal, and the voice acting is spot-on perfect.\n\nOverall, this game is hardly debatable as the greatest game ever made.

minha opinião, o melhor jogo de primeira pessoa que existe. Ótima estória, boa jogabilidade e gráficos lindos para um jogo de 2004. Para quem quer entender a estória do jogo, recomendo jogar  O Half Life 1.

Just as good now as when I played it in 2004.\nIt's not the combat and story alone that make this game amazing. Any AAA company can throw those at you and call it a finished game. Half-Life 2 goes deeper than that. The enemies you face through the entire game only get stronger and think of as many ways necessary to kill you as the story progresses while staying relevant to whats happening at the time.\n\nYou need to experience this game at least once in your lifetime, even episode 1 &2. Please don't let this pass you.","timestamp_created":1419944132,"timestamp_updated":1514110854,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13712310","author":{"steamid":"76561198095980805","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":979,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":949,"last_played":1508965171},"language":"english","review":"Good.","timestamp_created":1419943412,"timestamp_updated":1419943412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13712281","author":{"steamid":"76561198131329981","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":346,"last_played":1513861267},"language":"polish","review":"11/10\nNic dodać, nic ująć.
