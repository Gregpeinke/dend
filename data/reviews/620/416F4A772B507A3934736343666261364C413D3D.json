That’s why success of the first part of the Portal was a surprise even for the VALVE. Therefore seriously question arose about the Portal 2. And what we got? Let's see.\n\n　STILL ALIVE?\n\n　　The game begins with the fact that Chell along with her new partner, personality module Wheatley, is trying to escape from an abandoned Aperture Science laboratory. Throughout the game, the plot makes a interesting twists. Individual deserves compliments perfect finale, after which there remain only a warm feeling. In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.\n\n　ONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER\n\n　　One of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.\n\n　ENDLESS TESTS\n\n　　In game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard). In no case do not miss the community maps.\n\n　Multiplayer:\n　　Online: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ \n　　Co-op: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O\n　Storyline: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O\n　Graphics: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O\n　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺\n\n　\n\n　Complexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned (if you have good friend for the co-op) in the one-two walkthrough.\n\n　　　　VALVE made another good\n　　game.

The puzzles are exciting, and they all feel like they have unique solutions, even though there are a limited number of elements from which the puzzles are built.  It's such a rush to say, \"Oh, I can do *that*!\"\n\nThe game builds on the strengths of the last game, adding a set of tests like in the original, but then you enter the *old* testing grounds, with a host of new elements and ideas.  The single-player mode is about three times as long as the first Portal, with different phases and different enemies along the way.  The co-operative mode is an entire second game that is just as challenging as the single-player, though less varied.  I'm playing it through with my son right now, but I imagine it would be near impossible just using gestures.\n\nThe characters are absolutely brilliant.  GLaDOS, Wheatley, and Cave Johnson provide hilarious banter, with Ellen McLain's GLaDOS standing out because of her incredible character development.  Nothing beats solving puzzles while being taunted by a passive-aggressive, psychopathic robot.\n\nI'm only sorry that the game ended.  It's not very replayable, since you only get the rush of solving the puzzles once (something the game actually alludes to in game), not that that stopped me.

Instead the game teaches you a bit of a life lesson: Perserverance.
