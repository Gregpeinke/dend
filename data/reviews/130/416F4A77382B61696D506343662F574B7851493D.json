The word Randall is derived from Randi, the Hindi slang for Prostitute. The term Pitchford is derived from surname of the patient zero. The disease was the result of the lack of judgement in the part of the obese white man in charge of turning the Valve. Those who are infected by the parasite feel the need to compulsively watch dirty kiddie films and slowly become diagnosed with Pseudologia Fantastica.","timestamp_created":1612684781,"timestamp_updated":1612684802,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468188613653182983","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86109912","author":{"steamid":"76561198874719343","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1612663955},"language":"polish","review":"Bardzo przyjemny dodatek, polecam.","timestamp_created":1612664024,"timestamp_updated":1612664024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86103401","author":{"steamid":"76561198236163526","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":334,"last_played":1646170133},"language":"english","review":"Barnold","timestamp_created":1612654405,"timestamp_updated":1612654405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86095904","author":{"steamid":"76561198857838176","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1634985678},"language":"english","review":"i loved playing as a white police officer, which is my ultimate aspiration in life, to be a white man whos pursued a career in law enforcement","timestamp_created":1612644754,"timestamp_updated":1612644754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86086916","author":{"steamid":"76561198404489058","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":446,"last_played":1639225087},"language":"english","review":"for the love of god don't enable hd models","timestamp_created":1612634635,"timestamp_updated":1612635206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86085344","author":{"steamid":"76561198435268057","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":280,"last_played":1613328723},"language":"russian","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1612632988,"timestamp_updated":1612632988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86078422","author":{"steamid":"76561198866453606","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1612625232},"language":"russian","review":"эту игру придумал гений","timestamp_created":1612625495,"timestamp_updated":1612625495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86046653","author":{"steamid":"76561198205250988","num_games_owned":601,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1612584067},"language":"turkish","review":"   Eğer benim gibi bu oyunu oynamayı planlayıp sürekli erteleyenlerdenseniz hiç kasmayın kendinizi direkt alıp oynayın.
