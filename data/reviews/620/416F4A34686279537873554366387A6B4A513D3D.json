The aerial faith plates and lazers are just old gameplay elements given a new skin, momentum and energy pellets, respectively, and the other, more innovative gameplay elements, the gels, hard light bridge and excursion funnels, are never fully implemented before being tossed aside.\n.The jokes have been reduced to three, constantly repeated categories: blunt insults, irony and shouty reactions. It's not an issue of sensitivity, but when the joke is just \"You're fat\" over and over again, it loses its value. \n.Given a completely unnecessary backstory, from Caroline to every single one of Cave Johnson's messsages. Not only do they ruin the character of GLaDOS by giving her a sappy backstory that no one asked for, but they devalue the credibility and seriousness of Aperture Science through Cave Johnson's inconsistent, outlandish antics. It's no secret that they were just done for a cheap laugh, though.\n\nThe combination of the previous two points means that Portal 2 loses the subtlety of the original. What was once the humorous dark environment of the original game has been reduced to a so quirky exdee floating British accent and cheap insult after cheap insult with no sustenance, what was the eerie writings of an ecapee on the walls warning you about the madness to come should you keep following the voice guiding you has become the ramblings of a complete idiot that would never have had any kind of funding to begin with, and what was once a mysterious robot who you only knew as the thing out for your death became some petty love interest to the same man, creating a back story that no one wanted or asked for. Not only was this unnecessary, but poorly implemented. We're introduced to Caroline so late into the game, and she appears so rarely into the game that we're barely given any chance to grow attatched to her as a charcter. Caroline is only given one setting: slightly ditzy. We don't even hear any growth between Cave and Caroline, we're only given the information that Cave has feelings for her.  It's also just a bad backstory. \nI am by no way suggesting that Portal 1 was some kind of modern gaming masterpiece with excellent storytelling and jokes, but it did what it did beautifully, and Portal 2 threw it all out of the window for a new, more casual audience.","timestamp_created":1398224368,"timestamp_updated":1398475026,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.260770648717880249","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9905847","author":{"steamid":"76561198120856357","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":734,"last_played":1563154550},"language":"english","review":"just spent an hour on it not realizing it was 1130 on a schoo night","timestamp_created":1398224160,"timestamp_updated":1398224160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497287511825561523","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9905786","author":{"steamid":"76561198002866701","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":734,"last_played":1358928000},"language":"brazilian","review":"Não só o melhor jogo de 2011 eleito por vários sites especializados como um dos melhores que já joguei!

Lacks the violent action that some people may be looking for, but the problem-solving and story aspects are absolutely amazing. Character design is quite interesting, with the Personality Constructs (otherwise known as cores) being one of the most expressive robots I've ever seen. \nAs for the storyline, it's arguably best to have played the original Portal, if only to know why you're recognized by the Central Core. Otherwise you can easily figure out what happened previously based on what the AI tells you. \nPortal 2 includes a co-op mode for two players, and is more focused on solving tests than following a story. Quite entertaining to try to complete. Along with that, Workshop integration is also available, allowing players to build tests from scratch.
