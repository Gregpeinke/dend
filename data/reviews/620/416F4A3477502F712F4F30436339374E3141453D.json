It is equally fun playing for 10 minutes and 10 hours (with the innovative community content). This is the only game I'd show someone who has never played a video game and wants to know what all the hype is about. To me it is the perfect encapsulation of the fun that is gaming.  \n\nAnd with Portal 2, it's not just the gameplay. The gameplay is of course amazing with many very innovative additions to Portal 1 (in itself pretty close to a perfect game). But Portal 2 is a more complete game than even its predecessor, and a large part of that is due to how it weaves in the story, the dialogue, with the gameplay so, so well. It's genuinely funny, a true comedy game. There is a sense of narrative progression, but without it getting in the way of the gameplay, the super fun puzzles. And the puzzles themselves are often difficult and require problem-solving and creativity, leaving you feeling very rewarded when you crack them. \n\nWhat more can I say? This game is art, it's a masterpiece. It's video game perfection and a credit to the medium.","timestamp_created":1572076367,"timestamp_updated":1572076367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55795434","author":{"steamid":"76561198120730687","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8810,"last_played":1602464060},"language":"english","review":"I absolutely recommend this game, it's one of my favourite games ever made.","timestamp_created":1572075576,"timestamp_updated":1572075576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55795296","author":{"steamid":"76561198962615052","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4793,"last_played":1655300382},"language":"russian","review":"Velve спасибо вам за portal 2 и portal","timestamp_created":1572075188,"timestamp_updated":1572075188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55795291","author":{"steamid":"76561198383739810","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1577594956},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom","timestamp_created":1572075172,"timestamp_updated":1572075172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55793866","author":{"steamid":"76561198184305727","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":350,"last_played":1654382522},"language":"latam","review":"Los penes son la creacion mas hermosa que el señor nos ha mandado  son tan suavecitos, tan tiernos y sencibles que lloran cuando se emocionan  cuando tienen frio se hacen bolita para que lo abraces , no es muy soft?  los penes son muy lindos se esconden en su cuello cuando se avergüenzan, pero cuando estan felices se levantan y te buscan con la mirada para que le pongas atencion  amo los penes, son mis criatura favorita en este planeta  Mi animal favorito?

Unlike the first one, this game actually develops its universe and lore throughout the campaign. You'll learn more about the world, the characters and the game itself. The story is well told and the writing is cleverly hilarious. \n\nGraphics: Even to this day, I think the game looks fantastic and holds up tremendously well despite being released a while ago. I don't know how they did it, but Valve managed to keep the game as beautiful many modern titles. The game is colorful, the details are great, and the lighting is fantastic.\n\nGameplay: Exactly like the first Portal aside from a few exceptions. First off, there now actual cutscenes and sequences to progress the story. This means you won't always be solving puzzles, which diversifies gameplay and provides a break from the usual formula. Additionally, there are new things for you to use to solve puzzles other than the portal gun which honestly makes the game much more interesting. \n\nSound: The music is great and actually very beautiful. The sound effects are awesome. Everything seems to make realistic noises. But by far the best part of the sound is the voice acting. The great writing for the game is brought to like the stellar voice acting that gives characters life.\n\nVerdict: 9.5\nPortal 2 is a great game! The only thing that bothered me was that it drags on towards the end. I feel like the game could have gone without some of the last segments and Valve should have instead made them additional levels to play after you've beaten the game. But this is literally the only issue I have with the game. I think everything else is perfectly done.","timestamp_created":1572070001,"timestamp_updated":1572120581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55791597","author":{"steamid":"76561198050111892","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1836,"last_played":1561042158},"language":"english","review":"This is my favorite puzzle game.
