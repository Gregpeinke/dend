Among many things today first-person shooters have, story telling is not the one. They are just trying too hard to put action and story together. This game does it all! Exploration and action are one of the biggest attributes in this game that is followed by a great storyline and characters. Sure, it can get repetitive from time to time with thousand of enemy going for you, but it's just... well... fun. Story is really interesting and it always puts you at the edge of your seat.

There is nothing to compare with the marvel that is Bioshock Infinite. Fans of the older Bioshock may be disappointed that rather than the story taking place in the beloved and beautiful world on the bottom of the sea, it takes place in a city just above the clouds. Older fans, do not fear! Bioshock Infinite may not have Rapture or its horror esque ambience, but it is still beautiful in every way that the previous entries were. The cosmetics of the game are brilliant, as with every other game in the series. Bioshock Inifinite seems particularly more beautiful and pleasing to the eye than ever before. While I found myself thrashing about the skylines to outrun ships and enemies, the sound is what really captivated me. The music, the effects; everything about the way the sound is put into the game works perfectly. It feels intense and dramatic, but also strangely realistic. I assume that the most important part of the game, to me, were the characters. The way that the game progresses and displays the characters' growth and progression is quite a charm for me. I can't go into detail without spoiling the story, but the characters are absolutely impressive, love or hate them. Of course, this goes without saying, the Bioshock series is well known for their intricate plotlines and extensive story. While I believe that it's best you experience the story for yourself, I can summarize the basic idea behind the beginning. From the start, you play as Booker DeWitt, a New Yorker in 1912, and are sent out on a mission to find 'the girl' in order to repay your debt. You head where you are told to and later find yourself above the clouds in the city of Columbia. As far as the story goes, once again, you should definitely play it for yourself; this summary is just the beginning of a large chain of events. The last topic to cover, of course, are the game mechanics. If you have played a Bioshock game before, you will find that it is a bit different from what you are used to, but it still plays somewhat the same. You are limited to two guns this time around, however ammunition is quite easy to find, and you may take the weapons from your enemies' dead corpses as you fancy. Plasmids have been replaced with Vigors, but they work in the same way. Basically, Vigors are bottles of immense power that go into your body and are released through your hand, like shooting fire balls! In the original Bioshock entries, Adam was your source of getting Plasmids, but in Infinite you find them as you go along and replenish it with Salts. The revamp is a bit basic, but it gets the job done. Vita Chambers are completely gone; you revive in an area closeby where you died with half of your health, but you lose a bit of money and your enemies have healed a bit too. You have a shield that replenishes and a health bar that works like any other health bar. There are no longer any healing items that you keep on your person; they must all be found nearby on the ground or you can eat a pineapple that some blokes carry around when they're shooting lead into your brain. All in all, the combat system may have been simplified, but the game's beautiful scenery and brilliantly planned out story really makes the cake for Bioshock Infinite. That's some good cake.","timestamp_created":1390323877,"timestamp_updated":1390323877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55658954381942749","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8797892","author":{"steamid":"76561198019137035","num_games_owned":270,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1110,"last_played":1516774631},"language":"english","review":"I hate to say it but I am really, really disapointed...

(Warning Spoilers)\n\nI felt that the entire gameplay was just a boring hallway shooter (I did like the new powerups the game had to offer like the Undertow for example but the lack of special ammunition made me angry because Bioshock was very well known for that feature so I don't understand what Ken Levine was thinking when he made that decision & I also miss the research mechanic from the original Bioshock games) the entire time and I hate to say that because from my experience with both Bioshock & Bioshock 2 it was such a thrilling experience to fight Big Daddies, Splicers & the Big Sisters but in this game they gave probably the most uninteresting \"Big Hitters\" I have ever fought against. I hate the Handyman because to me he is uninteresting version of the Big Daddy (He's easy to fight too, since you have to shoot his heart), The Ghost you fight later on in the game is a fucking repetitive bitch since you have to fight it 4 times (The ghost was ok the 1st time but 3 more times with the same style?! Fuck That) but I did enjoy fighting the raven guys, The vigor a.k.a plasmid goons & the robots that represent US presidents like Lincoln for example. (All the other enemies were ok but not interesting but I'm very disappointed that I never get to fight Songbird which in my opinion is the best enemy in the entire game, I also felt that the difficulty was too easy since I played the entire game on Hard mode but I think 1999 mode is the best difficulty to play on)\n\nI think the game's upside is the story, music, characters & voice acting because to me it was very near to perfection but I had to pull myself through the bland gameplay (I forgot to mention that the weapon upgrades suck but the gear you collect for your clothes changes the way you fight so I guess that's a positive) just to experience my relationship with Elizabeth who lockpicks, opens dimensions, runs around in noisy shoes (I hate her shoes) & supplies me with helpful crap (She is only helpful 50% of the time, I'm saying that because she is very slow at finding things & when she does find things she alerts me at the wrong time sometimes but overall she's an ok ally) but I wish she could use a gun because handing me supplies is not enough help for me (I understand Elizabeth's fear of killing people but I was only suggesting the gun part so you can just ignore what I said about it) but anyways the music was a delight for me to listen because some of the tracks were very suspenseful at times like the ending for example & the voice acting was perfect (I forgot to mention that the ending is very confusing but I like endings that make me think & I have an issue with checkpoint saves as the main save system because if I miss a voxophone for example then I'm forced to restart the entire game again).\n\nOverall I think Bioshock Infinite is average (I have mixed opinions on the game & I have more subjects to say about the game but I'll just end it here) & if the gameplay was worked on more then I might enjoy it just like the older Bioshock games but everything else is fine to me (The exploration is good too but I'm not going to mention much about it since I already know how good it is).\n\nBurial At Sea Review:\n\nI loved this DLC 100% because it gave me a reminder of the original Bioshock (It's basically an improved version of the original game that I loved) & the ending was confusing too which left me to think but I'm sad that it was short because that's the gameplay I wanted in Infinite because to me it wasn't boring. (The story is about finding a little girl)\n\nIn the 2nd episode of Burial At Sea you play as Elizabeth who tries to find the same little girl from episode 1 but she's limited on ammo so she has to sneak her way through Rapture to find this girl & Atlas a.k.a Fontaine (If you paid attention from the original Bioshock then you'll understand Atlus better) tries to stop you (He torments you later on), so you get to fight Andrew Ryan again sorta (Very hard to explain) & after that I can't really explain the rest of the story because as usual I'm terrible at understanding Bioshock Infinite's story. The 1998 difficulty is an interesting mode to play on because you have to play the entire game without having vigors but it also has the difficulty of 1999 mode combined with it so prepare to die a lot in it.\n\nClash Of The Clouds Review:\n\nIt's basically hoard mode except in this one you use your earnings to buy never before seen art & videos (I can't explain this mode very much).\n\nUPDATE: Had to edit my review because the videos were no longer available","timestamp_created":1390257554,"timestamp_updated":1496599420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549157023429870605","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8789664","author":{"steamid":"76561198033109716","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5093,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2453,"last_played":1630006965},"language":"english","review":"A game that you don't want to end. Bioshock Infinite has an immersive world that you never want to finish. The combat system in the game is great, though it is kind of annoying that you must click once to ready, then click again to actually fire if it is on one of the weapons, (like if you are using a Vigor, then you want to use a gun, you must first hit the button to ready the gun then hit it again to fire). Being only able to carry two weapons is kind of a disappointment, but more realistic then the other Bioshock games. This game definitely has the best graphics of the series, and it is just a beautiful game. I run three monitors and it makes the game even more immense. It isn't the most straining of games on your graphics card, unless you are running three monitors. Elizabeth provides an excellent companion, helping you through the game providing you with ammo, money, salts, and health packs. The battles in the game are rather difficult, so it is even more helpful for her to assist you.

Infinite got it right. A good sequel uses the original as a jumping off point to an entirely unique experience.\n\nYou start out as this dude named Booker, and you go to the cloud city of Columbia. You get some plasmids, sorry, I meant vigors, and you have to rescue some gild who follows you around for the rest of the game.\n\nNow about this girl. From a gameplay perspective, it's amazing to play a game where you don't want to bash the face in of whatever NPC you are escorting. Normaly, excort quests are rubbish. However this game is a joyful exception to that rule. The girl never gets in your way, and she doesn't get herself killed in combat. In fact, she's incredibly helpful in combat because she will sometimes \"find\" health and ammo if you are running low.\n\nAnother bit of gameplay that was added that I find awesome is the sky-rails. You know in Bioshock how there was never a single bit of actual underwater gameplay, in a city that is entirely underwater? Yeah, they fix that here. the skyrails are awesome.\n\nAlso the plot is great and these developers seem to have mastered the video game plot reveal. The last 30 minutes of the game is pure brilliance.\n\nThis is easily the best game I played in 2013. I've been sitting here for at least 10 minutes trying to think of any complaints I might have, so this review is a little more balanced, and I'm have a very hard time remembering any.","timestamp_created":1390177869,"timestamp_updated":1390177907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8776943","author":{"steamid":"76561198122526810","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1487496656},"language":"english","review":"This game is so revolutionary for me i just absoulty loved the Characters, they have great personality structure and the story plot was well planned out i definitely recommend this Game for people who love Rpg games","timestamp_created":1390177229,"timestamp_updated":1390177229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8776933","author":{"steamid":"76561197980916777","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":765,"last_played":1396069547},"language":"english","review":"Final Thoughts, LOVE , LOVE , Ti voglio baciare (I want to kiss it/you.)

It coasted to the crown of Best PC Game of 2013 and will be the precedent for many a game to come. The blend of the combat mechanic with weapons and vigors along with the breathtaking scenery and storyline makes it the most enjoyable game hour for hour that I have ever played (and that comes from investing 100+ hours in Skyrim). After 12ish hours of gameplay, the completion of the story and the plot twist revealed, (c'mon, we all knew there'd be one) I was immensely satisfied with a profound appreciation for not just the gameplay, setting or story, but most of all: the characters. All I can say is that if you haven't yet, buy it.","timestamp_created":1390176417,"timestamp_updated":1390176417,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8776610","author":{"steamid":"76561198050272786","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":782,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":739,"last_played":1393188655},"language":"english","review":"My favorite game\n\nReally fun\n\nDLC is great too\n\n10/10 would play","timestamp_created":1390175172,"timestamp_updated":1390175172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8776536","author":{"steamid":"76561198096128507","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1072,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1016,"last_played":1412482398},"language":"english","review":"Simply put, this game is the shit.","timestamp_created":1390174800,"timestamp_updated":1390174800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8776324","author":{"steamid":"76561198022542543","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":823,"last_played":1394936931},"language":"german","review":"Dieses Spiel ist ein absolutes muss!\nDie Story ist mehr als top aber das ist nicht alles, die Grafik des Spiels ist ausgezeichnet und es mangelt definitiv nicht an den Details.
