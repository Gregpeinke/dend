Даже больше скажу, это была первая игра в серии, с которой мне довелось познакомиться. Тогда, под впечатлением от прохождения Infinite, первые 2 части мне совершенно не зашли, а совсем недавно история снова повторилась, после прохождения первой игры и попыток борьбы с багами второй, мне уже не понравилась Infinite, от чего было решено немного подождать. Время действительно сыграло свою роль, но об этом в итогах.\n\nСюжетно Infinite просто фантастический, после завершения игры ты остаешься в экстазе на долгое время, а чтобы уловить все микромоменты ЛОРа и повествования, нужно находить всяческие необязательные материалы. Почему такой акцент на этом? Да потому что это не обычный скучный текст, а аудиодневники, небольшие и красиво оформленные видеоролики, диалоги различных болванчиков, это прибавляет интереса в исследовании мира, потому что мне надоедает читать миллионы записок даже в простых коридорных играх.\n\nГрафически игра не была выдающейся даже на момент выхода, но стиль решает все. Он максимально карикатурный, несколько мультипликационный и даже не пытается играть на реализме, при этом никак не влияет на восприятие и не чувствуется детским. Придерусь разве только к некоторым совсем уж мыльным текстурам, с которыми порой приходится взаимодействовать на очень близком расстоянии.\n\nГеймлей тут просто отвратителен. Вот так сразу. Шутер из BioShock Infinite как из LADA Racing Club гонки, вроде бы и основной жанр, но все выполнено из рук вон плохо. В выстрелах не чувствуется \"сока\", даже звуки стрельбы какие-то плоские, будто разработчики хотели почтить традицию первых двух частей, хотя там шутерная механика ещё хуже. Передвигаться неприятно, персонаж чувствуется очень медленным, камеру резко трясет, некоторые элементы взаимодействия вынуждают тебя заниматься пиксель хантингом.\n\nЭто пожалуй все, что мне хотелось бы указать. Остальные элементы выполнены просто нормально, как и должны в любой современной (относительно) игре. В итоге я могу сказать, что игра мне очень понравилась ещё много лет назад, а сейчас закрепила мнение и доказала, что выдержала проверку временем. Также Infinite существует как вполне самостоятельное произведение, не требующее знания сюжета первых двух частей, чего не скажешь о DLC. Но! Хотя у меня и не было никакой ностальгии в отношении оригинальной дилогии, все же атмосферно она мне понравилась больше и Infinite после неё чувствуется несколько несерьезно. В любом случае, если вы ещё не притрагивались к BioShock в принципе, сыграйте сначала в Infinite, повременив, завершите оба сюжетные DLC, а только потом приступайте к первым двум играм серии, так сюжет будет восприниматься более цельно и серьезно.","timestamp_created":1561865125,"timestamp_updated":1561865125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.644393980503082275","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52288611","author":{"steamid":"76561198314817436","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":563,"last_played":1561701070},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情是真的好，枪械手感一般","timestamp_created":1561865075,"timestamp_updated":1561865075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52286514","author":{"steamid":"76561198004227619","num_games_owned":318,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":991,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":991,"last_played":1561624112},"language":"english","review":"The Burial at Sea DLC's were worth the time to play","timestamp_created":1561864476,"timestamp_updated":1561864476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52285305","author":{"steamid":"76561198273021739","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":301,"last_played":1559821986},"language":"english","review":"Fun game but a bit confusing at times, you are unsure to go at parts, but it is a really fun game tho.","timestamp_created":1561864141,"timestamp_updated":1561864141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524200558662414551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52283095","author":{"steamid":"76561198452803567","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":945,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":656,"last_played":1599745036},"language":"schinese","review":"这游戏是真的好 不过流程偏短","timestamp_created":1561863514,"timestamp_updated":1561863514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52282295","author":{"steamid":"76561198080310738","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":547,"last_played":1612336283},"language":"schinese","review":"想再玩一次才发现没有中文了。","timestamp_created":1561863304,"timestamp_updated":1588672867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52281446","author":{"steamid":"76561198345931233","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1187,"last_played":1560202045},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is a game, it's not hyper memorable but it's fun, the story is pretty neat and weapons are ok, however you can only carry 2 at a time, and plasminds are basically useless, you could win the game without ever using them.

You're then sent to a lighthouse and blasted up to a floating city called Concordia a 1950s like city with a steampunk aesthetic. As you explore the city you discover that something isn't quite right. \n\nI don't want to say too much I don't want to spoil the game to anybody who hasn't played it  But trust me as I say that it is a game with very interesting environments that tell a story and develop further as you play through. \n\nThe gunplay is satisfying and fun you get a good amount of weapons throughout your playthrough and you also get some really cool abilities as you play through the game with different types of perks and elements to use on enemies. There are also parkouring elements where you can glide on sky rails with a device called a skyhook used to progress through the game And launch above enemies for surprise attacks for fast paste fights.\n\nThere are also three additional DLC to this game 2 chapters of a continued story called Burial at Sea which I would highly recommend getting and a survival mode which isn't my favourite but if you enjoy the combat and you want a survival like mode then sure pick that up I guess. \n\nKeep a eye on this game on your radar especially if there's a deal on it I would recommend picking it up. \n \n","timestamp_created":1561848884,"timestamp_updated":1561848884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52225270","author":{"steamid":"76561198103753073","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":949,"last_played":1630467158},"language":"english","review":"Just got to play it and then play it again and again and ....","timestamp_created":1561848679,"timestamp_updated":1561848679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52224692","author":{"steamid":"76561198149912960","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":628,"last_played":1503853049},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy Buen juego.

You are only allowed to hold two guns at once which is irritating because at any point when you might want to try a new weapon you have to decide if you want it enough to put the one you're currently holding down. You can run out of ammo and be forced to switch to a new gun but that doesn't really feel very good. The gun upgrade system is much less interesting in this game than it was in the previous Bioshock games. Previously you would get a single free upgrade from gun upgrade stations and more often than not the upgrade would do something special, like add an effect to your bullets. This system made you think about what you wanted and then rewarded you for going with it both by changing your gameplay but also by changing how your gun looks, which was very cool. In Infinite you only get number edit changes like more damage, more ammo capacity, better reload speed etc. These upgrades are necessary because of how the difficulty increases but they don't feel especially cool.\nThe plasmids, known as Vigors, in this game are actually quite fun and were designed to synergize with each other so I found myself trying to use the vigors as a primary attack strategy and only using guns when necessary. In the previous games plasmids were upgraded with a special currency but in this game the only currency is dollars and you use it on everything. That means I usually avoided upgrading my guns so that I could save money for vigors because those upgrades actually did change gameplay instead of just being number edits. It also means that my guns were even less interesting than they already were.\n\nThis game has achievements based on beating the hardest difficulty, however you can only unlock it after beating the game once anyway so I would recommend just trying to enjoy it the first time through. Playing it on hard is just an exercise in frustration because the only effect it has is to make your attacks less effective while giving the enemies more health and making them deal more damage. There are some tough enemies that are best defeated in certain ways and you'll have more than enough of a challenge from them on easier difficulties.\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game. It's fun despite the design choices that differ from previous titles and the story offers a lot to think about. I just barely finished playing it from the start for what is probably my third time since it launched and I'm looking forward to playing the DLC again because from what I recall it really improved upon a lot of things in the base game.","timestamp_created":1561840956,"timestamp_updated":1561840956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52179848","author":{"steamid":"76561198869919150","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":444,"last_played":1633270764},"language":"turkish","review":"ÇOK KALİTELİ VE HİKAYESİNİ ANLARSANIZ MUHTŞME BİR SANAT ESERİ FAKAT BENİM BEYNİM OLMADIĞI İÇİN OYUNU FAZLA OYNAYAMADIM BEYNİNİZ VARSA ALIN OYNAYIN NEYSE BEN YENNEFERE GİDİYOM","timestamp_created":1561840771,"timestamp_updated":1561840771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52178165","author":{"steamid":"76561198137304738","num_games_owned":378,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":949,"last_played":1582686775},"language":"english","review":"Great game","timestamp_created":1561840498,"timestamp_updated":1561840498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52176447","author":{"steamid":"76561198202434026","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":898,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":890,"last_played":1582626803},"language":"russian","review":"годная игруха, особенно если с рус локализацией","timestamp_created":1561840236,"timestamp_updated":1561840236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472867757081985474","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52174171","author":{"steamid":"76561198271574446","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":2456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2242,"last_played":1561920318},"language":"english","review":"Great game and I just recently played through it again and I say it really holds up.
