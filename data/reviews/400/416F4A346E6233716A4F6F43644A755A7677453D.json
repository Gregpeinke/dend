Some are amazing but unheard of by most, games of infamously bad quality, games that merely exist, and so on. Some games however are trailblazers. The kind of game that when it releases leave people talking about it, lingering in the minds of the general public. Portal was once such game. I always heard about it and how great it was and still is, but until recently I never gave it the time of day. Now after finishing the main quest, I wanted to write my review and give my mostly glowing admiration of the game.\n\nThe story begins with you, Chell waking up from a hibernated sleep being asked by an AI and told you will be a test experiment in solving puzzles and working your way through \"test chambers\", areas designed to test the intelligence of the subjects and their new device, The Portal Gun. From there, you solve these puzzles all in the promise of some sweet, sweet cake at the end. While the story is pretty simple overall, it does have its moments and writing is so good (especially in the last hour of the game) that I'm okay with the simplicity of it.\n\nWhat the real meat of the game though are its \"Test Chambers\", and this is where the game shines brightly. IT starts out simple enough. You open a portal to reach a spot you can't get to, open a portal to move an object somewhere else, etc. What really astounds me is that despite the simple premise, it really takes advantage of both the concept of using two portals and the momentum and physics used in Half-Life 2 to create an experience that teaches you new things as you go, right up until the end of the game. None of puzzles are tough enough to leave you stuck there for a long time but they're no so simple you can breeze through them. MY only real gripe with them is that puzzles the focus on momentum tend to be a bit wonky. The most notable example for me was after Chamber 19, where you had to use momentum to reach a higher platform. the problem was that you have a tendency to miss your portal if you just look in another direction which made it way harder than it needed to. That and it can cause motion sickness in those susceptible to it like myself.\n\nWhile I think the game's writing is high-quality and the gameplay is very well done, unfortunately I can't say the same for its presentation. My issue with the graphics aren't really about the image quality or the models, or anything like that. My problem is the choice of aesthetic and color palette. While I understand they wanted to go for a clean, sanitized environment that contrasted with the rust of the real facility, it doesn't exactly lend itself well to environments that captivate or interest me. It makes sense why they're that way, but I don't enjoy it very much overall. The music is fine, mostly doing what HL 2 did and only appearing in specific sections to heighten tension and suspense during key moments, which works effectively.\n\nSomething I think also works effectively is its length. The main game can be beaten in about 4-5 hours on a first playthrough. While it is pretty short and replayability is limited by virtue of it being a puzzle game, it does have extra levels you unlock by playing it and bonus challenges to complete for extra side content and achievements if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nIn summary, Portal is the kind of game that earned the adoration and praise it received all those years ago. A story that starts simple and gates more complex as it goes on, an environment that makes you feel alone and worthless, strong and entertaining writing, and gameplay that takes a simple concept and uses it in a lot of different ways. I'm not sure if it'll earn a spot in my favorite games of all time list, but I can absolutely see why it would in the eyes and hearts of others. I may have been late to the Portal Party, but I'm still glad I came and got to eat some cake. \n\nIt's an easy recommendation to people who like puzzle games, games that are short in length, or just a game that can entertain you with dialogue.","timestamp_created":1555873753,"timestamp_updated":1555873753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589459776878356934","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50255519","author":{"steamid":"76561198276125412","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":58,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":58,"last_played":1549962269},"language":"russian","review":"Ну это определённо ШЕДЕВР!","timestamp_created":1555870950,"timestamp_updated":1555870950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50254783","author":{"steamid":"76561198335416359","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1658972468},"language":"english","review":"I would recommend this to others so that they too can enjoy the puzzly wonders that is Portal.","timestamp_created":1555868223,"timestamp_updated":1629822138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489998310804367065","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50254632","author":{"steamid":"76561198840882248","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":966,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29,"last_played":1587048136},"language":"russian","review":"Норм но без онлайна","timestamp_created":1555867697,"timestamp_updated":1555867697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50252447","author":{"steamid":"76561198926143836","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1589925126},"language":"french","review":"oui","timestamp_created":1555859013,"timestamp_updated":1555859013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50250611","author":{"steamid":"76561198130739837","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1520,"last_played":1553089929},"language":"english","review":"a must have game for steam\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1555851872,"timestamp_updated":1555851872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50249829","author":{"steamid":"76561198415405068","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1543145372},"language":"german","review":"Kultspiel,muss man einfach erlebt haben","timestamp_created":1555848603,"timestamp_updated":1555848603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50249014","author":{"steamid":"76561198313884738","num_games_owned":396,"num_reviews":118,"playtime_forever":473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":422,"last_played":1559928507},"language":"russian","review":"Одна из лучших игр от Вольво (включая вторую часть)\nПлюсы:\n-хорошая физика на движке Source\n-приятная графика\n-интересные уровни и сюжет\nМинусы:\n-ОЧЕНЬ короткая игра, прошел за 2 часа\n\nP.S.\nTHE CAKE IS A LIE!","timestamp_created":1555844810,"timestamp_updated":1555844908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.634868741035461426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50245559","author":{"steamid":"76561198202418965","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1590,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":329,"last_played":1585543606},"language":"english","review":"I have to admit, was intimidated by the prospect of 3D spatial puzzles - I wasn't sure I would be able to solve them and thought they would require hours upon hours of thought.
