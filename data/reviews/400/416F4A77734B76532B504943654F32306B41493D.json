Has a tone completely uniquely dystopian, as while it technically has sign of being dystopian, the lack of human interaction accompanied by the robotic voice of GLaDOS creates this beautiful unnerving feeling that never gets bad enough to be scary. The game does a great job teaching you what you need to know then having you apply your newfound knowledge. Once you have mastered what it can provide, the game ends. It doesn't try to stretch out its playtime because to do so would harm more than help.\n\nRealistically, if you are reading this, you generally know about Portal. It's a 3d puzzle game that provides an interesring mechanic you have to reshape your thinking around. It is, in a sense, groundbreaking for its thought to put the player within the puzzle as a moving component rather than an outside observer.\n\nIf you want to get into gaming, just play this, there is very little to dislike, if anything.","timestamp_created":1593261609,"timestamp_updated":1593261609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511806607246398926","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71485748","author":{"steamid":"76561198445841885","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1593290380},"language":"russian","review":"Денис не смог понять что делать)","timestamp_created":1593261585,"timestamp_updated":1593261585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487983584403991699","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71484083","author":{"steamid":"76561199001199007","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1608012344},"language":"english","review":"This was a truly unique experience, wonderfully enjoyable.

Being dropped in a futuristic lab setting, you're forced to go through some tests. Throughout your journey, you're accompanied by an AI's voice, which can be really entertaining and funny. It starts off quite friendly and welcoming, but the more you advance in this world, and the more you explore, you find out about other test subjects' stories and realize you might be in trouble.\n\nEach puzzle, or \"test chamber\", is unique and forces you to think, plan and execute with precision. The first few chambers act as tutorial levels, slowly introducing the game's mechanics, and increasing the complexity & difficulty at a reasonable rate. You traverse the world by walking, jumping and moving through walls and floors using portals created by a special weapon. This weapon can shoot at specific surfaces (usually in plain white), opening up to two portals at a time. Having the portals bound to MB1 & MB2 and each having a different color, is a very wise design choice. The player doesn't have to read or memorize anything, and can focus solely on aiming and timing his portals, which in turn, opens the game up to some high paced action. Generally, I've found the main playthrough challenging, but not too hard. Hardcore players would enjoy the \"advanced\" bonus content - that's where the game gets really tough and punishing.\n\nThe game's graphics and models have aged pretty well, for the most part, except for some ugly toxic water and metallic pipes. The colors are bright and relaxing, but get dark and claustrophobic as you progress.\n\nAll in all, the game is very enjoyable, even in 2020.
