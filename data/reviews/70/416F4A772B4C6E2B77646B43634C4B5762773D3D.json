Вступительный ролик, на мой взгляд, несколько затянут, но все же смотрится классно. Правда, если вы смотрите его один раз. Во второй — не советую, надоедает. Сделан он на движке игры, но новость не это — подобное вы могли уже видеть в SiN`е. Новость в том, что построено вступление так, что постепенно вы проникаетесь всей важностью своей миссии, вживаетесь в роль, как говорится. Окружающие пейзажи всячески этому способствуют, поражая масштабами и качеством исполнения. К тому же это не совсем ролик. Он интерактивен. В совсем небольшой степени — но интерактивен. Вы можете не просто смотреть, но и передвигаться в пределах вагончика, на котором вашу персону доставляют в самое сердце эксперимента. Вы можете подойти к окну и получше рассмотреть окружающее. Тем более, что рассмотреть есть что: вот робот поковылял в самую гущу отвратительной зеленой жидкости, вот поезд проехал — повез свежий запас топлива для реактора — и так далее... Красиво!\n\nИнтеллект. Это — то, что в первую очередь интересует меня при знакомстве с кем-либо. Компьютерные противники — не исключение. От уровня их умственных способностей зависит то, интересно будет играть, или нет. Здесь — довольно интересно. Довольно — значит то, что вариант совсем не идеальный, но и не самый плохой. С первого взгляда противник может показаться очень умным. Но только с первого взгляда. Потом начинаешь замечать, что все-таки имеет место система так называемых логических триггеров. То есть каждое действие вашего оппонента разработчики попытались предсказать и запрограммировать. Так вот, если вы сделаете что-то очень уж нестандартное — будьте уверены, противник практически впадет в кому. То есть он не сообразит, что ему делать. Прятаться? Бежать? В итоге бедняга будет просто метаться на месте и беспорядочно стрелять. И это — совсем не большой недостаток, поверьте.

[/b]\n\nThis game is still awesome and fun to play even to this day, although it does show its age especially with the graphics and sound quality, Half-Life still stays one of the best FPS games on the PC. Released way back in November 1998, Half-Life was developed by Valve and originally published by Sierra Studios but now is self-published by Valve themselves\n\nHalf-Life offers solid controls with an interestingly told story and some interesting settings. The game is difficult and you will die a lot but with a little patience you will get through its 10 or so hour campaign. Half-Life offers some good level design with a modding community which is still alive to this very day! And the game runs smoothly and runs fine on modern-day systems\n\nAnd who of course forget the famous crowbar!\n\nSadly, the graphics have aged, if you don't like old graphics but want to play Half-Life for its interesting story and characters, fortunately Black Mesa exists which updates the game's graphics and sound but still I'd recommend playing this as well as Black Mesa\n\nHalf-Life is an instant classic and a must buy for every PC owner!\n \n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]\n[i] THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!

There are a ton of bugs with the game itself and the game often places you in situations where you will ultimately die unless you have a great save file. The enimes, especially the soilders, have way too much health and can kill you almost instantly (they always have gernades and have spot on accurecy with them and secondary fire for automatic rifles) and will harm you if you are not prepared (i.e. you fall down, as part of the game's plot and will lose 30hp, and all of your amour). \n\nOverall the game is great plot wise, probably not great to play and makes you frustrated at times if you did not save often. Probably best for nostalgic reasons for those who have played the game before, but this honestly is my first time playing the game so beating the game is a great feeling.\n\nThe next is a few items to keep in mind, if you want an idea ( I will not put any spoillers so don't worry)\n\nI have listed a few good items to deffinitely use (below) but the only contradiction to their usefulness for most siutations is unideal since the ammunition for them is low but there is a ton of ammo for the one's you would use less often:\n-The automatic rifle (great for anything that has low health and you need just of of the way)\n-The revolver (for some reason very OP, takes only two shots to kill most things but ammo is very scarce)\n-gluon gun (though the ammo goes away really quick, its great for the alien soilders and smaller creatures, ammo scarce)\n-Crossbow (accuracey is horrible, but good for a quick death)\n-pistol  (fantastic for getting rid of some small creatures)","timestamp_created":1484021702,"timestamp_updated":1484021702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29153370","author":{"steamid":"76561198255326810","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1160,"last_played":1504850799},"language":"english","review":"Valve is the Konami of PC gaming","timestamp_created":1484012058,"timestamp_updated":1503701580,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.46657484769821167","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29152558","author":{"steamid":"76561198012039920","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113,"last_played":1507910510},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever!!!","timestamp_created":1484008227,"timestamp_updated":1484008227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29151548","author":{"steamid":"76561198190672983","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1618026555},"language":"english","review":"Good MLG game\n","timestamp_created":1484003956,"timestamp_updated":1484003956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497166335582733154","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29148993","author":{"steamid":"76561198346153267","num_games_owned":381,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":17537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":55,"last_played":1621499621},"language":"turkish","review":"Half-Life CD almıştım baktım Steam var, CD kaybolur diye birde Steam'dan aldım.
