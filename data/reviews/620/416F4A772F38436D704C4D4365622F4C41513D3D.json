The visuals are stunning and offer a wonderful sense of time, with the original 19 chambers completely overgrown and partially destroyed. With a glimpse into the beginning of Aperture the visuals deliver again, showing just how old the place really is, and how massive.\n\nAside from the vast storyline, the writing is extremely humorous. Characters such as Wheatley and Cave Johnson steal the show with their witty dialogue, while GLaDOS offers the same dry humor she did in the first game, only now with more well-written insults and a surprising backstory.\n\nThe Cooperative Testing Initiative gives you a whole new storyline with a two-person style of gameplay.
