I love science fiction and they were always so well recieved. Finally I decided to buy BioShock Infinite. I expected to like the game. Mabey I would even love it, but little did I know that it would not only become my favorite game, but cause me to view video games in a different way entirely. The gameplay in Infinite is smoothe and is a great example of a AAA first person shooter, but it is not the hook. The story is the hook. Infinite's story is not only the best video game story I have ever experienced, but the best story told in any form of media. It makes you think, something that is rare in video games today. It is impossible for me to reccommend this game to anyone who believes that they have the brain power to understand the complex story.

In my mind, there was no way the faceless protagonist, damsel in distress and one-dimensional enemy could resolve in an unexpected ending, yet somehow it did. I am indelibly impacted by the story of this man who seeks to wash his sin, yet finds redemption in the least expected of places.\n\nAll those who played Bioshock Infinite will know of the gripping relationship Elizabeth and Booker develop over the course of events of the game. Sure, we had to endure enemies by the bucketload, followed by a health system that reminds me of old-style shooter games with *no* health regeneration (I'm still undecided on whether this is a good thing). Sure, there weren't nearly enough \"boss\" fights to punctuate the campaign's progress. Sure, there was a general looseness of combat in the first place. Yet, the universe Irrational Games has created strung me on all the way through the night to its epic conclusion at 3am, and I am glad to have seen it through to the end.\n\nNo PC game story has ever told me a story of this depth. This sets the stage for games to begin telling more narrative than the run-of-the-mill, \"Kill the other team, they're the enemy\" games; this says storytelling is alive and breathtakingly beautiful in the PC game. May game studios tell stories for generations to come.\n\nPROS:\nAmazing storyline\nBreathtaking universe\nGood variety of abilities, enemies, art styles\nImpeccable voice acting and scripting\n\nCONS:\nLack of boss fights\nLoose combat controls\nKinetescopes were far too cryptic\n\nMy score - 9/10","timestamp_created":1394824454,"timestamp_updated":1394824454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9469001","author":{"steamid":"76561198119885512","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":213,"last_played":1427393078},"language":"english","review":"AMAZING GAME !!

Bioshock Infinite is a first person shooter with RPG like elements that involve money, powering up your skills/weapons, as well as interacting with people in the world.  For the most part, you are free to explore everything as you traverse the game and can go back as needed to open locks and such that you may have missed or did not have enough lockpicks for at the time of discovery.  \nThe first person genre in my opinion generally gets less than stellar story lines and focuses soley on killing and run and gun.  This game strays from that path a bit and rewards you for taking shots when needed as well as not stealing.  Your powers you gain from playing the game alter how you handle certain situations and make every gun worth using in almost every situation given you have enough salt left to use your vigor powers.  For instance, using the pistol with the crow power works incredibly well since the enemies are distracted due to being eaten alive by crows.  There are many other examples but for the sake of not spoiling anything I will leave it there.\nI found the girl involved in the story to be someone I wanted to take care of despite her knowing how to handle herself in bad situations.  Usually, I can care less about NPCs as they just annoy me but this game for some reason changed that and I haven't had that feeling in a long time.  The events that transpire are sometimes over the top crazy and make the game even more worthwhile playing.  \nFor a FPS to reach out to me and make me want to finish this game is completely amazing.  Most FPS genre games have a crap story and are really based around the multiplayer aspect.  When you remove multiplayer completely and focus on a story and the things that you can do in the said game, you can easily see how everything comes out for the better.  If you are expecting call of duty or battlefield style play you can look elseware but if you are looking for a Fallout style gameplay with the RPG elements then this game is for you.","timestamp_created":1394779391,"timestamp_updated":1394779391,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9463860","author":{"steamid":"76561198057970766","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2951,"last_played":1483907528},"language":"english","review":"Why is this game so perfect? *_*\nIt was definitely love at first sight <3","timestamp_created":1394778786,"timestamp_updated":1511770169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.621853351593017578","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9463691","author":{"steamid":"76561198065499765","num_games_owned":527,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":447,"last_played":1427295007},"language":"russian","review":"Потрясающая игра.

Sure it has a fantastic art style,voice acting, and music and all, but the gameplay kills what could have been a stellar Game. The story was not bad, up untill it goes into the interdemensional themes of it and pretty much just made groan at the idea of this. The characters felt just there, with the exception that is elizabeth. The gameplay is a step down from the first bioshock such as the ability to carry only 2 weapons,no hacking, and no alt ammo types which made the original game unique and interesting. There is a sky hook which lets you ride on rails, but It felt really gimmicky to me personally. Now ignoring the fact the game strips of what was redeemable about the previous games, is it even enjoyable on it's own? no for several reason.  The biggest problem is that the guns lack any weight or impact making the combat incredibly teadious and stale after awhile, even the vigors can't save the dull combat. The game is also Rather Easy, you can't even die in this game, granted this was a problem in the first game but it would have been better if gave you some sort of penalty other than losing cash in the game. Now i've been pretty rough on the game, but it's not bad, however it's not good ethier. What matters in a fps is the core gameplay not the story which As I said I didn't care for. But if your FPS doesn't do a good job of it's core game mechanics, there is something wrong. There are things to like in here like the art direction, elizabeth,music etc. Overall it's really just an average game, with both good and bad aspects to it. Would I reccomend it? maybe if you are wanting to play it for the gameplay(like anyone who plays first person shooters) i'd say get it for cheap, and if you really want to see how good it's story is, then yeah I would. I Wasn't impressed with the game and it left me in dissapointment.\n\n6/10 It has some top notch production values, but it's gameplay needed a lot of work put into it.","timestamp_created":1394756290,"timestamp_updated":1394756290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494648635387420654","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9461778","author":{"steamid":"76561198053307492","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":731,"last_played":1424133210},"language":"english","review":"This is the best shooting game I've ever played.","timestamp_created":1394755221,"timestamp_updated":1394755221,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9461279","author":{"steamid":"76561198074705005","num_games_owned":323,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":474,"last_played":1394913994},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра.Просто.Офигенная.","timestamp_created":1394751085,"timestamp_updated":1394751085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489934444427490234","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9461273","author":{"steamid":"76561198119483952","num_games_owned":436,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":2246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":549,"last_played":1489101086},"language":"english","review":"was a great choice buying this game i love it","timestamp_created":1394751052,"timestamp_updated":1394751052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9461223","author":{"steamid":"76561198127065783","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1084,"last_played":1499462753},"language":"english","review":"Chopin on da track","timestamp_created":1394750735,"timestamp_updated":1395953693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9461059","author":{"steamid":"76561198080695794","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":697,"last_played":1573098031},"language":"brazilian","review":"- \" Muito bom.. extremamente envolvente esse game !

It has been a long, long time since I've been immersed in a universe like this. For once in 2 years, I felt like the actual protagonist rather than a gamer playing as someone on a screen. The way the protagonist mumbles to himself as he does things is very immersive (as I do the same thing to myself in real life).\n\nThe story and generally the way the game is structured, is perfect. Just like any other story-driven FPS', you've got combat, then a cutscene, combat, then a cutscene. The difference between this game and the others is that you actually look forward to seeing the next cutscene. The combat is great fun too, though. Weapons feel like they have impact and the sound effects used for them is top-notch.\n\nYour 'sidekick' isn't annoying at all. At first I had my doubts about her, but she is literally a huge help to me. She gathers ammo, health and money lying around while I do my thing. She isn't necessarily an 'escort' NPC but she's more like your other half. You'll require her powers in order to complete some combat sequences (which can get very difficult playing in hard mode).\n\nI will not divulge much info about the story on this one but all-in-all, the story is great. I prefer it to the original Bioshock as you don't feel as lonely this time around. I also prefer the early 1900's to the 1960's as everything just feels more 'rugged' and less about being a 'gentleman'. Hard to explain. Well, I'm off to continue playing the game.

Подводный город, аккуратно созданный сценаристами, дизайнерами и художниками, который напоминает живой организм, живущий сам по себе – можно было назвать целым явлением в истории интерактивных развлечений. \nЕсли попробовать оценить новый Bioshock «по шкале восторга», это будет выглядеть примерно так – сумма 2-х предыдущих частей помноженная в несколько раз. Так чем же Infinite так прекрасен? \n\nПервое, что бросается в глаза – новая атмосфера. Колумбия – город, парящий в небесах. Если в 1-й части мы бродили по мрачному депрессивному подводному городу - антиутопии, с населением потерявшим все законы морали и нравственности. То Колумбию можно охарактеризовать полной противоположностью города «Восторг». По сути, небесный город тоже можно назвать антиутопией, где общество как-бы вознеслось над привычным нам миром. Главной задачей было построить свое идеальное общество, свой райский уголок, где не будет места человеческим порокам, и все будут добры и счастливы. \n\nВсе выполнено в светлых теплых тонах, с яркой и сочной цветовой гамме. Когда мы попадаем в этот прекрасный город, тебя тут же окутывают чувства уюта и домашней обстановки. В этом городе каждое здание, каждая сцена изящно выполнены, и по-своему являются символом желаний и идей местного населения, а количество восторгающих образов не поддается счету. Когда прогуливаешься по улочкам Колумбии, еще раз убеждаешься, что игры имеют полное право называться «искусством». \n\nНесколько слов о графике и геймплее. Если опять же сравнивать с играми предшественницами, в Bioshock Infinite графика заметно похорошела. Картинка стала яркой, и более насыщенной. Тени и освещение «идут» в ногу со временем. Анимация заметно продвинулась в сторону реализма. Геймплей удобен и благодаря специфике воздушного города имеет ряд интересных фишек. \nBioshock Infinite – это настоящее произведение искусства. Это не просто компьютерная игра – это приключение, позволяющее прожить другую жизнь. Не пропустите. \n\nДостоинства:\n* Необыкновенность (отличие от предыдущих частей)\n* Красивая графика\n* Невероятный , запутаный сюжет \n* Прекрасная атмосфера\n* Общая стилистика игры просто поражает\n* Персонаж Элизабет ^_^\n* Спецэффекты\n* Хорошая музыка и звуки\n* Геймплей\n* Способности главного персонажа\n* Виды боя\n* Разнообразие и оригинальность оружия\n\nНедостатки: \n- Геймплей может надоесть, но это не критично\n- Однообразность врагов\n- Мелкие баги\n- Одна концовка \n- Отсуствие стэлса\n- Нет мультиплеера\n- Нет русской озвучки\n\nМоя оценка игре 5/5","timestamp_created":1394698329,"timestamp_updated":1412261877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547245204448699951","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9445908","author":{"steamid":"76561198119940194","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":632,"last_played":1477750197},"language":"koreana","review":"그냥 빠져들게 된다","timestamp_created":1394697212,"timestamp_updated":1394697212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9445605","author":{"steamid":"76561198040934744","num_games_owned":311,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":938,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":938,"last_played":1392304592},"language":"english","review":"Brilliant game Brilliant story","timestamp_created":1394692676,"timestamp_updated":1394692676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9445600","author":{"steamid":"76561198020217602","num_games_owned":528,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1078,"last_played":1605647874},"language":"english","review":"Easily the most ambitious of the sereis and in my humble opinion the one that shines brightest.
