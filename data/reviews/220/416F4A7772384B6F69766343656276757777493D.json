Si no les gusta el hecho de que su motor sea muy difícil de digerir hoy en día, pueden jugar su remake, Black Mesa, el cual está hecho en el mismo motor gráfico que este juego (yo, personalmente, jugué a la versión original del 1, porque me iba a terminar saliendo Source por las orejas de tanto jugar con ese motor jeje).\n\nAhora, hablando del juego en sí, es una experiencia inolvidable que te sumerge profundamente en su mundo haciendo un uso completamente inmersivo de sus escenarios, en los cuales se presentan enfrentamientos sumamente divertidos y energéticos que usan cada gota que el motor exprime de manera muy inteligente y satisfactoria. En su tiempo fue una revolución y, si lo jugás desde esa perspectiva, te vas a dar cuenta del por qué y casi que vas a sentirlo como tal, ya que el juego es, técnicamente, completamente competente hoy en día.\n\nYa me pasé el juego hace como 2 semanas, pero ahora solo puedo pensar en seguir jugándolo para recorrer esos escenarios tan bien hechos, interactuando con esos personajes tan profundos y bien hechos con el fin dejarme llevar por este mundo que prácticamente te hace olvidar de que lo estás jugando a través de tu compu. Desconozco si este juego proviene de este mundo boeeeee.\n\nMe gustaría poder describir más cosas, pero hablar de este juego se vuelve muy difícil y complejo, pudiendo reducir el juego en su totalidad a una experiencia histórica para los jueguitos que Dios no te va a perdonar el no haber jugado junto a sus dos expansiones antes de morir.\n\nDisfrútenlo.","timestamp_created":1611078978,"timestamp_updated":1611078978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84987395","author":{"steamid":"76561198291607070","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":568,"last_played":1611160630},"language":"english","review":"its

Grundsätzlich beinhaltet es alle Stärken aus dem ersten Teil, jedoch auch einige Schwächen.\n\n[b]Andere Teile und Ableger[/b]\n\nHalf Life Episode 1 und 2 habe ich ebenfalls gespielt und finde diese wieder richtig gut, ich möchte nicht sagen, besser als den 2. Teil, aber für mich persönlich wieder deutlich interessanter als einige Situationen in Half Life 2. Half Life Opposing Force von 1999 habe ich auch gespielt, kann ich, im Gegensatz zu Blue Shift, nur jedem empfehlen, es lohnt sich. Half Life Alyx besitze ich nicht, da ich kein VR Headset besitze, kennen tue ich dieses Spiel aber ebenfalls und angespielt habe ich es auch, es ist großartig!\n\n[h1]Weniger gut[/h1]\nWas mir etwas weniger gefällt, wobei das Meckern auf hohem Niveau ist, ist, dass sich das Spiel etwas Action-reicher spielt, als noch Teil 1, es geht fast nur noch Action-geladen zur Sache, bei dem ersten Teil erinnere ich mich häufiger an etwas ruhigere Passagen, wo auch mal keine Gegner zu finden sind und man andere Dinge zu tun hat, das ist aber recht subjektiv, außerdem bemängel ich im Gegensatz zum ersten Teil die Geschichte von Half Life 2, denn die ist manchmal weniger aufschlussreicher als angenommen und kann schon mal für Verwirrung sorgen, das hat Teil 1 besser gestaltet, dennoch kann auch Half Life 2 mit diesem zumindest mithalten, so zählt auch dieses Spiel zu eines der besten, dass ich jemals gespielt habe (in diesem Genre), das Beste ist für mich nämlich Half Life bzw. Black Mesa, auch dazu habe ich übrigens eine [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/gruuli/recommended/362890/]Review[/url] geschrieben, allerdings deutlich umfangreicher.

    Let me regale you friendos with a tale. A tale of friendship, a tale of bloodshed, a tale... of a holy man, of Father Gregori.\n     I had entered Ravenholm, a newly acquired gravity gun in hand, my previous friends and family possibly destroyed by the Combine still fresh in my mind. The place was dark and spooky, much like my mom's closet when I got locked in there for eating the freshly picked tomatoes from her garden.\n     Ravenholm was home to more terrors then my 5th birthday party. There were headcrabs, poisonous headcrabs, fast headcrabs, zomibes, poisonous zombies, fast zombies, and worst of all, the agony that I was late to pick up my new prescription glasses. Everywhere you turn there would be some abominable monster waiting to wreck your insides and slowly whisper in your ear that scary godmother 3 will never happen. And yet, when all seemed lost, he arrived.\n     Father Gregori was a simple man of religious fervor. He saw an unholy abomination and he'd shoot, much like my uncle during his divorce, hi Uncle Steve, hope jail isn't so bad. Gregori's words kept me going through the walk through Ravenholm. Soon I too was blasting zombies to bits and acting as representation on behalf of facehuggers in small claims court. As if my night couldn't get any better, Father Gregori had gifted me with a SPAS-12, the superior tool for telling your neighbors to get their kids under control so that they stop playing on my yard.\n     Sadly, my time with Father Gregori, much like my time living in a stable household, came to an end. With the grace of a Russian politician rigging votes to maintain office for a 5th term, Gregori shut a door behind me an instructed me to keep going. I didn't want to leave, but Father had set him and a bunch of zombies ablaze and Hooty always taught me to keep safe from fires.\n     I don't think I'll ever see Father Gregori again, but I know my time with him will always be in my memories, perhaps for so long that I'll have no choice but to replay those memories over and over again because I'll never get a 3rd entry in my saga.\n\n10/10 would be guided by scary Russian priest again.","timestamp_created":1611026647,"timestamp_updated":1611026647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84954669","author":{"steamid":"76561198850980475","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":81,"playtime_forever":4583,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1179,"last_played":1625211512},"language":"english","review":"Over hyped...... please don't hurt me","timestamp_created":1611026295,"timestamp_updated":1611026295,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84954136","author":{"steamid":"76561198192802510","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":617,"last_played":1660479474},"language":"schinese","review":"Dizziness makes me cannot even finish this game, let alone speedrun","timestamp_created":1611025337,"timestamp_updated":1611025337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84951123","author":{"steamid":"76561199071855294","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":150,"last_played":1653668887},"language":"english","review":"good gam","timestamp_created":1611019980,"timestamp_updated":1611019980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84950014","author":{"steamid":"76561198956783463","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1725,"last_played":1636086834},"language":"latam","review":"Me encanto, aunque se aleja un poco a el ambiente que daba Half-Life 1 es igual o mejor en varios puntos. Empezando por el motor que usa, Source, usa unas fisicas increibles que se usan en multiples partes como en los puzzles o en las secciones de pelea, además de las varias características que conserva cada objeto, ejemplo: si lanzas una caja de cartón irá más lejos que de lo que podría ir una de madera y está a la vez irá más lejos de lo que podría ir una piedra del mismo tamaño; estas también funcionan con los enemigos, algo suave tirado con fuerza no daña a un enemigo y algo pesado lanzado suavemente tampoco. El entorno es inmersivo pero hay algunas cosas  que se podrían mejorar como la iluminación y algunas zonas algo vacias. También algo a resaltar es la inteligencia de los enemigos que usan varias tácticas para acorralarte, no puedo decir lo mismo de los aliados que estorban a donde sea que vayas pero aunque sea como escudo humano pueden ser útiles. La historia que nos da es bastante extensa pero no complicada y fácil de entender y se puede hacer una linea de tiempo con los demás juegos, un detalle que no me gusto fue la aparición de personajes importantes que en el primer juego solo eran npc's aleatorios aún así les da una buena personalidad para nada forzada que se puede expresar con algunas expresiones y acciones en el juego. El doblaje es bueno pero en las expresiones de sorpresa se pierde toda esa calidad. El soundtrack también es algo de elogiar, muy buenos fondos especialmente en las partes de acción. Finalmente aún conserva las molestos cuadros de \"cargando\" entre mapas pero al ponerlos en lugares que no molestan tanto no quitan demasiado la inmersión. Gran juego 9.2 de 10 lo recomiendo si quieres seguir la saga de Half-Life y quieres un buen shooter.","timestamp_created":1611018037,"timestamp_updated":1611018037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84949145","author":{"steamid":"76561198844503750","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1781,"last_played":1655237282},"language":"russian","review":"Это не просто игра, это настоящая легенда, в своё время перевернувшая рынок своей технологичностью, прошло уже 16 лет, а графика до сих пор довольно таки неплохая.

Let's get into what I liked.\n\nAs a game, I don't really have any problems with it. Half Life 2, and really the Source Engine in general feel much less buggier than it's predecessor. All of the guns feel great to shoot, there's not really any annoying enemies (No more Alien Grunts, yipee!), and all of the new physics-based elements are fun to mess around with. I was worried when I first started playing this game that it was going to feel too much like a glorified tech demo, but thankfully I was incorrect. Also, the level design is nowhere near as linear as Half Life 1. This makes me really happy, since the linear level design was my biggest problem with that game.\n\nBut, of course, I still have my problems with this game, and they all have to do with the story. So, if you don't want to be spoiled, skip the blacked out section.\n\n[spoiler]The Combine feel very one-dimensional. In Half Life 1, most of the antagonists you could feel bad for. Whilst the marines were slaughtering innocent scientists, for all we know they could've been under the false pretense that the scientist team let the Xen aliens go rampant on purpose. And besides that, they were all, for the most part, hunted and killed by the feds. When I say you can feel bad for most of the antagonists, the feds are the exception. Fuck the feds. Anyways, the Xen aliens didn't even go to the Earth willfully. They were enslaved.\n\nSo when you take everything into consideration, you feel no sympathy for the Combine. They're just a heartless corporation that uses their power to gain more of it from weaker planets. This just doesn't end up feeling as interesting as the dynamic in Half Life 1.\n\nAside from that, I have one more problem with the story. The reveal that Mossman is a spy. It didn't end up feeling that impactful, since you barely got to know her. Although, I did like how it was revealed at the end that she only acted as a spy so that Eli's scientific work could be put to the best use possible. Still kind of stupid of her to trust anyone associated with the Combine, but whatever.[/spoiler]\n\nWhat's most important for a game, however, is the gameplay. And as a game, it's pretty much perfect. I don't really do ratings for my reviews, but I'll make an exception. I give this game a 9/10. Nearly perfect, and the issues are very small. If you like Half Life 1, FPS games, or really games in general (Why else would you be here?), give this one a try. I think you'll like it.","timestamp_created":1611015773,"timestamp_updated":1611015773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84948062","author":{"steamid":"76561198996432100","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4675,"last_played":1655766690},"language":"english","review":"le
