In the rest of the game you frantically leap and teleport around the facilities testing tracks, meeting one eyed friends and others with more than one eye.

Demostrando por última vez hasta la fecha porque Valve es tan bueno a la hora de hacer diseño de niveles e impregnar carisma en sus pocos pero valorados títulos. La accesibilidad de sus niveles no implica simpleza ante todo aunque de todas maneras se hubiera valorado agregar niveles principales que requieran un poco más de dificultad. Aunque es un gran título tiende a ser algo conservador y no tratar de experimentar un cambio mecánicamente como lo hizo otra de sus franquicias: Half-Life 2. Fuera de este detalle y de momentos que si te lo pones a pensar puede desencajar con lo que esta sucediendo en el momento, es una entrega más que excelente y destacable hasta la fecha de hoy por todo lo mencionado.
