Also the movement speeds and the way you move in this game are ridiculous.\nSo anywho, I thought I should just waltz into this game playing hard difficulty, which led to several mix responses from me, one of them was \"what the f***\", and the other was a realization of the amount of awareness you have after the first few chapters, which kind of took the joy out of it. But this was still an interesting game, even though I died probably 109 times and more just so that I would have enough health for the enemy after this one, because I knew that I was likely to be caught off guard by the next one or it would be impossible to dodge the next attack.\nJust saying right now, you should probably play easy or medium difficulty, before you think that you can take on a stressful challenge known as hard difficulty.

It isn't Half-Life 3 but it's something for once. If you don't know what I'm talking about, take a look for yourself. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2W0N3uKXmo\n\n[i]I would say [b]\"it's about Fu*king time\"[/b], but I'm here to talk about the original Half-Life and all of its strengths and weaknesses.[/i]\n\n[list]\n[*][h1][b]The Strengths...[/b][/h1]\nI say the biggest strengths of Half-Life is it's [b]Storytelling[/b] and [b]Atmosphere[/b]. Storytelling is done through a First-Person Perspective [i][b]\"AKA through you\"[/b][/i], this is something that was great back in 1998 and is still great to this day. Of course the way how it delivers dialogue is kind of dated in some way, because they talk kinda too fast. A mod called Black Mesa,[spoiler] \"which is a re-creation of Half-Life 1\"[/spoiler] kind of fixes this problem, but it's still okay in my opinion.\n\nI do say the story is great and I won't spoil too much of it, but really it's just you running around pressing buttons and getting the hell out of Black Mesa, while watching scripted events unfold in front of you.[b] Which is something that modern games has done a thousand times now[/b], [i]but back in 1998 this kind of concept was groundbreakingand is still enjoyable for the most part.[/i]\n\n[b]As for Atmosphere, it's Great.[/b] [i]Something that's still unique to this day and can get you really immersed.[/i]\n\n[*][h1][b]The Weaknesses...[/b][/h1]\n[u]The gameplay is kind of weak in my opinion.[/u] It's still good, but only when you come encountered with aliens. [i]Fighting against the Human Grunts is kinda crappy[/i], because they [u]Utilize Hitscan[/u] and [u]Line of Sight[/u]. So the moment they see you, you're going to take damage regardless on how fast you are or how much you try to dodge. [i]But hey the AI can easily be cheaped out, so I guess that's some kind of advantage that you can do.[/i]\n\n I did say that the atmosphere is great, but sometimes in other areas there's absolutely no sound playing at all. Like whenever you reach the surface, I kind of expect a [i]War Zone happening[/i], like [u]hearing Explosions, Humans and Aliens dying around you[/u], you know all that jazz [u]but there's just nothing[/u]. [b][i]These parts with no sound detracts the immersion of the game a bit.[/i][/b] But these are only [u]\"just some parts of the game\".[/u] There are other parts that do have some kind of sound, so the whole game is not entirely quiet.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]\n[b][i]Overall it's a pretty good classic and I still enjoy it to this day.[/i][/b]\n\n[u]I would recommend this game to anyone that's looking for a Retro game experience or if you're into Shooters.[/u]","timestamp_created":1574392795,"timestamp_updated":1574456625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57611974","author":{"steamid":"76561198842877716","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":868,"last_played":1614131242},"language":"english","review":"absolutely amazing. i picked this game up when it was on sale, and i fell in love with it right away. the 90's graphics gives character to the game, and its aged well in my opinion. i highly recommend this game to anyone who is wanting some good 90's FPS games","timestamp_created":1574390477,"timestamp_updated":1574390477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57611639","author":{"steamid":"76561198272328314","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":1714,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":687,"last_played":1590491976},"language":"english","review":"It guud","timestamp_created":1574389805,"timestamp_updated":1574389805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472529232501983643","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57611077","author":{"steamid":"76561198847001469","num_games_owned":1562,"num_reviews":184,"playtime_forever":831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":831,"last_played":1571976300},"language":"english","review":"played for the first time in 2019 at age 28; aside from graphics and bugs and audio and a few outdated mechanics this a masterpiece that clearly brought in the dawn of a new era for vidya and deserves all the praise it gets.\n\nalso fuck a VR sequel, gtfo gabin","timestamp_created":1574388703,"timestamp_updated":1574388703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532246649265289307","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57606633","author":{"steamid":"76561198255809850","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2133,"last_played":1652056161},"language":"english","review":"[h1] Half Life.

Half-Life is by far my favorite game of all time.\n\n","timestamp_created":1574379818,"timestamp_updated":1574379818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57606338","author":{"steamid":"76561197969031618","num_games_owned":689,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":1413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":977,"last_played":1575233768},"language":"english","review":"It's Half-Life","timestamp_created":1574379199,"timestamp_updated":1574379199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57606066","author":{"steamid":"76561198085205278","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8211,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7824,"last_played":1652217244},"language":"english","review":"pew pew pew","timestamp_created":1574378663,"timestamp_updated":1574378663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57604845","author":{"steamid":"76561198320686872","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":209,"last_played":1656698087},"language":"english","review":"Better than getting a crowbar to the face!!","timestamp_created":1574376363,"timestamp_updated":1574376363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57600731","author":{"steamid":"76561199003264277","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":248,"last_played":1651268872},"language":"english","review":"One of the greatest pc games and a must play for everyone.","timestamp_created":1574369439,"timestamp_updated":1574369439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57600132","author":{"steamid":"76561198804293802","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4278,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3805,"last_played":1655064381},"language":"turkish","review":"eğlenceli MORUQ","timestamp_created":1574368516,"timestamp_updated":1574368516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57599980","author":{"steamid":"76561198260022645","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":759,"last_played":1576103724},"language":"english","review":"its fun\n","timestamp_created":1574368277,"timestamp_updated":1574368277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57594934","author":{"steamid":"76561198401381177","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":597,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":595,"last_played":1644832120},"language":"english","review":"E","timestamp_created":1574361255,"timestamp_updated":1574361255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57592840","author":{"steamid":"76561199003851011","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1643399713},"language":"english","review":"its good","timestamp_created":1574358366,"timestamp_updated":1574358366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57591947","author":{"steamid":"76561198158825562","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47,"last_played":1654080131},"language":"english","review":"This game is big part of my childhood and it was big deal at the time. I remember my cousin and brothers playing it and was so immersed. I remember how my cousin was stuck at Blast Pit chapter. It was like this big labyrinth which my little mind couldn't comprehend. So scary, too for 8 year old and I was like \"I want to play Half-Life, too\" and my family allowed me besides all violence and gore.\n\nHalf-Life has the best sounds in gaming. Every single one is so nostalgic... from hitting with crowbar to health recharger, to all these button sounds, doors, background sounds and alarms. Let's not forget original vanilla menu. It's so stylish & 90s (sadly not in steam version).\n\nI always loved how all levels are connected even with it's frequent \"loading...\" text on screen. It simply added to whole immersion part like You are going through this big adventure gone wrong. One thing which people quite often criticises Half-Life (nowadays especially) is it's platforming. I'm not one of them. I always liked that there was platforming segments and was amazed how level designers came up with these sections to make them look both realistic and interesting to traverse. The way how all these levels connect through ducts, pipes, passages, having to backtrack, opening shortcuts, seeing old areas from distance and feeling progress was amazing. There was a lot of scripted moments compared to other games at the time which made things constantly fresh and unexpected and game's pacing was spot on.\n\nCan't forget about this simple fact. It is really good shooter with lots of guns and enemies which all work differently. Every enemy had different AI and attack paterns. Soldiers were really advanced at the time. Throwing grenades, reteating and overall fun to fight against. The way how weapons are slowly introduced and game is still bringing new guns and enemies even during it's final chapters. Yes, Xen was amazing (fight me!) and felt so alien compared to rest of game.\n\ntl;dr: One of my all time favorites 10/10","timestamp_created":1574357141,"timestamp_updated":1574357201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532967031002044678","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57591057","author":{"steamid":"76561198281278725","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":387,"last_played":1582342410},"language":"english","review":"gordman","timestamp_created":1574355888,"timestamp_updated":1574355888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57589783","author":{"steamid":"76561198056926177","num_games_owned":301,"num_reviews":143,"playtime_forever":421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":416,"last_played":1604839732},"language":"english","review":"Glad to have finally played through this.
