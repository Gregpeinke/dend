The game is based on the same mechanisms as the first part, and adds elements that make the game better.\n\nI'm mainly talking about cooperation mode. It's done so well that I think it's more interesting than the single player mode and more fun to play. Of course the storyline is very good, but the ability to solve puzzles with a friend appeals to me more. The boards are made in such a way that we are unlikely to finish them by ourselves and the cooperation is very important here.\n\nOf course, our main object that we need to complete the game is the gun portal, just like in the previous part. It does not introduce any innovations, it works on the same principle as before, that is, it can create two portals between which we can move.\n\nWe need to mention the riddles that await us during the game. We will come across simple, trivial puzzles, which will take us literally a while to solve, but we will also find some that we will have to spend more time on. This discrepancy makes the game more diverse and friendly even for younger players.\n\nThe graphics are very good for the year of the game release. The locations are nice, they contain various details, despite the old engine, the graphics can really make an amazing impression.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\nPortal 2 is definitely one of the best games I've played. It's hard to find any mistakes, the game is just great. We have an interesting storyline, good cooperation mode, easy and difficult puzzles. All in all, the only thing I can attach to is a few bugs, but they are so few that they do not affect the pleasure of the game.\n[b]\n✔️Gameplay\n✔️Graphics\n✔️Storyline\n✔️Cooperative mode\n✔️Sound\n\n❌Few bugs\n\n[b][u]Rating: 9.5/10[/u][/b]\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●\n\n[h1][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34408584/]Follow my curator for more reviews[/url][/h1]\n●▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●\n[b]\nATTENTION!\nPlease note that this is only my evaluation and opinion of the game.

I love it so much, just the humor and everything about it. The campaign is amazing and I highly reccomend it. You dont really need to play Portal 1 to understand it but if you know what happens in that game well its probably for the better.
