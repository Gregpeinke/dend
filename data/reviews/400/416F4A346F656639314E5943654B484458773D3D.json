À votre réveil, vous entendez une voix, celle de GLaDOS vous expliquant ce que vous faites ici et ce que vous devez faire pour sortir. Ainsi commence alors un jeu génial. Même si de base le jeu n'était qu'un test, qui devait donner vie à 'Portal 2\", l'histoire est profonde (je me suis même attaché à un certain cube dans le jeu... ;))\n\nMême si les graphismes ne sont pas excellents, mais assez bons pour un jeu sorti en 2007, on retrouve énormément d'informations, que ce soit sur les murs ou encore dans des pièces cachées du jeu. Les éléments cachés nous apprennent beaucoup d'informations sur les locaux d'Aperture Science, vous pourrez découvrirs ces mêmes éléments dans le jeu.\n\nLe gameplay maintenant: le jeu m'a semblé un peu court, contrairement à la suite de celui-ci, même si 1h30 voire 2 heures sont suffisantes à compléter Portal, le gameplay (et l'histoire) sont tellement addictifs que vous allez avoir envie de recommencer ce jeu encore et encore et d'acheter sa suite: Portal 2\n\nPoints positifs du jeu:\n - Super background et histoire\n - Présence de GLaDOS tout au long du jeu\n - Découverte des locaux de Aperture Science tout au long du jeu\n - Gameplay très addictif\n - Musiques excellentes\n - Bien d'autres choses que vous découvrirez au long du jeu\n - Ce jeu tourne sous tous les PC, avec n'importe quelle carte graphique que ce soit Intel Graphics, AMD ou encore Nvidia (qui reste le mieux bien évidemment)\n\nPoints négatifs du jeu:\n - Les graphismes sont assez anciens et vieux, mais le jeu en reste très bon\n - Pas de double fin, la même pour tout le monde.

Please keep in mind this was written after I completed both Portal and Portal 2 between a couple of days, so some parts of the review might be more accurate of the franchise as a whole than just Portal.\n\nWhen I first got this game as part of the Valve pack, I did not think I would like it at all, since I am not big on puzzle games, and that's what this game is at first impression (and its core, actually). There are barely any events that require split-second decisions, nor is aim and accuracy a big difference maker. One would expect a first person game where you carry a gun to have much more tension, and when I did not find that in the first 20 minutes or so I quit the game. I'm very glad I picked it up again last week.\n\nThe dialogue, although not much, strongly helps to establish the \"characters\" in the game. Motives become that much more clear and you will enjoy the game more once you dive into it. Voice acting is superb and there is not a line I don't smirk at while playing.\nThe gameplay is simple, with just a few mechanic twists, yet requires you to really take the entire environment into consideration. Every nook and cranny, no matter how distant or seemingly in the background, might help you to solve the puzzle at hand. There is always room for error and restarts, so beam away when you are in trouble.\nThe difficulty is not very high if you are an experienced gamer, but the sense of achievement you get from solving whichever room you are in is. I yelled \"yeah!\" numerous times through the course of the game.\nFinally, this game seems to be great for non-gamers---I was able to convince my never-gaming wife to try a couple of puzzles, and even she thought it was fun and challenging. Too bad I had to laugh at her for unable to grasp the idea of motion while falling through sideways portals, and there was that...\n\nOf course, from my playtime you could tell I only played story mode, and not multiplayer and mods, so there is probably loads more fun I am missing, but that is for a different reviewer to cover.\n\nFinal Verdict: I strongly recommend this game if you want a breather from all the FPS and action games of the world, and even more strongly recommend that you play Portal and Portal 2 in succession.\n","timestamp_created":1472128149,"timestamp_updated":1472128149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25127562","author":{"steamid":"76561198003107149","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":12972,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":340,"last_played":1626652563},"language":"schinese","review":"通关之后感觉甚是无聊，没有传说中的那么好玩，结果发现高级房间挑战模式才是本体，正章只是教学练手模式，挺不错的游戏，就是高级房间太少了","timestamp_created":1472110693,"timestamp_updated":1472110693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25126911","author":{"steamid":"76561198288837359","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":385,"last_played":1472106060},"language":"koreana","review":"처음에는 터렛 무서웡 으잉 ㅠㅠㅠ 하다가 어느새 아무렇지않게 터렛 뒤로가서 터렛을 바닥에 낙하시키는 나를 보았을때의 기분이란... 글라도스가 날 포악하게 만들었어!","timestamp_created":1472106730,"timestamp_updated":1472106730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25126357","author":{"steamid":"76561198092329986","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1472102036},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un juego Puzzles muy interesante que puede darte 2 o 3 horas de desafio moderado; sin emnbargo el punto mas importante es la forma como nos cuenta su historia, sin cinematicas o pausas de texto, solo conversacion entre tu y Glados, quien se roba todo el protagonismo.\n\nTotalmente recomendable si quieres ver una forma de narrativa que no detiene al jugador, lo complementa","timestamp_created":1472103036,"timestamp_updated":1472103036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50147712230682373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25126010","author":{"steamid":"76561198133169645","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":493,"last_played":1472333899},"language":"english","review":"Great game and challenging in the later levels... though I did have to get creative in solving a puzzle in room 18 and skipped a button.","timestamp_created":1472100839,"timestamp_updated":1472100839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25123515","author":{"steamid":"76561198109207141","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":1164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":568,"last_played":1633031255},"language":"german","review":"I played it and I'm STILL ALIVE!\n\nMuss man gespielt haben - auf jeden Fall, bevor man sich an Teil 2 macht, aber auch ansonsten und überhaupt!!!\n\nMehr kann ich jetzt nicht schreiben, ich muss meinen gewichteten Begleiterkubus suchen gehen...","timestamp_created":1472086996,"timestamp_updated":1472086996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25121389","author":{"steamid":"76561198085117283","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1398512840},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошо.","timestamp_created":1472076530,"timestamp_updated":1472076530,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25121323","author":{"steamid":"76561198036618207","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":211,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1454881676},"language":"english","review":"A homocidal AI that plays tricks with the best lines Ive heard in a game.
