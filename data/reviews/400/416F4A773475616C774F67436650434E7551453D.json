As you progress you will learn more and more about the facility and it's dark secrets. that's as far as i'll go to not give spoilers\n\n\nLength: Sadly however this game is criminally short only being about 15 hours long if you really take your time but you could probably squeeze out another 2 or 3 from the challenges as well\n\n\nCommunity: This game still has a large, loving fan base and are still creating mods for the game one of the best ive played is Portal: Prelude however if you arent experienced avoid that one at all costs as you wont get past the first level.\n\n\nOverall: 9.5/10 it is very short and in the end that is what will be what costs this game .5 points everything else though is fantastic.","timestamp_created":1548882343,"timestamp_updated":1548882343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48652718","author":{"steamid":"76561198312722505","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1076,"last_played":1640641665},"language":"english","review":"Its a great game with great phisics. 10/10","timestamp_created":1548880100,"timestamp_updated":1548880100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48652337","author":{"steamid":"76561198212697680","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":259,"last_played":1563913264},"language":"polish","review":"Świetna gra i Dobra fabuła.

Seguramente ya varios de ustedes lo jugaron hace varios años, pero otros quizás no, cosa que me parece un pecado, especialmente si tienes una PC y no has jugado ningún juego de Valve. En caso de que esto ultimo sea verdad, pues, en hora buena, te invito a que juegues Portal, y en este video te diré básicamente porque tienes que jugar este título sí o sí. Sin más que agregar, empecemos.\nPortal es un juego de plataformas y podría considerarse también de rompecabezas, desarrollado por la muy famosa Valve, creadora de juegos como Half Life, Counter Strike o L4D2. El juego fue lanzado al mercado el 9 de octubre del año 2007 para PC y Xbox 360, unos meses después, tuvo su versión para Play Station 3. \nAcabas de despertar en un extraño cuarto de cristal, con nada mas que algo que parece ser una cama, un pequeña mesa con una radio, y un retrete, hasta de pronto, la voz de una computadora te da la bienvenida al experimento. Hasta el momento todo parece normal, pero ¿qué pasa? Un pequeño corto circuito ocurre mientras te da las instrucciones. ¿Esto te da la primera pista de la historia, acaso algo anda mal? Estas encerrado en un sitio desconocido con una computadora, pero, en los escenarios ves oficinas vacías y cámaras, ¿qué fue lo que paso? ¿En dónde están todos? La computadora dice que, al terminar las pruebas, todos te estarán esperando con una deliciosa tarta, esto suena algo…sospechoso. \nPasas cámara tras cámara resolviendo puzles con tu pistola de portales, en un principio solo puedes abrir el portal azul, que se completa con el portal naranja que aparece durante los primeros niveles, pero después te dan una mejora para crear los 2 tipos de portales y resolver acertijos mas complicados. Hasta ahora todo bien, simplemente, encontrar la forma de salir presionando botones con cajas, yendo a lugares en donde parece complicado de llegar, cuidándote de las torretas y las bolas de energía que aparecen en las habitaciones, ¿esto parece extraño no? ¿Un experimento en donde se pone en riesgo la vida del sujeto? A tal grado de poner habitaciones en donde si caes al suelo, el cual esta cubierto por algo que parece acido, mueres. \nHasta ahora tenemos un juego bastante interesante, una historia llenas de misterios, que uno va descubriendo a lo largo de escuchar diálogos, y viendo las pistas que uno encuentra a lo largo el juego, una en especial, en donde nos advierten que el pastel es una mentira. El diseño de nivel y la atmosfera funcionan bastante bien con lo que nos quiere transmitir el juego, esa sensación de misterio, avanzar cada vez más y más, hasta que finalmente descubres que fue lo que paso en Aperture Science.  Otra cosa que debo mencionar es que Glados como antagonista esta muy bien hecha debido a su carisma y personalidad.\nNo tengo mas que recalcar, creo que el único punto negativo en el juego es que el jefe final es algo decepcionante, también podría mencionar la poca, o mejor dicho nula banda sonora que tiene el juego, pero realmente no es algo que afecte mucho al gameplay, ya que esto implementa esta sensación de aparente soledad.","timestamp_created":1548714338,"timestamp_updated":1583173478,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.623036623001098633","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48615070","author":{"steamid":"76561198119513145","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":1355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1139,"last_played":1651836816},"language":"english","review":"Portal is a game where you solve puzzles using a portal gun.

It's got the basic plot of any sci-fi puzzler, but it succeeds at making it original. You are a test subject in the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center, solving puzzles with the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. These puzzles usually involve placing an Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube on an Aperture Science Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super-Button to open an Aperture Science Chamberlock. The main mechanic is the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, which, as the name suggests, is a gun that shoots portals. You can place portals on any white surface, and you use them for pretty much anything.\n\nWhile you're performing the test, GLaDOS, the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center's computer, guides you, promising cake as a reward for completing the tests. However, the further you get, the more sinister things become. You must work with energy pellets that kill you on contact, avoid floors that kill you on contact, and defeat robots that don't kill you on contact but shoot a ridiculous amount of bullets.\n\nThe game also has a great sense of humor. I'm not going to give examples, so that you can experience all the comedy for yourself, but I am going to say it might be a good idea to sit there and listen to Intelligence Core, even though a timer is counting down to your death.\n\nOverall this is a great game, totally worth the ten bucks.\n9/10","timestamp_created":1548606016,"timestamp_updated":1548606016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48590617","author":{"steamid":"76561198435095229","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":338,"last_played":1548621753},"language":"english","review":"Excellent.
