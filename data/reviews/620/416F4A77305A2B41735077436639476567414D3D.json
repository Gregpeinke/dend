and the coop is my fav \"Portal\" game for sure, and 6 is still a \"pretty good\" in my book. HOWEVER, if you had told me I was going to put that for Portal 2 back when I started it, I wouldn't have believed you. I mean these are just numbers anyway, but well. Gives you an idea.The original is one of my favorite games and I put a 9 on that because of how inventive, crisp and engaging the campaign was. Portal 2 is just more of the same things, it has lesser of all 3 I mentioned. By virtue of being a sequel, it obviously can't be equally as novel, but the problem is that MORE OF THE SAME also translates into the quantity, more so than the quality. This game is more than 4x longer than it should be. And the specificity of the mechanics does not warrant this length. The first game had 19 chambers and 3 additional rooms. This one has [b]37 chambers and 22 additional rooms[/b]. Which are bigger. By the end, I was begging for the game to be over since unlike the prv one, there wasn't a progression in difficulty, but more of a flatline near half-game after which it just refused to end. Apart from the length, another thing that I didn't like was the increased prevalence of \"find the white marker across the whole map to portal to\". It shifts half the challenge in the game from puzzle-solving to just standing and looking for a spot. They know it was going to be a \"thing\" hence the zoom button too. And I'm not a fan of this addition, personally. It ends up bloating a lot of the playtime.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Narrative[/td]\n        [td]6[/td]\n\t[td]Portal 2 certainly wanted to have more of a \"AAA story\" compared to 1, which would certainly be some people's preference, but for me, the simplicity and intrigue of 1 was what did the most for me. And while I enjoyed Cave Johnson a lot, I kinda got saturated by the lore behind each and everything. There was some dialogue going on every single second. The humor seemed to be more r/fellowkids at times, in contrast to the mysterious and almost dark vibe of the previous. But I did enjoy the \"final portal\" shot and that whole sequence leading up to the overall \"eh\" finale. So, as you can tell, I both love and hate the game. I know one thing for sure though, that Portal 2 kinda lifted the veil of mystery that 1 had cast years ago, simplifying and materializing the world a whole lot for the player, for better or worse.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Visuals[/td]\n        [td]8[/td]\n\t[td]The good ol' signature Portal look.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Mechanics[/td]\n        [td]9[/td]\n\t[td]It's built on the same engine as 1, so the mechanics are just as good. Everything from the movement, to mid-air physics, is great. This game also adds fluid mechanics which end up adding a lot of fun ways to solve puzzles.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Challenge[/td]\n        [td]6[/td]\n\t[td]As I mentioned above, I didn't like the shift in the \"kind\" of challenge that was present in a lot of the game, where simply finding \"where\" to shoot the portal was the challenge. I don't want to discount some of the great puzzles in there btw, so credit where it's due. But you need to wade through a lot of filler to get to those. I did end up finding the game easier than 1, but I'm sure that's because I already know how to think in the way the game needs. Another thing that could've affected is I played the coop campaign a couple years ago itself, and my friend and I went directly into the BONUS content mistakenly. But I do think I'm not the only one who would've found 2 to be easier than 1. By the end, you had levels in Portal 1 with multiple solutions, one where you had to portal mid-air and shit. There's nothing that \"climax feeling\" as that in 2. But also, it's also a matter of the difficulty curve more than difficulty. Had the game been restricted to a shorter length, they would've had more control of the increment in challenge.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Variety[/td]\n        [td]7[/td]\n\t[td]I kinda began to feel the variety lacked in comparison to the game's runtime. While the fluids, gravity rays etc. were good fun for like the first 10ish levels I had em, the patterns began repeating pretty quickly with those.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Mapping[/td]\n        [td]6[/td]\n\t[td]The \"more\" ending up to become less principle followed in the map design as well. While Portal 2 has some of the best puzzles out of the 2 games as well, I can still somehow only remember 1 or 2 of them even though I just finished the game over the course of the past few months - compared to a lot of memorable bits from Portal 1. In Portal 1, every element in the level followed a \"Chekhov's Gun\" kind of rule, where it ended up serving some purpose or another, and some puzzles still ended up having multiple solutions. But in 2, there were white patches everywhere around, most of them with no application. You could consider it a good thing, to confuse the player, but that isn't the way I appreciate challenge being added, since the difficulty when you spotted the \"correct white patch\" wasn't that difficult. And a lot of the level design ended up boiling down to \"find the correct white patch\", with only a few \"solve the actual puzzle using all of these white patches\" that 1 did.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Sound[/td]\n        [td]8[/td]\n\t[td]The voice acting, sound design etc. is still just as excellent. JK Simmons was great.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Interface[/td]\n        [td]8[/td]\n\t[td]I like the minimal UI, as the game shows everything important within the world itself. One thing that really bugged me was literal paragraphs of subtitles that show up whenever someone starts talking. I'm not even kidding, I've never seen a game be this bad with it, at least from what I recall. I ended up shutting them despite preferring to have them on during gameplay simply for this reason.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Pricing & Performance[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n\t[td]The game runs really well, and is more than a steal for its price even without a sale.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Replay Value [/td]\n        [td]-[/td]\n\t[td]I don't judge puzzle games on their replay value. Only genre I do that with.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\n    [tr]\n        [td]Online (Not part of final score)[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n\t[td]My ranking of the games will be: Portal 2 Coop > Portal > Portal 2 SP.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]SCORE : 7.4/10[/b]\n\nSo yes, despite all the criticisms I made through the review, this is still a REALLY good game and a must-play in the coop at the very least. \n\n[url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hU-EeIPXVLoEmwcIPggkGa5bfc3ykvTxWwgTty-7Unw/edit#gid=0] Full list of Rated Games.
