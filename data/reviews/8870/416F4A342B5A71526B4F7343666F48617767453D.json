DAMN..! [/h1]\n\nGraphics: \nAwesome, but it also really depends of the computer or the settings. Either way the developers really tried to go into details.\n\nBugs:\nVery minor, (sometimes objects go throught walls when [spoiler] Elizabeth throws them [/spoiler] ). <---- just a minor spoiler\nI hadn't seen any others tho so if you want write a comment about bugs that you had that I hadn't seen, I will add it for other people to see.\n\nGameplay:\nOh my [strike] fu*king [/strike] god.... No words just play the game. But in one word.. AWESOME. And the ending tho... total [strike] mindfu*k [/strike]\n\nCharacters: ( click only if you want to see the character names and personalities! )\n[spoiler] Oh i fu*king love Elizabeth and the twins are so fucking amazing too. I think that irattional games couldnt pick a better \"person\" than Booker DeWitt as the main character. Also I think that Elizabeth is the best fucking companion you can have. ;) [/spoiler]\n\nOverall sh*t and stuff: \n\nMy god this game is AMAZING. I never really liked single-player games more than the multiplayer ones but this one restored my faith in them. \n\nGraphics: 9/10 (considering the bug)\nGameplay: Elizabeth/10 (11/10)\nCharacters: 9.9/10 ( [spoiler] I think that there were only around 5 designs of the basic soldiers, not including the Vox [/spoiler] )\nOverall: 9.96/10 ( yeah I used calculator)\n\nAfter all, I really recomend this game to all kinda sci-fi-fantasy lovers.... FUCK IT JUST BUY THIS GAME!!! (even if you don't like single-player games, or at least try it and you can get a refund, the game will however, get the most interesting after 2 hours which is past the limit) \n\nAlright than... If you want to say something to me write me a message or if you hadn't liked this review write a comment to let me know  so I could improve in writing other reviews. Thank you. \n\nBeware of the dangerous world outside and stay healed my friends\n\n(also sorry about the lenght and my english)","timestamp_created":1560012554,"timestamp_updated":1560012837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.710920631885528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51121318","author":{"steamid":"76561198169786041","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1536,"last_played":1474906494},"language":"swedish","review":"mmm yes mamma","timestamp_created":1560011215,"timestamp_updated":1560011215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51120342","author":{"steamid":"76561198050927126","num_games_owned":377,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":1404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1404,"last_played":1544243133},"language":"english","review":"Its a good game but not a \"BioShock game\" as in feels nothing like the two previous games.

และสิ่งนั้นเองที่ทำให้พวกเขาต้องได้พบกับการผจญภัยที่เหนือจินตนาการ และ ความจริงอันสุดขมขื่น\n[b]ตัวเกมภาพรวม[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]ตัวเกมจะให้เราดื่มด่ำกับบรรยากาศ 20's(อาจจะมีความ 80's ด้วยเล็กน้อย[spoiler]เช่นเพลงบรรเลงที่แกะมาจากเพลง80's)[/spoiler]\nที่มีวิทยาการล้ำสมัยและบรรยากาศของเกม ที่จะพาคุณคล้อยตามได้อย่างง่ายดาย ทั้งรื่นรมย์ เร้าใจ และ น่าขนลุก และสิ่งที่น่าสนใจคือตัวเกมเล่นกับทฤษฎีโลกคู่ขนานที่จะสร้างปมให้คุณสงสัยและคลายปมชนิดที่ว่าต้องจิกหมอนเลย การดำเนินเรื่องของมันแทบจะต่อเนื่องมุ่งแบบไม่หยุดยั้ง สไตล์ของเกมนี้ จะบู๊ก็ไม่เชิง จะลอบเร้นก็ไม่ใช่ แต่มันก็จะผสมผสานกันจนมันกลมกล่อมเอง(แต่เท่าที่เห็นก็จะหนักไปที่บู๊นะ) แต่ตัวเกมก็ไม่ได้ให้คุณเดินหน้าตลอดเวลาคุณสามารถหยุดสำรวจรอบๆพื้นที่ก่อนที่จะไปพื้นที่ต่อไปก็ได้ หาของและเสพบรรยากาศเพลินๆ สำหรับใครที่ชอบสายสำรวจหาของเกมนี้ตอบโจทย์กับคุณอย่างมาก ถ้าใครสำรวจเก่งๆละก็รางวัลสำหรับนักสำรวจถือว่าคุ้มค่ากับการให้สำรวจเลย \n    [*]ถ้าคุณเข้าใจภาษาอังกฤษได้อย่างถ่องแท้คุณจะรู้สึกอินกับมันมาก ผมก็คนหนึ่งที่ไม่ได้เก่งมากแต่จะมี Translate อยู่ข้างมือตลอดแปลไปอินไป พึ่งแปลนี้เสร็จ อ่ะอ่าวเห้ยๆ บทไปละ รู้สึกอิจฉาคนเก่งอังกฤษก็เมื่อเล่นเกมนี้แหละครับ555(ส่วนการปรับ Subtitle จะอยู่ในช่อง Audio ครับไม่รู้ไปอยู่ทำถ้วยอะไรตรงนั้นไม่คิดว่าจะไปอยู่ช่องนั้นได้ตอนแรกท้อละว่ามันไม่มี)\n    [*]การบังคับของเกมนี้ค่อนข้างจะเฉพาะตัวเพราะเนื่องจากมีระบบการใช้ Vigor หรือเวทมนต์ต่างๆที่สามารถใช้ได้ตามลักษณะต่างๆ โดยการกดคลิกขวาเพื่อใช้ การเล็งเป้าจะใช้ปุ่มเมาส์กลางแทน ส่วนตัวเลยคือไม่ถนัดเอามากๆ ยิงไปยิงมาใช้เวทมนต์หมดโดยที่ไม่รู้ตัว 555 ก็แก้ปัญหาด้วยการปรับเปลี่ยนปุ่มแค่นี้ก็โอเคเลยครับ\n    [*]ดูจากเนื้อเรื่องแล้วมันก็ดูเหมือนว่าเราต้องพา Elizabeth มามันก็ต้องเป็น Escort(การพาบุคคลหรือสิ่งของไปที่หมาย)ใช่ไหมครับ(หน้า Ashly RE4 ผุดขึ้นมาทันใด)แต่จริงๆแล้วมันไม่ใช่เลยแม้แต่น้อยเพราะ  Elizabeth ดูแลตัวเองได้(คืออมตะแหละแต่นางก็ Take cover นะเว้ย) และสามารถช่วยเหลือเราในยามขับขันและสามารถหาของต่างๆได้[spoiler]เช่น การหาเงิน/Picklock,ให้ยา/กระสุน,สะเดาะกลอน และการใช้พลังของเธอ[/spoiler] ซึ่งเป็นการสร้างความผูกพันระหว่างเรากับ Elizabeth ได้ไม่น้อยเลย แต่ก็มีบางทีที่ ตัวเกมจะแสดงความโก๊ะออกมาเช่น Elizabeth เดินไปเดินมาแถวกลุ่มศัตรูโดยที่ ศัตรูไม่ Alert เลยหรือศัตรูที่มีความรู้สึกเร็วและช้ากว่าปกติ\n    [*]อาวุธถือว่าทำได้เหมาะกับธีม มีระบบ Upgrade ที่ไม่ยุ่งยากมาก ซึ่งไม่เพียงแต่ Upgrade แค่อาวุธเท่านั้นแต่ยังสามารถ Upgrade ได้ทั้ง Vigor และ Gear ซึ่ง Gear ก็เป็นพลังพิเศษที่มีค่าแตกต่างกันไปและสามารถใส่ได้ถึง 4 ชิ้น ซึ่งจำนวนมากน้อยของ Gear ก็ขึ้นอยู่กับว่าเราจะสำรวจมากน้อยแค่ไหนยิ่งสำรวจมากยิ่งได้มาก \n    [*]ระบบที่เป็นเอกลักษณ์ของเกมเลยคือ ระบบ Skyline เป็นการเคลื่อนที่บนรางด้วย Sky-Hook(แถมเป็นอาวุธระยะประชิดด้วย)และสามารถใช้ในการต่อสู้ได้อีกด้วยเพื่อเกิดความหลากหลายไม่จำเจว่าจะต้องอยู่แค่ภาคพื้น ไม่ว่าจะเป็นการใช้ปืนยิงบนรางเองซึ่งก็เป็นการหลบหลีกการโจมตีไปในตัวหรือจะเป็นการกระโดดไปหาศัตรูเพื่อใช้อาวุธประชิดในการโจมตี ซึ่งระบบ อาวุธและ Gear จะเกื้อการโจมตีจาก Skyline ให้มีประสิทธิภาพมากขึ้นอีกด้วยแต่บางทีใช้มันก็จะมึนๆเสียวๆหน่อย[spoiler](͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)[/spoiler]เพราะ มันต้องใช้ Skyline เกือบทั้งเกม สำหรับใครที่เมารถอาจจะเมา Skyline เพิ่มเติมก็ได้555\n[/list]\n[b]สรุป[/b] เกมนี้ควรจะเป็นเกมที่คุณควรลองเล่น เพราะเกมนี้มีเอกลักษณ์เฉพาะตัวและมีหลายแง่มุมให้คุณได้ครุ่นคิดตามไปกับเนื้อเรื่องตลอดตั้งแต่เริ่มจนจบเกม[spoiler]ทั้งเหรียญสองด้าน/โลกคู่ขนาน ความคลั่งตัวบุคคลจนไม่ลืมหูลืมตา การรักษาสายเลือดบริสุทธิ์และเหยียดเชื้อชาติอื่น[/spoiler]  เกมนี้บางทีก็แทบไม่เหมือนเกม มันเป็นเกมที่มีความสวยงามในแบบของมันที่เราสามารถดื่มด่ำกับมันได้ทุกรายละเอียดและมีความต่อเนื่องเหมือนกับหนังเรื่องหนึ่งเลย ช่วงวันหยุดเสาร์อาทิตย์หรือหยุดยาว น้ำพร้อมป๊อปคอนพร้อม ปิดไฟปิดม่าน นั่งบนเก้าอี้หรือโซฟานุ่มๆ แล้วพร้อมดื่มด่ำกับโลกอันสุดแสนมหัศจรรย์ ได้ใน BioShock Infinite ขอให้มีความสุขกับการเล่นเกมนะฮะ

RECCOMEND THIS GAME SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S STILL A SOLID SHOOTER WITH DECENT STORY BUT I DETAIL MANY PROBLEMS BELOW. If we had number ratings I'd give this game a 7/10.\n\ntldr : The game is a very solid shooter and a good story (I enjoyed the original Bioshocks more , but it's still decent). However, the game has many graphical, audio and other bugs that just annoyed me and even forced me to restart the game sometimes. ( Read below for details) I picked up this game along with the season pass for $14.99. I'd say even off sale this game is a decent buy, but if you're looking for the original Bioshock magic it's not really here (except for the DLCs which do take place in Rapture and feel more like the games i knew and loved).\n\nGameplay : The combat is great . Guns are varied and fun , customizable with different upgrades. There's plenty of environmental traps to use , different paths to take and combinations of powers and guns to use. Exploration is rewarded with extra loot , finding little audio recordings that give you insight into more lore , side objectives , etc. Sadly some things seem rushed , in this game you get a companion character (Elizabeth) who follows you around. Sometimes her pathing just gets really janky and she may get stuck unless you \"nudge\" her move. Sometimes she blocks doors and wont move out of the way, one time i actually got the game stuck by accidentally getting between her and a scripted event , causing me to get stuck and the game unable to continue. Then while playing in the DLC I jumped up a small ledge and got myself stuck between two pillars and couldn't escape. So it's got \"those\" problems. Also lack of a map REALLY annoyed me in this game , makes it harder for casual players to explore.\n\nGraphics : The game takes a very different direction in terms of atmosphere and color tone than Bioshocks 1-2 . While Bioshock 1-2 was more dreary , creepy and almost scary , infinite makes everything more bright , even peaceful at times. So if you're looking for that original Bioshock feel , it's kinda.. missing here. It does show up abit later into the game (and for sure in the DLCs!) , but it'll still look nice to anyone who isn't looking for that. However there are also times when you'll see your companion (Elizabeth) glitch out for very brief seconds and look like she's being crumpled up like a paper before returning to normal.\n\nAudio : Alot of problems here. Sound seems broken in this game. Something will sound like it's to my right but i can clearly see it on my left. Ambience cuts in and out when you walk through certain places. Audio lines sometimes overlap (same character saying two different things at once).","timestamp_created":1559798095,"timestamp_updated":1559798095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51073259","author":{"steamid":"76561198810440404","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":652,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":652,"last_played":1559773893},"language":"english","review":"HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE BIOSHOCK GAME (in my opinion).

You cant progress without her. She unlocks doors, she opens portals, she throws you ammo and health packs. The story revolves all around her and she's cute.  I had a blast playing this and the price drops during sales so it is really worth every penny.

Whilst it'll probably say I've played more of this than the other two, due to owning differing copies and getting the remasters that'd be false. The world is okay, the sky world looks pretty and the world fair style is sorta endearing. However it's mostly just pretty and I don't feel as invested as I did in the other games. I don't care as much interestingly about Booker as I do about Bioshock ones protagonist. \n\nEvery character from small to large is sort of just fine. The world feels less fleshed out and the story plainer, though the concepts are a little deeper. Powers and weapons are a major step back and gunplay whilst a little slicker feels like a major step back. The fact you can only carry two weapons over the original 9 or 10 is also a bit plain and means you can only approach situations in a very flat way. The powers equally are way flatter than the others in the series. \n\nI can't call it a bad game. I would say it's worth it on sale, there's more going for it than most games and you'll have a good time... but compared to bioshock 1 and even 2 I find it less enjoyable, though particularly with the former you just can't beat it.","timestamp_created":1559636476,"timestamp_updated":1559636476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51042991","author":{"steamid":"76561198048543122","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1036,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1563204121},"language":"thai","review":"เคยซื้อไปรอบนึงแล้วReFunไปแล้วด้วย ตอนนั้นมันค้างอยู่ตรงหน้า เข้าเกมที่เป็นโลโก้ 2K ไม่รู้จะแก้ยังไง แต่อยากเล่น","timestamp_created":1559632976,"timestamp_updated":1559632976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51042338","author":{"steamid":"76561198339215021","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":438,"last_played":1646421792},"language":"spanish","review":"JUEGASO <3","timestamp_created":1559628685,"timestamp_updated":1559628685,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51042303","author":{"steamid":"76561198156366644","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":601,"last_played":1593164993},"language":"english","review":"Nice game","timestamp_created":1559628473,"timestamp_updated":1559628473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51041266","author":{"steamid":"76561198373103822","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1619630286},"language":"english","review":"Wow!

Но обо всём по порядку.\n -Геймплей\nИгра представляет собой шутер от первого лица с легким налётом RPG механик. У вас есть \"коридор\" (довольно широкий, но всё же коридор) пара пушек и строго определённое количество ботов. Зачистил условную арену - идёшь дальше. Арсенал довольно обширный, но лично я пробегал всю игру с одной винтовкой, лишь изредка меняя оружие во втором слоте. Ах да, с собой носить разрешают только две пушки. \nНе мало важную роль играет наш напарник Элизабет - девушка с сверхъестественными навыками, способная открывать разрывы в пространстве. В этих разрывах могут находиться оружие, полезные для битв элементы окружения и тд. В бою девушка прячется, но бесполезной не становится, то и дело подкинет в пылу битвы патроны или аптечку. С ней также связана интересная механика смерти главного героя. Если ваше здоровье падает до нуля, вы просто теряете сознание, а Элизабет вас откачивает, вы теряете немного денег, противники чуть-чуть восполняют здоровье. И снова в бой. \nДля передвижения по летающему городу Колумбия созданы аэротрассы и аэрокрюк. Последний так и вовсе используется как грозное орудие ближнего боя. А сами аэротрассы вносят динамики в игровой процесс, ведь не только вы можете расстреливать противников катаясь на высоте, оппоненты так же не брезгуют прокатиться прокатиться с ветерком и активно используют воздушные \"дороги\" для обманных маневров. \nСкрасить бои призваны энергетики - аналоги плазмидов из первых частей Bioshock. Однако их в разы меньше чем у своих предшественниц. Игра в принципе сильно отличается от оригинальной Bioshock. Если первая часть серии была рассчитана на вариативний геймплей со способностями главного героя, то Bioshock делает уклон в шутерную механику. Стрелять здесь конечно весело и, что не мало важно, приятно, но это это уже не то погружение в игровой процесс, которое нам предлагала Bioshock 2007 года.\n-Колумбия\nС первого взгляда летающий город поражает своей красотой и необычностью. Главный геймдизайнер Кен Левин и его команда смогла создать нечто иррациональное, но в тоже время понятное для каждого. Антураж Америки начала 20го века был трепетно и качественно перенесен на экраны наших мониторов. Архитектура, агитационные плакаты, разговоры обычных граждан - все это хочется смотреть и слушать, любоваться видами парящих в облаках зданий. Однако это не та игра где сюжет целиком подается через окружение, главную роль играют люди.\n-Персонажи \nИзюминкой этого произведения является, конечно, Элизабет. Разработчики смогли создать её настолько живой, что не хочешь верить что это всего лишь кучка пикселей бегающих по экрану. Тебе хочется верить в каждое ее слово, в каждое движение. Возникает желание услышать как можно больше диалоговых строчек от нее. \nПо ходу истории развивается и характер Элизабет и за этим чертовски интересно наблюдать. А наблюдаем мы глазами Букера ДеВитта, главного героя. Сам протагонист хоть и обладает своим характером, но он всегда как будто озвучивает те же мысли, которые возникают у игрока. Это позволяет ассоциировать себя с ним, разделять его переживания и расти вместе с ним.\n-Сюжет\nО сюжете можно спорить долго. Кто-то увидел в нем историю о людях, кто-то историю о жестокости и предрассудках. Но это ли не отличительная черта искусства. Каждый видит в нем что-то свое, что-то что меняет его. А сюжет Bioshock Infinite именно такой. Это история затрагивает множество тем, и каждая из них найдет отклик в душе каждого. Концовка будоражит сознание и дает пищу для размышлений. Да, она оставляет немало вопросов, но так ли это плохо для такой игры? После прохождения только и хочется, что искать ответы на всяческих форумах, фан-пабликах и главное - у себя в голове.\n \n   В итоге выводы все равно остаются за вами, я лишь могу посоветовать отложить все свои дела, выключить телефон и пройти эту игру. И если вы всё сделали правильно, обещаю, после погружения в мир Колумбии вы вернетесь чуточку другим.","timestamp_created":1559619455,"timestamp_updated":1559639479,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":35,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.784221053123474121","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51040630","author":{"steamid":"76561198093969032","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":840,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":840,"last_played":1559577906},"language":"tchinese","review":"神作","timestamp_created":1559617053,"timestamp_updated":1559617053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51040286","author":{"steamid":"76561198067289914","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":756,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":756,"last_played":1559402755},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo é extremamente lindo!\n\nHistória - 10\nJogabilidade - 10\nGráficos - 10\n\nPORRA, pode comprar você não irá se arrepender, jogo é perfeito!","timestamp_created":1559614511,"timestamp_updated":1559614511,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+ZqRkOsCfoHawgE="}
