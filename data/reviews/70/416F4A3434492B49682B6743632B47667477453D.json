It introduced a fairly streamlined single-player experience with fps combat, some tricky platforming and the occasional puzzle, all wrapped up in a nice physics engine. The complex and simple AI behaviors that were coded are a delight to observe. Foes will flee and regroup to improve their odds, soldiers will reposition and lob grenades with great effect, and cockroaches will flee light sources. If I could highlight the most troubling aspect of this game, I would say that the levels in Xen are a little difficult to navigate. Otherwise, I would say this game is definitely worth the price of admission.","timestamp_created":1547009053,"timestamp_updated":1547009053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559310197830200195","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48197498","author":{"steamid":"76561198126907303","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":682,"last_played":1547445660},"language":"english","review":"I really wanted to like this game. I have heard all about how Half Life is one of the best games ever made, and how people still want a Half Life 3 after all these years, so i decided to give it a try. I can't find myself getting into it though. I will list my main issues, but also give some positive marks because the game still does do some things right.\nThe Negative:\n-While I do agree that this game is fantastic for coming out in 1998, it has not aged particularly well. The gun play feels clunky. I dont mean in the sense of comparing it to a game from 2018, I mean even comparing it Halo: Combat Evolved, a game that came out only a few years later the gunplay feels stiff. I'm not being nostalgia blind in that comparison either since i played that game for the first time in 2015. I honestly feel like the gunfights feel better in Fallout 3, A game that is often critiqued for and known for having pretty bad gun play.\n-The sound design feels... a bit off. I get that black mesa is an underground facility but why does every sound you here while you are inside have so much reverb? I will give it this though, the Assault Rifle sounds great.\n-The controls are good most of the time, but when i want to make precise movements, it feels like i am moving on ice.\n\nThe Positive:\n-The way the game delivers its story through gameplay rather than cutscenes is a cool idea, though i couldnt really get into the story myself.\n-The modding scene for this game is out of this world. If you are like me and you can't really get into the vanilla story, there is nearly an endless supply of fan made content where you can find something you do. You can even get a \"Brutal\" mod that helps to modernize weapon balance, animation and sounds.\n\nIn conclusion this game was good. For 1998 that is. As revolutionary as some of the mechanics this game brought to the table are, I can't overlook its flaws. If you want to see a stepping stone in game technology, or go on a nostalgia trip because you grew up with this game, then go for it, but i personally can't see what all the hype is about. If you want to play a classic FPS that sitll holds up, then try the original DOOM.","timestamp_created":1546994281,"timestamp_updated":1546994574,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.416804611682891846","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48196528","author":{"steamid":"76561198006201515","num_games_owned":364,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":4998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1864,"last_played":1655547349},"language":"english","review":"Damn, that's my favourite game.

De fato, por mais que todos os outros aspectos do jogo continuem tão efetivos quanto no seu lançamento, podemos dizer que os gráficos não entram  exatamente nessa lista,porém, os gráficos não arrúinarão sua experiência com o jogo, e se você estiver á procura de uma experiêencia de  Half-Life com gráficos melhorados, recomendo o remake feito do zero por fãs, Black Mesa (Também disponível na Steam.)\n\n[h1]Jogabilidade.[/h1]\nA jogabilidade de Half-Life é um equilíbrio perfeito entre divertida e desafiante.\nCom controles surpreendentimente funcionais para um jogo originalmente lançado em 1998, O jogo se comporta de forma bizarramente similar á um FPS moderno. O jogo tem você  matando alienígenas e militares e resolvendo quebra cabeças para avançar um enredo contado de forma contínua, ou seja Half-Life não tem cutscenes, nunca tirando  o controle do jogador sobre o protagonista.\n\n[h1]História.[/h1]\nHalf-Life possui uma história engajante, que te faz ficar grudado ao computador por horas querendo saber qual será o próximo acontecimento. Em Half-Life você assume o controle de Gordon Freeman, Um físico teórico formado no MIT em seu primeiro dia  de trabalho, no centro de pesquisa da Black Mesa.

Fora esses, entrtanto, a apresentação continua como era em sua data de lançamento: simples, porém efetiva.\n\n[h1]Veredito[/h1]\nHalf-Life é um jogo que, mesmo tendo 20 anos de idade ainda é um clássico, divertido e engajante,  que deve ser jogado por todo gamer pelo menos uma vez em sua vida\n\n[h1]Nota final:[/h1] [b]9/10![/b]","timestamp_created":1546818195,"timestamp_updated":1546818195,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48156202","author":{"steamid":"76561198297320298","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":723,"last_played":1546979835},"language":"french","review":"Jouez y juste pour votre culture vidéo-ludique, un MUST, la pierre angulaire de tout un genre.","timestamp_created":1546809830,"timestamp_updated":1546809830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48156143","author":{"steamid":"76561198409852165","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":9432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":105,"last_played":1623282933},"language":"english","review":"stongly recomend amazing vriaty of enemies and gore! very good game 10/10","timestamp_created":1546809659,"timestamp_updated":1546809659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48155396","author":{"steamid":"76561198285258290","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":5807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3181,"last_played":1523033691},"language":"english","review":"This game aged surprisingly well.

Хочу сказать, что первый раз я запустил игру из серии \"Half-Life\" в детстве это был пиратский диск «Half-Life Дыхание ксена», но проблема в том, что эта версия шла на двух дисках и по иронии у меня был только один и им оказалась даже не вторая часть, а второй эпизод. Но даже не смотря на это игра мне очень понравилась.\nПосле этой \"нужной \" предыстории можно приступить к обзору.\nЕсли честно не ждал от игры, что то дельное. Начал судить предвзята из-за возраста данного творения(на момент написания обзора эта цифра равна 20).И думал, что потрачу на неё чуть больше 3 часов. Не буду ничего говорить о графике в 1998 она смотрелась восхитительно.\nКак же я ошибался!\nHalf-Life - является чем то невероятным и незабываемым. После первой половины игры ты погружаешься в этот мир с головой и не хочешь покидать его. Мне понравилось многое, а именно сюжет, который прописан от и до и заканчивая геймплеем и механикой игры.

It tells the story with a unique narrative and will always keep you wanting to play till the end. The games weapons are satisfying and fun to use, and in many fast paced situations you're going to have to learn which weapons work best and how to engage a problem properly, Whether its small pesky headcrabs to the more organized HECU forces, meaning tactics are a key. Now some parts of this game got difficult even on easy, but are still doable and this games puzzles never get boring (at least for me). The characters in this game even without any explained backstory still feel real and this game excels at making you feel like you're apart of the whole incident that occurs. This is greately helped by the fact that Gordon Freeman (The character you play as) doesn't talk, meaning that you can put yourself in his shoes alot easier. Another thing to mention is that the AI and their behaviours are very detailed, and though hard to notice, is very very cool (An example is the houndeye's coordinated pack attacks and how they'll actually fall asleep while the pack leader keeps watch)\n\nAs for negative things, the games physics engine while great at the time of its release, is outdated now and pushing objects like crates around can get quite annoying but it doesn't affect the gameplay a whole lot at all. Platforming in this game is a little hard but completely doable and pretty satisfying if you pull it off well. The negative things with this game is very few and insignificant to it's pros.\n\n10/10 and an instant favourite by me","timestamp_created":1546615207,"timestamp_updated":1546994870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48097892","author":{"steamid":"76561198169424508","num_games_owned":316,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":216,"last_played":1585897980},"language":"russian","review":"игра-легенда,проходил в удовольстивем","timestamp_created":1546614337,"timestamp_updated":1546614337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48097635","author":{"steamid":"76561198879170282","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":402,"last_played":1602375151},"language":"english","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1546613576,"timestamp_updated":1546613576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48096967","author":{"steamid":"76561198353470257","num_games_owned":383,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":532,"last_played":1562558340},"language":"english","review":"great game but crack-life is better","timestamp_created":1546611875,"timestamp_updated":1546611875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48096544","author":{"steamid":"76561198095311899","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1036,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1031,"last_played":1593961592},"language":"english","review":"Classic, worth it, especially if you are playing on a potato....","timestamp_created":1546610801,"timestamp_updated":1546610801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48094837","author":{"steamid":"76561198865014701","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":596,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1576418349},"language":"russian","review":"ну что тут говорить о всемирно популярной игре?

Plenty of levels to complete with an all-encompassing genre of FPS, platformers and puzzles. At times the platform aspects can be annoying, but aren’t they all at times, some of the puzzles you have to solve range from easy to just accidentally stumble on the correct solution, but none of this detracts away from the game play.\n\nDid I mention this was 20 years old and a classic, oh yes I did. In addition it is worth checking out the HL community as there are some incredible mods out there to breathe new life in to this game. Overall this is a must have game, a piece of gaming history which still holds its own and has a huge following behind it.\n\nNow where did I leave my glasses, (I am sure I did not need these 20 years ago) as I am about to revisit Half-Life Blue Shift and play as Barney and make up for all the times I left him to die or got him killed during Half-Life.\n","timestamp_created":1546464584,"timestamp_updated":1546464584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48051954","author":{"steamid":"76561198256210298","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1540655762},"language":"turkish","review":"Old But Gold !!!","timestamp_created":1546463080,"timestamp_updated":1546463080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48050841","author":{"steamid":"76561198002201827","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":684,"last_played":1546456511},"language":"czech","review":"Člověk by řekl že tak \"stará\" hra mě nebude bavit ale nostalgie funguje :) opět se naučíte používat tlačítko save, a přemýšlet co udělat aby vás ta blbá hra pustila dál.","timestamp_created":1546459611,"timestamp_updated":1546459611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48049823","author":{"steamid":"76561198419889865","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1547463982},"language":"spanish","review":"UN CLASICO.JPG","timestamp_created":1546457011,"timestamp_updated":1546457011,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48047834","author":{"steamid":"76561198169082921","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":600,"last_played":1657631912},"language":"russian","review":"Игра положившая начало великой серии игр которую будут любить даже сейчас","timestamp_created":1546452038,"timestamp_updated":1606372744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48045035","author":{"steamid":"76561198142298257","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":569,"last_played":1438420700},"language":"russian","review":"пиздатая игра для 1998 года, но на этом всё","timestamp_created":1546445338,"timestamp_updated":1546445338,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.414216727018356323","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48043879","author":{"steamid":"76561198103175440","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1563291987},"language":"english","review":"- Watches video guide \n- Play for 2 minutes\n- Watches video guide \n- Play for 2 minutes \n- .. x100\n\nTotally will watch some guides again :')","timestamp_created":1546442568,"timestamp_updated":1546442568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48040621","author":{"steamid":"76561198068324560","num_games_owned":584,"num_reviews":310,"playtime_forever":733,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":733,"last_played":1546375340},"language":"russian","review":"7 из 10.
