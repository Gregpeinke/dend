It's quite a puzzler, and it allows an enjoyable experience as you listen to the funny dialogue throughout. The co-op is best played with a friend, and it is no doubt a very fun gamemode. To spice it up a bit, there are some community test chambers, as well as a test chamber construction system that allows you to design your own puzzling course. This may be one of my favorite games of all time, and deserves the overwhelmingly positive rating it has. This game was more hyped than Fallout 4, and it promised to deliver an amazing experience.
