So before we jump into this review we must praise our lord and savoir Gabe Newell.\n\nThere are many more good points than I expected there to be for an 7 year old game. The graphics are very good seeing as the age of the game, you could say it's graphically better than some current ones, no offense to developpers who don't focus on the graphical aspect. You get guided along the way with a robot voice called Glados and I must say she has more humor than the most game characters. For example she says \"Your test is almost over and after you\"ll be baked and then there will be cake.\" The humour itself in this game was also very good, the boss level was very entertaining thanks to all the jokes it had and also the ending was pretty ironic because you\"ll be the one eating the cake. The ending song was actually amazing, I'm going to download it some time after writing this review. You can solve the puzzles using companion cubes or normal cubes and using your portal gun. The portal gun has two portals a blue one and an orange one and when you pass through one of them you come out of the other one. The controls are not that hard to understand, I barely changed any to my likings. The puzzles get harder each level but there are many useful checkpoints so it makes it not as bad when you die or get stuck.\n\nThere are a few minor things about this gem but this are just me noticing details while playing along. You can apparantly save when you are dead or about to respawn rather which is not that useful but I accidentally did that when playing. I was dying from drowning in a puzzle and I saved because I wanted to get back another day and it set my checkpoint to that death so it kept respawning me there. I sometime was doubting if I could portal on some wall or floors. There are three colors in this game, walls or floors rather said, those are black, beige and white. But since beige looks a lot like white you weren't sure if you could portal on it.   \n\nI'm doubting still why you are taking time reading this, still thankful though, and not buying this game. Even at full price at this moment it isn't a waste of money and don't mind the gametime as there are many bonusmaps and such which I didn't dig into

Sure, one could beat it in one afternoon, and the game itself doesn't look as pretty as it once did, although it still looks relatively good, but I can assure you, this game is worth every penny. Portal is about as simple as games get, one must traverse through Aperture Science and attempt to not solve each rooms puzzle. The story is very simple, although there is a great twist at the end, and is mostly sidelined to the FANTASTIC gameplay. There is so much variety in this game and every level is just level after level of pure joy. Whether you're not taking fall damage or getting shot at by the adorable turrets, there is just an assortment of video game brilliance to be found in each corner of Portal. As simple and short as this game is, it must be in every gamers' Steam library.
