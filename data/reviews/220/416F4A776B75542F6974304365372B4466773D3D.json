А сам и во вторую не играл. Решил вот сыграть, заоодно и карточки получить, а то несколько лет лежит без дела. И ребят, ей богу затянуло. Достаточно интересный сценарий. Отличное управление, как у самого персонажа, так и управление транспортными средствами. Не хватает порой указателей, не понятно, что делать, 5 минут бегаешь думаешь, а по сути все это быстро нужно делать, что все получалось синхронно. Так вот, затянуло меня так, что прошел все эпизоды. Мне и правда понравилось. Моментами в игре можно отложить пару кирпичеков. Теперь думаю, нужно ли первую часть проходить, когда уже прошел вторую.

A la fin du premier épisode, j'ai ressenti une satisfaction et un \"soulagement\" (avant la scène flippante du G-Man bien sur) tandis que dans le 2, (toujours avant la scène intriquante du G-Man) j'ai eu un bref contentement ( *SPOILER* subitement arrêté par l'explosion *SPOILER*).\n\nEt puis BORDEL DE MERDE, QUEL AMBIANCE!

O forse no. Ma la trama di Half-Life è quella che mi ha coinvolto in maggior modo nel mio epriodo di adolescente. Half-Life 2 è uno di quei pochi sequel di un gioco che ha fatto la storia. Il Source Engine è tutt'ora uno dei motori grafici all'avanguardia. A livello di trama non ho nulla di dire e si completa con i due relativi DLC (Episode 1 ed Episode 2). Il gioco non stanca e l'IA del Source è davvero eccelsa. Non ha fatto un passo indietro dal 1998.\n\nRitornadno ad HL2 la modalità single-player (ovvero la trama) emrita di essere giocata. Il deathmatch di HL2, invece, è un semplice passatempo e i vari server che ci sono cercano di rebndere vivo il gioco anche al termine della campagna principale.

Je vient de finir ce jeu et c'est tout simplement pour moi une immense réussite sur plusieurs facettes. Premièrement, l'histoire qui m'a rattachée et m'a même forcée à jouer plus souvent qu'autrement, il y a quelque chose d'héroïque, de valorisant, et un point sentimental qui pousse à continuer de jouer tête baissée ! Deuxièmement, le moteur du jeu qui est sans contredit un pièce tournante de cette opus, toutes les interactions et les puzzles à franchir ont quasiment un rapport direct avec le nouveau moteur de jeu qui permet un interactivité avec le monde dans lequel on évolue . Par contre selon moi il y a quelque bémol à souligné mais qui ne devraient pas vous faire changer d'avis quant à l'acquisition de ce jeu. Pour ma part je trouve que dans certaines parties il était un peu difficile de se retrouver et de savoir où aller pour progresser, ce qui, pour quelques situations, est très fâchant puisque qu'on se retrouver tué, tué et encore tué sans savoir vraiment quoi faire. De plus, sur une note personnelle, j'ai trouvé que l'histoire se déroulait beaucoup sans les personnages principaux qui manquaient à l'appel dans des situations qui étaient importantes pour le cour de l'histoire. Pour conclure, je pense que Half-Life 2 bien qu'il soit un peu âgé, saura ravir un amateur de FPS qui rechercher un tout nouveau genre de jeu, puisque qu'il est lui-même le précurseur de nombreux FPS moderne qui nous sont proposés.
