This game was the bomb when it came out in 2004 and it is still known as one of the best FPS games on the market but this game has a huge bit of history behind it when Valve finished Half-Life 1 they wanted to make a sequel right away but in 2003 after the E3 showcase of the game an ANON German hacker had leaked the files onto the internet and at the time the game was virtually unplayable. This also leaked some CSS BETA content and TF2 ALPHA content but this was one of the biggest thefts at the time and it will stand out in gaming history for a long time and it will always be with the people that have lived through 2003. Finally in 2004 this game was released to the general public with an outstanding physics engine, astonishing shader detail, a jampacked level editor in the files and daziling facial posing NOW can you see why this game is defined as a classic.

The graphics are fantastic & the areas in the game often have a kind of gritty realism not seen before in a FPS. City 17 is an amazing backdrop for a game not to mention the surrounding areas such as highway 17, the Nova Prospekt prison complex & especially the citadel which is as alien as Xen but portrayed in a much less organic & much more mechanical Manor. On the whole the HL2 world is an amazing contrast of urban/suburban realism, a variety of outdoor locations & cold alien structures. \nHL2 also attempts to build on the character interaction that was revolutionary in the first game. Later in HL2 you will be joined by resistance fighters that form into a small squad that you can control. However you have extremely limited control over this squad. You simply order them to collectively follow you or move to an area that you point out with the crosshair & that's about it. \nEverything in HL2 behaves as you would expect it to in the real world & this really helps to draw you into the HL2 world. No more so then when you are first let loose with the gravity gun. This 'weapon' almost turns the game into a glorified physics engine demo but Valve have managed to implement this device in such a way that it becomes indispensable in your quest as well as an awe inspiring tool for demonstrating the physics engine. \nThe sound in HL2 is a very strong point. Amazing FX, background sounds & music that suits the action & seems to carve a niche of it's own. It's good to see such attention paid to an area which is sometimes overlooked in games & plays second fiddle to the graphics. In HL2 the sound is as important to the feel of the world as the graphics are. Probably some of the best sound I've ever heard in a game. I thought Doom 3's sound was amazing but HL2's is more subtle & as such often more effective.","timestamp_created":1450288079,"timestamp_updated":1450288079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562189042568206787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19731844","author":{"steamid":"76561198102257288","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1064,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":572,"last_played":1454191089},"language":"spanish","review":"Si te gusta quedarte con ganas de una tercera parte, este es tu juego.","timestamp_created":1450282793,"timestamp_updated":1450282793,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19731708","author":{"steamid":"76561198079204174","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1031,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":975,"last_played":1546259195},"language":"english","review":"3/GabeN","timestamp_created":1450282289,"timestamp_updated":1450282289,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19731500","author":{"steamid":"76561198122537872","num_games_owned":353,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":764,"last_played":1438814213},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life 2 - Игра, которую я никогда не забуду.\n\nВ этой игре есть всё!\n- Интересный главный герой\n- Запоминающиеся персонажи\n- Незабываемая атмосфера\n- Загадочная личность (G-Man)\n- Отличный сюжет\n- Хорошая графика\nНет только минусов!\n\nРассказывать про саму игру не вижу смысла, так как каждый в неё играл!

Se echa mucho en falta en muchos juegos modernos esa sensación de inmersión y dificultad, que aun que es un juego lineal muchas veces te encontraras sin saber que camino tomar, y no lo hace frustrante, al contrario, agradeces que no sea como muchas campañas hoy en día que parece que las hacen para tontos. Lo e jugado en dificil, y para mi por lo menos es la dificultad adecuada, para algunas personas a lo mejor es excesiva en algunos puntos de el juego. La historia, una maravilla, si crees que no serias capaz de jugarte el 1 por que los graficos son ancestrales, recomiendo que por lo menos lo intentes, aun así existe un remake, en mod y standalone del Half Life 1 echo con el motor de Source reciente que es muy fiel al juego original y que siempre puedes jugar en vez de el original.
