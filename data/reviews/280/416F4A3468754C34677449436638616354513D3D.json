It was supposed to be a recreation of it in the newer source engine. Unfortunatly though, instead of fully utilising the power of the newer engine valve barely made use of any of the new features and the features they did incorporate eg ragdoll physics were very poorly done. It was also heavily plagued by large amounts of bugs throughout the game. This was supposed to be something amazing but unfortuantly it turned into a massive failure and the backlash from that caused multiple other valve games to not recieve remakes or the remakes were cancelled halfway through, these included team fortress classic and counter strike. Although counter strike luckily did get that proper remake, that we now call Counter Strike: Source. Luckily though for the fans of the original Half Life a proper remake was created but not by valve. Instead it was made by some very very dedicated modders, the remake was originally a free mod by the name of 'Black Mesa' but has now been made into a standalone game. Unfortunatly though the zen levels have not been remade yet but are being worked on by the team o f modders. \n\nI would not reccomend playing this, if you want to play half life then either you can play the original or if you want something newer then try black mesa. \n\nAdditional Notes: I have played this all the way thorugh but my time doesnt reflect it even remotely becuase i lost my time thanks to a glitch/bug","timestamp_created":1452874983,"timestamp_updated":1452874983,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20533045","author":{"steamid":"76561197975749074","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":3236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":321,"last_played":1615910695},"language":"english","review":"that fucking ladder","timestamp_created":1452825449,"timestamp_updated":1452825449,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":14,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469719797372817993","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20530971","author":{"steamid":"76561197993817220","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1391193236},"language":"russian","review":"Игра создана в далеком 1998-ом году и прошло довольно много времени от её выпуска.
