Игра была выпущена для демонстрации новых технических возможностей (преимущественно High Dynamic Range) обновленного графического движка Source, которых не было в Half-Life 2. Уровень игры был создан с уклоном на окружение, способное наиболее качественно продемонстрировать возможности данной технологии. Также Lost Coast является первой игрой Valve со встроенными комментариями разработчиков (подробности вы найдете ниже), позднее их стали добавлять во все одиночные игры компании (в отличие от Lost Coast, в полномасштабных играх вроде Portal комментарии доступны только в специальном режиме прохождения).\n\nГордон Фримен, бессменный герой обеих частей Half-Life, приходит в сознание на берегу моря, неподалёку от прибрежного посёлка Святой Ольги.
