Invece devo dire che questo gioco mi ha veramente divertito, anche se il finale è molto confuso e non ti fa capire nulla della trama. La cosa che mi fa strappare un enorme sorriso è il doppiaggio italiano che, anche se fatto veramente tanto male e i doppiatori non sapevano recitare, mi faceva divertire. La cosa che mi ha divertito di più di questo gioco è la fisica che ti permette di uccidere i nemici con l'ambiente. Per esempio puoi usare la pistola gravitazionale (che ti permette di prendere oggetti e lanciarli) per prendere una lama da terra e lanciarla contro i nemici per dividerli a metà. In più la pistola gravitazionale può essere usata anche per prendere un'arma o delle munizioni. Una cosa che mi ha dato veramente fastidio e che puoi prendere pochissime munizioni per arma. Esempio: Il f ucile dei Combine può tenere 90 proiettili per un totale di tre caricatori e fidatevi, li finite veramente in fretta. Un'altra cosa che mi dà abbastanza fastidio è che la pistola non serve veramente a nulla dato che toglie veramente pochissimo. La utilizzerete per i primi livelli ma dopo che prendete altre 2/3 armi non la userete mai più. Sinceramente potevano fare un'altra arma che utilizzava gli stessi proiettili della pistola, proprio come nel primo Half-Life. \n\nVoto: 7/10\n\n\"Abbastanza divertente ma confusionale\"","timestamp_created":1590933703,"timestamp_updated":1639022650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47999998927116394","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70095614","author":{"steamid":"76561198031663814","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":1998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1965,"last_played":1658325470},"language":"english","review":"Even after 13 years, this game is fantastic.

I played the original on release and liked it a lot, but always big on lost causes as I am, I boycotted the sequel because of Steam. Which I considered the mother of all evil at the time. Aside from a brief stint on some net cafe, I steered clear for years. Now, long after the end of the world didn't come because of Steam and Half-Life 2 was crowned \"game of the decade\", I thought it's time to finally give Half-Life 2 a proper shot and see how it holds up, if it can attract new audience and if all that hype is justified.\n\nThe introduction, in typical Half-Life fashion, is long and totally overindulgent. These days, perhaps a bit too much. Drawn-out sequences like the intro exist later in the game also, but they are more tolerable because by then you are committed, this early on they really need a hook. I suppose back in the day that was the visuals, people would have been awed to see the city. Not so much these days. Going through it, I just couldn't wait to suit up, get my trusty crowbar and start cracking heads. To be fair, the story part of the introduction remains very effective, even if the lustre of the visuals has faded. The main characters quickly show how likeable they are, the environment is full of narrative detail, the game's world successfully captivates you.\n\nThe premise is simple. A few decades after the events of the original game, Gordon Freeman returns to an Earth under a brutal occupation. This Gordon is now a messianic figure, his deeds shrouded in myth, a paragon of freedom. Such is his fame, that his mere presence is enough to ignite a revolution. Now Gordon is definitely a badass, but this reputation is not exactly earned. Considering the nature of his dealings with G-Man it's rather ironic in fact. The game recognizes that, subtly poking fun at just how quick people are to praise Gordon. It is surprising how successful this approach is in investing the player. It makes you want to prove the legend true, go above and beyond for all those people naively placing their faith for a better tomorrow squarely at your feet. Point Half-Life 2.\n\nGameplay wise the game is fairly solid. It has an interesting array of weapons and enemies. Though perhaps it could do with less companions blocking your way. Much has been made about this game's focus on physics. I can't say I had no complaints here either, the physics engine has clearly aged. Things that should be smooth aren't, like going through the revolving door early in the game. You will often find yourself getting stuck for no proper reason and there are bugs, like that one time my buggy sunk in a building and wouldn't stop rotating half in and half out, forcing me to load an earlier save. Yet the gameplay remains for the most part very entertaining and physics are a huge part of it, continuously providing with creative ways to overcome obstacles. Be it enemies, or puzzles.\n\nGraphically speaking there isn't much to complain about. I have a hard time believing this game is old enough to drive. Facial animations in particular caught my attention. The game doesn't flaunt it but it has some really good ones. Audio is satisfying and the music, though quite understated has some very memorable moments. The game's world design is also worth of note. The areas are quite expansive, for its time that must have been quite the shocker. You spend much of the first half of the game travelling outside the city, using vehicles. The trip provides for an interesting change of pace. The areas have a fair amount of variety too. There is a \"horror\" area filled with zombies and even an alien citadel. I guess, the game could have skipped some of the sewers though.\n\nPlaying Half-Life 2, even after all these year, you can tell the game was groundbreaking and you can recognize its influence. Though it has aged, it remains perfectly serviceable. If someone hasn't played it before and is afraid the game might have gone stale, there is nothing to worry about. Does it deserve the hype? Well I'm not sure really. Its influence has definitely placed this game on a pedestal, perhaps like Gordon's in-game fame, all this praise is not entirely deserved. Nevertheless, best game ever or not, this remains a great FPS and I do recommend it.","timestamp_created":1590800006,"timestamp_updated":1590806364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.661140084266662598","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70018028","author":{"steamid":"76561198026988949","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":607,"last_played":1592520158},"language":"english","review":"excellent","timestamp_created":1590797746,"timestamp_updated":1590797746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70017958","author":{"steamid":"76561198089847935","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":1230,"playtime_last_two_weeks":14,"playtime_at_review":903,"last_played":1660032671},"language":"english","review":"Master Piece.","timestamp_created":1590797582,"timestamp_updated":1590797582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70017361","author":{"steamid":"76561198298264883","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":888,"last_played":1509283337},"language":"turkish","review":"===[ Hitap Ettiği Kesim: ]===\n☐ Küçükler\n☑ Herkes\n☐ Yetişkin\n☐ Ortalama Oyuncu\n☐ Hardcore Oyuncu\n===[ ☼ Grafikler: ]===\n☐ Patates\n☐ Leş atıyor\n☐ Kötü\n☐ Meh...\n☑ Güzel\n☐ Süper\n☐ Fevkaladenin fevkinde\n\n===[ $ Fiyat/Performans: ]===\n☑ Parasını hakediyor\n☑ İndirim için bekle\n☐ Param var, oyunum yok\n☐ İade edebiliyorsan et\n☐ Sakın alma\n☐ Beleş\n\n===[ ☢ Sistem Gereksinimleri: ]===\n☐ 90'lar dan kalma emektar bile açar\n☐ Tost makinesi\n☑ Orta bi pc\n☐ İyi pc\n☐ İyi ekran kartı ve işlemci ister\n☐ NASA pc'si ister\n\n===[ ☼ Zorluk: ]===\n☐ İki kol yeter\n☑ Ez\n☐ Öğrenmesi kolay / Pro'su olmak zaman ister\n☐ Zor\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n===[ ۞ Oynanış süresi/uzunluk ]===\n☐ Bayağı kısa ( 0 - 4 saat)\n☐ Kısa ( 4 - 10 saat)\n☑ İdare eder ( 10 - 20 saat)\n☐ Uzun ( 20+ saat)\n☐ Sonsuz\n\n===[ ⌬ Hikaye] ===\n☐ Yok öyle bir şey\n☐ Arka Sokaklar'dan hallice\n☐ Orta\n☐ İyi\n☑ Mükemmel\n\n===[ § Bug ]===\n☐ Oyunun kendisi bug\n☐ Buglar oynarken rahatsız ediyor\n☐ Buglar var\n☐ Biraz Bug var\n☑  Tatlı buglar var.
