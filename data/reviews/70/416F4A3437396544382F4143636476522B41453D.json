OpFor is especially recommended for its stellar gameplay.\n\nI would also recommend getting the mod version of 'Half-Life: Decay' from ModDB as an add-on.

We’ve had 20 years of games come out after this, and with that much hindsight I can say with a straight face, this game is not as good as people make it out to be.\n\nLet’s get the easy stuff out of the way first, guns. The gun play is fantastic but shows it’s age, the animations are overly exaggerated and the damage doesn’t always make sense. The shotgun and assault rifle feel very underwhelming and inconsistent, sometimes needing more bullets to kill enemies than the base pistol. The distance you can throw grenades feels very short but the damage they deal seems adequate. The only weapon I actually find overpowered is the revolver; when your pistol can one shot an enemy that would normally take 4-6 rifle shots, it may be a little broken.\n\nThe beginning of the game, while possibly being great when it first came out, now feels drawn out and extremely annoying. If you don’t pay attention to the minute details of the markings on the walls, even getting your H.E.V suit and starting the game can be confusing. The dialogue of the game takes far to long to get the point across, and makes the game move at a snails pace.\n\nWith the dialogue the way it is, it causes a major problem. The story is already a convoluted and confusing mess, unless you listen to absolutely every second of dialogue; and listening to the dialogue takes annoying amounts of time causing the story to stall, and become dull. There’s a lot of the story that isn’t elaborated on and confuses me; like why the military instantly starts shooting you when the last thing you were told was that they were on their way to save you.\n\nThe textures of this game did not age well at all, and nor did the lighting. A lot of the poor textures add to the difficulty of some puzzles. The bad lighting only really hurts the maneuverability of vents which doesn’t amount to a lot, but when it does you can really notice it. A lot of the puzzles are easy enough to solve, only a few causing me to spend more than a few minutes on them. I did get stuck at multiple points in the game due to poor checkpoints, the game not saving on chapters or loading screens, and pure stupidity on my part.\n\nGetting through the puzzles and into the actual story, it is excruciatingly long. It took me over 10 hours, from start to finish to complete the game (on easy, mind you). When the military starts to intervene they kinda just forget to tell you what to do from there on out, and make you figure it out yourself. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind having to figure out what to do next, or where to go next, but in this game it gets really annoying.\n\nThere’s a section with a giant fan in the Chapter Blast Pit, that is probably what tripped me up the most, causing me to have to completely restart the game. It’s nowhere near obvious enough as to what you’re supposed to do, having multiple platforms that make you think you’re supposed to go through them instead of straight up. There’s also a fall in the same chapter; where a large pipe that you’re walking through collapses and is near impossible to beat if you have less than 100 HP.\n\nAs you’re making your way top side in the Chapter Apprehension, for some reason there are ninja’s? This is never elaborated on, it’s just out of nowhere and completely baffling. This leads into a confusing laser level that literally finished itself for me; the door opened extremely early without me having to finish the puzzle, causing me to waste time on said laser puzzle. Once outside I got stuck with 1 hp against multiple military personnel causing nearly a half-an-hour of frustrated Quick Saving and Quick Loading. In the later game before Xen there’s an Overpowered tank that took me a few minutes to get around. That coupled with the lack of health packs is a real detriment to how fun it is, not to mention the snipers that can some how shoot you from around a corner.\n\nAfter entering Xen I got lost for about 20 minutes because of how un-obvious the way to progress was. I played through the ending as normal in a nice cycle of; getting lost for a while before progressing.\n\nAfter finally getting to the Nihilanth I quickly destroyed all the Crystals needed before getting stuck in an almost endless 40 minute loop of; attack, show brain thing, die to stray laser beam. OVER AND OVER AGAIN for 40 minutes.\n\nHalf-Life is not a fun game, it is definitely a mentally challenging game. It sits in this weird Limbo in my mind, because I enjoyed it more than Half-Life 2, but it holds absolutely no candle to it’s sister series Portal. I will not criticize all the bugs, or the textures because the game is 20 years old, but I do not think this game is worthy of the 96 that it has on Metacritic. It’s story is odd, and feels like an after thought, having possibly made levels before thinking about how they line up, or join together. In saying this, I am excited for Black Mesa and plan to play it.\n\n7/10 – Now that I’ve beat it, I probably won’t play it again.","timestamp_created":1584552366,"timestamp_updated":1584552366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65276461","author":{"steamid":"76561198342809516","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1757,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1655228813},"language":"turkish","review":"Çok Güzel Bir Oyun Herkese Tavsiye Ederim.","timestamp_created":1584547369,"timestamp_updated":1584547369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65276086","author":{"steamid":"76561198812561124","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":356,"last_played":1592493433},"language":"turkish","review":".","timestamp_created":1584546926,"timestamp_updated":1584546926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65274734","author":{"steamid":"76561198128063353","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":400,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":400,"last_played":1566370872},"language":"polish","review":"Może i to stara gra ale dalej może spodobać się pewnym osobom!

I know that a lot of I watch like gmanlives and Yatzhee has sung this games praise, but what someone who’s never played it before? Would it hold up to the test of time like Strife or would age and standards hamper the experience like Shadow Warrior. Only one way to find out.\n\nAnd just to be clear, I’m playing the original game. Not the fan remake Black Mesa or any port. Just the standard, classic version you can get on Steam. Want to have that retro experience.\n\nStory:\n\nYou play as Gorden Freeman. Inter-dimensional space criminal, wanted on over 100 worlds that has taken refuge on Earth. As he hide in plain sight, planing his workplace massacre, a freak accident leads the space police to him and and will tear the whole facility apart to find him. Now armed with a crowbar, a hazard suit and a thirst for blood, Freeman must escape the police while leaving a massive trail of blood in his wake.\n\nWhat? What do you mean that’s not the plot of Half-life. I mean Gorden Freeman is just an audience surrogate so he can whatever the player wants and I want him to be a psychopath cause that makes me laugh. I know this game was a step up for interactive storytelling at the time but maybe I’ve been spoiled by newer games and it feels bland and empty. I also think it might have been better if it was possible to skip the opening and head straight to the first real level as there’s nothing really happening in the first ten minutes.\n\nGameplay:\n\nFirst of all: Configure your controls. I was stuck in the opening as I couldn’t press the button for the hazmat suit since it wasn’t set up. You’ll also need to configure the flashlight as their are numerous vents that are pitch black. And if you’re using a controller like me or even if you’re not, you may want to make sure you;re crouch and jump buttons are next to each other as you’ll need to press them at the same time to perform a long jump near the end of the game.\n\nNow that we got the annoying control issues out of the way, let’s, talk, game. As this a FPS lets talk about that first and it works. The weapons work will, the shotgun is good at close range, crossbow works as sniper rifles and the crowbar losses it’s effectiveness when you get a gun. Seems lacking now when I think about it.\n\nThe enemies however are pretty cool like their are guys that shoot lightning, giant fish in the few water sections, ceilings traps with their tongues hanging all the  way down to the floor, giant brutes that shoot bees like bullets and crabs that can die in a fire. And as for the army, while their machine-guns can be annoying and almost always appear in groups, they don’t appear in every level so they aren’t a constant pain. As for enemies that did bug me, there the ninja as they were hitscanners that were fast but they only appear in two levels, and most of the boss fights.\n\nThese bosses. In theory, I should love these things as I tend to have an issue with a boss that’s just use you’re biggest weapons and for the most part, these fights tend to be more obstacles you can’t win in a fight do you have to avoid them somehow. Take the helicopter at the start of Surface Tension for example: you  need to go trough a some clearings like a minefield and a section with a tentacle till you get to the cliffs and get the rocket launcher so you can kill it. The issue however is that this guy has hitscan weapons and can hit you even you’re hiding behind cover, making it a nuisance till the real fight. And the other bosses have issues that ruin the experience for me like the sections for the tentacle fight being blocked by planks or the baby headcrabs that are impossible to see. The only bosses I enjoyed were the big bug guys as they tend to be more of lure them to traps to get rid of them so they don’t become an issue.\n\nBut that’s only the shooting. There is another aspect of this game and thats platformer. Now I was expecting to hate this cause FPS and platforming don’t mix but to my surprise it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be since for the most part, the ledges are big enough to jump on without issue with the only real issues being having to duck as you jump to get on higher boxes and fall damage. Does this mean that it was not as bad as people make it to be? No. There are issues with the platformer, mainly with ledges. One of the earlier platform involves you climbing up an elevator shaft and one slip up could kill you. And it ends with climbing a ladder and it’s like running up a wall and easily fall off.\n\nAt least this game has auto save so if there is a game breaking bug, you can just reload a previous save to proceed like an NPC not opening a door after clearing a room or the mother headcrab not proceeding to the final phase of her boss fight.\n\nPresentation:\n\nI got nothing. Music is few and far between, voice acting is decent but not good qualty for the scientists and guards but awful for the army. And Black Mesa just looks like a boring warehouse. I did thought Xen look pretty cool. Looked like skin with hair as pillars.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThis game is like the perfect middle ground between Quake 1 and 2 as it’s both a fun linear experience and takes it time.\n\n7/10","timestamp_created":1584471281,"timestamp_updated":1584471281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490936577320098877","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65223837","author":{"steamid":"76561198814459306","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":26536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1481,"playtime_at_review":1456,"last_played":1660559599},"language":"english","review":"it
