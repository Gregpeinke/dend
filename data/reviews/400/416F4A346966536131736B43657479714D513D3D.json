Many of Portal's levels are difficult (especially the bonus levels), but there is immense satisfaction after competing challenging levels.  Portal also includes a complex and mysterious story with ties to Valve's Half Life universe. Portal's atmosphere in-game does a great job at making the user feel as if they are alone and isolated from any human activity.  Portal's story and exceptional gameplay combine to make a remarkable video game. Portal does feature a remarkably short campaign, but it is made up redeeming qualities like the well written story and original game mechanics. Portal is a great video game that is definitely worth a purchase.","timestamp_created":1416527929,"timestamp_updated":1641609943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470873177051544189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13020507","author":{"steamid":"76561198148089947","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":305,"last_played":1594140216},"language":"spanish","review":"Una experiencia nunca antes experimentada.","timestamp_created":1416518758,"timestamp_updated":1416518758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13010509","author":{"steamid":"76561198146810890","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":958,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":958,"last_played":1413253869},"language":"english","review":"Is this a good game?
