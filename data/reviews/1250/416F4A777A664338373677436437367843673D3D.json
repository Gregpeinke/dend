People with hundreds of hours play said it still wasn't hard enough so they buffed the monsters. People then complained that getting butchered on wave 1 of easy wasn't fun, so they added DLC that allows you compete - for a price.\n\nWhat started off as a fun co-op game now relies on you being level 6 in all skills and bullet count, otherwise you're voted off and the entire team dies - apart from the guy no-scoping from a glitch point.\n\nIf you're wondering whether this is sour grapes, how many other games do you know where the explosives expert is used for killing trash and the melee guy has to crouch to hit the other melee units?\n\nWas a great game - now just ruled by \"ITS NOT HARD ENUF YET!\"","timestamp_created":1292234228,"timestamp_updated":1413533758,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2722791","author":{"steamid":"76561198011647032","num_games_owned":12094,"num_reviews":854,"playtime_forever":29982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24426,"last_played":1505637626},"language":"english","review":"If you loved left for dead then this game is for you. There is a lot of customizability in this game where you get to choose your own weapons and what you look like. There are times in the game where I get so scared of being alone I freak out and jump around crazy. The graphics are amazing, it really puts you in depth in the game. The sounds in the game really freak me out. it is a very addicting game to play. The online community is very active. If you want to practice there is a single player mode but you don't get the same effects like you would in online play. A must-have for any zombie lovers!!","timestamp_created":1292230690,"timestamp_updated":1292230690,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzfC876wCd76xCg=="}
