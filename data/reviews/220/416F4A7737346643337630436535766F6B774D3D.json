Не смотря на свой возраст она до сих пор держит высокую планку качества.\n\nИгра является продолжением первой части. Спустя несколько лет, G-man вовращает Гордона из стазиса, решив его использовать в своих целях. За время отсутствия Фримена, прошли довольно глобальные изменения в мире. Планета была захвачена могущественной инопланетной организацией, именуемой Советом Альянса. Большиство людей, стали жертвами и рабами захватчиков, однако были и те кто пытался сопротивлятся. Небольшие отряды повстанцев, не теряли надежду спастись и вернуть Землю обратно. Роль главного повстанца сыграет бывшый сотрудник научного комлекса Black Mesa.\n\nПервое, что на тот момент бросалось в глаза, это новый движок Source. Помимо прекрасной графики, крутой анимации, движок имел отличную техническую составляющую. Большая качественная работа была проведена с физикой. Все предметы, оружие, техника, повинуются физике, с учётом их массы, трения и силы тяжести. На этой основе сделано немало различных простеньких головоломок.\n\nТем не менее игра является классическим представителем жанра шутер от первого лица. Так же игра сохранила все классические традиции первой части. К примеру за действиями игры, мы наблюдаем исключительно из глаз главного героя, без каких то видео-вставок или разрыве во времени. Так же Гордон Фримен молчит на протяжении всей игры. Ну и конечно загадка серии номер один, таинственый человек в костюме с кейсом.\n\nПо части геймплея, игра нам предлагает куда больше разноообразия нежели первый HL. И если в первом, место действия в основном проходило на територрии научного комплекса в пустыне, где большую часть времени, игрок проводил в стенах лаборатории, то во второй части, разнообразие локаций на порядок выше. Захваченый, полуразрушенный город восточной европы, побережье, мрачный атмосферный городок Рейвенхольм, тюрьма, огромная Цитадель. Все эти места помимо всего прочего, красиво воссозданы, а в некоторых прекрасно передана атмосфера(Рейвенхольм).\n\nЕсли в первой части основными противника были инопланетные существа, в перемешку с солдатами, посланными на зачистку лаборатории, то во второй таковыми являются солдаты Альянса. Сражениям с зомби и другими существами уделено куда меньше времени. Тем не менее игра постоянно держит в напряжении, а качественно поданый геймплей и продуманный сюжет мотивируют играть не прерываясь, до самого конца.\n\nКроме основной геймплейной составляющей игры, а именно перестрелки с врагами и убийство мутантов, игра так же предлагает нам и другие развлечения. Часто встречаются не сложные, однако вполне продуманые логические задачки, нам дадут возможность покататся на багги по побережью и на воздушной подушке по каналам города.\n\nВ игре не много оружия, однако представленных экземпляров вполне хватает, для того чтобы устроить настоящий беспредел на улицах Сити 17. Хотя модели оружия другие, однако типы и виды остались такими же.  Главным нововведением стала Грави-пушка, которая полностью заменяет все функции ломика. Теперь один из символов Half-Life, стал самым бесполезным предметом в инвентаре Гордона.\n\nНесмотря на то, что большую часть игры прийдется ходить в одиночестве, и сражаться с врагами собственными силами, во второй части у нас будут союзники. Это некоторые повстанцы, Аликс и её Пёс, и даже Муравьиные львы. Сам же AI был намного лучше проработан. Как враги так и союзники вели себя вполне адекватно. Редко когда замечал баги или какие то проблемы с этим.\n","timestamp_created":1639780580,"timestamp_updated":1639780580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105999719","author":{"steamid":"76561198968801473","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":678,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":678,"last_played":1630493401},"language":"russian","review":"попробуй заговори","timestamp_created":1639779570,"timestamp_updated":1639779570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105998117","author":{"steamid":"76561198282868776","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":126,"playtime_forever":13511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":359,"playtime_at_review":1430,"last_played":1660590522},"language":"turkish","review":"23 saaat oynadım oyunu çook zevkli tavsiye ederim","timestamp_created":1639777262,"timestamp_updated":1639777262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105997916","author":{"steamid":"76561198861919595","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1058,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":769,"last_played":1657908840},"language":"english","review":"hands down one of the greatest stories ever told - video game or not, half life is an experience of a lifetime.","timestamp_created":1639776995,"timestamp_updated":1639776995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105997771","author":{"steamid":"76561198935856436","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1113,"last_played":1655653343},"language":"english","review":"this game is amazing, its the longest HL game ( i think )","timestamp_created":1639776817,"timestamp_updated":1639776817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105997386","author":{"steamid":"76561198374709878","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1049,"last_played":1641319131},"language":"russian","review":"Одна из самых лучших игр в моей жизни","timestamp_created":1639776335,"timestamp_updated":1639776335,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105997135","author":{"steamid":"76561199199553418","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2074,"playtime_last_two_weeks":91,"playtime_at_review":524,"last_played":1659565249},"language":"english","review":"Bread","timestamp_created":1639775991,"timestamp_updated":1639775991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105996295","author":{"steamid":"76561199140659599","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1641571238},"language":"latam","review":"A","timestamp_created":1639774895,"timestamp_updated":1639774895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105995535","author":{"steamid":"76561199217102212","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60,"last_played":1652126840},"language":"russian","review":"Немного поностальгировал и решил пройти нестандартно...

Играя в Half-Life, мы не просто переносимся в Сити-17 и смотрим глазами талантливого физика, мы становимся Гордоном. Мы переживаем то же, что и он (правда, он молча всё это делает).\nАтмосфера – ещё одна ступень к вершине славы Халфлайфа.

You resume the role of Gordon Freeman from the first game and arrive in a larger world outside of Black Mesa – City 17. The game uses some fantastic environmental storytelling sessions like the open sequence to introduce the world, and they do a brilliant job to show the suppressed vibe of City 17. I enjoy the narrative a lot, but the story is nothing to write home about as it is basically just a blockbuster story with some mysteries unexplained. What is important about it (especially the first game) is it changed the common belief in the game industry at that time, when people thought a story in a shooter is as important as a story in porn. Anyway, because of how they left things in a cliffhanger in Half-Life 2 Episode 2, now I really need Half-Life 3.\n\nDespite being almost two decades old, the graphics look good. Given how other games at that period all used brown color tone making them not age well, you got to appreciate the advanced graphics design they went for, which makes the game look timeless. As for the sound design, there are some good but brief music pieces in different sessions of the game. The sound of SMG is too loud and there is no way to adjust it, but the sound of reloading shotgun is like ASMR and very pleasant to the ears.\n\nIn terms of level design, it is fine, yet not as impressive as the first game, in spite of it getting rid of annoying levels like the platforming sessions in Xen. In the first game, combat usually happens in large and open levels, while this game has larger and more open maps, combat, however, tends to follow a linear structure (not all levels of course) - you don’t need to traverse back and forth within a level, just follow the path and mow down everyone on your way, which probably why I feel the level design is less memorable and more generic. It has less enemy variety and the difficulty is not as challenging, which may also contribute to it. Half-Life Episode 2 has pretty good level design though, as each level has distinct features of its own. Also, puzzle design blends in the levels naturally, usually in the way that you need to find hidden paths to process (can be tricky sometimes). But as someone who got spoiled by the navigation in modern games, I do wish the game had waypoints as I was often confused not knowing where to go or what to do and it took a while until I figured it out.\n\nDue to the old technology, the game will freeze for a while in each save point, which doesn’t feel good. The game also has the same control issue as the first game – even you stop, the character will slip for a short distance. Fortunately, the game has much less platforming so it is not as a pain in the butt as in the first game. What is a new issue though is the AI teammates keep getting in your way in narrow places. These things are tiny but can be annoying at times.\n\nI personally like the first game better because the level design is more fun, despite the platforming in that game can be totally infuriating. But Half-Life 2 is more fluid and less frustrating by comparison and a very solid experience overall as a big step up from the first game in almost every aspect. You should try both games if you have the mood and time.","timestamp_created":1639697428,"timestamp_updated":1639697428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105945080","author":{"steamid":"76561198799639208","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":3685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":283,"playtime_at_review":1720,"last_played":1660332889},"language":"english","review":"fantastic game","timestamp_created":1639696356,"timestamp_updated":1639696356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105944055","author":{"steamid":"76561198037932709","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":988,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":635,"last_played":1656259946},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito legal apesar de ser antigo e muito bem feito","timestamp_created":1639694653,"timestamp_updated":1639694653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105942930","author":{"steamid":"76561199056898273","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":576,"last_played":1659891587},"language":"english","review":"Small but fum\n","timestamp_created":1639692896,"timestamp_updated":1639692896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105939325","author":{"steamid":"76561198333879990","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":579,"last_played":1639690429},"language":"english","review":"PLAY IT NOWW\nXD","timestamp_created":1639687650,"timestamp_updated":1639687650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105937359","author":{"steamid":"76561198127849555","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":841,"last_played":1657216555},"language":"english","review":"One of the greatest, graphics and gameplay still hold up to this day.
