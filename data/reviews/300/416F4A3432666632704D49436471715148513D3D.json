I'm not aware at all of how the original Day of Defeat fared, as I never played it, therefore I can't make a proper comparison between the two.\n\nWhat I can talk about though, is obviously Day of Defeat: Source, having played it quite a bit and having fun with it. The game is set in WW2, and while a lot of games are set in WW2, nowadays with the massive trend of current and near future FPSes lately, it is remarkably a refreshing change.\n\nSource obviously made the maps and models look much better than the original game. They still hold up quite well nowadays, much like Source itself in any case, so for most people there won't be much of a problem when it comes to graphical fidelity.\n\nWhile I don't know how the gameplay in the original DoD was like, if it was anything like CS 1.6 to CS: Source, it may have ruffled a few feathers on the original DoD community upon DoD: Source's release. Or maybe it didn't, because of the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is most definitely this game's strong point by a long shot. There are several classes to pick from, varied enough to justify their presence in the game, and fully suit the setting, just like the various weapons you have. The shooting feels good, just like most of the FPSes in Source.\n\nUnfortunately, it suffers from not having a whole lot of variety to it, both in game modes and in maps. And by now, there are naturally also other FPSes set in WW2 that feel and play a lot better than DoD: Source. There's still a community present, so you should have no difficulties jumping into a multiplayer game however.\n\nI would get this game. It's cheap and can be an enjoyable and refreshing game experience once in a while. Plus it's a Valve game, and those come with a lot of obvious perks. (Garry's Mod models being an example) Just don't expect too much out of it.","timestamp_created":1385560571,"timestamp_updated":1385560571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":76,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.78888392448425293","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7781430","author":{"steamid":"76561198030291733","num_games_owned":804,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":103,"last_played":1443286586},"language":"english","review":"A very fun game to shoot people down and from time to time, it hardly dosen't even feel like CSS so go buy this if you wanna shoot something as well as get materials for Gmod!","timestamp_created":1385539229,"timestamp_updated":1385539229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584911525249481201","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7779673","author":{"steamid":"76561198062504280","num_games_owned":298,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1620,"last_played":1540079214},"language":"english","review":"this game is best n/a\nif you dont buy this ur gey","timestamp_created":1385525749,"timestamp_updated":1386039996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49692043662071228","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7777703","author":{"steamid":"76561198004553723","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":12662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11821,"last_played":1601184271},"language":"english","review":"I like playing around with the mg and shaotin` people till` they start getting mad and quiting which is also known as \"RAGEQUIT\".

Ибо только лишь с живыми людьми играя есть возможность получить всю полноту ощущений, почувствовать драйв от игрушки. Никаких графических изысков в игрушке нет, как таковые они здесь и не нужны.

It starting out as a Half-Life Mod is one of Valves lesser known titles. I really enjoyed this game and still do, I hope the online communtiy can get as many players as it used too. It's game that is too good to be put down, it really stands out for me. Not only does it offer strategic gameplay,intense FPS skills, and overall replaybility, but it offers a almost immersive enviroment that I've spent some of my best gaming experinces in. I don't want to see this game die, and I hope it will become popular again.","timestamp_created":1384218607,"timestamp_updated":1384218607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42ff2pMICdqqQHQ=="}
