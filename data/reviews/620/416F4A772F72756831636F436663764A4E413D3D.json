Вся игра проходит по схеме: поставил один портал, поставил другой портал, прошел через него, оставил один портал, поставил другой портал, прошел через него, и так далее. Уверен, это связано с тем, что игра вышла, в том числе, и на консолях. Хоть в игру и были добавлены гели, но все загадки и головоломки были относительно просты. Еще один момент, который мне не понравился: в русской озвучке голос Кейва Джонсона (основателя Aperture) в аудиозаписях никак не меняется по мере прохождения игры и старения самого Джонсона.

when the end leaves open alot of questions.\n\nThe Developer comments are also quite interestning and the workshop content is really good too.\n\nThe amounts of secrets and easter eggs is great.\nThe Multiplayer also is a really nice thing and it features a looong playtime and a lot of fun.\n\nAlso funnily enough this game was the main reason i got Steam and a
