I do plan to eventually take the time to finish the game, but currently my interest lies with good video games. There, I said it. In my personal opinion, Half-Life 2 is a hot mess of a video game that is extremely overrated and brings virtually nothing new to the table.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about what it does bring to the table: a semi-complex physics engine. While this sounds cool and revolutionary, all it really does is let you use a gun that shoots random objects in the world at people. Whoop dee frickin doo. Sure, the gun might be a cool gimmick, but the engine isn't really anything special, even for 2004 standards. And for some reason everyone praises the engine in HL2, when dare I say it that Windwaker, a console game (gasp), made better use of physics throughout its game with wind of all things, and like two years earlier.\n\nStory. It's pretty meh. Now before I get criticized about criticizing the story even though I haven't finished it, take a minute to compare the opening of Half-Life 2 to the original Half-Life. The first game introduces you to people in the lab, not characters with names, but just people (this is important). It then introduces you to your equipment and tells you what the H.E.V. suit does. This is a good way of foreshadowing the player about what they will face in the game. It then has you do something that triggers all of the problems, and you're immediatly in the action and people are dying and you have to escape. On the other hand, in Half-Life 2 you have a similar opening, but this time you are introduced to the world, which is pretty cool. Going through, you have no real control about the events leading to your escape, and when you do, you are introduced to a character with a name (this is important). You go through the entire escape, and are out in the real game on a boat. Now that we've examined the way both games open, let's talk about why the opener in the first Half-Life is much better in relation to the entire game and story: the people. Characters are mostly nameless, and as a result everyone you come across is someone that you want to keep alive, and you feel guilty when you see people die. In Half-Life 2 on the other hand, you are introduced to named characters who are immediatly taken away from you. You are introduced to a story which is immediatly taken away from you. When you bump into regular people, if they die, they die. They weren't important to the story because they didn't have a name.\n\nGamepley. It's the same level as the original game, which is not a good thing. I would've expected some improvement, seeing as how it's 2004 and not 1998. I can forgive the first game, because it was the first true 3D shooter and they were still trying to figure out how to make a game like it work. For a second game released in 2004, however, I cannot forgive it. It feels like I'm skating around the place, which is really annoying because everyone else looks like they walk around pretty normally. Guns are pretty poorly designed, all feel like they have the same accuracy, just with different fire rates and ammo capacity. It also feels like there is less ammo lying around in this game, just so that they can force you to use the gimmicky gun more often to show off their semi-decent physics engine. To put it simply, all difficulty in this game comes from imprecise movement, poor accuracy on your guns, and a lack of ammo in the game.\n\nTL;DR and conclusion: Half-Life 2 is an overrated game today, and was at release. It brings almost nothing new to the table with it's semi-decent physics engine for 2004. Gameplay is broken, and difficulty is dictated solely by poor gun and movement accuracy, along with a lack of supplies. The story I have experienced so far is mediocre at best, and the way the story and gameplay mix is really poor and completely takes you out of the immersion. If you want to experience a good shooter from Valve, play the first Half-Life and both expansions. If you want a good example of the Source engine, play the Portal games. If you want to see a game that shows what the Source engine with a Half-Life 2 twist really should be, get Garry's Mod. Because at the end of the day, broken gun and movement mechanics only work in a semi-party game where modders can fix all the problems that Valve was too snooty to fix. \n\nStop praising this game, because the more you praise it and convince people to buy it, the less Valve will want to make Half-Life 3. It will never live up to your expectations the more you hype it up, and everytime you convince someone to buy a Half-Life game, Valve sees no financial benefit of creating a 3rd game. I am expecting a LOT of criticism from this review, and that's alright, as long as you are willing to take a step back and take a moment to think about my points of criticism. The only reason I would ever recommend this game to someone is if it's on sale, and they're interested in trying out different types of shooters. Otherwise, I would recommend this game to nobody and direct them towards the first game instead. And no, I do not have nostalgia goggles for the first game. I did not experience it until 2014. The only one's who have nostalgia goggles are a few of the Half-Life 2 elitists.\n\n2.5/10","timestamp_created":1482179143,"timestamp_updated":1482454605,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.22399236261844635","comment_count":16,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28473511","author":{"steamid":"76561198085111302","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":551,"last_played":1481030539},"language":"spanish","review":"Media vida dos, si es dos quiere decir que [2x(½)] = 1 vida.\nNo se si quiere decir que es half life 3 confirmado, pero me ha quedado mates y estoy resentido.","timestamp_created":1482175740,"timestamp_updated":1482175740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28472447","author":{"steamid":"76561198033490064","num_games_owned":603,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":889,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":355,"last_played":1561586057},"language":"russian","review":"!)","timestamp_created":1482171859,"timestamp_updated":1482171859,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489258229732513428","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28472219","author":{"steamid":"76561198320554413","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":28,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28,"last_played":1481667283},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom!","timestamp_created":1482171048,"timestamp_updated":1482171048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28469251","author":{"steamid":"76561198074009985","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":977,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":942,"last_played":1546450885},"language":"russian","review":"конец супер  🎮 )))))))","timestamp_created":1482160775,"timestamp_updated":1482160775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28462341","author":{"steamid":"76561198043147281","num_games_owned":703,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":212,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1373500460},"language":"english","review":"4) Marijuana is terrible for your physical health: How bad is marijuana for you?
