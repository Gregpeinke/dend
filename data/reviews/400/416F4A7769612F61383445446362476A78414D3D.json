If you haven't played it yet and have had steam for a year or over... well... HOW?\nIf you have steam, then this is a MUST buy... well I mean every valve game is a must buy if you have steam unless you're a, you know, weirdo.\nI highly recommend getting the 'Valve Complete Pack' during the summer sale, as I think it has the best price out of all of the other times when there are deals.\nAnyway, Portal's story is one of the best I've ever played, (which doesn't have much competition really as the only 'real' game I've completed is 'A Way Out' by EA... yeah EA made a good game...) and I highly recommend playing through the entire Portal game in less than a week or so, as full game plays on YouTube are only about 1hr 30min - 2hrs long, and there's only 19 missions, (most of them are 15-20 mins or so) so it won't take you that long to beat it.\nAnyways, I HIGHLY recommend Portal if you want a quick, fun and easy game to play over the holidays, when you come back from work/school, or on the weekends. Actually Portal isn't that easy, as it uses physics based gameplay, which is hard... obviously, but believe me it's one HELL of a game.\nThanks for reading this and hopefully it got you to buy the game or at least read about the

Atmosféra je skvělá, někdy jsem si připadal, jako bych hrál horrorovku, máte opravdu pocit osamělosti a to vážně do hry sedne. Skvělé hlášky a ikonický záporák nechybí.
