So how you can guess, this walk I machined above will take you an hour or 2, maybe 3 even.\nDon't get me wrong, I loved the story and the holes in it because you go to search about it, you want to understand and solve this puzzle.\n\nElizabeth - \nOh boy, her eyes...\nShe is full of personality, you get to know her when she happy, sad, angry, upset. And the funny thing is you start to feel the same as she is.\nShe does stupid things (like a human being) and clever things too. She knows how to help you in a fight at the right moment.\nThey nailed it with her, she takes such a huge role in this game and you will enjoy her being with you.\n\n9 \\ 10","timestamp_created":1609529232,"timestamp_updated":1609579193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83746781","author":{"steamid":"76561198385635823","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1139,"last_played":1609433747},"language":"schinese","review":"现今当之无愧的第九艺术。","timestamp_created":1609524182,"timestamp_updated":1609770138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83745507","author":{"steamid":"76561198075707254","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":518,"last_played":1612014928},"language":"polish","review":"Amazing game!","timestamp_created":1609523040,"timestamp_updated":1609523040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83744691","author":{"steamid":"76561198028063827","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":707,"last_played":1551814800},"language":"english","review":"I played this game a few years ago at a friends house, didn't really click.

When I reached it, my reaction was: \"this can't be the ending.\" Unlike, the first and the second game that both made me cry on my first completion (got on both the good ending). Gameplay wise, is an \"take your own approach\" type of shooter, and all of the \"vigors\" are satisfying and really useful in combat, the guns are a mix bag, the machine gun being my most used weapon next to the Carbine and the Volley Launcher. The enemies are okay, they didn't poss a real threat through most of the game, because of how broken the shield is, and how you can basically toy with them with all of the vigors. This games versions of the \"big daddy\" enemy, the patriots, are laughably easy to take care off, unlike their rapture counterparts, and the game suffers for not having a varied enemy rooster, because most fights can be tackled with the same strategies, unlike the first (and to a lesser extent the second) where you changed tactics constantly depending on what enemy type you were dealing with. \n\nGraphically, this is the best looking game in the series without a doubt, unlike the second game that felt like an upgrade and a downgrade graphically, this game truly perfected the look of Bioshock. The ost is great, but it isn't as memorable as the first game's soundtrack, its better than the second game's though. Overall, I think the game (the main campaign, this doesn't rate the DLC) is an 9/10. The weakest in the series, but its still an overall great time.","timestamp_created":1609456467,"timestamp_updated":1609456467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83685590","author":{"steamid":"76561198387146555","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":490,"last_played":1609507876},"language":"russian","review":"Соли есть заебись","timestamp_created":1609455469,"timestamp_updated":1609455469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494699656963348389","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83684704","author":{"steamid":"76561198111350544","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":140,"playtime_forever":405,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":405,"last_played":1529257743},"language":"english","review":"woman","timestamp_created":1609454457,"timestamp_updated":1609454457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83684295","author":{"steamid":"76561198815740752","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1632814864},"language":"russian","review":"Серия игр Bioshock-ШЕДЕВР\nНепередаваемые ощущения после прохождения всех частей.DLC-стоят своих денег, в них раскрываются все тайны.\n","timestamp_created":1609454034,"timestamp_updated":1628802322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83681172","author":{"steamid":"76561198161490813","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":898,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":825,"last_played":1609778098},"language":"english","review":"Very good main history, the game is great but a little short.

The stories for solo campaign games are often conveyed over radio and cutscenes that take you out of the game. Bioshock Infinite does a good job at telling much of the story through characters or events that are taking place right in front of you. The game does have cutscenes, but they don't break the gameplay like in most games. Instead, the camera will restrict your focus to the area of importance until the cutscene is over. Even the tutorial is immersive: set up as a carnival with different booths that with familiarize you with different game mechanics.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the story of Bioshock Infinite. The world aesthetic and graphics make this one of the most visually stunning games I have played. I often felt compelled to thoroughly explore maps so that I could fully appreciate the breathtaking scenery. I found the gameplay to be quite fun (not as good as modern first-person shooters, but not boring by any means). The gameplay mechanics (weapons & abilities) felt noticeably better than the original Bioshock game. The skyhook also adds a fun aspect to gameplay that is still unique in the first-person-shooter realm.\n\nOverall I rated the original Bioshock as a great game, but I would rate Bioshock Infinite as infinitely better.","timestamp_created":1609439895,"timestamp_updated":1609439895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83670303","author":{"steamid":"76561198288354388","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":972,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":908,"last_played":1644173695},"language":"schinese","review":"太美了。\n伊丽莎白，哥伦比亚，冲上云霄和最后的结局，太美了\n第九艺术无愧","timestamp_created":1609439452,"timestamp_updated":1609439452,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540918171405792236","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83669454","author":{"steamid":"76561198130781535","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1178,"last_played":1515630916},"language":"english","review":"I know there's many comments concerning how the developers didn't exactly deliver what players were wanting but given I was walking in with no expectations for this game and that I was already hyped up from the past two games, I'm glad to say that I immensely enjoyed this game.

placed, the dialog very well written, and the ending exceedingly perfect. \nYou are missing out on a lot of the story, if you do not play the two Burial at Sea additions.\n\nI did feel a bit at odds with the ending, despite it being very well done from its own individual point, but having playing Burial at Sea 1 and 2, I can now say the writers of this game, and the additional content, are simply amazing.

único que puedo decir de este juego es que es maravilloso. No se ni por donde empezar. \n\nA pesar que nunca he jugado a la primera entrega, no me importa, voy a dar mi opinión.\n\nHistoria: La historia de este juego yo creo que es lo fundamental, es muy emocional, interesante y es una locura, te metes completamente en el personaje principal y también los personajes secundarios están creados de una forma que incluso empatizas con ellos y sabes toda su historia (incluyendo a los personajes malos) pero sobretodo si prestas muchas atención a las grabaciones que encuentras en la aventura.\n\nAMBIENTACIÓN: La ambientación es un poco extraña, que tiene una combinación y un toque de la religión y la historia de Estados Unidos combinado con una ciudad flotante, pero aun así es una maravilla.\n\nJUGABILIDAD: El juego es un genero de disparos en primera persona, tal vez haya gente que piense que no es muy original, pero yo habido jugado a tantos juegos de este genero este me ha encantado, la satisfacción que tienes al matar a un enemigo (un poco psicópata pero bueno) la variación de armas son las justas y necesarias tienes: Un lanza granadas, un lanza cohetes, un fusil de francotirador, una pistola pequeña, un fusil de asalto, un subfusil, una ametralladora ligera, una escopeta etc y todo estas armas con un diseño único. Además de una especie de gancho que tienes para moverte y los poderes son brutales, todos con un diseño original y cada uno sirve para hacer cosas completamente diferentes. Por cierto, no se si es que soy el puto amo (que ojala) pero el francotirador de este juego esta chetadísimo.\n\nEn conclusión que para mí unos de los mejores juegos que he jugado en mi vida y si lo hubiera jugado en 2013 cuando salió, estoy seguro que me hubiera encantado mas. Recomendado por el preció que sea, es una obra maestra y estoy seguro que no te defraudara. Le doy un 11/10\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1609370940,"timestamp_updated":1609370940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83602827","author":{"steamid":"76561198930162892","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":534,"last_played":1645578763},"language":"spanish","review":"juegazo de la gran flauta, se coje de parado al 1 y al 2, buena historia, mejor juego, ademas esta 2 mangos compralo laucha roñosa.","timestamp_created":1609367245,"timestamp_updated":1609367245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83601803","author":{"steamid":"76561198311763515","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1967,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1614,"last_played":1620585880},"language":"spanish","review":"Una obra maestra, historia bien pulida.
