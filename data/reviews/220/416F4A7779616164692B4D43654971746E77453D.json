The AI is very formiddable and intellegent which make the fights more engaging and difficult, (unlike more modern FPS's where the enemy's are just mentally deficient bullet sponges) the combine, zombies, headcrabs, antlions, hunters, dropships and striders are all a joy to fight. On top of all of this, Half Life 2's story makes for a very unique experience, the characters are all interesting and fleshed out and you end up remembering each and every one of them, the beginning sequence has very little action but is still excellent to experience, in the intro sequence we're introduced to the oppresive enviorment of City 17, we see the oppresive regime of the combine and how they treat the helpless civillians of City 17 which makes it all the more satisfying to fight them, the enviorment is always moving and it makes you feel as though you're part of a living breathing world.\n\nOverall Half Life 2 provides an experience that no other shooter can provide and i would highly recommend picking it up for yourself, and i look foward to the sequel that will never come out.","timestamp_created":1525707252,"timestamp_updated":1525707252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41904832","author":{"steamid":"76561198160615254","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2019,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":369,"last_played":1647006939},"language":"english","review":"Why are you reading a comment from Yoda when you should be playing this game instead?","timestamp_created":1525698290,"timestamp_updated":1525698380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41904230","author":{"steamid":"76561198448011792","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":978,"last_played":1571434465},"language":"spanish","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1525695566,"timestamp_updated":1618173313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41903964","author":{"steamid":"76561198170895542","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":656,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":286,"last_played":1634362952},"language":"english","review":"What could I say?

Big bad \"multiverse-multidimensional universal empire\" (yes, literally, look at the lore) powerful aliens want have dominated Earth and humans are now a slave race. You (and ordinary scientist) and a bunch of ragtag homeless people with home made weapons (the Resistance) work together to stop the Combine (the alien bad guys). Can't really complain about the story characters I guess, they have good voice actors and animations which makes them believable I suppose, although since the main character has no real personality and is a mute there is no real relationship between the player and plot characters which makes it hard to care at all about the plot characters. The game is praised for it's use of interactive \"cutscenes\" (You're able to look and walk around in them) although these story events/cutscenes is just NPCs slowly walking around, talking to each other, then pressing buttons, so there's no interesting story events/cutscenes that actually make use of this unique form of storytelling mechanic. Overall the story in this game is very bland and boring, mainly because of the lack of interesting events ingame. \n\nThe game's protagonist is poorly designed, he has a fixed back story, name and appearance and the storytelling is very linear so there is no player choice, and yet the protagonist has no voice (not even voice sound effects or first person animations) or personality so it's inconsistent and breaks immersion. You don't feel like Gordon Freeman because of first points I made above, and yet he isn't even his own thing either since he has no personality.\n\n\n[b] GAMEPLAY/COMBAT [/b]\n\nThe game is primarily an Action FPS so the combat is it's gameplay, and it's terrible. Enemy AI is only two steps from being SOF3 tier. They throw grenades and that's about it, they don't really work as a squad and they constantly stand in the line of fire or slowly strafe to the sides (while still being in the line of fire), they are bullet spongy and feel unresponsive as hell considering when shot they barely twitch and the particle effects for both bullet impacts and gun effects are practically non existent. Enemies go from being very alive to gently slumping over to the ground with no real impact weight to the bullets you fired. Gun sounds and effects are bad/guns feel like pathetic pea shooters and there's only a small variety of guns in this game. The game has probably twice the enemy variety of HALO 1 but all the enemies practically play the same and you won't be forced to change strategy from enemy to enemy so it becomes reptitve very quickly. Physics \"puzzles\" in this game are a joke, it's the same stuff that toddlers play with in day care centers like putting a brick on a teeter totter to lift something up (you literally do that in one level)\n\n[b] VISUALS [/b]\n\nOkay graphics engine wasted on ugly ass bland empty enviroments. There's a big difference between dark and depressing feel to enviroments like the Max Payne games and Deus Ex versus just being depressingly ugly and bland that they remind you of working an 8 hour shift in a small town office on a cloudy day. Textures look grainy and there is no self casting dynamic shadows like other games of the same era such as FEAR and DOOM 3 to help set a moody ambient, so even for its time the graphics engine was nothing special. Oh yeah, and speaking of the ugly enviroments, it makes the levels a boring dull chore to play through because everything looks depressingly boring.\n\n[b] VERDICT [/b]\n\nIt's not a bad game, but it is highly overrated.

I tried my best to complete this game but apparently my best was not good enough.

Gra HALF-LIFE, łącząca w sobie dynamiczną akcję i niezwykle wciągającą fabułę, wywołuje niesamowite zamieszanie na rynku. Debiut firmy Valve zdobywa ponad 50 tytułów „gry roku”, a przez magazyn PC Gamer zostaje ogłoszony najlepszą grą komputerową wszech czasów. Na całym świecie sprzedano ponad osiem milionów egzemplarzy.\n\nDZIŚ. Half-Life 2 to zupełnie nowy wymiar trzymającej w napięciu, wymagającej i emocjonującej części pierwszej. Kontynuacja oferuje przerażający poziom realizmu i interaktywności z otoczeniem. Otwiera drzwi do świata, w którym obecność gracza ma wpływ na otoczenie, poczynając od środowiska opartego na modelu fizyki, po zachowania, a nawet emocje zarówno przyjaciół, jak i wrogów.\n\nGracz ponownie wciela się w postać Gordona Freemana powracającego na Ziemię, którą opanowała obca rasa. Najeźdźcy drążą planetę i ograbiają ją z naturalnych surowców, dziesiątkując przy tym populację. Freeman musi uratować świat przed złem, które wyzwolił jeszcze w Black Mesa. Liczy na niego wiele osób.\n\nWciągająca rozgrywka w czasie rzeczywistym jest możliwa dzięki technologii Source®. Silnik Source umożliwił wprowadzenie wielu zmian:\n\nPostacie: Zaawansowany system animacji twarzy pozwolił na osiągnięcie niezwykle realistycznych modeli postaci. Dzięki odwzorowaniu zachowania 40 mięśni twarzy postacie mogą wyrażać swoje emocje i płynnie reagować na zachowanie gracza.\nModel fizyki: Wszystkie modele, począwszy od kropli wody, a skończywszy na 2-tonowych ciężarówkach, reagują zgodnie z oczekiwaniami i prawami fizyki (dotyczy to takich zjawisk, jak masa, tarcie czy grawitacja).\nGrafika: Technologia renderingu Source, podobna do wykorzystanej przez firmę Pixar w takich filmach, jak „Toy Story®” oraz „Potwory i spółka®”, umożliwiła stworzenie pięknego i realistycznego środowiska gry.\nSI: Zarówno przyjaciele, jak i wrogowie nie szarżują na oślep. W odpowiedni sposób reagują na zagrożenia, pokonują trudny teren i korzystają z wszelkiego dostępnego uzbrojenia.","timestamp_created":1525250081,"timestamp_updated":1525250081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41808268","author":{"steamid":"76561198014585527","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":120,"last_played":1578520831},"language":"polish","review":"Jak każda gra od Valve \n\n[h1] 10/10 [h1]","timestamp_created":1525247261,"timestamp_updated":1525247261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41807586","author":{"steamid":"76561198381218194","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":278,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1531475886},"language":"schinese","review":"个人认为的不多的神作中的一个，不敢相信是04年的游戏","timestamp_created":1525243107,"timestamp_updated":1525243107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41807173","author":{"steamid":"76561198347331421","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":871,"last_played":1601494346},"language":"russian","review":"Игра каеф.

Interesting story line, would reccomend to go back to the first Half-Life and continue on to the second game, but the game still explains most of previous story, even if you have not played trough the first game. Once you reach the end, it will make you think, what will come next. I personally enjoy games that leave something to think about in the end, and anxiously makes you wait the next part to see how it unravels.\nLucky for you there are two additional parts.","timestamp_created":1525207541,"timestamp_updated":1525207541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41798935","author":{"steamid":"76561198276645149","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":171,"last_played":1504264216},"language":"russian","review":"Эта игра не нуждается ни в оценке, ни в обзоре.
