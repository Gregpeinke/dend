Sus virguerías técnicas han sido superadas y con el tiempo lo afearán más, pero el ingenio y maestría que hay detrás de cada rincón de Ciudad 17 permanecerá. El regreso de Gordon Freeman está calculado al detalle:  Valve ha logrado crear unos mapas llenos de retos que el jugador irá solucionando gracias a su intuición. Niveles dónde las fases de acción se entremezclan con persecuciones, plataformas y puzles a resolver. Y lo que a priori suena como imposible, funciona, y de qué manera. \n\nEs un juego diseñado para divertir; es por ésa razón que aunque sus escenarios resulten algo vacíos a día de hoy, haya texturas en baja resolución o polígonos como puños ( cuidado, sigue siendo muy cdecetea nivel visual aún con diez años a sus espaldas ), su variedad de situaciones y desarrollo inteligente y desafíante lo convierten en la definición perfecta de videojuego. \n\nNo todo es perfecto, la IA amiga deja mucho que deseear, el doblaje al castellano es nefasto y el tercer acto pierde algo de fuelle para dar paso a un críptico final, orientado descaradamente a los episodios siguientes para obtener respuestas. Pero aunque Half Life 2 sea un ejemplo recurrentede narrativa dinámica dentro de la idiosincrasia del videojuego, yo me quedo con lo divertido que es encarnar una y otra vez a Gordon Freeman.","timestamp_created":1407312689,"timestamp_updated":1407312689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504727602005004883","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11571345","author":{"steamid":"76561198042825861","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":282,"last_played":1377823296},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I have ever played, let alone one of the best games ever made.

It has everything you need to make a good game: compelling characters, a deep and rich story, great combat mechanics, killer music, good graphics (for it's time, and even by today's standards they aren't bad.), and action.  Lots and lots of action.\n\nIf you're clueless about what this game is about, you dive into the shoes of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist that escaped twenty years in the past from the Black Mesa laboratories.  In Half-Life, Gordon accidently releases a portal to Xen, an alien world, which causes massive chaos.  This includes zombies, aliens, zombies, aliens, and more zombies.  After the events of Half-Life (go play the game), you are placed into stasis by the mysterious, \"G-Man,\" who wakes you up from it right before the events of Half-Life 2.  You awaken as Freeman to a world controlled by a military group called the Combine, who have placed humanity into strict order, which is led by your old Black Mesa supervisor Dr. Breen.  You quickly learn that there is a resistance led some of your former fellow scientists, who plan to overthrow the Combine in order to make the world as it was once again.  So you get at it, becoming the face of the resistance, in order to take earth back once again.\n\nI truly can not give enough praise to Valve for making this incredible game.  I tip my hats to you, developers.\n\nSo, if you haven't played this game, now is the time.  Put on your hazard suit.

En su juventud, se fue a terminar sus estudios a Ciudad 17, pequeño pueblo muy tranquilo donde actualmente vive.\nCuando comienza el juego se vé que la situación económica no es muy buena, ya que nuestro personaje acaba de llegar en tren de buscar trabajo. La primera cinematográfica del juego no debería sorprenderte, simplemente ha sido un sueño de Pepe en el tren, ya que acababa de llegar de buscar trabajo, y eso en Ciudad 17 es duro. Al bajarte del tren te encuentras con tus colegas del barrio, y te invitan a jugar al juego llamado: a ver quien aporrea mas ciudadanos, donde también vale aporrearse entre ellos con una especie de palo eléctrico. Obviamente Pepe no quiere  ya que necesita irse a su choza a descansar para iniciar mañana otro dia de búsqueda de trabajo.\nHubo un problema, Pepe se dejó las llaves dentro de su casa y tuvo que ir saltando de tejado en tejado para poder entrar. Al entrar tuvo que bajar las escaleras de la azotea para bajar a su piso, y estas se rompieron, dejando inconsciente a Pepe.\nLa vecina de Pepe, Eugenia González, habia acudido a ayudarle, y pudo reanimarle. En ese momento Pepe habia encontrado el amor de su vida. Eugenia le conto a Pepe que había un hombre que estaba buscando empleados para trabajar de taxista, y Pepe aceptó, poniéndose así su uniforme y para empezar mañana. Pepe y Eugenia estaban muy enamorados, y esta invitó a Pepe a conocer a su padre, Tomás González. Los amigos de Pepe iban a empezar una partidilla de airsoft en todo el pueblo, como era normal y Pepe no quería jugar. Los amigos se enfurecieron y planearon una jugarreta para que Pepe jugara: raptar a su futuro suegro. Pepe y Eugenia descubrieron el malvado plan de sus amigos, y derrepente toda su furia se concentró en el y se convirtio en SuperJosef III, obteniendo así sus armas de airsoft y reventando a sus amigos como si fuera un máster pro de cs jugando a Full HD 1080 60 FPS.\nAcabaron con todos, pero se dieron cuenta que habian secuetrado a Tomás en la base enemiga de la partida. Rápidamente fueron en su búsqueda y ocurrió lo que llamaban: La Batalla final, donde ambos capinanes de los equipos se enfentaban por el rehén.\nPepe derrotó al otro capitán con una patada voladora giratoria y consiguió ganar la partida. Acto seguidó Tomás se calentó y se llevó a su hija lejos, con la excusa de que no le gustaba sus amiguitos. Y así, Pepe nunca tuvo un final feliz, n comió perdices además que perdió en curro por estar jugando en horas de trabajo.","timestamp_created":1407199072,"timestamp_updated":1407199072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549462735652923584","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11553226","author":{"steamid":"76561198044929997","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":4485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2247,"last_played":1634918801},"language":"italian","review":"The Best Game of the World NOW GABEN WE WANT HL3!!! -A normal Half-Life 2 Player","timestamp_created":1407189791,"timestamp_updated":1407189791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53562009334564209","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11551398","author":{"steamid":"76561197980771349","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":104,"playtime_forever":3572,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3251,"last_played":1644857799},"language":"english","review":"Wonderful and amazing game, recommend to play all episodes of serie !\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFNXUMn3sjc","timestamp_created":1407179678,"timestamp_updated":1429052267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11550410","author":{"steamid":"76561198116797261","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":8097,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":266,"last_played":1634726500},"language":"english","review":"This is a funky violence game.
