que tem algo errado com a câmera pois ela fica se movendo para direções aleatórias, isso se resolve indo em opções e na parte de \"Mouse\", procure uma opção chamado \"Enable Raw Input\" e só ativar e

А кто бы поступил иначе? Не знающий ничего, но упорно пытающийся найти пути отступления – это действительно похоже на человека, оказавшегося в эпицентре инопланетного вторжения.\n\nДополнение короткое, оно не дает устать, единственная проблема – были вылеты и фризы, отчего – кто знает?
