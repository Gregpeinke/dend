В ней не только замечательный геймплей, но и отличный сюжет, который разворачивается по ходу игры.\nПродолжение игры Half-LIfe. Гордон Фримен помещён в Стазис G-Man'ом. После катастрофы в Чёрной Мезе начались Портальные Штормы. В связи с этим, на Землю вторглись инопланетные захватчики, именуемые Альянсом. Началась война, названная впоследствии Семичасовой. Альянс победил и захватил власть на Земле. Их наместником стал доктор Брин - бывший Администратор Чёрной Мезы. Люди стали \"заложниками\" собственной планеты, а те, кто не разделяет власть Альянса, создали организацию под названием \"Сопротивление\", под предводительством Илая Вэнса.\nСпустя 20 лет, G-Man пробуждает Гордона Фримена и отправляет его в центр власти Альянса - город City 17. Являясь легендой граждан City 17 и символом свободы, Гордон саботирует город, и начинается полномасштабное восстание. Гордон Фримен должен добраться до доктора Брина и остановить оккупацию Земли.\n\nОбновлено:\nВ этом году игре исполняется 14 лет, но она по-прежнему лучшая в своём жанре.
