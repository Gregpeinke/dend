Chewing through the sweet pulp, you found at it's core that Portal was a tempting physics based puzzler, utilsing time and space to create 2 \"portals\" around a room in order to solve fiendishly devised puzzles. Portal 2 improved upon the formula by introducing more approachable humour in the voice talents of Steve Merchant. Smoother graphics and more refined sound make this the icing on a truly amazing puzzle game. Would I reccommend it? Whole heartidly yes. It's a must game.

Portal 2 delivers on every aspect that made the original great and expands its breadth without losing its identity by adding new game mechanics like physics augmenting fluids, light bridges/walls, and floating vortexes. The story here is as dark and hilarious as the original while offering more gameplay time. Once you've finished the single player campaign, you can jump into the testing labs with a friend to tackle two-player cooperative puzzles that will test your wits as well as your friendship (in a good way, of course).

Portal 2 is an awesome game, it has great gameplay, easy to learn mechanics and controls, and a great story. I've had this game for about three years. I bought it for $5 during the 2012 summer sales, and I must say, I'm still playing it. The workshop feature adds so much more this game. The only problem I have found with this game is that singleplayer is a bit short and it does need a bit more to it (yes, I actually agree with those idiots who think this game is short), but the Workshop feature, Co-op mode, and replay value make up for it.  The Co-op mode is an interesting new game mode that is both frustrating and fun at the same time. This game is great, but Valve still can't count to three, even if a knife was at thier throats. So don't ever, ever, EVER expect Valve to make a Portal 3, but expect someone else to make it thanks to Portal's awesome community. Great game, but it needs a damn sequel. Come on Valve!
