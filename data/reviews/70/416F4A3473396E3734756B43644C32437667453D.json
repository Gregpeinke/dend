There are some rooms which are beautifully designed which are very fun to run around in. I found it super interesting and insanely fun, there are times where super unexpected events take place which only make the game even better and better.  You do need to be smart in order to play Half-Life, in terms of using your brains to figure out how to bypass an obstacle and to know how to save ammo properly so you're always prepared in a combat with a creature or a member of the military. \n\nThis game is VERY DIFFICULT, you'll find that you need plenty of bullets to finish off a single enemy, then, the enemies can lower your health by so much with just one attack, even one hit from an enemy is enough to kill you sometimes. \n\nThe story is fantastic and really blew my mind because i was so impressed on how valve came up with such an interesting plot, the graphics are also decent.\n\nI would for sure recommend this game, people need to know that this is the mother of all FPS games.

[/h1]\n\nEin Mann, eine Brechstange, eine Alieninvasion!\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n“Half-Life” ist ein Ego-Shooter der alten Schule. Ab durch die Level, hier und da ein paar neue Knarren und immer fleißig alles nach Leben und Munition absuchen. Die Gegner sind dabei angenehm unterschiedlich, ansonsten aber hart und herzlich. Kleiner Tipp: Es greifen nie mehr als 2 Gegner gleichzeitig an, dass ist ein kleiner Trick der Entwickler. Aber auf einem hohen Schwierigkeitsgrad macht das Spiel seinem Namen alle Ehre: Selten hat man volles Leben, denn der nächste Gegner wartet schon. Aber auch andere Gefahren aus der Umwelt wie beispielsweise Elektrizität oder Strahlung können gefährlich werden, während man die Rätsel löst. Das Unternehmen Valve liebt übrigens Ventile… Für so ein altes Spiel sind die Level dann noch recht abwechslungsreich und die Technik war damals revolutionär. Nach ein knapp 8 Stunden Prügelei mit einer Brechstange und ja, vielleicht auch ein paar Schüssen, hat man das Abenteuer dann hinter sich.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nAls der Physiker Gordon Freeman arbeiten wir in Black Mesa, die sich mit anderen Dimensionen auseinandersetzen. So wurde jüngst eine andere Dimension gefunden, jedoch gibt es zu Beginn recht wenig Informationen. Als ein Laborversuch fehlschlägt, lösen wir eine Apokalypse aus und schwupps, müssen wir die Welt retten. Wir prügeln uns mit dem heiligen Symbol, eine Brechstange, durch die Einrichtung und müssen dabei auch gegen das Militär kämpfen. Die Schweine wollen nämlich alles vertuschen aber natürlich gewinnt am Ende der Physiker mit keinerlei Kampferfahrung, wir reisen in die Dimension Xen und treten ein paar Aliens mal so richtig ins Gesicht. Die Story ist für so ein altes Spiel nicht übel und mehr will man zunächst eigentlich auch nicht. Das Szenario ermöglicht die Umsetzung vieler Gegner, Level und coolen Ideen. \n„Half-Life“ selber hat wie auch sein Nachfolger Wellen geschlagen, da beide brandneue Techniken benutzen, auf denen viele andere Spiele aufbauen. So gäbe es wohl in dieser Form heute kein „Counter-Strike“, kein „Day of Defeat“ und kein „Garry`s Mod“. Das Spiel ist defintiv ein Meilenstein der Videospielgeschichte und auch spielerisch macht es immer noch Spaß. \n\n[b]Grafik/Sound[/b]\nJa, äh. Davon wollen wir jetzt nicht wirklich anfangen, oder? Aber hey, es hatte schon damals echtes 3D! Die Soundkulisse ist auch eher maginal, aber dafür geben die Sprecher zumindest ein Wenig was her. Und ich bin mir sicher, dass dieses Geräusch von diesem Alienvieh in Wirklichkeit eine klackernde Tastatur ist. Äh, ich höre jetzt lieber auf…\n\n[b]Fazit[/b]\n„Half-Life“ ist immer wieder mal spaßig zum Durchspielen. Wenn man zu seinen Wurzeln zurückkehren will, gibt es wohl nichts Besseres. Ich würde allerdings nicht unbedingt zum Kauf dieser Version raten, da es [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/225840/Sven_Coop/]Sven Co-op [/url] gibt, mit dem man alle Level kostenlos sogar mit Freunden spielen kann oder man kann auch zu [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/]Black Mesa[/url], einer hübscheren und kompletten Aufbereitung des Spiels, greifen. Außerdem möchte ich noch auf diesen lustigen [url=https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-top-down]Top-Down Mod[/url] aufmerksam machen! Dieses Spiel sollte man einfach in Ehren halten, weil es seine eigenen Wurzeln tief in die Gamingwelt gegraben hat. Außerdem komme ich immer auf lustige Gedanken, wenn ich eine Brechstange sehe…\n\nMehr Brechstangenaction? Ich habe auch zu den anderen Half-Life und vielen weiteren Spielen ein Review verfasst.
