Back then, it was a buggy mess. But after not hearing much about the game, Tripwire pulled the same thing they did with Red Orchestra by releasing it, 100% polished, as a standalone game. Killing Floor pins you and a group of people (unless you solo) against waves and waves of different types of zombies. From the starter Clots, to the obnoxious Siren and to the pants-defecating-inducing Fleshpound, Killing Floor keeps you on the edge while still creating a sense of joking around with the over the top British voices demanding for LOADSAMONEY and other goofy phrases. There is a story behind the game, but I don't even think Tripwire themselves even care about it anymore (none of the character packs involve special military operatives like the original 4 default characters). It's a fun indie title that I personally think gets you more enjoyment than Left 4 Dead does, although it plays much differently.","timestamp_created":1309751285,"timestamp_updated":1309751285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470114588737487793","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1464042","author":{"steamid":"76561197993476998","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5970,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5740,"last_played":1433569974},"language":"english","review":"Fun to play with friends, more complicated than it looks","timestamp_created":1309750758,"timestamp_updated":1309750758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1410521","author":{"steamid":"76561197992928478","num_games_owned":464,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":9302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8801,"last_played":1427764489},"language":"english","review":"Survival horror at its best.... discounting l4d1 and 2.","timestamp_created":1309750379,"timestamp_updated":1309750379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"204806","author":{"steamid":"76561197965179027","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":15104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14760,"last_played":1441665696},"language":"english","review":"I've had the experience of playing KF for quite some time now...It has a lot of team elements that make it fun to play with friends as well as some RPGish elements in the sense that you can level up each class from LEVEL 1-6\nTo compare L4D to Killing floor would not be a good comparison...\nKilling Floor is like tower defense, with each level you try to improve your characters weapon arson to destroy the zombie hordes.
