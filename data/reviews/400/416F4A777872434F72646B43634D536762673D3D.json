I've heard how amazing this game is from a few friends, so my expectations were set pretty high, which usually results with me being disappointed.  However, Portal lived up to all the hype.  The storyline and characters are pretty weak, but that's the only flaw I can find.  The graphics are great for a 2007 game and the gameplay is amazing.  The concept of solving puzzle rooms may seem mundane, but the intricate physics of the connected portals makes this game one of the funnest games I've ever played.  The main storyline serves as an excellent tutorial that gets progressively more difficult and does provide some amusing moments through a subpar storyline.  For a real challenge, the game provides bonus maps, wherein I spent majority of my 20 hours of gameplay.  Highly recommend for everyone.","timestamp_created":1483395793,"timestamp_updated":1483395793,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28958106","author":{"steamid":"76561198045969113","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1941,"last_played":1574167876},"language":"english","review":"This is an absolute classic.

the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead.\n\n\n至于你们说的GLaDOS的新发明，我记得portal gun是在G的手中最后制成的，二代中引力光束，弹射跳板，还有那两个机器人都是G做的吧。接下来的一系列测试计划，也是科研必不可少的一部分啊。\n","timestamp_created":1483286032,"timestamp_updated":1483286032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513087570667266846","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28905930","author":{"steamid":"76561198262747375","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":212,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1545985899},"language":"schinese","review":"经典的游戏","timestamp_created":1483284193,"timestamp_updated":1483284193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28905693","author":{"steamid":"76561198107084489","num_games_owned":309,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":12,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1480528794},"language":"brazilian","review":"Joguinho
