Ein Meilenstein des Shooter-Genres, nein, der ganzen Videospielindustrie. Half Life 2 gelingt das, woran die meisten Shooter davor und auch noch heutzutage, scheitern. Anstatt den Spieler mit immergleich ausschauenden Schlauchkorridoren zu langweilen und keine Herausforderung oder Gameplayänderungen zu bieten, überrascht Half Life 2 den Spieler immer wieder mit spritzigen Neuinterpretationen des Gameplays und einem Leveldesign, in dem wirklich jeder Raum einen Sinn besitzt und nicht wie bloßes Füllmaterial wirkt. Jedes Level ist dabei auf seine Art einzigartig, sei es das Autolevel, ein schwindelerregender Spaziergang über eine Brücke oder die gruselige Atmosphäre von Ravenholm. Half Life 2 ist eines der wenigen Spiele, die zu wirklich fast keiner Sekunde langweilig sind.\n\nDie Story ist hierbei eher in den Hintergrund gerückt, wobei sie stets den roten Faden in den Levelverlauf legt. Das Finale des Spiels ist hierbei der Höhepunkt, da der geheimnisvolle G-Man furchteinflössend und dennoch anziehend zugleich wirkt. Man sollte unbedingt auch noch Episode 1+2 spielen, nicht nur um des genialen Gameplays wegen, sondern auch um die spannende Story in ihrer Gänze zu erfahren.\n\nNun werde ich auf die einzelnen Aspekte des Spiels eingehen:\n\nGrafik-7/10\n\nAn heutigen Maßstäben gemessen ist Half Life 2, trotz HD-Auflösung, kein so grafisch eindrucksvolles Spiel mehr wie noch seinerzeit 2004 zu seinem Release. Dennoch wird dies durch ein geniales Artdesign und eindrucksvoll inszenierte Kulissen wieder wettgemacht. Hässlich ist das Spiel damit also keinesfalls.\n\nSound-9/10\n\nDer Soundtrack hält sich eher im Hintergrund, es gibt jedoch einige Tracks, die sehr gut klingen. Am besten ist aber die Soundkulisse, seien es die Geräusche der Monster, die sich umhertreiben oder die Effekte, die beim Abschießen von Laserstrahlen erklingen. Besonders in Ravenholm läuft einem oft das kalte Wasser über den Rücken, wenn man ein Kreischen hinter sich hört, in der Hoffnung, dass da kein Gegner hinter einem steht. Daumen hoch hierfür!\n\nStory-8/10\n\nWie oben bereits beschrieben, steht die Story eher im Hintergrund, ist aber dennoch interessant genug, um den Spieler bei der Stange zu halten.\n\nGameplay-9/10\n\nSehr abwechslungsreich und eben kein 08/15 Shooter-Rumgeballer. Jedes Level fühlt sich einzigartig an und man möchte die Level immer und immer wieder spielen.\n\nSynchro-8/10\n\nDie deutsche Synchronisation ist größtenteils gelungen, wenn auch für meinen Geschmach der G-Man etwas befremdlich klingt im Vergleich zur Original-Stimme. Aber dies ist verschmerzbar.\n\nGesamtwertung-9/10\n\nHalf Life 2 schafft es im Handumdrehen, seinen ohnehin schon genialen Vorgänger nochmals zu übertreffen und legt den Grundstein für das Shootergenre, dessen Genialität leider nie so erreicht wurde wie hier mit Half Life 2. Ich kann also nur meine vollste Empfehlung für diesen Toptitel aussprechen. Eines der besten Spiele aller Zeiten!","timestamp_created":1463863910,"timestamp_updated":1463863910,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23124321","author":{"steamid":"76561198120101475","num_games_owned":1599,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":2170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2170,"last_played":1461062992},"language":"english","review":"Great game","timestamp_created":1463863568,"timestamp_updated":1463863568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526527106761932373","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23124243","author":{"steamid":"76561198043424113","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4798,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4203,"last_played":1658531123},"language":"english","review":"great game of its time and a part of my childhood i defenitly recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it.

Игра была выпущена в две тысячи четвертом году и получила высокие оценки многих известных изданий. Помимо этого она собрала множество наград. Разработку игры вели около шести лет, но ожидание прошло не зря, потому что компания Valve разработала для игры новый движок под названием Source, в котором была хорошо проработана анимация персонажей, а также были произведены работы над искусственным интеллектом противников. Взаимодействие игрока с внешним миром вышло на новый невиданный ранее уровень. \n\nгеймплей\n\nДействие первой части игры происходило в секретном научном комплексе под названием «Черная Меза». Здесь проводилось множество экспериментов и один из них оказался крайне неудачным для жителей Земли. Во время эксперимента «что-то пошло не так» и в результате открылся портал в другое измерение под названием «Зен», где обитала враждебная инопланетная цивилизация и разумеется они тут же начали экспансию. Поскольку наш бравый Гордон принимал непосредственное участие во всем этом безобразии ему и предстояло разобраться с этим, к тому же он остался одним из немногих вышивших в «Черной Мезе». \n\nПо сюжету первой части нам предстояло выбраться из научного комплекса, попасть в «Зен» и уничтожить лидера этой инопланетной цивилизации чтобы прекратить вторжение и закрыть образовавшийся портал. Вторая же часть ведет свое повествование через двадцать лет после событий первой части. Мы прибываем в город «Сити-17», один из немногих крупных городов, что остался на Земле. Сюжетная линия в Халф-Лайф довольно сложная, вернее в ней довольно сложно разобраться, особенно учитывая концовку этой игры и нашего таинственного «друга» G-man’а, который имеет обыкновение появляться и пропадать неизвестно откуда и куда. В этой игре нашим главным противником станет некто Уоллес Брин, который постоянно транслирует свои речи по всевозможным передающим устройствами. \n\nОбстановка игры крайне разнообразна, от городских пейзажей Сити-17, до его пригородов и территорий за пределами города. Вообще территории, которые показаны нам в игре, напоминают Восточную Европу, и игроки часто спорят о том, какие же страны послужили образцом для игры. Также по мере прохождения нам попадутся парочка советских автомобилей, что для меня стало сюрпризом. Кстати, моя любимая локация в «халфе» это Равенхольм, с крайне колоритным персонажем, что живет в этом городе.\n\nзнаменитая фомка\n\nТакже стоит упомянуть, что особенность первой части игры сохранена и здесь, Гордон Фримен за всю игру не произносит ни слова, даже когда с ним разговаривают. Вернее почти все диалоги построены так, что Гордону просто нет необходимости отвечать, когда к нему обращаются, так что мы так и не знаем немой ли он или просто большой молчун, ведь как мы знаем все настоящие ученые немного сумасшедшие. Такая вот «фишка» от разработчиков игры, которая довольно оригинальна, а также лучше погружает тебя в атмосферу игры. Но думаю, что каждому любителю этой игры хотелось бы узнать побольше о сюжете, потому что информации предоставленной нам явно не хватает, чтобы охватить весь мир Half-life. Например, когда же нам уже расскажут кто такой этот G-man?! \n\nВраги в игре знакомы нам и по первой части: хедкрабы, зомби и барнаклы, но большую часть игры мы проводим в сражениях с силами Альянса, но к счастью у нас в игре будут союзники, пусть и немного. Большую часть игры мы все же проходим в одиночестве и молчании. \nВыбор оружия не очень большой, но верная монтировка всегда при нас, а еще гравитационная пушка, которой мы сможем притягивать и отталкивать объекты. Крайне забавная штука, так что рекомендую поэкспериментировать с ней.

It rarely ever, if it even does, crash, the options menu is fantastic, besides some weird UI designs, with varied graphics options, including a slightly limited FOV slider, proper AA and other basic graphics options, the control options are awesome with a wide range of fully rebindable keys, as well as a controller option but I'm not sure if those are rebindable, or even changeable at all, as well as pretty good audio options and even an option for enabling VR. Pretty fly port if you ask me.\n\n[h1]The Graphics/Performance[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are actually fantastic for this game. Character models are flawless with amazing facial animation, and animation in general, as well as fantastic gun models, pretty great particles, amazing looking water and some awesome lighting effects. The only downside is the geometry isn't the best and some objects are blocky and not very well modelled. Besides that the game looks fantastic. It's honestly really hard to believe this game came out in 2004. The performance in this game is simeply incredible as well. I'm able to run it at 240-300 FPS all the time on an FX 4300 OC's to 4.5GHz(it changes all the time I know I'm still working on finding a stable clock speed) and an EVGA GTX 750 ti. It runs phenominally and looks awesome.\n\n[h1]The Story/Atmosphere/Characters[/h1]\n\nThis game's story is really fucking good, and I mean REALLY fucking good. All the characters are very interesting, very well written and extremely well voice acted. The story is just something I can't explain. It's the story of a group of rebels and some scientists trying to bring down the reign of an alien armed force known as the Combine as well as their... I guess leader of which I've forgotten the name of. Also the greatest thing about playing as Gordan Freeman is that you are literally him. He's a silent protaganist which makes it feel like you are him. Every thought, spoken word and action is you and, to me, he is the best god damn protaganist ever. Also, throughout the entire game there are absolutely no cutscenes. Everything is told through gameplay and background details. It's a game you have to really pay attention to as you play to truly understand all the shit that's happening. Not to mention the villain is actually really good. The ending had me a little mixed on how I felt about him but he was generally good not gonna lie. And speaking of the ending holy shit is it quite the ending. Also the atmosphere is kinda hard to explain for this game. It's a very rich atmosphere that contains a lot of different things in it. War, horror, espionage, sci-fi. It's hard to narrow down exactly but holy shit is it a fucking rich ass atmosphere.\n\n[h1]The Controls[/h1]\n\nThe controls for this game are awesome. Every control is mapped out very well, the options menu for the mouse is very nice with options for mouse smoothing, acceleration and even god damn raw mouse. It's fantastic and really there's not much else to say.\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay is really something else. You are 100% involved with everything you do in this game. Every single god damn thing. You kill the enemies, you press the buttons, you jump around, you swing the crowbar, it's all fucking you and it is glorious. The epic action all happens realtime, the firefights, the blowing up of striders, the mass murder of the Combine, everything. It is an epic game with epic action that makes you want more. Although I have some gripes with the game. The gunplay is less than pleasing with the lack of recoil, but somehow very wide bullet spread, of the automatic guns and the very weak and tedious pistol. The grenades are fine, albeit kinda finnicky, the RPG is cool as shit, the revolver is kinda hard to use but still awesome and the shotgun is fucking sweet, but the automatic rifles are not that great. \n\nThe AI in this game is also kinda questionable, although really fucking well made. The Combine AI just kinda sucks. It isn't basic it's actually quite complex with how they try to lure you out of hiding with grenades and how they try to flank you and all that shit. Their pathfinding is actually pretty great too. Your allies AI is awesome though. They actually move out of your fucking way if you're blocking them, are great at fighting, manage to use cover very well, are great at following and don't have any real pathfinding issues, besides sometimes when they won't follow you if you move to quickly, and too far, ahead, but that's forgiveable for the awesome AI that was given to the allies. See how it's done, other game developers? Valve knows how it's done. Also all the missions are just fucking awesome I can not stress that enough. Not to mention the extremely impressive physics engine that I can't believe existed in 2004, let alone 2016. Seriously Valve stop making Dota and shit and make a Half Life 3. Or at the very least finish the Episodes.\n\n[h1]The Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI'm going to be honest I did not like this game at all when I first played it. I just could not get into it. After giving it a second chance I have completely changed my opition on it and God do I absolutely love this game. There are little things such as the weird gunplay, weird Combine AI and cancerous ladders but besides all that it is an amazing game with awesome characters and a fantastic story. Seriously if you haven't picked this masterpiece up you NEED to play it. For God's sake it's $10 on Steam and like half that on G2A. Hell, pick up the episodes if you're already done this game those are even cheaper on both Steam and G2A and I'm sure are just as good. Sadly, there doesn't seem to be any future plans for Half Life Episode 3 or just Half Life 3 in general, since Valve said they're not planning on doing anymore work on these games and are instead working on their other series, such as Portal and Left 4 Dead, as well as eventually finished the Source 2 engine. This game is a pure masterpiece that any FPS fan seriously needs to play. Now stop reading this god damn review and play this shit already. This review does not do this game justice in the slightest as there are way more people who can explain this game much better than I can. Honestly I probably undersold the game if anything. Just... just go play it I don't even know why you're still reading this.\n\n[h1]The Verdict[/h1]\n\n[b][i]Port - 10/10\nGraphics - 8/10\nPerformance - 10/10\nStory - 10/10\nAtmosphere - 9.5/10\nCharacters - 10/10\nControls - 9/10\nGameplay - 10/10\nAI - 9/10\n\nAverage Rating - 9.5/10\n\nActual Rating - 10/10","timestamp_created":1463483509,"timestamp_updated":1463522516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23035136","author":{"steamid":"76561198081402352","num_games_owned":479,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":840,"last_played":1653884343},"language":"schinese","review":"怎么说呢，本人出生以来，第一次接触halflife系列，就是halflife2，刚开始时看表哥玩的，2006年左右。后来自己开始尝试，当时玩到运河船道那一关就打不过去了，就气馁了，看着后面灰色的关卡图案，别提多失望了，半夜做梦都梦见自己达到了后面的关卡。当时我不到十岁，所以对未解锁但有关卡的图标，特别好奇。（做梦时真的想象着后面的关卡，当时我才6-7岁）当时我表哥不让我动他的电脑，我是趁他不注意才玩的，除了他没人有可能知道咋玩，虽然他也不知道。\n\n之后再和半条命2打交道是10岁左右的时候，还是看我表哥玩，他下了个破解版的，所有关卡全通了的，我别提多开心了，只可惜，他的电脑出了bug，超级卡。当时玩《跟着弗里曼》一关，画面没动，就被狙击手狙死了。\n\n12岁时，我对计算机也有了更多的了解，我便自己开始玩半条命2。我自己第一次下载，还下了个带病毒的，把家里电脑整瘫痪了。之后总算下了一个完整版的，自己乐在其中。之后13岁，我有了我自己的电脑，半条命2也是装上的首选。\n\n不过16岁时，因为小弟的勾引，我入了steam（别打我！）我当时还是别人送我的激活码，我激活了半条命2，拥有了steam的第三款游戏。其实就是2015年8月末。\n\n我和半条命整整十年的历程，如今，这依然是我最爱的游戏之一。起源引擎不断在更新，这也很令我欣慰，记得刚接触时，人说话嘴不动。其实，我第一次将半条命从头打到尾，也是在2015年年底。之前只是玩了几个关卡而已。我和我小兄弟，一起玩半条命2，玩《沙地陷阱》，老有人把车开翻，我们笑着，从未互相指责。\n\n真的很期待半条命3，因为这部游戏即使再优秀，也可能会被比下去，除了新作，也是为了让它再次站上高峰。这既是童年的回忆，也是未来的展望。","timestamp_created":1463480834,"timestamp_updated":1463480834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":12,"weighted_vote_score":"0.729141652584075928","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23032883","author":{"steamid":"76561198208312040","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":593,"last_played":1463790001},"language":"english","review":"TOTES AMAZE","timestamp_created":1463464040,"timestamp_updated":1463464040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23032531","author":{"steamid":"76561198279042067","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":332,"last_played":1470393283},"language":"schinese","review":"不错的射击游戏，剧情也不错～蛮喜欢的(´･ω･`)，而且价格也是很公道，是经典中的经典哇(ง •̀_•́)ง","timestamp_created":1463461346,"timestamp_updated":1463461346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23032086","author":{"steamid":"76561198068278298","num_games_owned":352,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1922,"last_played":1618847469},"language":"brazilian","review":"Uns dos melhores jogos que já joguei em toda a minha vida, MELHOR FPS DE TODOS, História Fenomenal e Final de explodir cabeças.
