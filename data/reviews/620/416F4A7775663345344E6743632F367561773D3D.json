Πέφτεις, καίγεσαι, λιώνεις από οξύ, κάνεις τραμπολίνο και όλα αυτά για χάρη της επιστήμης (ή έτσι θέλουν να νομίζεις). Και σαν απλός άνθρωπος καταφέρνεις να επιβιώσεις. Από τα πάντα.\n\nΑν βάλουμε μέσα και το κύριο συστατικό του παιχνιδιού, τον ταυτόχρονο μεταφορέα θέσης, γνωστό και ως τηλεμεταφορέα, μας κάνει ένα παιχνίδι που θα πάρει ΩΡΕΣ για να το τερματίσετε.\n\nΑ και για τούρτα αφήνω το καλύτερο, you monster.

This is probably one of the best games I have ever had the privilage of playing. The puzzles are well executed and the games physics also. In some parts, I had to look really hard for the way to the next brain-bender. The story is a direct upgrade from it's predecessor. In Portal, all you were was a lab rat, doing endless tests and killing a roude A.I (it's still an amazing game), but in this, there is well-developed characters with exquisite writing (Wheatley is my fav) and well-timed humour, a journey that takes you throughout the entire (by that, I mean ENTIRE) Apeture lab and even a backstory about the origin of GlaDoS. The ending is most likely the best video game ending I have ever seen, and I won't spoil it, but expect the unexpected. Level design is near flawless, taking you through 5-6 different areas of Apeture you have never seen before. About here, I would talk about the Co-op mode where you play as Peabody and Atlas (the two you see at the end), but the person I have tried to play it with's internet keeps cutting out, but from what I have played, it is one of the best work-together co-op modes ever (in my opinion), rivalling Left 4 Dead and Ranbow Six: Siege.
