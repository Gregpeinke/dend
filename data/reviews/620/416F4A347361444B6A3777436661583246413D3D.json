Now you can enjoy a game where that same dark humor is now 200% less subtle!\n\nThis game immediately alienates those who were familiar with the first title by throwing an updated version of the Source engine in the game, which gives a distinct disconnect between how you're controlling and what's actually onscreen compared to the first game. \n\nArtstyle is okay. The updated look of the Portals is pretty poor compared to the first game, and the only area of the game that really stood out visually was That Middle Section of the Game I won't describe because spoilers. The rest of the game suffers from too little white space with which to shoot portals. You have to go into the single player accepting the fact that you aren't playing Portal, a first person puzzle platformer, but Portal 2, a first person adventure game.\n\nTo go with the game's new role as an adventure game, the voice acting direction to lose all semblance of the bland robotic tone from the first game. Steven Merchant has hardly any distortion applied to his voice, and H.K. Simmons's script is literally nothing but one-off jokes that prevent the player from properly connecting with him. Ellen McLain is fine, nothing fantastic but she has to walk through the same sludge script as the rest of the cast. The script just sucks, too many blantant attempts at jokes, not enough off-kilter or black humor which helped lend the game its unique atmosphere. So many elements from Portal 1 are reused that you wonder why Valve bothered. \n\nCan't comment on multiplayer, have no interest getting frustrated trying to complete puzzles that are likely by Valve's standards 4 times as hard as single player ones. No comment on the workshop levels either, no experience with modding or level designing.\n\nGame's lack of a true difficulty curve results in resetting at multiple points in the game while you learn new concepts instead of adding on to previously learned ones.\n\nPlot is dumb, a bunch of material that stresses the plausability of a scenario I found perfectly reasonable in the first game by way of overexposition.","timestamp_created":1358614761,"timestamp_updated":1442814206,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.190837979316711426","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6298586","author":{"steamid":"76561198063194583","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":3449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1093,"last_played":1623687551},"language":"english","review":"The singular most amazing, mind-boggling, brain-teasing and beautiful puzzler I have ever seen. 10/10.

Jogo bonito e complexo o melhor puzzle que já joguei na minha vida. Este esta bem mais desafiador e melhor que a edição anterior.","timestamp_created":1357758152,"timestamp_updated":1511461668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"411512","author":{"steamid":"76561197970446488","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":714,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":687,"last_played":1372286951},"language":"english","review":"unico.","timestamp_created":1357755867,"timestamp_updated":1357755867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5563055","author":{"steamid":"76561198051979333","num_games_owned":993,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":773,"last_played":1385263347},"language":"english","review":"simplemente, una obra maestra....","timestamp_created":1357750059,"timestamp_updated":1357750059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5485149","author":{"steamid":"76561198050567489","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":426,"last_played":1504810725},"language":"russian","review":"Очень интересная игра, мозги потренировать), да и так для удовольствия неплохо.","timestamp_created":1357732447,"timestamp_updated":1357732447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4saDKj7wCfaX2FA=="}
