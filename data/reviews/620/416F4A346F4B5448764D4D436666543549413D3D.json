I love how it looks, plays, and most of the puzzles. The enviorments are nice for the most part, even the small characters have specific and memorable personalities, and there were moments that made me shocked. However, there are a lot of problems with this game. My first major complaint is that they remove so many of the portal-able surfaces making it turn into a game of Spot the Surface than Portal 2. That happens mainly because of the enviorments being forced and eventually becoming bland. A big room is cool with the soundtrack for the first two times, but eventually becomes overused. The next issue I have is the puzzles. The puzzles later on are meant to be peiced together, but it's still annoying when you are pretty much trained to look for every and any solution possible just to have these come along and make you overthink everything. There was one puzzle near the very end where I had to go to one side of death water to press button and then do this and that and go there and avoid the turrets and it just became too much. This game isn't that easy to replay. I have only played a bit of the story as I have already compleated it on my Xbox copy before I got Steam. I guess it's good, but not such an amazing game that I would say it's better that Portal 1. If I had to rate it from 1 to 10 (1 being worst, 10 being best), I'd give it a 9. Almost there, but not quite.","timestamp_created":1389388779,"timestamp_updated":1389388779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8652007","author":{"steamid":"76561198111698699","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":643,"last_played":1389443734},"language":"german","review":"cooles spiel coole rätsel","timestamp_created":1389388506,"timestamp_updated":1389388506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8651901","author":{"steamid":"76561198119297170","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":832,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":597,"last_played":1518537510},"language":"russian","review":"Рекомендую!","timestamp_created":1389387974,"timestamp_updated":1389387974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8651488","author":{"steamid":"76561198116335634","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2922,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1476,"last_played":1525652044},"language":"russian","review":"spaaaaaaaaaaace","timestamp_created":1389386053,"timestamp_updated":1389386053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500619590282440186","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8651356","author":{"steamid":"76561198095580301","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4386,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2382,"last_played":1480971370},"language":"spanish","review":"Otra obra maestra de VALVe.

Co-op is the best co-op I've played, genuinely collaborative, requiring synced actions at its hardest. Several new science tools to play around with, like light bridges, air funnels and gels(speed, jump and one for making surfaces portal-friendly). Co-op and SP have their own storyline and characters; they relate to one another, but without either spoiling the other. Level editor with leaderboards. Hilarious comedy, without losing drama and threat.\n\nCons: More characters and dialog mean less isolation and loneliness, which were part of the appeal of the first(all alone, with a psychotic AI, in a deadly facility).\n\nMy recommendation: Even if you don't think you're that good at puzzle games(I'm not), play this.
