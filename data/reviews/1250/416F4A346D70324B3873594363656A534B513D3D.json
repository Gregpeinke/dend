Bunlardan ilk akla gelen Counter-Strike’tır. Bu modlar hem tek başına isim olurken, diğer yandan yapımcılarına da iyi gelir sağladılar. Daha başka örnekler de verilebilir. Son olarak bu zincire Killing Floor (KF) katıldı. Yapım, Tripwire Interactive tarafından geliştirildi. Tripwire Interactive, aslında yabancı değil. Firma daha önce Unreal Tournament 2003 için Red Orchestra modunu yapmıştı. Daha sonra Red Orchestra’yı Unreal Tournament 2004 için de hazırladılar. KF’nin de aslında çıkış noktası Unreal Tournament 2004. Yapım ilk olarak 2005’te mod olarak geliştirildi ve kullanıcılara sunuldu. 2008’de ise son güncellemesi yapıldı. Bir sene sonra yani 2009’da da mod olmaktan çıktı ve kendi başına satılmaya başlanan bir oyun oldu. \n\nNereden nereye\nKF, Left 4 Dead (L4D) oynayanlara yabancı gelmeyecektir. Gene üstümüze gelen zombi ordusunu durdurmaya çalışıyoruz. Yapım kısa ve klişe bir hikayeye de sahip. Londra’daki Horzine Biotech adında biyoteknoloji şirketinin yaptığı araştırmalar kötü gidiyor, zombiler oluşuyor. Konu bilinmese de olur deyip, bu ufak ayrıntıyı geçebiliriz. KF, multiplayer ve singleplayer seçeneklerini sunuyor, tabii ki işin aslı multiplayer’da yatıyor. Altı kişiye kadar co-op desteği sunan oyun içinde, Londra’nın sokaklarını, Biotech laboratuarlarını içine alan altı farklı harita var. Oyunla birlikte gelen bu haritalar güzel tasarlanmış, ancak sayısı az. Fakat KF için yeni haritalar yapılıyordu. \n\nKilling Floor\n\"Berserker perk'i son seviyedeyken, elektrikli testere ile ölümcül oluyor.\"\n\nYapımda perk sistemi kullanılıyor. Field Medic, Support Specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Berserker ve Firebug olmak üzere altı farklı perk var. Bunlar en fazla 5. seviyeye kadar çıkıyor. Tabii ki her seviyenin belli bir avantajı ve şartları var. Mesela Firebug’ta 1. seviye olmak için Flamethrower ile 25.000 hasar puanı vermeniz gerekiyor. Ancak seviye atladığınızda bu size; seçtiğiniz perk’in silahını daha ucuza satın almak, daha fazla hasar vermek vs… gibi ekstra özellikler sağlıyor. İsterseniz oyundayken, aşama sonlarında perk’nizi değiştirebilirsiniz. \n\nHaritaların belli yerlerinde para karşılığı silah, cephane, zırh alabileceğimiz satış noktaları bulunuyor. Parayı da öldürdüğümüz zombilerden kazanıyoruz. Her aşamayı geçtiğimizde, ekstra olarak da biraz daha para geliyor. Satıcılar haritadaki her aşama sonunda, farklı noktalarda, kısa bir süreliğine açık oluyor. Mesela Manor haritasında birinci aşama sonunda bina dışında satış noktasından bir şeyler alırken, ikinci aşamayı geçtiğinizde bu sefer satıcının yeri bina içinde üst katta oluyor (Zaten yeri kırmızı oklarla da gösteriliyor). KF’de; Flamethrower, bıçak, balta, elektrikli testere, Crossbow, pompalı, otomatik tüfek, el bombasının yer aldığı 12 farklı silah var. Genel olarak silahlar yeterli. Ayrıca silahları sadece satış noktalarından almıyoruz. Cephane, silah ve zırhlar haritaların belli yerlerinde karşımıza çıkabiliyor. Yalnız her aşamada bunların yerleri rastgele şekilde değişiyor.\n\nKilling Floor\n\"Siren attığı çığlıkla, zırhımız yüzde yüz olsa bile sağlığımızı azaltabiliyor.\"\n\nAç düşmanlar\n\nSürekli olarak belli bir aşama olduğunu belirttim, bunu biraz daha açalım. Haritalarda zombiler kalabalık gruplar halinde, en son çıkan boss’a kadar, sayıları ve çeşitleri her seferinde artarak kademe kademe geliyor. Tabii ki seçtiğimiz zorluk seviyesi ve oyunun süresine göre bunu arttırabilir veya azaltabiliriz. Yalnız KF’nin tadı en zorda çıkıyor. Toplamda boss’un dahil olduğu 9 farklı düşman tipi var. Bunlar Clot, Bloat, Stalker, Gorefast, Crawler, Siren, Scrake, Fleshpound ve Patriarch (Boss düşman).\n","timestamp_created":1404072982,"timestamp_updated":1404072982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":26,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.690948009490966797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10952149","author":{"steamid":"76561198073417729","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":7424,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3012,"last_played":1496595588},"language":"spanish","review":"un juego ideal y adictivo para jugarlo con amigos","timestamp_created":1404072455,"timestamp_updated":1404072455,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10951587","author":{"steamid":"76561198069998937","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":556,"last_played":1427516007},"language":"english","review":"Really Good and scary fun","timestamp_created":1404071462,"timestamp_updated":1404071462,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10949951","author":{"steamid":"76561198062562856","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3854,"last_played":1550446447},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego exeleten se los recomiendo es muy entretenido porque es de  survival horror :D, lo bueno eque puedes jugar con tus amigos.\nTiene graficos algo feos pero aun asi se puede jugar y se puede pasar el tiempo.","timestamp_created":1404068747,"timestamp_updated":1404068747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10949490","author":{"steamid":"76561198034902134","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8171,"last_played":1613582174},"language":"russian","review":"ну что сказать....она НАМНОГО лучше л4д,очень веселая игруля,с хорошим саундом\nЕсли вы любите крошить зомби со своими друзьями,очень большое разнообразие карт и оружия,то она для вас","timestamp_created":1404067880,"timestamp_updated":1404067880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10949249","author":{"steamid":"76561198067352356","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1404686396},"language":"english","review":"I wish there were more guns and the game was more organized.

Let's see, this game has no destructible environment. If you throw a grenade at a wall, the wall does not collapse, WTF?! ARE YOU SERIOUS?! Look at Battlefield 4, that game has falling skyscrapers! Second, this game is too unrealistic. I mean, seriously, man-eating mutants? Wow, that's sooooooo realistic... NOT! Third, how does the enemy in the 11th round talk? Mutants cannot talk! They are NOT humans! Fourth, the game is obviously using an old, crappy engine. Have you guys seen Battlefield Hardline's Frostbite 4 engine? It looks FANTASTIC! Last but not least, this game is waaaaay too boring. The maps are puny. No wonder why this game has no vehicles like tanks or jets. Look at Battlefield 4, that game has GIGANTIC maps and the game is EXTREMELY fast paced and NOT slow paced as s**t at all! \n\nI highly do NOT recommend this game, but I do highly recommend Battlefield 4, a true military simulator.","timestamp_created":1404010074,"timestamp_updated":1404010074,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4049643874168396","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10926282","author":{"steamid":"76561198053009776","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":218038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164196,"last_played":1656166935},"language":"koreana","review":"제대로 할 줄 몰라서 재미없는 경우도 많으므로 무기 세팅 정석을 알려드립니다.\n무기팩의 경우 머스켓 빼고는 전부 장난감.\n\n# 샤프슈터\n1. mk23, revolver, cross-bow (장거리형)\n2. m14, musket (단거리형)\n3. m14, lever (단거리형)\n\n# 서포트 스페셜리스트\n1. aa12, hunting shotgun, katana (최종 트리)\n2. shotgun, hunting shotgun, fire axe (돈없을 때)\n\n# 데몰리션\n1. m32, m79, mk23 (플파 사냥용)\n\n# 메딕\n1. mp7,mp5,m7a\n2. mk23, cross-bow, mp5 (보스전)\n\n# 버서커\n1. katana, fire axe, lever (솔로형)\n2.

Why? The reason is simple. Killing Floor beyond beginner mode was geared for teamwork. There is, without a doubt, no way you can start this game and be good without a team.\n\nKilling Floor has a unique spawning system where the zombies will always spawn local to the players. They will specifically target areas that are not covered and work to surround you relentlessly. Unless you are a professional, have around a hundred hours on your belt, a level 5 minimal (out of 6 levels) character, you will not survive solo.\n\nTo break it down, the classes are divided into Field Medic, Support Specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Berserker, Firebug and Demolition.\n\nThose who love to play support roles, Field Medic and obviously Support Specialist are for you. You will either heal your allies while killing what they can't, or wielding doors shut strategically as the Support Specialist.\n\nSharpshooters and Commando have their own specialized targets. These two make a good pair in taking out the strongest zombies together. What a Sharpshooter sniper cannot kill in a single blow, you can count on the Commando to finish off with their ability to see invisible targets and the zombie health bars.\n\nIn addition, Support Specialist is also the shotgun spray king. Along with Firebug that causes damage over time, and the destructive Demolition's firepower, you will have the perfect selection of crowd controllers who take out all the weak ones as the second line of defense.\n\nAs for your first line, who else can do a better job than the Berserker? Well... except for the unexpected tank, the Field Medic. While the Berserker is an excellent melee unit that cannot be pinned down easily, the medic, when armored, can resist death from even the boss for a good 10-15 seconds head on while your ally may be mowed down in a second.\n\nKilling Floor still does seasonal events, gives special unlocks, and continually adds new maps and game modes. You will not be disappointed.\n\nBe warned, Killing Floor is not a game to be played alone. Personally, I highly recommend a team of at least 4 individuals. By mid levels, you can go with 3. Later on, you can even solo. But as a team, you can take on even the most biggest, baddest of zombies on the worst difficulties.\n\nCan you ditch your soloing habits from the world of FPS and adapt to the teamwork requirements of Killing Floor? Or will you be the first one eaten alive...","timestamp_created":1403994132,"timestamp_updated":1403994132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10920540","author":{"steamid":"76561198086229453","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1422045619},"language":"brazilian","review":"loco","timestamp_created":1403993556,"timestamp_updated":1403993556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10920486","author":{"steamid":"76561198044016288","num_games_owned":741,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5585,"last_played":1634227430},"language":"english","review":"Best zombie/horde mode game.","timestamp_created":1403993447,"timestamp_updated":1403993447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10919577","author":{"steamid":"76561198142030395","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":971,"last_played":1442707104},"language":"english","review":"this is a fun game to play with your friends.","timestamp_created":1403991402,"timestamp_updated":1403991402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10917505","author":{"steamid":"76561198001279212","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4082,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2144,"last_played":1425253429},"language":"english","review":"super fun game, grabbed for 5 bucks...awesome 5 bucks, nuff said","timestamp_created":1403987225,"timestamp_updated":1403987225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mp2K8sYCcejSKQ=="}
