Playing as a random scientist who survived an explosion due to shear chance, only to find yourself in the middle of a military onslaught and an inter-dimensional invasion brings a feeling that is akin to something like Die Hard. Your survival is the one thing that's stopping the plans of the enemy from moving forward, hence why you feel like a bad*** when you manage to ruin everything for them. \n     All the guns in the game pack a punch and it feels good to shoot. The more different weapons you find, the more opportunities you get to absolutely destroy the enemy, even the ones you previously had a difficult time with. The enemies themselves are fun to fight to. The marines can throw grenades, shoot weapons, and man vehicles like you do. The aliens are structured from weakest to strongest, each one having their own ability, requiring you to think ahead before a fight.\n     There aren't any cut-scenes in the game, so you find out about the world through the dialog; which makes it much easier for those who don't want to sit through a story and just want to go straight to fighting. One criticism I will make is with the movement. Your character moves like he's on ice sometimes. This helps with puzzles, but if your ever trying to walk toward a short 2-foot ledge, you might have the chance of slipping off. I only had this issue in the beginning, and you get used to it after a while (although, I can't tell you how many times I died because of one wrong step). TL;DR This is a just a fantastic game. The movement could be better, but I would still HIGHLY recommend it to any gamer.","timestamp_created":1587791936,"timestamp_updated":1587791936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67974617","author":{"steamid":"76561198013526162","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1612754648},"language":"english","review":"There is nothing to dislike about this game, I only wish there where more or that Valve decides to go back and remaster all of the early versions to give them the graphic facelift they deserve.\nI love everything about these games, the problem solving, the story line, humour and the sounds.\nI recently rescued HL2 disk from my now retired XBox only to discover that I can continue playing it in my 360, it was a joyous occasion which lead to a 5-6 hour nostalgia binge.","timestamp_created":1587791584,"timestamp_updated":1587791584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67974466","author":{"steamid":"76561198153980436","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1587834423},"language":"russian","review":".","timestamp_created":1587791322,"timestamp_updated":1587791322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67973440","author":{"steamid":"76561198260168405","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1165,"last_played":1659220237},"language":"english","review":"deez","timestamp_created":1587789677,"timestamp_updated":1642028704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67972067","author":{"steamid":"76561198365283998","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1587786275},"language":"english","review":"So, I only played this game with a friend of mine back in the mid 2000s.

As variedade de armas, os inimigos, os cenários, tudo isso é excelente, realmente nota 10, o jogo é bem mais longo do que eu esperava, levei 9 horas na dificuldade normal para zerar, e não se deixe enganar, pois na dificuldade normal, ele é bem desafiador, mesmo que você já seja acostumado a jogar games de FPS.\nEm relação à jogabilidade, é onde possui aspectos bons e ruins. Basicamente é aquela jogabilidade padrão, estilo DOOM e CS 1.6, o que é muito bom! Porém, uma coisa que me incomodou MUITO é a velocidade do personagem, pois além de ele ser MUITO rápido (estilo DOOM), ele meio que \"desliza\" quando você agacha. Para algumas partes do game é OK, porém o jogo exige de você muitas fases de plataforma, em que é necessário ter precisão nos pulos, e isso me irritou muito, pois a jogabilidade rápida, torna extremamente imprecisa a movimentação e precisão dos tiros, muitas fases não combinam com esse estilo rápido de gameplay, e me estressou em momentos que era preciso fazer um pulo, caindo, tendo que voltar trechos ou morrendo pelo dano de queda. Não podemos considerar isso uma limitação da época, eu realmente acho que isso foi uma falha, meio que indo na Hype de DOOM.\nOutro ponto negativo, mas esse podemos considerar uma limitação da época, é que alguns trechos (a minoria) são pouco intuitivos, dificultando você saber o que precisa ser feito ou aonde ir, meio que você têm que descobrir tudo sozinho com tentativa e erro, não é algo que atrapalhe muito, mas \"empaquei\" umas 3x no decorrer do jogo, e fui ver algum vídeo no Youtube ensinando a passar os trechos. Mas lembrando que não é nada que interfira tão negativamente, pode ser que você passe tudo de primeira sem olhar nenhum \"detonado\" na internet.\nUma coisa que me deixou um pouco triste também, é que o game não possui conquistas, nem apenas uma mostrando que \"zerou\", o que seria muito bacana para pessoas como eu, que gostam de fazer os desafios do game.\nEm relação ao multiplayer, é simplesmente FANTÁSTICO, se você gosta de um TEAM DEATCHMATCH frenético de doer os dedos, vai adorar. Eu me surpreendi com a quantidade de servers online, inclusive com ping bom para o Brasil, eu imaginava que era um game \"morto\" em multiplayer, mas surpreendentemente têm muitas pessoas jogando.\nResumindo, é um Clássico dos jogos de PC, mesmo sendo antigo, é um jogo que envelheceu muito bem, e com certeza vai agradar todos que gostam de FPS, independente da idade!","timestamp_created":1587780843,"timestamp_updated":1587781159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629629611968994141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67963567","author":{"steamid":"76561198108046895","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":697,"last_played":1587279678},"language":"english","review":"I would make sense of what the hype was about at the time.

This game is fantastic. Absolutely great gameplay there's always new weapons for you to find even in the end game levels. Keeping players on the game. Whenever there's story it's always good and keeping you invested but, I must say the story is a little bit lacking. It's about a page long if you write out the plot points. However, due to the technical limitations at the time you can only fit so much in. While I love this game there are a few flaws. Levels are sometimes extremely long and tedious. Chapter 8 not going to say any details for spoiler's sake. However, it is extremely long and I tried but I couldn't beat it without a guide. Same thing for Chapter 12. Long, tedious. Not to say both of them are bad levels, but it is just painful to go through them. Expect to spend a good few hours on them without a guide. One last point before wrapping up. If you are here to invest quite a few hours into this. There is little to no replay value except for some challenges you set for yourself, but I don't think that just a few long levels and the little replay value will ever stop my newfound love for this franchise.","timestamp_created":1587761369,"timestamp_updated":1587761548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67954241","author":{"steamid":"76561198311569241","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1663,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1533,"last_played":1589986743},"language":"turkish","review":"Nasıl her fantastik filmde esinlenilen bir Yüzüklerin Efendisi karakteri veya sahnesi varsa günümüz aksiyon oyunlarının da esinlenilen bir Half Life özelliği bulunur.","timestamp_created":1587760370,"timestamp_updated":1587760370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67953660","author":{"steamid":"76561198313532861","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":828,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":398,"last_played":1638902259},"language":"turkish","review":"i","timestamp_created":1587759542,"timestamp_updated":1587759542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67953659","author":{"steamid":"76561198422835851","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":294,"last_played":1587760496},"language":"turkish","review":"Çok gereksiz müq\n","timestamp_created":1587759541,"timestamp_updated":1587759541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67952916","author":{"steamid":"76561198033129399","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":111,"playtime_forever":1756,"playtime_last_two_weeks":179,"playtime_at_review":480,"last_played":1660499532},"language":"english","review":"Imagine this\n\nAn amazing first person shooter, with graphics that don't look to terrible, released in 1998, with only some mistakes.\nPros:\nFun FPS\nGreat story\nLittle bugs\nModding is free\nCons:\nGraphics dont 100% hold up well\nSome chapters may seem boring\n\nIn conclusion, if you want this but made even better (somehow) then play Black Mesa.
