After 2 or 3 playthroughs I can still find slight details which I missed on the previous run.\n\nGraphic wise, the game has its unique art. No, it is not photo realistic but I still love how it looks. Columbia immerses you into the early 20st century atmosphere like no other game, and the abrupt change to Rapture and its 1950s look really takes you by surprise. The amount of work put into every single part of the map by the artists is truly worth mentioning. Bioshock Infinite is a game in which you need to explore, see and experience, because there is much more to do and learn than just the main story.\n\nThe storyline is spectacular. I've played many games which had an amazing storyline that really gripped me, but none other left me with such a fulfillment as this game.  It has complexity, mystery, great characters, great setting and great pace. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't give many details, but boy... what a mind blowing experience.\n\nAnd now we come to gameplay. I've read other reviews and I must say that I agree, the aspect that Bioshock Infinite lacks the most is the actual gameplay mechanics. Don't get me wrong, it is not like the game is unplayable or boring. I tend to play my games on normal difficulty because I don't really like challenges (and, let's face it, I suck). However, I found myself increasing the difficulty on the DLCs because I hardly died during the main storyline. There are too many action fights and gun shooting which just seem a bit repetitive and unnecesary. They are not so bad, though, but you won't need much help defeating them all. I actually forgot about the vigors (or plasmids) most of the times because I didn't really need them. That tells how something which was pretty cool (vigors) was kind of wasted because of how easy the game was. Anyway, I know I've developed more on what I consider negative about the game and not so much about the good things, but take it more as a rant because it hurts to see a great game wasting good mechanics.\n\nAll in all, the game is GREAT. The DLCs are really really worth it, I regret not having played them sooner. If you like shooters, not-so-long-to-finish games, great storylines and outstanding artwork... this is your game! Now, if you want to customize your character, great gun shooting and lots of playtime hours... you might want to consider this buy, maybe watch a couple of walkthroughs before reaching a decision.\n\nI hope I helped you!","timestamp_created":1470880664,"timestamp_updated":1481168175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24817539","author":{"steamid":"76561198069861226","num_games_owned":601,"num_reviews":154,"playtime_forever":1487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1446,"last_played":1425067549},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen juego de disparos.

BioShock Infinite - первая игра, после которой появилось желание выразить свой восторг. Ни одна игра ещё не оставляла столь положительных эмоций, прости Халфа и 4-й принц персии. Мир созданный Кевином Левином проработан до мелочей, что если ты будешь  не просто бегать и гасить врагов, а прослушаешь ещё журналы, то сам поверишь в этот мир, что он возможно где-то есть в других мирах. О самой игре, в целом, можно только сказать - Браво!!! \n\nДля тех кто не хочет читать всю эту писанину и не играл в игру, скажу лишь одно - сыграйте и пройдите её до конца, это одна из тех игр, что западают в душу, которую вы не забудете.\n\nА теперь немного опишу игру в общих чертах:\n\nОтдельной части заслуживает Элизабет. Самый живой и естественный по характеру персонаж, в некоторых людях меньше жизненности, чем в ней. Проходя игру ты видишь как растёт и меняется персонаж, от юной милашки познающей окружающий мир до всезнающей и холодной женщины, которой предстоит сделать трудное решение. В неё невозможно не влюбиться. Не могу выразить словами всё восприятие этого персонажа, очень трудно было понимать, что игра пройдена и пора с ней прощаться. Немогу не написать про её танцы в начале игры, очень живые, заводные и естественные, возможно звучит очень странно, но самые настоящие и красивые танцы из всех игр, пока. Она так беззаботно танцует и налождается музыкой, что не хочется её прерывать\n\nВыражу своё мнение по другим аспектам игры, начнём с графики: она хороша, особенно всё. что связано с Элизабет, платья, голубые глаза, эмоции... она чудесна. Все остальные персонажи, тоже хорошо проработаны и очень разные. \n\nСюжет - выше всяких похвал, когда он начинает слегка наскучивать, сразу существенно меняется локация позволяющяя по другому взглянуть на бои. Появляются новые оружия, способности, тактические ходы и поэтому до конца игры сохраняется некая новизна.  История даётся постепенно и ускоряется под конец. На твоих глазах меняется весь мир, приводя всё к шикарнейшему финалу.\n\nЗвук - местами очень резкие, но очень интересные звуковые эффекты. Тут мало, что можно сказать, про сами звуки, разве, что про звонкие и тревожные крики Соловья, в целом они как во многих других играх, но вот музыка это нечто. Очень живописно передаётся атмосфера этого мира, в разных местах исполняется разная музыка оживляющая эту часть города. В церквях поют хором люди, в начале игры, когда все радосные, везде игрют песни начала 20-го века (такие беззаботные приятные), в бедном районе дети поют печальные песни, в каменоломне все хором поют.... мир живёт своей жизнью, законами. \n\nОтдельно скажу про локализацию, точнее о руссификации. Это - шикарно, лучшая озвучка, голоса очень натуральные и передают характер героев, все эмоции (особенно Элизабет и Буккер) переданы превосходно. Проходил игру дважды, на второй раз вдохновила как раз руссификация. Студия осуществившая перевод сделала невероятное, перевела все надписи и диалоги(даже мелкие и незначительные), и причём не просто через переводчик, а грамотно и эмоционально. \n\nПосле прохождения игры захотелось вспышку из \"Люди в чёрном\", чтобы всё забыть и пройти игру заново.

I love BioShock Infinite, but I'm also frustrated by it. This game could have been genre-defining, it could have been a revolution. Unfortunately all the best intentions and biggest budget in the world couldn't achieve the lofty goals they set. \n\nThe thematic elements are genius, how they turned their limitation of linearity into a beautiful story and theme of its own, but at what cost? As much as I still enjoy re-playing the game, the gorgeous art and top draw acting can't disguise that the underlying systems don't mesh with what they're trying to do- the mass murder just doesn't feel appropriate to this setting (these are regular cops and downtrodden folk coming at you, not jabbering zombies or mutated monstrosities) and Infinite's gunplay is lackluster compared to even other entries in its own series. Which means some parts are a bit of a slog to get through, and you often have to mentally divorce the moment to moment gameplay from the overarching story.\n\nLike the original games, the floating city of Columbia is the real star of BioShock Infinite, and it's a wonderful place to visit in all its multi-dimensional incarnations, looting every container in sight and picking up audio diaries as you go. While there are indeed moments of quiet, like exploring a sunny beach or roaming the amusements arcade, most of the time you're fighting your way through the place. \n\nThat wouldn't be so bad if the fighting wasn't so dull, with encounters being quite frequent and always playing out similarly without much in the way of enemy variety and no ability to plan before battles. I mean, you CAN lay down traps with Vigours, but this uses up too much juice to be very practical for much of the game. All enemies are openly hostile, there's no middle ground like with Big Daddies, stealth is useless and you can't carry around extra weapons or resources like health packs. This leads to frantically scrounging through trash cans and corpses in the heat of battle to find health items a lot of the time. Eventually you acquire enough Vigour powers and gear upgrades that the fighting starts to become interesting, but at that point you're nearing the end of the game. Still, it's all pulled off with a fair bit of pizazz using some seriously cool effects (flaming electrified crows!) and a wonderfully reactive soundtrack that plays little stingers when you get headshots and the like. \n\nYour main goal of course is to rescue Elizabeth from the city, and she is an eminently likeable and believable character that shows real emotion (in cutscenes). Out of cutscenes, Elizabeth is completely ignored by EVERYTHING, even though she's what they're after (okay, with one exception, when she's abducted OFF SCREEN). She rarely feels like a real person outside of very specific interactions during actual gameplay, reverting to a glass-eyed automaton for a lot of the time with none of the dynamism or responsiveness shown pre-release, falling well short of expectations set in the same category by Naughty Dog or Valve. Her story's great, her design is mostly great, the voice acting's great (if a bit breathy), but she's just not very well realized in the actual GAME part of the game. In combat, the mechanic of her randomly throwing you supplies is also pretty awkward. After 100+ hours I can kinda predict when it's likely to happen, but there's definitely some randomness as to when she'll bother to toss you that vital vial. \n\nMaybe I love Infinite more for the dream of what it could have been, than the actual thing they delivered, I don't know. I think back to the original vision demo that Irrational produced, which promised untold freedom of combat and reactivity from the environment, plus a potentially much more interesting Elizabeth whose powers had more variety but were also hazardous to her health. The reality falls a bit short. It's still a very fun theme park ride of a game, held together with some top notch storytelling, but the environment is very nailed down and smaller scale than one would expect and you kinda have to grit your teeth through certain sections. \n\nAlthough I feel we saw barely half of their original intentions come to fruition, what we got to play through is still awe inspiring, moving and thought provoking. For comparison's sake, if Mass Effect 3 failed due to being rushed out and designed by committe, Infinite is the polar opposite, where years of complete freedom led to a mess of gameplay elements that never quite gel or reach their full potential but still make for a compelling, if flawed, experience. \n\nThey failed trying to do the impossible and I find that admirable. Definitely recommended.","timestamp_created":1470600905,"timestamp_updated":1470600905,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507943093776702881","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24765577","author":{"steamid":"76561198103671614","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":845,"last_played":1450482522},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite games ever, amazing history and desing, love it :)","timestamp_created":1470599862,"timestamp_updated":1470599862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502412557601928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24764422","author":{"steamid":"76561198003747367","num_games_owned":468,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1095,"last_played":1470697536},"language":"english","review":"A truly masterpiece, the story is GREAT and the visual is stunning!\n\n\nGreat game!","timestamp_created":1470595355,"timestamp_updated":1470595355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502412557601928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24764144","author":{"steamid":"76561198224001028","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":721,"last_played":1472079220},"language":"english","review":"I don't usually write reviews, but after experiencing this game I feel compelled to add my voice to the many that have already extolled Bioshock Infinite.\n\nI finished the main story several months ago and have played plenty of other games since, but my mind keeps rolling back to Bioshock.

[b]Traenos a la chica y borraras tu deuda[/b]\nEmpezamos en una barca en el medio del mar, sin saber como llegamos ahi ni hacia donde vamos, una noche lluviosa donde se divisa un faro que parece ser nuestro destino, al llegar alli los individuos nos abandonaran repitiendo la misma frase, traenos a la chica y borraras tu deuda, y eso es lo que pensamos hacer, verdad?\nEn la cima del faro encontraremos una especie de transporte que nos llevara donde da comienzo la aventura. Columbia, una ciudad flotante regida por un denominado Profeta.\n\nEn lo que al gameplay se refiere, puedo destacar las siguientes cosas. Una amplia variedad de armas y una variante de armas de otra faccion con funciones similares. Tambien dispondremos de vigorizantes, similares a un hechizo que consumen sal como si fuece mana. Estos tiene 2 variables de uso, de forma rapida presionando el boton o de forma sostenida para usarlos a modo de trampa y que se active cuando un enemigo pase cerca de el. Hay varios vigorizantes de diferentes usos y si se combinan entre ellos, es decir lanzarlos en cierto orden, se pueden lograr combinaciones que amplifican sus efectos.\nTambien tendremos 3 tipos de tiendas diferentes, unas para comprar municion, salud y sal, y las otras 2 para mejorar armas y vigorizantes en sus respectivos casos.\nLos mapeados son lineales salvo por algunas zonas esconidas o bloqueadas (estas requeriran de contar con ganzuas para poder acceder a ellas) que permiten encontrar voxafonos, telescopios y diarios, estos son los complementos para desentramar toda la historia y a los personajes que se nos presenten y tambien a la ciudad de Columbia.\n\nVisualmente es mucho mas colorido. por lo que vi. que Bioshock 1 y 2. Pasar de estar debajo del agua a estar en una ciudad entre las nubes ayuda mucho en estos casos. Porque permite crear un entorno que se siente mas vivo y colorido que sus predecesores.\n\nPara terminar me gustaria decir que jugue este juego en 2016 por primera vez y me bolo la cabeza porque esperaba un juego de tiros como a los que estaba acostumbrado y sin prestar mucha atencion a la historia y los detalles que me estaban contando, sin comprender lo que realmente estaba pasando. Lo acabo de volver a re jugar en 2020, y me asombra lo bien que envejecio este titulo.\n\nDejo links a los analisis del DLC Burial at Sea.\n\n[b][u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lambo215/recommended/214931/]ANALISIS BURIAL AT SEA EPISODIO 1[/url][/u][/b]\n[b][u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lambo215/recommended/214932?snr=1_5_9__402]ANALISIS BURIAL AT SEA EPISODIO 2[/url][/u][/b]","timestamp_created":1470578304,"timestamp_updated":1595630774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617388308048248291","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24760122","author":{"steamid":"76561198087215085","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1159,"last_played":1527437881},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая игра в которую я играл!!!!!","timestamp_created":1470578117,"timestamp_updated":1470578117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24758941","author":{"steamid":"76561198154563070","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":2599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2515,"last_played":1622241310},"language":"english","review":"Not perfect but certainly worth a playthrough, incredible optimization too.","timestamp_created":1470573001,"timestamp_updated":1591760210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502412557601928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24757531","author":{"steamid":"76561198022151453","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2249,"last_played":1470567335},"language":"brazilian","review":"Na hora de apreciar o cenário, ouvir dialogos e assistir ao game, confesso, ele é satisfatório.
