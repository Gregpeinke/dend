So you, armed only with a knife and a weak pistol, must face the vicious, hideous hordes. But you need not face them alone. Bringing friends is the only way to enjoy this game. So if you have friends, congratulations! You'll enjoy this game. If you enjoy immolating hallways of disgusting ghouls, you'll enjoy this game. If you like difficult levels, blood smeared hallways, haunting sounds, dim and flickering lights, and jump scares, you'll enjoy this game. And if you're like me, and enjoy sending entire packs of Satan's vagina crawlers back to the fiery, fleshy pits from whence they came with a single blast from a flamethrower as you laugh manically, watching your sanity slip away from the sheer violence and gore.....

The structure of the two games are quite different, with Killing Floor being more arena like and with waves. However the amount of mods available for this game is amazing, ranging from imported or newly created skins and weapons from other games to new enemy types like the Brute, new classes, and sometimes full mods such as one that recreates Aliens and Dead Space.

Here is my actual review and opinion.\n\nKilling Floor is a Zombie Horror Arcady-like FPS with RPG elements (Character class based leveling). The single player aspect of Killing Floor is not amazing, but is fun enough to keep you ocupied for a while at least. By yourself you pose a reasonable challenge to the zombies on the easy and normal difficulties, but on Hard and Nightmare you will find trouble, especially in the earlier waves. The game has two modes : Survival, where you are pitted against the Infected and fight through the waves to eventually fight the Patriarch (Boss Infected) and escape, and Missions, which have a set number of objective based gameplay which can be challenging (or frustrating) from time to time. I'd say that Survival is the real meat and bones of Killing Floor as the mission based gameplay can get tedious and boring from time to time, not to say the survival gameplay can't get boring....it just takes a hell of a lot longer. As I mentioned earlier in this review, You can take on the horde by yourself, BUT you can take on the horde with others online (or LAN). Here is where the community can ruin the game. People can leave mid-game (If you are one of these people who leave without a just reason then fuck you) shortening the list of survivors and your chances of winning the wave, Playing on a random server (reguardless of difficulty) People will more than likely votekick you for a low level of your selected class (Rember sir you were new at the game at one point too so if you have a high level and you votekick people with low levels then get over your superiority complex you fucking idiot). The community for this game is one of the reasons that the online is ruined in my opinion, as the servers with genuinely nice people (Or at least ones who'll play the game and try to have fun) is too damn low. If you're playing online I reccomend playing with friends on a closed (Private) server, You'll all probably have a better connection to the server, no random people can join and ruin the fun of an all melee group (Really funny cause one person always ends up with no new melee wepon xD), and if they don't want to play with you cause of a low level you can just unfriend the douchebag on steam (You don't need that kind of negativity in your life). So overall I recommend this game (Just not for public online...just....just don't), It's fun and it'll give you hours of mindless fun. 7/10","timestamp_created":1404848981,"timestamp_updated":1404848981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49773755669593811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11139455","author":{"steamid":"76561198064507000","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1388,"last_played":1430358576},"language":"english","review":"ehhhhhhhhhhh its k i gess","timestamp_created":1404848837,"timestamp_updated":1404848837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498753130435943604","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11138834","author":{"steamid":"76561198012892219","num_games_owned":298,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":301,"last_played":1443961599},"language":"russian","review":"купился на красивые скрины на деле графика в  no more room in hell и то лучше будет + там не надо платить нехилые деньги за довольно \"сраненький\" скин персонажа , который даже глаз не порадует ибо от 1 лица, геймплей ....... даже в первом cod с его любительским зомби модом из 10-20 волн было интереснее","timestamp_created":1404846564,"timestamp_updated":1404846564,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.441232949495315552","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11138804","author":{"steamid":"76561198052495354","num_games_owned":648,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1527818429},"language":"english","review":"awesome game","timestamp_created":1404846441,"timestamp_updated":1404846441,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11138366","author":{"steamid":"76561198035467635","num_games_owned":404,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1730,"last_played":1437077594},"language":"english","review":"I have few hours in this game, but I know people who've easily sunk thousands.
