With great writing and humor as well, Portal 2 is one of the best games I’ve ever played. The mechanics of using your portals to solve puzzles is challenging and rewarding, and the level design complements this spectacularly. On top of this, the atmosphere and music perfectly fit the type of style and gameplay this game has to offer. The game’s dialogue also offers great humor and jokes, and GLaDOS is one of the most entertaining characters to listen to. The co-op is also great, with its own separate story and everything. On top of this, there's also player made levels if you run out of game to play. So that way, you can always play new and interesting levels.

If you're looking for fun, you've found it. Great humor, and I guarantee that at some point, you WILL laugh!\n\nEdit: I wrote the beginning of this comment years ago, when I was still young and naive. Now that I am older, I can provide a more elaborate review. The attention to detail in this game is astounding, references to different games and Portal 1 are everywhere. The puzzles are fun yet challenging enough to drive you mad with desperation if you can't seem to find the solution. The dialogue is awesomely hilarious, GLADoS is much more refined, and Wheatley is just great. The storyline is great, as is the ending. You will walk away from this game feeling accomplished, and you can't help but laugh at the awesome story this game has produced.

Esta historia se queda donde la anterior y nos cuenta que ocurrió con GLaDOS, que le pasó a nuestra protagonista y obviamente que habrá mucho más puzles con portales. \n\n[h1] Pros:\t[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Mejores puzles que su precuela. Este Portal 2 es más difícil que el anterior y sus puzles son más largos y más frenéticos, donde sacamos el mayor provecho a la pistola de portales.\n[*]Una historia mucho más profunda y más larga. El anterior Portal duraba lo que te tardas en fumar un canuto, apenas daba tiempo a saborearlo, pero Valve aprendió la lección y lo hizo no sólo más largo, sino más rico en historia. Aquí podemos conocer el pasado no sólo de Aperture Science, si no de la mismísima GLaDOS, y joder, GLaDOS mola.\n[*]Un final cojonudo. Si aún no sabes como termina este juego, pásatelo, con ese final se te van a caer los cojones al suelo... O los ovarios XD. \n[/list]\n\n[h1] Contras:\t[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Un villano indefinido y confuso. En el anterior Portal este era un punto positivo, pero en este no puedo decir lo mismo. [Spoiler] Wheatley me parece un personaje estúpido, demasiado risitas y que no está a la altura como villano de la genial GLaDOS de la primera entrega. Y si os digo la verdad no me ha terminado de convencer mucho eso de que pongan a GLaDOS al final como la \"buena\". Eso sí, el primer tramo de la historia con GLaDOS rencorosa por haberla matado, me parece magnífico. [/Spoiler]\n[*]En el anterior juego ya me quejé de que se pasa demasiado tiempo cargando... Pero en este es todavía peor... Los tiempos de carga me parecen excesivos, y te quitan todo el hype para pasarte la siguiente prueba.\n[*]Creo que esto es problema de Win10, pero a mí en muchas ocasiones me daba tirones y bajadas de FPS, haciendo que se cortase el audio o se congelase la imagen durante unos microsegundos. Y no, no es problema de hardware porque me funcionan a la perfección juegos actuales.\n[/list] \n\n[h1] Análisis:\t[/h1]\nQue decir, este es un Portal mejorado hasta el infinito y más allá... Es una pena que Valve no haya seguido sacando juegos como estos, porque merecen y mucho la pena. Personalmente me parecen dos juegos que todo amante de los videojuegos debería probar. Y aunque parezcan básicos, tienen un toque que los distingue y una historia simple, pero que atrae. \n\n[h1] Nota:\t[/h1]\n8.8/10","timestamp_created":1518553146,"timestamp_updated":1518553146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40051769","author":{"steamid":"76561198346328674","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1046,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":691,"last_played":1554050831},"language":"russian","review":"Советую","timestamp_created":1518547045,"timestamp_updated":1518547045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40051288","author":{"steamid":"76561198271309710","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":661,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":523,"last_played":1521564980},"language":"turkish","review":"1.yi oynamadan oynamayın.","timestamp_created":1518545781,"timestamp_updated":1518545781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40050087","author":{"steamid":"76561198273712914","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2797,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1949,"last_played":1648827657},"language":"english","review":"This mus be the best game ive ever gona play in my intime life, made me cry.
