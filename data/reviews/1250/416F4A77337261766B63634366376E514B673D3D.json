Ele ganhou o prêmio de melhor jogo de PC de 2009, melhor shooter e melhor expansão de PC em 2009. Você pode jogar com até 5 jogadores no modo online, ou sozinho jogando no solo mode (O ''singleplayer'' de Killing floor). O jogo não os conta como 'zumbis' e sim como 'specimens' de um programa do governo inglês para clonar soldados. \n\n\nÁudio: \n\nUma coisa que impressiona muito é a quantidade de falas que se tem no jogo, não só dos personagens mas dos 'specimens'. O áudio do jogo é bem simples, não há tantos efeitos sonoros quanto nos jogos de hoje em dia, porém seu som é bem agradável e, por parte dos personagens, um sotaque inglês. \nO áudio (no caso trilha sonora) também muda de acordo com o que acontece no jogo, quando não há zumbis a música de fundo é mais suave, tranquila porém quando os jogadores estão em combate a música passa a ser básicamente composta por Heavy metal e batidas de tambor. \n\nGráficos: \n\nA engine do jogo é a Unreal Engine, seus gráficos são simples e não são lindos ou perfeitos como o de Crysis, porém não são gráficos desagrádaveis que tiram o entretenimento do jogo. O lado bom disso é que qualquer pessoa com um pc mediano pode 'rodar' o jogo sem qualquer problema. \n\nJogabilidade: \n\nA Jogabilidade de KF é muito boa, os comandos são fáceis e respondem bem ao movimento do mouse, porém não tem suporte para canhotos. Assim como Left 4 Dead, você não pode apertar uma tecla e correr mais rápido (o que acontece em vários FPSs) sua velocidade é determinada à partir da quantidade de peso que tu carregas e de seu Perk. \n\nEstória: \n\nKilling Floor não tem uma estória definida, é apenas falado de que na Inglaterra alguns cientistas faziam experimentos e algo aconteceu ocasionando na criação dos 'specimens'. O jogo deixa vago essa questão, fazendo com os jogadores criem sua própia versão da estória. \n\n\nGameplay: \n\nO gameplay de KF é muito simples, consiste em um jogo 'Solo' (sozinho) ou em multiplayer (vários jogadores), no qual você e seus colegas devem lutar contra hordas de zumbis (mais precisamente 'specimens) em que cada ronda (wave) se torne mais difícil, até que ao concluí-las haverá uma batalha contra o 'Super-Specimen' que se chama 'Patriarch'. Os jogadores podem escolher aonde ficar, correr e lutar. O jogo pode ser modificado atráves de mods, mudando a dificuldade, número de inimigos, de waves, ou de jogadores. (Algumas dessas mudanças pode impedir que você avance o seu perk) \n\nHá diversas armas no jogo, incluindo armas corpo a corpo (melee), Shotguns, Rifles dentre outras. Jogadores ganham dinheiro ao matar 'specimens' ou curando seus colegas, o dinheiro ganho pode ser gastado no Trader em troca de armas e você também pode vende-las no Trader. \n\nUma característica do jogo chamada de ''ZED-Time'' faz com que o jogo fique com o efeito 'Matrix' de 'slow-motion' o que pode salvar seus colegas. \nPode-se usar elementos táticos como soldar portas e fazer com que os inimigos venham em apenas uma direção. \n\nHá um chat de voz in-game com simples avisos/insultos etc, como há o chat de voz em que os jogadores podem conversar com outros, trocando estratégias ou pedindo ajuda. \n\n\nPerk: \n\nUma das coisas que diferencia Killing Floor de vários FPSs atuais é seu sistema de 'Perk'. Esse sistema é bem encontrado em jogos de RPG, em que se escolhe uma classe e ela tem suas vantagens e desvantagens. O jogo conta com sete classes: Field Medic, Support Specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Beserker, Firebug e Demolitions. \n\nCada perk tem sua vantagem/desvantagem e exigência para dar um 'up'. As exigências são ganhas fazendo certas ações durante o jogo, como curando seus colegas ou fazendo dano nos 'specimens'. \n\nO perk é detalhado no canto inferior esquerdo, com a imagem do perk e seu número de estrelas. Jogadores com perks de 0 à 5 terão a imagem de seu perk vermelha com o número de estrelas equivalente ao seu nível. Jogadores no nível 6 terão uma imagem dourada de seu perk com uma estrela. Seu perk deve ser selecionado antes do começo de uma partida e pode ser mudado uma vez ao final de cada 'wave'. \n\n\nSpecimens: \n\nOs ''specimens'' são os principais antagonistas em Killin Floor. Enquanto eles são bem referidos à zumbis, eles são o fato de uma falha em um experimento de clones criado pela ''Horzine Biotech'' (uma compania fictícia de biotecnologia em London). Há dez tipos diferentes de 'specimes', incuindo o Patriarca (Patriarch), todos eles com suas própias ''habilidades especiais'' e estética. \n\nAo decaptar um 'specimen' você o deixará incapaz de fazer algumas de suas habilidades. \n\nMuitos 'specimens' têm tendências canibalísticas, e iram alimentar-se em corpos de jogadores mortos recentemente. \nOs 'specimens' não têm um 'Spawn point' fixo, eles sempre nascem perto dos jogadores. \n\nSolo/Multiplayer: \n\nO jogo não tem um modo campanha em que fala sobre sua estória, no seu modo ''Single-player'' o jogador pode escolher dentre vários mapas e jogar sozinho (o que é bom para quem é iniciante no jogo aprender os controles e upar seu perk), em cada mapa há um box com uma descrição, uma pequena estória sobre o mapa. Esse sistema do ''Solo'' é bem similiar ao de Battlefield 2. \n\nConclusão: \n\nSe você procura um jogo de zumbi, muito mais desafiador do que o Left 4 Dead e não se importa muito com os gráficos e sim com a diversão, Killing Floor é o jogo ideal, além de ser barato (apenas 15 doláres na steam) ele vai lhe proporcionar diversão por muito tempo. \n\nPrós: \n\nMultiplayer viciante; \nDiversidade de mapas, armas e 'specimens'; \nJogabilidade boa; \nSistema de Perk. \n\nContras: \n\nGráficos ultrapassados; \nEstória mal definida; \nSingleplayer enjoativo; \nDesequilíbrio entre perks.","timestamp_created":1405104459,"timestamp_updated":1405104459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531445801258087158","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11186905","author":{"steamid":"76561198124721868","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":400,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":152,"last_played":1424380768},"language":"english","review":"This game is awesome!
