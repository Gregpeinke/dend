the first Portal did right, this game expounded on.  Everything is improved upon: level design, character development, animation, voice acting, story, puzzles, soundtrack, the portals themselves.  Even the most obvious plot twists are so well executed through the scenery and lighting and acting and animation and literally everything that you can't help but feel shocked.  GLaDOS and Wheatley will steal both the show and your heart.  Co-op is so much fun, and this is coming from someone who is normally staunchly adamant about hating playing with other people.  Help me, space cops, space cops, help.\n\nAgain, much like with the first game: if you haven't played it in awhile, play it again.  If you've never played it, buy it now and play it.  You'll be Wheat you did.  Shoot, the pun doesn't work with his name.  You'll be GLaD you did.

There is more story/narrative from the start than the first game had (so it held my attention longer). The puzzles were more difficult but also more fun and it felt like there was more reason to play other than just to solve puzzles. I enjoyed the new aspect of goo being added. At first I thought the Lower Aperture level was a little boring but while replaying  (although long) it has been providing some intriguing story/backstory content that I enjoy greatly.\n\nMy only complaint with the game was that it is a little too linear. I usually play games that are more sandbox style where you do whatever you want, so I was disapointed I couldn't just abbandon Wheatly when I first had him (I didn't realize his plot to the story unil later but I didn't like him telling me what to do). I understand you have to follow the path the creators make, but I would have at least liked some reactions to other decisions before having to follow the main path again. Still, it would have been nice to have no one in charge of Aperture by the end.\n\nHere's to hoping for a third game!","timestamp_created":1527651031,"timestamp_updated":1527651031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42374836","author":{"steamid":"76561198815536256","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4892,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":724,"last_played":1589354502},"language":"russian","review":"+Прикольная головоломка\n+В два, и даже в три раза длиннее чем прошлая часть\n+Сюжет такой же топовый\n\n+/- разработайте 3 часть)","timestamp_created":1527649299,"timestamp_updated":1527649299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42374653","author":{"steamid":"76561198346843874","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1512894708},"language":"turkish","review":"IŞINLAMA AMK","timestamp_created":1527648505,"timestamp_updated":1527648505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":15,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510958015918731689","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42374212","author":{"steamid":"76561198295129723","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":506,"last_played":1652377696},"language":"russian","review":"СЛОЖНА СЛОЖНА нехуя не понятно","timestamp_created":1527646385,"timestamp_updated":1527646385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480314940214157104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42373793","author":{"steamid":"76561198349303744","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1622,"last_played":1593150637},"language":"brazilian","review":"Estratégia pura e divertido.","timestamp_created":1527644564,"timestamp_updated":1527644564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42373019","author":{"steamid":"76561197961323750","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":963,"last_played":1626998044},"language":"brazilian","review":"Tão bom quanto seu antecessor.\n\nJoguem o modo coo-op com amigos, é a melhor experiência de jogo!","timestamp_created":1527640897,"timestamp_updated":1528012275,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42372297","author":{"steamid":"76561198102909361","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":9205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8125,"last_played":1590771917},"language":"english","review":"its good","timestamp_created":1527637433,"timestamp_updated":1527637433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42371993","author":{"steamid":"76561198277735809","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":2138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1849,"last_played":1631402581},"language":"english","review":"BNEST COOP GAME!!!","timestamp_created":1527636141,"timestamp_updated":1610158412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42371558","author":{"steamid":"76561198353593495","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":291,"playtime_forever":153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":153,"last_played":1520994021},"language":"english","review":"good so far. i liked portal one more. glados is in it and shes great. love her. puzzles i found easier or i got used to the mechanics by now. anyways i would recommend playing the first one, then this. if u start with this one, ure going to be lost. still, really fun.","timestamp_created":1527633796,"timestamp_updated":1527633796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.463576167821884155","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuruE1+MCdp7RoQE="}
