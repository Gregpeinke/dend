They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you","timestamp_created":1572722498,"timestamp_updated":1572722498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":12,"weighted_vote_score":"0.664770364761352539","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56235342","author":{"steamid":"76561198170591393","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1536114532},"language":"english","review":"besto game in za warudo","timestamp_created":1572671717,"timestamp_updated":1572671717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460829466581344604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56212323","author":{"steamid":"76561198032529154","num_games_owned":561,"num_reviews":157,"playtime_forever":1728,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1728,"last_played":1313823600},"language":"english","review":"Du\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu hast mich\nDu hast mich gefragt\nDu hast mich gefragt\nDu hast mich gefragt und ich hab nichts gesagt\nWillst du bis der Tod uns scheidet\nTreue sein für alle Tage\nNein\nNein\nWillst du bis der Tod uns scheidet\nTreue sein für alle Tage\nNein\nNein\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nWillst du…","timestamp_created":1572653585,"timestamp_updated":1572653585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.408792376518249512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55841568","author":{"steamid":"76561198272528538","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1513444709},"language":"english","review":"Ricochet","timestamp_created":1572200969,"timestamp_updated":1572200969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571532607078552246","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55801999","author":{"steamid":"76561198150978040","num_games_owned":702,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":63,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1580663713},"language":"russian","review":"Это было круто!

Being a Goldsrc game, its movement quirks such as air-strafing add a layer of depth that not everyone will realize during their first playthrough. \nWhile potential for the gameplay isn't exactly limitless, it's still sad to know that Valve's original plans to keep on supporting this game never panned out.

(i know, it's shocking someone took time to do it) but most of em work and they are pretty cool, they add new maps that are more than just neon arrow pads. I am personally going to make some mods for it and i hope whoever reads this does too, it'll really get more players on it.\n\nTHINGS YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT RICOCHET: There many glitches bugs and unfinished pieces in this game here are a few of them: #1. when playing the game sometimes a half life browser icon appears instead of a ricochet one. #2. If you press \"T\" on your keyboard you can spray-paint a chosen icon (can be chosen in settings) you can paint it sometimes or every time you score a point (when you KO somebody). #3. if you press the \"E\" or \"Shift\" on your keyboard it slows your character. #4. When entering a ricochet match a grenade is sometimes displayed in your characters hand, but it quickly disappears when you finish spawning in. #5. If you change the brightness settings at all and the game glitches and does not kick you out like it says it will, then your characters right hand is visible but it looks different than it actually is, it is wearing a black glove and has a brown sleeve, in that weird looking hand there is a grenade (just like i stated previously but it stays in your hand), when holding the grenade you can still throw discs, but when the grenade is in your hand those jump arrows everywhere don't work instead of making you jump they just don't do anything so then you fall to your death.\n\nRICOCHET TIPS: here are my few tips (the game doesn't exactly have many elements to create strategies to) but here they are: #1. when you land and there is someone on the platform you are landing on quickly shoot a decapitation disc at them as soon as you almost land. #2. when waiting on a platform the second someone lands shoot a decapitation shot it's basically an instant kill because people land before thinking all the time. #3. always look around, the maps are really small so unless you look around you will be constantly dying. #4. when a player shoots a disc at you it's not game over either move out of the way or if that is too difficult or not really possible at the moment then shoot normal discs back at those discs it prevents your opponent's discs from hitting you if you shoot a disc at their disc. #5. collect power ups (this one is obvious) it really makes the game easier. #6. isn't it so annoying when you try to get to another platform but you end up landing on it and sliding off the side? well i have a solution to that, as i said earlier if you press \"E\" or \"Shift\" on keyboard it slows your character well it also prevents you from sliding, so when you are about to land on a platform press and hold \"E\" or \"Shift\" it makes the game even easier.\n\nIS THIS GAME WORTH BUYING?: I would say if you have friends playing it with you or there are people on the servers then yes totally, also it'll go on sale for like 49 cents so just get it then.\n\nHELP ME START THIS GAME: normally i would say help me bring it back, but i'm pretty sure it has always been dead you can mod it and it is actually fun with other people also like i said it is almost 20 years old so maybe the devs will be like: \"wow we made that a while ago oh guys look at this there are 400 players online since there are so many players we should give it a 20th anniversary update\". or maybe they'll be like \"Meh\" but either way it'll make the game a lot more fun if we get enough players so you can ask me questions in this discussion send me a friend request or whatever just at least join the discussion.\"\n\n^That Up There Is Everything About The Game....      \n\n!!!!!!!!!!FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!--------------->The Game Is Completely And Utterly Dead, Normally As I Explained In My Post The Game Is Pretty Boring And Pointless, There Are A Few Maps, A Few Power-Ups, And A Rare Chance Of Anyone Being Online, But, If You Get Mods On It.....       .....It Becomes A Lot Of Fun To Play With Your Friends.

\"Ricochet 2\" Announced As Epic Games Store Exclusive Releasing In 2020.\n\nAt a press conference Valve gave an hour ago as of the time of writing, CEO Gabe Newell announced a sequel to the highly popular FPS \"Ricochet\", to release exclusively for the Epic Games Store next year. \"We have decided to bring back the highly praised Ricochet franchise for release on the Epic Games Store in the year 2020.\" Gabe Newell stated after the 30 second announcement trailer played.\n\nThe announcement has been riddled with criticism from long time fans of the first game. One former fan, who wished to remain anonymous, said \"I picked up the game in 2002 after graduating school, and I think it's a fucking disgrace that the sequel is going to a platform that has almost none of the same features as Steam.\". \n\nOthers are excited for it's release on the storefront. Derek Marshall, 12, stated \"I can't wait to play it once, maybe throw that disc thing around for a bit, and then never play it again when the Fortnite servers go back up.\", before chugging a can of Monster Energy and calling his friends over Discord on his medium-range laptop.\n\nIt is not known if Ricochet 2 will ever release on Steam.

Once you discover how power air-strafing and generally good positioning this game becomes a masterpiece. The biggest downside to the game is the fact that very few people are online, however, if you play with friends this is a party game on the same level as smash bros.\n\nSome people have tried to start semi active ricochet revival communities. They all die out rather soon. I was one of the first recruits to join one and we had a nice community of 8 people who would play semi frequently, but of course we forgot and the community died out.\n\nI cant really put into words how much i love this game but I'm still gonna try. The joy of meeting someone outside of your friends list who is insane enough to play this game is unparalleled. One time i met a russian god who just had his airstrafes on point and really taught me how much further there was to go to reach the peak skill level of this game.\n\nRicoc Communindad Hellfish will always stay close to my heart as the best server in the game. Seeing AMX MOD X popups is as comforting as drinking hot chocolate on a cold winter night. The drab tron colour scheme instills a sense of homeliness in me as i turn the game on. Hearing a shop counter beep the exact same way the game beeps before changing maps fills my whole body with nostalgia. The screams of death as people fall of the map will be forever ingrained into your brain as absurd but entertaining moments of your life.\n\nIf you can get your friends to play this masterpiece do so. Its pretty shit to begin with but it grows on you more than any other game.\n\nIts an acquired taste, but euphoric once the taste is acquired.","timestamp_created":1565801361,"timestamp_updated":1565801361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54600385","author":{"steamid":"76561198342601105","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":107,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1565712772},"language":"english","review":"Not too much to say.
