Когда в неё играешь такое чувство, что запах полуразложившихся трупов передается через комп :). А так игра достаточно быстро затягивает в игровой процесс. Игра из разряда - задрачивания, лучше играть с опытными игроками. Движение персонажей хз сначало не привычно, такое чувство что все передвигаются как будто  наложили в штаны. Замедление времени иногда бесит, бывает помогает.

The ones I actually managed to convert had said it's just like Left 4 Dead, and why would they want to play if they already have L4D?  Boy did they change their mind after playing a bit of it.\n\nThis game has a lot to it.  In fact I prefer it over Left 4 Dead (the first or the second) due its depth and individualization factor.  If I want to go support...then I can work on support skills and level them up.  In L4D if I want to go support, I pretty much have to choose a shotgun and give med-packs to others whenever I can... it really has no classes.\n\nYou've got several classes to choose from, and you don't have to go with one or another - you can totally mix it up if you want, but you have to choose a perk that you wish to fight with during each round.  Each perk levels up independently of whether you have chosen it or not - it's based on the weapons you use and the types of kills you get, and other activities that you perform.  So while I'm welding a door shut I'm leveling up my support perk... then when I turn around and shoot a zombie in the head with my pistol I'm leveling up basically the sniper perk.  Then I turn to by buddy and heal them - I'm leveling up my medic perk.\n\nPerks aren't exactly classes - they're better.  You choose one so that you get bonuses towards that perk's class.  Let's say you choose support - the support guns are cheaper to buy, you get more damage with shotguns, you weld doors faster, etc.  Choosing the pyro perk is gonna give you more fire-resistance, faster kills with the flamethrowers and that sort of thing.  You really choose what's best for you at the moment.  After playing for a while you get to feel the rhythm of the maps and can know what perk is best at different times.  I like to start with the sniper one (it's called something else actually), then switch to support...then after I've earned a ton of money and guns, I will switch to something more helpful to the team.\n\nLeveling up your perks is the fun part.  You end up getting better benefits out of your perks in addition to achievements and bragging rights.  I fully leveled my support perk, and believe me - it's hard to do, so my friends are like \"dude that's awesome\".","timestamp_created":1386449177,"timestamp_updated":1386449177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7958530","author":{"steamid":"76561198020613613","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1414545246},"language":"english","review":"Better then Left 4 Dead 1, that's for damn sure.","timestamp_created":1386447244,"timestamp_updated":1386447244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478436082601547241","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7958333","author":{"steamid":"76561198093527233","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":16972,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8366,"last_played":1452645155},"language":"brazilian","review":"ótimo jogo!","timestamp_created":1386446424,"timestamp_updated":1386446424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7958135","author":{"steamid":"76561198030293931","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":80640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45640,"last_played":1541893124},"language":"russian","review":"Прижимают Бежим !\n\nЗомби Прут со всех Сторон !\nНервы , Трепет , Вой и Стон\nПлоть в Куски , Повсюду Мясо\nУжас в Жилах , Нету Спаса\n\nШанс на жизнь почти на Грани \nКровь Ручьём на поле Брани\nСкушать рвутся , Окружают\nНе Спастись , Кольцо Сужают\n\nПаника !
