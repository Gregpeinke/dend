I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.\n\nIn my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.\n\nAnyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?","timestamp_created":1638029158,"timestamp_updated":1638029158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104361783","author":{"steamid":"76561198850181443","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":439,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":414,"last_played":1654950438},"language":"english","review":"my favorite one out of the bunch\n","timestamp_created":1638025001,"timestamp_updated":1638025001,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104355928","author":{"steamid":"76561199123234726","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":66,"last_played":1638625358},"language":"turkish","review":"mikimmel la","timestamp_created":1638023104,"timestamp_updated":1638023104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104346080","author":{"steamid":"76561199061987589","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":88,"last_played":1638633452},"language":"turkish","review":"çok güzel oyun","timestamp_created":1638019904,"timestamp_updated":1638019904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoIbmsP0CcJ6GjgM="}
