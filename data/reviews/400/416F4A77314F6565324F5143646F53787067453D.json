You're not a scientist. You're not a doctor. You're not even a full-time employee. Where did your life go so wrong?\" - GLaDOS[/h1]\n\n[b]Portal[/b]. Игра, которая вдохнула вторую жизнь в жанр \"логических головоломок\". За всю историю игр только несколько представителей может похвастаться своим влиянием и весом в развитии этого жанра. И один из них - Portal. Любопытный факт: Valve изначально откровенно боялась провала игры и чтобы не рисковать, впихнула её в сборник Orange Box. Если же говорить о самом Портале, то это была проба пера, которая изменила всё. Казалось бы - два портала, вход и выход, и задача - пройти из одного конца камеры в другой. Такая механика должна наскучить буквально через несколько уровней, но нет. Это как наркотик. С каждой камерой тяга идти дальше только возрастает, невзирая на сложность, хоть и иллюзорную. Всё благодаря сплетению сюжета, персонажей и самой механики игры. Постоянно испускающая шуточки, порой довольно циничные, GLaDOS заставляет влюбиться в себя - очень редкий тип антагониста, на которого не держишь зла, несмотря на все её безрезультатные попытки убить нас самыми изощрёнными способами. И ты идёшь на встречу к ней не столько убийства ради, сколько ради того, чтобы взглянуть своему врагу в глаза. Врагу, которого создали сами же люди с детской наивностью и уверенностью в том, что это [i] \"их высадка на Луну\". [/i]\n\nХоть сама механика не настолько разнообразна, как может показаться на первый взгляд, но играть интересно вплоть до самых титров. Каждая камера привносит что-то новое. Пусть их не очень много, но все они запоминаются и врезаются в память. И это круто ! \n\n[h1]Графика и прочее [/h1]\nНа Win10 какие-либо проблемы отсутствуют. \n\n[b]Визуал[/b]\nВполне обычная для игр на Source того времени. Из-за особенностей комплекса, уровни здесь в визуальном плане практически идентичны друг другу, и лишь к концу игры находятся места, на которые можно действительно поглазеть. \n\n[b]OST\t[/b]\nПотрясающая работа от Кэлли Бейли. Хоть в нём и нет экшн-треков, но эмбиент здесь чеpтовски приятен. Особенно хочу подчеркнуть песню \"Still Alive\". Это просто бомба. \n\n[b]Озвучка\t[/b]\nОчень качественная. Слушать GLaDOS одно удовольствие. \nПо поводу русского дубляжа - он ужасен. Начиная от отсебятины, заканчивая средней игрой актёров, которые даже не пытаются передать в своём голосе эмоции у той же GLaDOS. Посему, лучше не париться и играть с оригинальной озвучкой.\n\n[h1]tl;dr[/h1]\nОдин из самых важных памятников игровой индустрии, который показывает, что игры - это не только деньги, но и искусство. Даже малая продолжительность не является минусом как таковым.","timestamp_created":1532297797,"timestamp_updated":1566058034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.706001341342926025","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43687019","author":{"steamid":"76561198402797740","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1038,"last_played":1610693975},"language":"english","review":"This is literally my all-time favorite game.

Roy groaned so deep it was almost a growl, and as if the memory of those words alone wouldn't have been enough to keep him hard for years, Ed began to shimmy out of his boxers.\n\nBy god, did the man have a beautiful body. Even though his collarbones cast too much of a shadow to be perfectly healthy, he had tight, solid muscle on every inch of his frame, decorated by the scars of a hundred victories. Roy was reminded once again of how Ed could destroy him if he ever wanted to.\n\nFinally, the man's cock sprang free of his boxers, red and flushed with want, and the cloth pooled around his feet. Roy stood perhaps five feet away, and examined his prize. \n\nAfter a moment, Ed asked:\n\n“So, are you going to come here, or...?”\n\n“Crawl to me.” Roy's voice was a terrible rumble. “I want you on your knees for me.”\n\nRoy could see the flutter of the pulse in Ed's neck as it hammered through him. The blonde made a needy little noise, and then – wonder of wonders – got down on his hand and knees. Then, in sight of Roy Mustang and anyone else who cared to look, he fucking crawled over to the general to kneel, unbalanced, in front of his commanding officer, mouth not two inches from the man’s clothed erection. Roy extended a hand to grip Ed on the shoulder, hard, to steady him.\n\nAnd also, Roy admitted silently, to steady himself. The sight of Edward kneeling in front of him – bright red all over, confused and ashamed but rock hard regardless – nearly did him in right then. The older man groaned, wondering how long this was going to last.\n\n“Are you waiting for a written invitation?” Roy asked, huskily, and drew his hand through the other man's hair until the hair tie lay discarded on the ground. A sheet of golden hair cascaded around Ed's face, framing the scene.\n\n“No, sir,” Fullmetal said, and went for the button on Roy's uniform pants. Roy's eyes slid half-shut as he watched the younger man pull the zip down and pause, unsure, then take his remaining hand and work Roy's cock free of the cloth.\n\nThe man paused again, then, looking at it with a combination of interest and trepidation, like the virgin he so obviously was – then slowly, carefully, he drew his mouth closer and licked.\n\nRoy's world could have ended right then and he never would have noticed. His eyes fell closed without his permission as he tried to suppress the moan that threatened. He tangled his hand in Fullmetal's hair, pulling at it just enough that it would hurt.\n\n“Yes, that's it,” Roy growled, sliding his eyes back open and feeling in control for just that one moment – but that was before Edward took the head of his cock into that perfect mouth and gave it an experimental suck. It tore a noise from him, helpless to stop it.\nRoy could almost feel eyes on them from the window, liked to imagine he could: perhaps he was imagining it, but either way the thought lit him up from the inside as a certain tongue lit him up from the outside –\n\n“Deeper,” he ordered, to interrupt that train of thought. “I want you to take it all. Moan like the only thing you've ever wanted was my cock,” he said, and with that dug two fingers into the wires of the bare automail port.\n\nIt had to have hurt, because Fullmetal's eyes rolled into the back of his head, and he whimpered like a broken thing.\n\nHe took the older man's whole cock into his mouth, then – Roy felt stars at the base of his spine, and fuck, this was going to be over too soon –\n The general dug his fingers deeper into the port, and focused more on the feeling of power than on the feeling of Ed's clumsy but eager tongue tasting his slit, licking hot stripes from the base to the tip of his shaft, swirling it around the head like he had done this before, like he had been preparing for it...\n\nThe image of Edward in bed playing with himself, teasing his cock until he strained just to keep himself still, and all of it done with Roy's pleasure in mind, was enough to break the last of the General's control.\n\n“Back onto the couch,” he growled. Ed looked back up at him, surprised and maybe a little hurt.\n\n“Was I that bad?” he asked, tone giving everything away.\n\nRoy released his death grip on Ed's hair, just for that moment, and petted him gently. Ed closed his eyes and leaned into the caress.\n\n“No. You did a very good job,” Roy said, tucking one strand of hair behind the other man's ear, allowing himself a small smile at that look of bliss. “Believe me when I say that.”\n","timestamp_created":1532272822,"timestamp_updated":1532272822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43681516","author":{"steamid":"76561198417856593","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":91,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":57,"last_played":1623114480},"language":"english","review":"cool","timestamp_created":1532271301,"timestamp_updated":1532271301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43680714","author":{"steamid":"76561198078432783","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1855,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1625498003},"language":"swedish","review":"bästa spelet","timestamp_created":1532268582,"timestamp_updated":1532268582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43680214","author":{"steamid":"76561198245329488","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":134,"last_played":1532266613},"language":"schinese","review":"最后的结尾音乐很好听哦！","timestamp_created":1532266772,"timestamp_updated":1532266772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43679819","author":{"steamid":"76561198800964088","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":226,"last_played":1530989754},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошо.
