It may share a \"universe,\" power concepts, and gunplay, but it's not. There is never any sort of tension, or any horror aspect. I will be reviewing it as the above average FPS that it is.\n\n[b] Gunplay: 7/10 [/b] The most important part of an FPS game is certainly the gunplay. \"Infinite\" does nothing new compared to its predecessors. It's solid, fluid, and feels good.\n\n[b] Story: 6/10 [/b] Most people end up being totally blown away by this, but for me it was just rather meh. While it wasn't very predictable, it also went a bit too far out there for me; gets into some Dr. Who style bs. Also seemed to be trying too hard to be thought provoking.\n\n[b] Gameplay: 8/10 [/b] Outside of the gunplay, running around and doing things still feels quite nice, and being able to quickly loot almost everything you see is a hoarder's dream. The skyline is a rather innovative idea that I quite enjoyed, and I wish it had been used much more. Being able to only hold tow guns at one time results in the player having to make choices about what to grab, and when to keep something; you might not find another one for a while. I did like that aspect, but I still yearn for the space-based inventory systems of \"System Shock.\" The plasmids, or \"vigors,\" as they are called in Columbia, honestly don't feel very special or even that impactful. However, I did end up using all of them in combat, so points for that. \n\n[b] Level Design: 5/10 [/b] The levels are serviceable. None of them were very special. I'll remember the setting at least.\n\n[b] Sound Design: 6/10 [/b] Everything seems to be nicely done; I didn't hear anything off. Weapon and vigor noises come out quite clear. Unfortunately, at times, it becomes quite difficult to pinpoint where an enemy is shooting from using sound. You just have to look in the dark for muzzle flashes instead.\n\n[b] Voice Acting: 6/10 [/b] I became somewhat attached to Elizabeth, good job. Daisy Fitzroy was given an excellent performance. Everyone else, kinda meh.\n\n[b] Music: 4/10 [/b] It wasn't bad, but I literally remember none of it.\n\n[b] Animations: 6/10 [/b] They work.\n\n[b] Graphics: 8/10 [/b] On max settings, this is an incredibly pretty game, while maintaining a definite \"video game\" aesthetic. Even on min settings, objects are still easily distinguishable, and the world is not at all offensive.\n\n[b] Difficulty Balance: 4/10 [/b] I played through on the hardest setting (hard). The first 1/4 of the game was incredibly easy. The next 2/4 was a highly enjoyable challenge, very well done. The final quarter was an abysmal, painful slog of bullet sponges. It began with the final \"boss\" fight, that cranked up the difficulty from the enjoyable 8 to freaking 20, unless you know exactly how the fight goes, and are fully prepared for it (explosives help). From then on, even with fully upgraded weapons, and vigors, everything takes quite a while to kill, and there are so many more enemies. Downright unpleasant.\n\n[b] General Design Gripe: [/b] There are two sets of weapons, the founders', and the vox'. You start with the founders' stuff and don't get access to the vox' stuff until much later in the game. By that point, you've probably invested quite a bit of money into upgrading your starting weapons. And now you have access to a whole other set, that doesn't seem to have any benefit. I don't have any solutions, but it's just real awkward.\n\n[b] Overall: 6/10 [/b] It's an above average FPS, with an interesting story. Not much more.\n[b] Personal Enjoyment: 5/10 [/b] This would be a lot higher if there was any atmosphere at all, and if the last act didn't leave such a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nRather short game, I beat it in just under 15 hours, with an insane amount of poking around absolutely everywhere, and minimal sprinting places. Playing like a sane person, one could probably complete it in 6-8 hours. Given that, and the difficulty issues, it's not really worth $30. Buy it on sale for 50% or less. Just don't expect a \"BioShock\" game. I'm glad I waited 6 years to play it.","timestamp_created":1559607091,"timestamp_updated":1559607185,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504132211208343506","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51039123","author":{"steamid":"76561198355904762","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":607,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1621182553},"language":"spanish","review":"lo pase en xbox y me parecio un buen jugeo aunqe no al nivel del bioshock 1 pero un gran final para la historia","timestamp_created":1559606836,"timestamp_updated":1559606836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51039121","author":{"steamid":"76561198048958525","num_games_owned":408,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":2983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2983,"last_played":1470939557},"language":"english","review":"Every now and then I think of this game and can't believe how amazing it is.\nThe plot, the characters, the gameplay, the music, the visuals!

My. God. Just when you thought that another Bioshock game won't ever get near to the very first Bioshock game. Infinite is literally the bomb -- it's surprisingly jaw-dropping! Insanely well-written and directed! Phenomenal story and great characters! \n\nI really enjoyed the NPC scripts and the level of creativity with each scenes. Lore wasn't boring to observe and explore. Solid audio direction, loved the music choices! It's packed with the good ol' Bioshock FPS gameplay with a simpler take on \"Plasmids\" (go and pick up the first two games you skipper!) which I personally prefer plus cool new mechanics! Shooting will definitely feel a bit clunky if you are coming from some of the current AAA FPS titles but easily catches up as you play through the game. \n\nInfinite looks refreshing because of the art style but imo, not the best-looking of its time -- still very good tho! It's up there and its details! Please, please go and finish the first two games first and watch this masterpiece of a series take a special place in your heart! Certainly one of the greatest games of all time! PS: This is coming from someone who haven't even played the DLCs yet.\n\nEDIT: I just finished the DLCs and it's craaaaaazy! I don't understand how they managed to pull this off! Massive plot continuity (or should I say origin) from Bioshock I to this! I love it! Extremely good voice acting from Elizabeth's voice actor! She deserves a good chunk of praise! Shoutout to the whole team, too! Artists, writers, directors -- ya'll are phenoms! This has now become my favorite trilogy in gaming!

I'm not going to spoil anything for you, but I'll try to tell you why this game is deeply worthwhile.\n\nTo get the basics out of the way first, the game looks great and sounds even better. The presentation values are absolutely top notch. It was originally released in 2013 and holds up amazingly well even today when I finally finished it, May 29, 2019. It's no [i]Crysis[/i] or [i]Battlefield V[/i] in the graphics department, mind you, but its artistic style is a wonderful blend between realism and a cartoon, and is thoroughly artistic in so many of its visual and aural treats.\n\nThe game also controls about as well as any game can, my sole complaint being the way zooming in with the firearms ups the mouse sensitivity or something. It's a little unnatural compared to the other games I'm accustomed to playing, and I couldn't find any way to disable that in the options. It plays wonderfully for any FPS fan, though you may want to rebind controls; I couldn't tolerate having my \"vigors\" on the right mouse button rather than aiming down the sights, for example.\n\nWhere the game truly shines, however, and why it left me in tears at the end, is its story. Again, I'm not going to spoil anything, but you start the game as one sort of largely time-worn character common to many games, and walk down a potentially redemptive path as is also common to many games, but then you end in a terrible and unexpected place. The best games manage to keep me in the dark until the end, forcing me to reexamine every decision, every plot point through an alternative lens through some fundamental narrative shift. BI does that wonderfully.\n\nI became very invested in the world during my play through, particularly in the wonderfully realized character of Elizabeth. I think she is literally the [i]only[/i] video game sidekick who actually pulls her weight in the entire history of video games. I'm not going to tell you she seems like a living breathing person because she doesn't, but the ways in which she aids and assists you along the way, rather than being a pain in the *** to babysit, is fantastic. You come to care about her and rely on her because of it, which makes the ending all the much more poignant.\n\nIf you like a thinking man's FPS game of any form, if you value storytelling at all, then you owe it to yourself to play and most importantly finish this game. It's a work of art.","timestamp_created":1559171158,"timestamp_updated":1559171181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.685732364654541016","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50936525","author":{"steamid":"76561198060257489","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":2655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2273,"last_played":1657992198},"language":"english","review":"I love this game, I've played this game several times now. and still love it.","timestamp_created":1559168451,"timestamp_updated":1559168451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50935632","author":{"steamid":"76561198117665530","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":780,"last_played":1597020997},"language":"spanish","review":"Una joya aun después de varios años","timestamp_created":1559164392,"timestamp_updated":1559164392,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50934009","author":{"steamid":"76561198054615937","num_games_owned":1332,"num_reviews":96,"playtime_forever":1100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":1069,"last_played":1660253790},"language":"english","review":"One of the best FPS narratives of all time with gorgeous art and audio direction.

Да, со второго раза сюжет голову не снесет, но даже в этом случае после перепрохождения задумываешься о некоторых вещах, а вот в первый раз это было просто невероятно. Морская могила в двух частях тоже радует достаточно сильно, ибо снова дают погулять по Восторгу, но еще в те времена, когда он был вполне себе ничего (не раздолбанный, например...почти), пах жизнью, цвел, и вот это все. Только есть один нюанс - геймплейный. Обычно же как принято? Вот тебе миллиард плазмид, апгрейдов для пушек, 300 видов патронов, ракет, батарей для лазеров, миллионы долларов на все про все и море всякой хренотени, заботливо разбросанной геймдизайнерами. В дополнениях это не так. Пулек особо нет, но вы держитесь. Соли (ЕВЫ) тоже нет, так что продолжайте держаться, а денег то тем более нет (хорошего вам настроения) - благо покупать особо нечего, а валить всех налево и направо с пулемета стреляя куда-то туда не выйдет, ибо все крайне ограниченно. Особенно в этом плане ограниченна Элизабет. Она не Букер или Джэк или еще кто, щита у нее нет,а т.к. она дама, то и ведра здоровых пушек и вагона патронов тоже нет. Так, по мелочи всякого дали, типа газовых болтов для арбалета, немного измененные плазмиды, но и так норм как бы...за исключением одного нюанса - арка с Элизабет - это стелс. Биошок и стелс странное сочетание...ну, ладненько, для разнообразия пойдет, тем более с сюжетом все продолжает быть все в порядке. \n\nНа самом деле игра играется прекрасно, как и первые две части (даже их ремастеры, но не без проблем, правда, технических).

It's obvious from the start that this game sets very high standards for itself, perhaps even unrealistically high for a game. But it matches that standard in every way. The only time I found myself not completely enjoying this game was when I got stuck for a while on a boss fight but I played the game on hard so that should be expected.

Columbia provides a gorgeous backdrop with many fun and exciting action set-pieces. \n\nCombat is simple, restricted and a bit underwhelming. Unlike previous entries the weapon wheel is absent, restricting the player to a maximum of two guns at a time + the skyhook melee weapon. On top of the small amount of weapons usable at a time some guns are only available in specific areas. The vigors are less imaginative this time round, mostly being reskins of already existing plasmids from the originals. Though it's too bad that pretty much all of these are invalidated by the Bucking Bronco and Return to Sender vigors. The former completely taking all but the largest enemies out of combat making group encounters a joke, and the latter absorbing enemy gunfire and shooting it back at them.\nThe ability to place vigors as traps is such a lacking feature compared to the more imaginative and strategic plasmid combos found in Bioshock 2. \n\nI'm not really all that great at judging what makes good storytelling and character writing so i won't touch on that much, but this game would probably be worse than the 1st but better than the 2nd in that regard. I will however say that Elizabeth is great, both as a combat aide and character, probably being one of the most memorable characters in the series.\n\nThe miscellaneous side objectives (enemy research, hacking, etc.) have been completely removed, which while not perfect by any means, gave the other games a certain charm and overall more engaging experience.\n\nOverall not necessarily a bad game, but when compared to the Rapture-based games (and even the original E3 gameplay footage), this entry is severely lacking,\n\n7.5/10, a really good game, just a bare-bones Bioshock game.\n","timestamp_created":1558940228,"timestamp_updated":1558940228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50880336","author":{"steamid":"76561198119551993","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1066,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1066,"last_played":1554304062},"language":"schinese","review":"上班拿着手机摸鱼，开着翻墙工具写测评，这在当初玩这款游戏的时候是不可想象的。当升上天空之城的那一刻，是四年多前，阳台上冷风嗖嗖，天空中划着东来西往的飞机线。哥伦比亚永远阳光明媚，空气中飘荡着音乐，站在飞艇旁可以听一整天阿卡贝拉。\n周围人不断地打着节拍，伊丽莎白就这么盘旋飞舞。故事就到坠落的海滩边就好","timestamp_created":1558938408,"timestamp_updated":1558938408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxIr+++oCcPWLwgE="}
