Portal is one of those really brilliant games that comes along and takes everything with a storm.\nPortal is a 1st person puzzle game. You control a silent and unknown protagonist doomed to do puzzles over and over by an evil (and coolest) machine entity.\nThe key features in the gameplay revolves around you solving puzzles using a gun shooting portals. This in itself may not sound that awesome, but you really have to experience the puzzles to percieve the cleverness (Is that even a word?) behind them. The gameplay has a natural difficulty curve with the game becoming harder and harder. It never feels annoying though, the hard part in this game is to figure out the puzzle. Usually you have a good amount of time to figure it out, and when you finally do, it feels very rewarding completing the darn thing.\nThe graphics are nothing to call home about. They are descent.\nThe very best thing in the game is by far the story. Considering all you do is solving puzzles, this may sound strange, but one key element changes this. The machine that has kept you trapped for \"Testing\" is one of the best characters created in many years. The constant barrage of comments and sarcasm delivered with an amazing voice is just fantastic. Combine this with an atmosphere where you find yourself insignificant, lost and utterly alone gives a really unique gaming experience.","timestamp_created":1292782719,"timestamp_updated":1403474304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3546149","author":{"steamid":"76561198024509953","num_games_owned":636,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":321,"last_played":86400},"language":"german","review":"Ein wenig kurz, aber es kostet ja auch nicht viel.
