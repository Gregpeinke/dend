Феномен игровой индустрии.\nЭто не тот типичный шутерок на вечером , каким некоторые люди его считают. Эта игра живёт , чувствует , полностью заставляет погрузиться в жуткую атмосферу коридоров исследовательского комплекса \"Чёрная Меза\"\nДа , графика безбожно устарела. Но лично я считаю , что это придает игре шарм. Все эти низкополигональные модели персонажей , которые словно живые реагируют на окружающие их ужасы , или же умные противники которые способны проверять наличие угрозы на слух или запах. Тут даже местная фауна питается и чувствует запахи !\nВ этой игре огромное количество маленьких деталей , которые не легко заметить с первого раза.\nПервый Half-life - это игра на выживание. Вас действительно загоняют в трудные рамки , заставляя обдумывать свои действия. Разумеется , надо играть на самом высоком уровне сложности.\nУникальная игра.

Polecam każdemu graczowi oczekującemu dynamicznej rozgrywki. Gra ma już swoje lata(1998 data premiery) jednak nie straciła nic przez upływ czasu. Młodsi gracze mogą być rozczarowani, ponieważ grafika w obecnych realiach GTA V, Wiedźmina 3 czy innych gier wygląda na bardzo przestarzałą jednak dodaje to uroku produkcji. Silnik gry jest bardzo podobny do CS 1.6 także gracze tej gry bez problemu odnajdą się w Half-Life. Fabuła jest wciągająca, gracz wraz z postępem w grze jest ciekaw co będzie dalej więc czasem z planowanej krótkiej rozgrywki można wciągnąć się i nie zaóważyć jak właśnie minęła kolejna godzina rozgrywki! Podsumowując polecam tą grę fanom starszych gier i nie tylko. Grę kupiłem na letniej wyprzedaży Steam za 3,59zł i właśnie polecam poczekać, aż gra będzie przeceniona(bardzo często jest -90%).

I can't even count the number of times I slid off a platform and died. However, if you can get past the skidding then the immersion in the game will surely wisk you away.\n\n(Also, I might just be an idiot, but at some points in the game I wasn't sure what to do next. Sometimes the AI just wouldn't open the door, othertimes I just needed to wander to see what I missed, or I didn't know that jumping and then crouching let you jump onto object that were just a little bit above your jumping range...)\n\nFinal Rating- 9.5/10 of a scientist (You were so close, but the last 1/2 SKIDDED away!)","timestamp_created":1535508238,"timestamp_updated":1535509339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.700965464115142822","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44434731","author":{"steamid":"76561198090876631","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":175,"last_played":1613121247},"language":"koreana","review":"하다 멀미나서 토함","timestamp_created":1535503661,"timestamp_updated":1535503661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561752974987030029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44434186","author":{"steamid":"76561198797693032","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":75,"last_played":1584701940},"language":"english","review":"Dont know what the hype is about\njust another shooter\nAverage","timestamp_created":1535500665,"timestamp_updated":1535500665,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.304568588733673096","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44433835","author":{"steamid":"76561198152073934","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1035,"last_played":1558217287},"language":"spanish","review":"Todo un clásico del género.

A game that everyone raved about for years, and a game until about a month ago, I never played. So, eager to see why everyone loved it so, I played it. And here were my thoughts.\n\nHalf-Life 1 is a first person shooter. In it you assume the role of the now famous and beloved Gordan Freeman, your average theoretical physacist. He was working at a facility called Black Mesa along with other scientists to understand and create teleportation technology, when the situation turns dire due to an alien invasion. From there, it's up to you to do whatever you need to get out of there in one piece. As not only aliens are there to hunt down an kill anything in their path, but military forces are also there to eliminate evidence and anyone involved in the incident. Pretty standard story overall, but it's enjoyable enough to convince someone why they'd be going on this crazy adventure.\n\nThe story is pretty standard, and that holds somewhat true for the gameplay as well. It's a first person shooter. You move, you jump, you shoot everyone else who wants to kill you, etc. There are a few things to help it stand out form your everyday shooter though. One important feature is the call system. By pressing the use key (Set to e) on non hostile NPCs, you can have them follow you around, aid in shooting enemies if they have weapons, and open doors you can't yourself. In theory, this should be a great feature that can show off the kinds of things you can do. There's a few problems though. The first and most identifable is the lack of use it actually has. The ability to use them is limited becuase they aren't many of them found in the game. Not only that, but you can never have them travel more than a short distance from where you find them, because the level design never accounts for you wanting to bring them along, so they end up left behind after you find one, with maybe 2 exceptions. The other issue is that scientists, one of the two types of allies you can recruit, are completely useless aside from opening doors, making them the same as a keycard. And since they're placed mostly in areas without enemies, there's no danger to it, making the trek to have them open a door a timewaster. \n\nWhile I do have problems with how the level design doesn't accomodate for that specific mechanic, I will say that the level design as a whole is fantastic, and my favorite thing about the game. Many of the levels aren't just about shooting the same five enemy types over and over. It does have that of course, but a lot of the game is about platforming and puzzle solving, traversing a level in an often strange way, like finding hidden vents, or hopping out of a window of a building onto a ledge outside to reach a ladder you couldn't get to otherwise. There are a number of great examples that go even beyond this. Going through the waste plant and figuruing out to to stop moving pistons at the right time to get past them, the sequence involving killing a tentacle creature, and many more. \n\nNot only are the most of the levels good, but I can say the same for the shooting and weapons. The best way to descibe combat is fast paced. There's no cover except for walls, and your relatively fast movement speed means dodging enemy attacks is actually easier than it looks. Minus some of the soldier enemies who have very good accuracy. The alien enemies remind a lot of Doom, where energy attacks are what they use and, aside from one of them, can be dodged by some good old fashioned movement. And not only are the enemies solid, so are the weapons. You get several different types of weapons. Most of them are standard weapons we all have seen before, a pistol, crossbow, assault rifle, magum, and grenades. But, there are a few unique ones that were actually a lot of fun to mess around with. One was an energy weapon that could disintegrate enemies, and another one has rechargable ammo that shoots homing hornets at enemies. \n\nHowever, it's not perfect. Some levels or sections actually feel poorly designed, or a re just plain irritating. The helicopter sequence topped off with landmines you can't see, requiring you to shoot randomly at the ground to get rid of them, the laser section, where tripping one of them is instant death. Actually any section that can instantly kill you is a pain, becuase they all felt like gotcha moments that take you by surprise. The falling pipeline and collasping ceiling get my special mention for cheap 1 hit-kill bologne. and of course the final level of the game is just bad. I really did not like it, which stinks because most of the game WAS enjoyable, and even the final level had a few good moments in it, like the intro section with the platforming or the shootuout in the section before the final boss.\n\nWhile I made mention of levels and setpieces, there are also some problems with the shooting. Grenades are awful and don't accomodate for moviing around at all. Try throwing one while moving, and watch it move all of 3 feet in front of you. Some of the weapons are a lot better than others. The Assault Rifle and Shotgun are bsically the best weapons in the game, because tons of enemies drop ammo for it and both weapons have great attack power. On the other hand, C4 and sensor bombs are so situational, I can only think of 2 or 3 places each that they can really be of good use. The sme thing can be said for enemies. Some of them are more fair than others. One of the aliens in particular has a pretty unfair lightning attack that if not hiding behind a wall, will always hit you, dealing some solid damage. Some headcrabs are also cheaply placed in vents and constantly surprise you around corners, from above, or when you drop down, and getting free hits in on you while doing so. The damage is pretty small, but it still feels cheap regardless. \n\nFor some other positive things, I'd like to talk about the music and graphics. Music in this game is actually pretty minimal. Asider from certain sections and shootuts with enemies, it's actually very quiet. And I like that. It allows you to focus on traversing levels and the enviornment around you, which I feel is important for this game. And the music that does play is still good. It's mostly used to pump you up for the upcoming challenge, but I liked what was on offer. And I'd say the same for graphics. For a game in 1998, it looks nice. Not amazing, especially nowadays, but it does the job well enough. And for a game from that time, it was certainly something amazing. Not much else to say in all honesty.\n\nI know that reading back, my review sounds somewhat negative, but I do want to assure people that this was a very good game. What it does right it really does right, and the issues I had were not too prevelent, just noticable enough for me to discuss when talking about the game. I do give it a reccomendation, and I will say it's a game worth your time.","timestamp_created":1535155702,"timestamp_updated":1535167398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44359017","author":{"steamid":"76561198286474745","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2778,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":577,"last_played":1650254020},"language":"english","review":"This Games Pretty Nice Its Also Hard But i LOVE IT i recommend getting it","timestamp_created":1535151828,"timestamp_updated":1535151828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44351707","author":{"steamid":"76561198128253537","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":888,"last_played":1590097314},"language":"english","review":"No matter how many years have passed this game remains just amazing.
