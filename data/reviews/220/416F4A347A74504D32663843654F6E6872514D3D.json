Одна з, якщо не найкраща гра коли-нибудь створена людством.[/h1]\nНе дарма кожен геймер знає Half-Life, навіть ті хто не грав.\n\nІгровий процес насичен дуже динамічною, медитативною іноді, підходящою музикою. Також навіть у 2022 році фізика предметів не така й погана, я б навіть сказав добра. Але головний скарб цієї гри - сюжет та його сенс. Я вважаю що, кожна людина по різному інтерпретує для себе сюжет, але розповім про те, що і є (як для мене) сенс сюжету. У самому початку гри ми бачимо, тотальний контроль кожного громадянина Сіті-17, величезну кількість поліцейських та дронів які стежать за людьми, які існуть лише для того щоб існувати.\nВийшовши на площу ми одразу бачимо усіма нелюбимого, невибраного \"президента\" проходячи у деяких домах ми чуємо що з кожного кутку працює радіо через яку розмовляє \"презік\" і каже про якісь найвищи цілі людства, поки самі люди не можуть навіть їсти їжу яку їм дають через те що, вона тупо гидотна. Мені це як раз нагадало про СРСР та сьогоднішню путінську росію (поліцейське государство, тотальний контроль, відсутність незалежних ЗМІ, масові арешти на мітингах, репресії і так далі). Але, із появою Гордона Фрімена у людей з'явилася надія, що вони можуть cкинуть владу яка засіла в дуже високому хмарочосі (приклад символизму - влада дивиться на народ звисока, та не баче їх проблем) він для них - месія. Це вже нам розказує про те, що основна мета гри - донести що, людина має бути свободною і що, свобода - один із головних скарбів людини. Гра змушує боротися, за свою волю, за свої права. Наслідки \"неборотьби\" ми можемо бачити на прикладі Північної Кореї або тієї ж самої росії, люди не готові боротися за свої права, люди бояться, вони обрали для себе шлях рабства, і це дуже прикро бачити... \nЧи вдалося Гордону (не Дмитру) та іншим побороти зло, я вам не скажу :)\n\nУВАГА! СПОЙЛЕРИ \n [spoiler] За годину до кінця десь(або менше, або більше, не дуже пам'ятаю) Воллес Брін вирішив залишити на вірну смерть усе людство заради своєї вигоди, що свідчить про те що, таким як Брін завжди було, і буде начхати на простих людей, вони для нього були ресурсом досягнення своїх цілей. \nКІНЦІВКА. \nПід кінець час зупинився, та з'явився загадковий G-Man, та сказав що, не буде пропонувати ілюзійний вибор Гордону, бо за нього і так вже все вирішено. Мабуть розробники хочуть цим сказати, що ми,люди нікчемні у порівнянні із всесвітом (що я вважаю так і є) і не маємо якось вибору, що все відбувається так, як і повинно відбуватись, що є якась вища сила, яка завжди все вирішує за людство. Це дуже загадковий момент у грі, надає полотно для роздумів... [/spoiler]\n[b] Висновки : гра отримує оцінку 10/10, гра обов'язкова для ознайомлення кожному геймеру, має сильний глибокий сюжет та геймплейні механіки. \n\nДякую за те, що приділили увагу моєму обзору!

No question about it. You take on the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman again in an dystopian future, where you try to save the remainder of the population on Earth. From the intro of the game you can see that Earth has gone well beyond \"democracy\". There are government propaganda messages blaring from speakers everywhere for you to obey them, police officers will attack you with no warning. Every government official is extremely hostile towards usual civilians. The government has also huge robots that will try to kill you along with hordes of soldiers.\n\nYou are trying to help a small remaining rebel forces who have a plan how to stop the government. This is a classic FPS with a great story, and great levels, different kind of weapons, different ways of solving things, also having aliens trying to help you, this game is everything what every game should be. Fun, clever, intuitive, easy to use, excellent story telling, and you are immersed in Half Life world in no time. You want more. There is really a small number of virtual worlds that have all the qualities here stated. A really small number.\n\nThis is a must have, must play, must replay, must have 100+ hours on it to enjoy it. I played through HF1 + HF2 six or seven times so far. I played previously the pirated version, but I also bought all the originals, they deserve whatever money Steam asks you to pay. The only thing that I ever wanted to tattoo on me was a crowbar logo from Half Life.

The enemy A.I. is relentless and there are some parts where you just don't have the health and/or shields to beat some enemies forcing you to think of ways to beat them with your assortment of weapons including a crowbar, gravity gun, pistols, machine guns, smgs, and shotguns. It's tough but once you beat some levels you breathe a sigh of relief and can pat yourself on the back when you beat a seemingly endless wave of enemies or you finally beat the bosses in the game.  \n\nHalf-Life 2 is an amazing game, deserving of its storied title as one of the greatest video games ever developed.","timestamp_created":1647978913,"timestamp_updated":1653840135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ztPM2f8CeOnhrQM="}
