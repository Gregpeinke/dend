The game was truly a lot of fun and  I was very eager to check out portal now that I've rediscovered in the midst of steam sales. Noone can complain for the price tag of 2 dollars and even 10 isn't too much to ask considering what you are getting.\n\nPros:\n-The puzzles are very engaging and fun to play.\n-It is made with the source engine meaning its easy to create new levels.\n-The storyline is unique and unlike any other series I have seen so far.\n-Fans of the talos principle will enjoy this game, fans of portal will enjoy the talos principle.\n-Turrets that try and kill you always say they don't blame you for deactivating them before they could do their jobs.\n-Cake\n\nCons:\n-The story line was kind of short, I finished it in two hours.\n-Its a lot easier if you've already played portal 2.\n\nExtra Notes:\nIf you have not played any of the portal games, start with this one even though the graphics of portal 2 look nicer. Believe it, or not, the story actually sort of fits together. Also though Portal on its own was pretty hard (just wait until you get to the turrets), portal 2 has more stuff it can throw at you such as gels that do different things and it definitely achieves the \"creepy giant abandoned lab\" a bit more than this game.\n\nPortal 2 is one of my favorite games, I had some high expectations for the original portal game and I was not disappointed!","timestamp_created":1482482931,"timestamp_updated":1482483070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28552871","author":{"steamid":"76561198278839739","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":34,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1482480325},"language":"koreana","review":"3D멀미 한 번도 해본적이 없는데, 멀미가 미쳤음. 한시간하고 어지러워서 컴퓨터 바로 껐는데도 후유증이 몇시간을감  게임이 재밌으면 뭐하나.. 하질 못하는데 ㅠㅠ","timestamp_created":1482480531,"timestamp_updated":1483089859,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28552721","author":{"steamid":"76561198086791194","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":113,"playtime_forever":650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":646,"last_played":1658728504},"language":"english","review":"Knowing we might never get a third Portal makes me very sad.
