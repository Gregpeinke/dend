In this game, nothing was ever creepy or unexpected. Nothing jumped at you from around a corner, or mumbled to themselves about how everything turned out wrong. The tone in this game is just completely different from the other two Bioshock games. They literally changed every aspect of the games. There is no history in this game that leads back to those games expect in the last few scenes where you \"revisit\" Rapture for about 2 minutes where there is no Plasmids, no combat, and no story. It's just a place to go to watch Songbird die. Bioshock Infinite should have included some aspect of Rapture. Setting a similar game in the past of an amazing game was just generally a bad idea because it didn't even try to include anything relating to the other 2 Bioshock games. Sure, the gameplay is okay, but eventually you just start wondering, \"How the fuck is this a Bioshock game? It doesn't even relate to Bioshock or Bioshock 2!\". And there is no freedom of movement throughout the game. There is no extra routes you can take. It seriously gives you one path to walk. It's like throwing you on a road with just an arrow pointing straight ahead. There are no cross-sections, no intersections. You do what they say and you get no other choice.

It's not a revolutionary game but it's not bad by any means. In fact it's one of the better games I've played this year, though that doesn't really say much.\n\nIt's very appearent though that this game focuses more on it's story than the previous Bioshock installments. And while the story in this game is probably the best one out of all the Bioshock games, the gameplay sort of suffered from it. Lot's of working gameplay features have been removed. \nInfinite isn't a Shooter with RPG elements like the previous installments, it's just a plain shooter. This design choice seems rather odd to me, as none of the Bioshock games have been known for \"tremendous gunplay\". It works, but gets really bland after a while, and the plasmids (or in this game \"vigors\") don't really help too much. I've ended up using like 2 of them as most of them pretty much do the same thing, that being stun + damage, the only difference being that certain enemy types are not affected by certain vigors.\n\nSo when it comes down to it, Infinite is a more or less 12 hour movie with barely above decent shooting inbetween the rather nice story sections.\n\nIf you want to look into it, I'd definitly wait for it to go on sale, which is what I did. I payed 10 bucks and got a pretty good game for that price, but would have probably felt ripped off if I payed full price, since it doesn't offer near as much content gameplay-wise as the previous Bioshocks did.","timestamp_created":1388181100,"timestamp_updated":1388181643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8346798","author":{"steamid":"76561197963785518","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":758,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":758,"last_played":1388175758},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game.

В городе все думают что это их рожденная дочь, Леди Комсток не признает ее и не хочет скрывать правду, Комсток убивает ее и скидывает все на Дейзи Фицрой (лидер \"Глаза народа\") Лютесов тоже решает убрать, наверное слишком много знают.. но они избегают смерти и теперь могут появляться везде где только захотят, в любом времени и пространстве как Г-ман загадочный персонаж из Халфы (я не совсем понял как они так умеют, скорее побочный эффект от их машины открывающий разрывы(порталы) в другие вселенные) Лютесы знают какие планы у Комстока и решают ему помешать, зовут Букера ДеВитта из той вселенной где он не принял крещение, не стал Комстоком, где нет Колумбии.\n1912г - начинаются события Биошока Инфинита.\n\nМожет для некоторых концовка маленько мозг выносит, но мне все понятно было, знаю что концовку не все поймут. Еще я встречал некоторых любителей первых частей кому не понравился новый биошок, но это большая редкость, и название \"Биошок\" очень даже подходит, привыкли просто что действия происходят под водой а тут город в небесах, ну, каждому свое, я и первые части люблю и новый биошок не меньше.","timestamp_created":1388163030,"timestamp_updated":1480338912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551093637943267822","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8337958","author":{"steamid":"76561198055440975","num_games_owned":375,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":385,"last_played":1652101420},"language":"english","review":"An exciting first-person shooter.

Lediglich die Irrenanstalt ist etwas düster und gruselig. \nAlles in allem bleibt das Spiel trotz sehr interessantem Setting und atemberaubender Grafik spielerisch doch eher mau und so ist man nach ca. 16 Stunden Spielzeit auch irgendwie froh, das man es hinter sich hat..","timestamp_created":1388145202,"timestamp_updated":1388145202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527862489223480225","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8330640","author":{"steamid":"76561198025478982","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2836,"last_played":1498415233},"language":"french","review":"C TRO KOOL","timestamp_created":1388142462,"timestamp_updated":1388142462,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540571987628936768","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8330468","author":{"steamid":"76561198107164206","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":599,"last_played":1387820393},"language":"russian","review":"Реально классная игра, из недостатков - это отсутствие русского перевода субтитров, под MAC","timestamp_created":1388141979,"timestamp_updated":1388141979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8330199","author":{"steamid":"76561198052825966","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1362,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":778,"last_played":1409190951},"language":"italian","review":"Definitely more than a game to play, it's a visual and inner experience that goes beyond the mere combat.
