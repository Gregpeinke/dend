Hra beží na novom engine, ktorý poháňa aj HL2. Človek by si pomyslel, že autori sa chytia príležitosti a prekopú hru od základu, ale nestalo sa tak. Jedná sa naozaj o surový prechod do HD. Na textúry sa pozerá všeobecne lepšie ako aj na modely postáv a nové efekty, ale stále sa naskytá pocit, že tých zmien je jednoducho málo. Primárnou zmenou je vyššie rozlíšenie a možnosť hrať hru na širokouhlých obrazovkách. No nie všetky zmeny, ktoré obsahuje tento remake oproti pôvodnému dielu by sa dali hodnotiť kladne. Hra obsahuje množstvo bugov. Niektoré pobavia a niektoré dokážu strpčiť samotné hranie. Umelá inteligencia je miestami naozaj mizerná a až tragická. Doslova šokujúco pôsobia zmeny v dizajne niektorých lokácií, kde pôvodné textúry boli nahradené otrasnými 3D modelmi, ktoré anulujú atmosféru epických scén. Všeobecne možno povedať, že v jadre je to stále Half-Life, ale v tomto prevedení to jednoducho nie je to, čo mohlo alebo malo byť a jeho kúpa sa skôr vyplatí zberateľovi ako bežnému hráčovi.\n\n65%","timestamp_created":1407438214,"timestamp_updated":1407438463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.74516671895980835","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11570259","author":{"steamid":"76561198090179263","num_games_owned":799,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":765,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":704,"last_played":1551404709},"language":"english","review":"Well what is there to say that hasnt already been said about this obvious classic some parts not exactly hold up well mainly the platforming sections but apart from that still an amazingly fun and atmospheric landmark game in the first person shooter genre .","timestamp_created":1407301164,"timestamp_updated":1407301164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11570165","author":{"steamid":"76561198115058786","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":73,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":42,"last_played":1408330310},"language":"english","review":"Half life 2 was the first one i played, so coming back to this game is a shock graphic wise yet i cant stop playing the game.

What I and many people didn't like about the source version was that, when we heard from Valve we were going to get a source remake of Half-life we though it was going to be amazing, although when HL:S was delivered it was just a source port. Although I would absolutely fine with this port if it wasn't for the bugs, glitches and gameplay.\n\nSuprisingly Half-life Source has more bugs than the original game, and these bugs are awful almost breaking the experince. Even after the 10 years its been out, this game hasn't been fixed. Half-Life 1 is my favorite FPS game it topples everything in my opinion(even the sequels), and to be a port how can the gameplay be bad?\n\nWell, since Half-life is running on a new engine the hit points and aiming is horrendous, for example the chopper: In the original game it took one or two hits to know the chopper down and a full charge from the tau cannon. However the the damage never seems to register properly so it makes the game unplayable. And it ruins the shooting with the new kick-backs of the weapons.\n\nHalf-Life: Source is an unpolished port and massive trump in valves libary of games.\nBut would I reccomend it?\nOf course not, you should really just grab the original it has the single player campaign working flawlessly and a multiplayer that comes with it, unlike Source where you have to purchase it independently.\n\nBut if you feel like playing this game in the source engine and you think it looks good then I would say maybe get it.\n\nEven though there is a source port for the original Half-life that looks superb.\n\n6/10","timestamp_created":1405934558,"timestamp_updated":1436573074,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11339174","author":{"steamid":"76561198032044612","num_games_owned":576,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":651,"last_played":1405897577},"language":"english","review":"Please fix hitmarkers on helicopters!

Hell yes. Would I recommend Half-Life: Source? Er, maybe. The original Half-Life was, and still is, an absolutely fantastic game. The story and how it’s conveyed to the player works extremely well, and the controls, gameplay mechanics, visuals, and sound are all phenomenal. Very few bugs, and certainly none game-breakingly noteworthy.\n\nHowever, this is where Half-Life: Source fails. This game’s major problem is its glitches and bugs. Some minor, some absolutely game-breaking. On one hand, you have scientist’s AI screwed up, running into open fire, constantly shooting off their response lines. On the other hand, you have some parts of the game where the textures and models go apeshit, essentially simulating your graphics card melting.\n\nEven with the bugs, the game does try to make it up with some enhancements thanks to the Source engine. The water effects are slightly better (although in my experiences it’s just extraordinarily shiny and reflective), and the lighting effects are significantly improved, although inconsistent when walking into an area that needs to load. However, the HL2 bullet hole decals make it possible to create magnificent works of art with your crowbar on walls. \n\nThankfully, the gameplay, controls, and overall look and appeal of the game is still there, unaltered. There’s no denying that the game is awesome. Half-Life in general is awesome. I just love how people on the GoldSrc version of Half-Life were complaining about the game having extremely old and outdated graphics, saying HL:Source is better in this field. Well, it’s not. A majority of textures and models are completely identical. Aside from the water and bullet decals, the games are visually the same, which is something I’m completely fine with. The regular version of Half-Life actually comes with the HD texture pack, something this port lacks. It essentially gives the game updated models to characters and weapons, and slightly enhanced textures in some areas. It’s nice, but not essential, which is fine.\n\nOverall, yeah, go ahead and get it. If this is ever on sale for cheaper than the regular Half-Life, and you own neither, by all means, go ahead and get it. You (hopefully) won’t regret it.\n","timestamp_created":1404308119,"timestamp_updated":1404308119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":77,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.825117886066436768","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10997650","author":{"steamid":"76561198037586730","num_games_owned":692,"num_reviews":378,"playtime_forever":679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":679,"last_played":1404213090},"language":"english","review":"I went into this having played hl2, but not the original.

This also provides a bit more backstory to the universe, which is good.\n\nA wide variety of weapons available. More so than hl2, I think, which is interesting and quite neat. It makes sense, given that this is set in a scietific research complex.\n\nI had some trouble getting my xbox controller to work with this, but I think using a keyboard/mouse setup works better. There's no real need for a gamepad here.\n\nTextures are about the right wuality for the age of the game. Not great by \"today\" standards, but still better than some games released about that time.\n\nThe soundtrack in this is really good, but the voices in the game can sound a bit garbled and echo-ey at times.\n\nDespite the fact that this is a moderately old game, the source remake means that it has no compatibility issues with newer systems.\n\nIf you've never played the original half life, then definitely buy this game.
