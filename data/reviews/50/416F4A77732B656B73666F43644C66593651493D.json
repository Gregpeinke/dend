finished with the game yet but I thought I would just write the review since Im at the end and I dont think much will change that will effect my overall thoughts on the game.\n\nI am very conflicted on whether or not I enjoy this expansion for a few reasons, the main one being: its too damn difficult. Its to the point of unfairness. Granted I am playing on Hard but its just stupid. A good majority of the enemies are humans with guns that take half a mag from your SMG to kill and while your trying to chase one down three more will be pounding you with grenades while another one sprints up to you and unloads before you can even look at him. The first few times it happens its an intense rush and extremely satisfying when you finally clear the room but now Im at the point where Im about 4 hours into this and Im still fighting them and its just frustrating and grueling at this point and I just want the game to end. Whenever you think you finally hit the end, you go down a vent and then another chapter begins full of the same 6 enemies to fight over and over maybe with a boss fight sprinkled in, which I will say are pretty fun sections. On the other hand, Blue Shift can be beaten in about 3 hours and manages to keep doing different things to keep the gameplay fresh throughout that time and this is where Opposing Force falls flat on its face for me. Dont get me wrong I still have fun for a good portion of the game but as I said before, its dragging on far too long in my opinion and it doesnt have enough gameplay variety to make it fun passed the 3 hour mark.\n\nThis is one of those times where I wish steam had a \"meh\" button but because it doesnt I'll just recommend it because I truly do think its a good expansion for HL1 but when compared to the OG game and Blue Shift it really doesnt compare for me.\n\n6.6/10\n\n\nEDIT: Just beat it and as I expected theres nothing that really changes my original thoughts on the game. Final boss was pretty lackluster but besides that it was a neat ending.","timestamp_created":1625539647,"timestamp_updated":1625543187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510638296604156494","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95140449","author":{"steamid":"76561199077477927","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":456,"last_played":1625447414},"language":"brazilian","review":"Achei topzera !","timestamp_created":1625525833,"timestamp_updated":1625525833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95136447","author":{"steamid":"76561199069514581","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":747,"last_played":1625437450},"language":"spanish","review":"Es lo que considerarías un juego m1lf.
