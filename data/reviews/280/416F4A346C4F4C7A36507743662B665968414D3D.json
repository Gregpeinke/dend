No, this piece of garbage is only good for the Garry's Mod maps.\nIt's so sad that mine and many other's favourite FPS series got done thiiiiis dirty.\nEdit: Was way too angry when originally writing this so I didn't actually list any reasons.\nFirst off, credit time:\n-Physics!\nProps can be knocked over and have regular gravity and movement! Nice!\n-The premise.\nThe idea of HL Source is that it as a port of a Gldsrc game to Source, the newer better version, and this allows it to show off and compare the newer physics to the much more basic original engine.\nIt also is a great way of showing off new software like it was a tech-demo of sorts.\n\nNegatives\n-No longer supported by updates.\nValve has completely shafted this game and hasn't updated it for a very long time which has caused major issues. The game engine, Source, is frequently updated and the updates encompass all games with the Source SDK but this can create new bugs in earlier Source titles which is why they are looked through by developers often to detect and fix mistakes caused by the engine updates. But HLS is no longer receiving individual updates so any bugs caused by Source updates linger and build-up over time. Not good.\nI will not list all bugs but there are videos on the bugs on YT that include but are not limited to:\nA boss causing no damage if using a certain attack\nSkybox leaking through the map and obstructing vision in a very dangerous area for the player\nAreas and obstacles that insta-killed you in the original game easily being tanked through if there is enough health and HEV Energy\n-Unintentional gameplay changes\nHow weapons and damage work has been changed when transitioning from game engine so the SMG spread went from normal to fuckin' ludicrous and areas too high for the player to survive falling down can now be survived as the damage no longer functions similarly, Valve should've tweaked this to make it work similarly enough to the original but they didn't.\n-Misc\nCertain tones of areas have been unintentionally destroyed.\nEarly on into the original, a dark, ominous and hazardous hallway acts as an obstacle, it is very atmospheric but the tone is ruined b this bright DirectX sheen on the floor. This means that the floor is also extremely bright, not a big deal if the area is meant to be lit up but the hallway is supposed to be dark and spooky making the new bright floor really out of place.\nThis hallway also contains an insta-kill electrical hazard that forced the player to find and use a different route to advance forward, pretty neat. Unfortunately, like I said before, damage has been altered heavily meaning that it is surprisingly easy to walk through the hazard with very little damage taken despite the fact that the hazard was always meant to gib you (\"gib\" means explode the player into meaty, tasty giblets).\n\nThe hallway is a perfect example of the main issues this game holds and how it ruins the fundamentals of the OG game. \n\n\n\n\n\nvalve pls

es simplemente malo, Half Life 1 original es un videojuego hermoso que pese a sus limitantes logro mucho en su √©poca, pero esto, simplemente es un mal chiste, bastantes bugs, errores de texturas que se ven horribles y una IA completamente arruinada por el motor source, este port se queda en lo mediocre y mas sabiendo que Counter Strike: Source fue hecho desde 0 y con el lanzamiento de Black Mesa solo muestra como este, pese a ser una idea interesante, simplemente se queda en Half Life 1 con ragdolls y agua HD, si van a jugar al primer Half Life jueguen mejor al original de
