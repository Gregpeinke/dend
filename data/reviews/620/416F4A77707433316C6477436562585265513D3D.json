A tão aguardada sequência do igualmente aclamado pela crítica [i] Portal [/i] leva todos os conceitos do primeiro jogo para novos patamares, acrescentando diversas melhorias e mecânicas na gameplay, expandindo a história ainda mais, e é claro, a inclusão de um fantástico modo co-op. Tudo isso e mais você confere nesta análise!\n\n[h1] Uma primeira pincelada [/h1]\n\nBom, leve em conta isto antes de se aventurar pela Aperture Science! [i] Portal 2 [/i] é um puzzle, portanto, diversos enigmas e quebra-cabeças serão apresentados ao jogador para prosseguir no jogo, que geralmente envolvem o uso de cubos, botões sensíveis a pressão dos citados anteriormente, e é claro, portais. O modo multiplayer também se baseia em puzzle, podendo ser jogado apenas por dois jogadores, e envolve muito a cooperação entre ambos. Além disso, é altamente recomendado que você tenha jogado o primeiro, ou, como no meu caso, visto um vídeo. Um resumo da história do primeiro jogo pode ser encontrado [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Lpib9HPo7A] neste link [/url] (cortesia de MDGAMEPLAY), só tomem cuidado pois neste vídeo ele também aborda a história do segundo e correlaciona ambos com a série [i] Half-Life [/i], também feita pela Valve e que se passa no mesmo universo.\n\n[h1] Gráficos [/h1]\n\nO jogo utiliza o famoso motor gráfico Source, presente em quase todos os jogos da Valve e criado por ela mesma, conhecido principalmente por sua presença no game [i] Half-LIfe 2 [/i]. De minha opinião, os gráficos do jogo conseguem ser muito bonitos, mesmo que com certeza já foram superados por outros jogos mais atuais, eles ainda tem o seu charme, e também não são um grande problema principalmente pelo fato de no jogo inteiro nunca vermos outro ser humano além da protagonista Chell, sendo todos os personagens principais robôs ou inteligências artificiais. \n\nResumindo: Os gráficos do jogo são bem legais, levemente melhores do que os de [i] Portal [/i], porém não são um grande ponto no game em comparação a sua jogabilidade, que é o nosso próximo tópico!\n\n[h1] Jogabilidade [/h1]\n\nSem dúvida, a jogabilidade é o principal fator deste jogo. Neste jogo vemos é claro uma grande gama de puzzles e enigmas, e, como um amante de quebra-cabeças, eu não poderia estar mais empolgado ao ver um jogo destes. Além de sua mecânica fantástica de posicionamento de portais introduzida no primeiro jogo, o uso de momentum para manter a velocidade mas mudar o trajeto, e é claro a presença de torretas, pontes, plataformas de repulsão e muito mais tornam a gameplay muito divertida e empolgante! O jogo tem uma linha de aprendizado bem justa, com um nível de dificuldade bem simples nas primeiras câmaras de teste, enquanto que as últimas vão precisar que você pense bastante em seus movimentos e no que fazer! O modo co-op, como dito anteriormente, expande a gameplay e muito, já que dessa vez são dois jogadores no mesmo mapa para resolver todas as situações-problema em sua frente! Muitos destes puzzles requerem que cada um dos jogadores se ajudem - como um deles prender o outro em um loop infinito de portais para que ele adquira uma alta velocidade para poder ser lançado para outra direção mantendo o impulso - e o jogo também pode ocasionar diversas situações engraçadas e confusas!\n\n[h1] Trilha-Sonora [/h1]\n\nBom, que Deus abençoe os compositores por trás deste jogo, porque nele estamos diante de uma das melhores e mais criativas soundtracks já feitas, dando um sentimento de tecnologia e sci-fi à la [i] Metroid Prime [/i] e também mantendo a emoção e suspense do jogo. Eu recomendo que você a confira no decorrer da sua jogatina desta maravilha, mas você também pode clicar [url=https://www.thinkwithportals.com/music.php] aqui [/url] para baixar todas as músicas do game.\n\n[h1] História [/h1]\n\nA história deste jogo é simplesmente FENOMENAL! Eu havia tentado a resumir mas infelizmente não consegui devido ao limite de linhas das análises da Steam, portanto peço que caso você queira conferir ela, consulte [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Lpib9HPo7A] este vídeo [/url] (o mesmo vídeo citado anteriormente, feito pelo canal MDGAMEPLAY), mas eu recomendo que você a veja na sua própria gameplay.\n\n[h1] Resumindo [/h1]\n\n[i] Portal 2 [/i] é sem dúvidas um dos melhores jogos já feitos. Uma obra prima atemporal, que é um daqueles jogos que você deve jogar antes de morrer, e que até hoje inspira outros títulos puzzle e plataforma. Uma história muito bem construída, um humor ácido muito bom, atuação incrível para cada personagem (exceto Chell, já que ela não fala durante todo o jogo, uma característica similar a um certo físico de óculos que usa um pé de cabra), trilha-sonora maravilhosa, jogabilidade muito divertida, enfim, sem dúvidas merece sua atenção!\n\nBom, esta é uma pequena homenagem (em forma de análise) que eu gostaria de fazer a este jogo, que é sem dúvidas meu game favorito. Muito obrigado você que leu até aqui, e tenha um ótimo dia!","timestamp_created":1495897054,"timestamp_updated":1607313995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31998428","author":{"steamid":"76561197980994912","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":687,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":644,"last_played":1656575827},"language":"english","review":"Awesome!","timestamp_created":1495896578,"timestamp_updated":1495896578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31997408","author":{"steamid":"76561198034964235","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":567,"last_played":1378497212},"language":"english","review":"Great follow-up to portal 1","timestamp_created":1495893487,"timestamp_updated":1495893487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31996856","author":{"steamid":"76561198160289269","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2546,"last_played":1643696426},"language":"english","review":"Good game","timestamp_created":1495891767,"timestamp_updated":1495891767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31994182","author":{"steamid":"76561198059267337","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1605,"last_played":1624680465},"language":"english","review":"Killing your friends simulator.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1495883321,"timestamp_updated":1495883321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548387110233306885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31990569","author":{"steamid":"76561197999423205","num_games_owned":394,"num_reviews":115,"playtime_forever":473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":473,"last_played":1388864780},"language":"english","review":"Fun!","timestamp_created":1495870153,"timestamp_updated":1495870153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31988555","author":{"steamid":"76561198139797836","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":71,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71,"last_played":1476545243},"language":"schinese","review":"因为小精灵至宝才过来致敬","timestamp_created":1495861043,"timestamp_updated":1495861043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31988430","author":{"steamid":"76561198245621774","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1948,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1005,"last_played":1642610157},"language":"schinese","review":"你在看评测，那我估计你不熟悉这个游戏，我只能告诉你，买了绝对不会后悔，steam上玩过最好的小游戏，神作，跟好友开黑打合作模式美滋滋","timestamp_created":1495860471,"timestamp_updated":1495860471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616151511669158936","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31984758","author":{"steamid":"76561198103787534","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":2287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1744,"last_played":1636259020},"language":"english","review":"This game is great.

Why would the sequel double in price?\n\nI'll explain.\n\nPortal 2 is so much more than that short puzzle experience it started as. New puzzle components have been added and some have been mechanically improved. The story mode is much more interactive and overall more fun and amusing. (Dialogue in this game is masterfully written, I'd like to point out.)\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. Have I mentioned multiplayer?\n\nThe cooperative testing initiative might be the main selling point of this game, as Atlas and P-Body the robots were prominently featured in more trailers than Chell herself. Not only that, but there's a 2-pack for purchase that allows you to gift a copy of the game to a friend. Now, if that isn't an invitation to play together, I don't know what is.\n\nBut the co-op is marvelous fun. The puzzles require you to think with more portals, and automatic voice chat streamlines the playing experience, allowing you to not even need to bother holding a button or getting Discord. And oh god is it fun pushing your friends into the goo. Since when did this game become a survival game?\n\nStill not enough for you? Well, prepare to have your socks knocked off.\n\nLevel creator.\n\nYes, in this game is included a FREE test chamber creator that allows for near-endless gameplay. And if that's a little too... Primitive for your taste, it also includes a download for a Hammer editor that allows you to essentially create a new game. (I'd like to point you into the direction of chambers like 12 Angry Tests that can only be described as Portal 2.5.)\n\nAre you still dissatisfied with this? Well, your loss. I guess you'll never see the amazing finale to the game's single-player first-hand. Honestly the only regret I have is spoiling myself of the amazing ending.","timestamp_created":1495658640,"timestamp_updated":1495658640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31940699","author":{"steamid":"76561198305743127","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1440,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":845,"last_played":1648331701},"language":"polish","review":"Kocham","timestamp_created":1495657417,"timestamp_updated":1495657417,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31940132","author":{"steamid":"76561198131912234","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1062,"last_played":1497360624},"language":"schinese","review":"一部优秀的FPS解密类游戏\n双人合作模式是考验双方智商的时候\n解说模式简直业界良心\n最后说一句 G胖不会数3","timestamp_created":1495655214,"timestamp_updated":1495655214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31940064","author":{"steamid":"76561198093352238","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":314,"last_played":1588705254},"language":"turkish","review":"\"Co-op Will be good\" -Valve \"Unless the other one trolls\"","timestamp_created":1495654938,"timestamp_updated":1495654938,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31939709","author":{"steamid":"76561198378127028","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":20316,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":775,"last_played":1657281708},"language":"russian","review":"Один интересный факт:космос не существует","timestamp_created":1495653534,"timestamp_updated":1495653534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31937161","author":{"steamid":"76561198108567400","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1544,"last_played":1495643694},"language":"english","review":"Best musical ending 10/10","timestamp_created":1495643768,"timestamp_updated":1495643768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31937120","author":{"steamid":"76561198345847052","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1501843822},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 is a fantastic successor to a fantastic game. The original Portal was a game that had everything it needed and nothing more, and while this made for a tight, filler-free experience from start to finish. it also failed to satisfy many people, who saw the massive potential the mechanics had and demanded more to whet their appetites. This is the game to satisfy those people. Portal 2 takes the original game's concept and runs with it, adding a ton of new ways to sove puzzles and interact with the environment, from light bridges to lasers to three types of gels, each having a unique impact on the surface it coats. While this adds variety and a greater play time, it comes at the cost of adding some flab to the slim as a whistle Portal experience, meaning that some of this game's playtime is wasted on pointless filler, something that could not be said of Portal 1. However, the advantage of this is a much greater sense of scale and ambition, making the game feel more substantial and leaving the player less hungry. It's like choosing between a small portion of a fantastic steak and a medium portion of a fantastic steak that's just a tad overdone. Which one you prefer will depend on whether you want the best experience possible of if you don't want to feel hungry at the end of the night. The story is also top-notch. The principle of more carries over here, as more characters are added and more time is spent developing the world and the characters and the plot. Again, which plot you prefer is down to personal preference, but either way you'll be getting a lot of laughs. Finally, on top of all that, this game has a fantastic co-op mode, which, unlike the single player mode, is short, sweet, and has no filler to get in the way of some of the most brilliant puzzles in the Portal canon.
