Portal is perfect. Portal 2 is not. It's something better than that. It's human: hot-blooded, silly, poignant, irreverent, base, ingenious and loving. It's never less than a pure video game, but it's often more, and it will no doubt stand as one of the best entertainments in any medium. It's a masterpiece. Valve did an awesome job carrying on from where Portal 1 left off, the twists and turns in the story were as entertaining as they were unseen. I've yet to beat the single player campaign, but finished the whole co-op campaign in 6hrs. Honestly, I have no idea where people are pulling \"It's just a 3hr game\" from, because unless you're just rushing through everything without even caring about the storyline/graphic design/changes to the spaces there is just no freaking way you can beat the whole game (single player and campaign) in just 3hrs. And if you're seriously just buying this game to rush to the end, then you need to stop playing video games, because they are meant to be enjoyed.\n\nThis game is well worth the price tag if you enjoyed the first game, even more so if you're a fan of co-op games (which the portal 2 co-op experiences went way over what I was expecting it to be!)","timestamp_created":1414462159,"timestamp_updated":1486410229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511148929595947266","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12663642","author":{"steamid":"76561197995742313","num_games_owned":612,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":2825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2162,"last_played":1500645149},"language":"hungarian","review":"Egyszerűen zseniális.","timestamp_created":1414458740,"timestamp_updated":1414458740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12663627","author":{"steamid":"76561198139963824","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1110,"last_played":1412797509},"language":"koreana","review":"난이도는 1편보다 쉬운 것 같아서 아쉽지만 협동 미션이 있어서 재밌었다. 창작마당에도 괜찮은 미션이 많아서 좋다.","timestamp_created":1414458648,"timestamp_updated":1414458648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12663200","author":{"steamid":"76561198156590125","num_games_owned":460,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":5291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4438,"last_played":1634276906},"language":"english","review":"If you like games, get this game.","timestamp_created":1414455657,"timestamp_updated":1527257655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12661953","author":{"steamid":"76561198140427874","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3097,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":526,"last_played":1585446601},"language":"english","review":"I loved this game; the plot was AWESOME!

Gut, mag sein das es nicht besonders lang ist, allerdings braucht es bei einem Bind- Run doch seine Zeit und außerdem bietet dieses Spiel einen zusäzlichen Coop- Modus, indem es noch mehr rätzel zu lösen, witzige Details, und Lachflashs durch das trollen gibt xD Na gut komme ich zum Inhalt: der herausragene Inhalt dieses Spiels macht sich größtenteils durch dessen Story bemerkbar, denn diese ist sehr spannend und unvorhersehbar 8ich gehe nicht weiter darauf ein wegen möglichen spoilern). ich empehle trotzdem, vorher den 1. Teil gespielt/gesehen zu haben, um die Anknüpfung gut zu verstehen. Was ebenfalls zu erwähnen ist, ist der Humor des Spiels. Wheatly, welcher im Deutschen vom deutschen Synrchonsprecher von Ironman, und im Englischen von Stephen Merchant - einem Komiker - gesprochen wird, gibt dem ganzen praktisch das Sahnehäubchen. Viele Sprüche von ihm oder anderen Charakteren, sind einfach nur zum totlachen witzig und passend. Viele kritisieren an diesem Spiel, das es keine wirklichen unterschiede zum 1. Teil gibt. hier ein paar Differenzen: \n- Ich mag es nicht schreiben aber es gehört dazu: bessere Grafik.\n- der - wie oben schon erwähnt - zusätzliche coop modus\n- die Story baut mehr spannung auf und es wird allgemein mehr über die Geschichte erzählt (Cave Johnson usw)\n- Im späteren Spiel verlauf gibt es mehrere Elemente, die das spiel um einiges schwerer machen\n\nNun gut, hier noch ein paar andere Argumente, wieso dieses Spiel sehr zu empfehlen ist: \nDa viele Rätsel echt schwierig sind, reizt dieses Spiel sehr. In der Steam Version sind zusätzlich noch viele Secrets zu finden, deren belohnung sich durch Erfolge markant macht. Im Coop - Modus macht es außerdem auch echt manchmal einfach spaß nur etwas Mist zu bauen und seinen Mitspieler zu nerven :) \n\nSpontan würde mir kein wirklicher Minuspunkt einfallen, außer vielleicht das es teilweise ein wenig eintönig ist, wenn die selben Elemente häufig hintereinander benutzt werden. \nich hoffe, diese Review zu Portal 2 konnte den ein oder anderen überzeugen. Wie gesagt, durch zusätzliche inhalte und die alleinige Liebe dieses Games sind 20€, bzw 25€(für das bundle pack mit portal eins welches ich empfehlen würde) echt verkraftbar :) \nIch entschuldige mich für Rechtschreib- Grammatik oder Zeichenfehler, da ich das ganze um halb 1 morgens verfasst habe xD Ich wünsche viel Spaß mit Portal 2!","timestamp_created":1414192183,"timestamp_updated":1414192183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12617078","author":{"steamid":"76561198123587870","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":7223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3613,"last_played":1650302665},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 is one of the greatest games I've ever played in my life.

Les graphismes ne sont peut être pas les plus beaux, avec des décors pas terrible sur certaines salles mais ils ont leur charme et ils restent très appréciable.\nSi je met 15 c'est surtout pour la durée de vie qui est trop courte et la difficulté qui reste assez moyenne meme sur les salles les plus durs.\n\nEn tout cas je le conseil a tout les fans de jeux vidéo et a ceux qui aiment réfléchir, c'est un jeu parfait pour faire de petite session salle par salle tout en rigolant bien :)\n","timestamp_created":1414181836,"timestamp_updated":1414181836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12613405","author":{"steamid":"76561198119535138","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":1631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":875,"last_played":1657346084},"language":"english","review":"Gun shoot no bullet! broken no buy!","timestamp_created":1414173059,"timestamp_updated":1419648572,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":94,"weighted_vote_score":"0.300340145826339722","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12613011","author":{"steamid":"76561198002009022","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":136,"playtime_forever":1394,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1394,"last_played":1323849600},"language":"english","review":"This game is great, but a bit sprawling, and the humor, level design and gameplay are not as tight as the first Portal. Some of the puzzles were way too much work to solve (it's supposed to be a _game_ guys, geez). I do like Wheatley and GlaDOS, but somehow they're a bit too much by the end. And the bleak loneliness of Aperture Science starts to drag.\n\nThe gel physics are great--both fun and artsy in exactly the way the first game was. A stroke of genius for the Portal team to find a concept that fit their world so well. Dare we hope for a Portal 3 one day?\n\nThe 2-player co-op mechanic is very cool. I played this with a friend who's kind of an FPS ninja, and I can't for the life of me remember most of what he instructed and did in order for us to get through the game. Guess that qualifies as replay value for me and someone else less ninja.\n","timestamp_created":1414171271,"timestamp_updated":1414171271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12612346","author":{"steamid":"76561197995709126","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1411,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1329,"last_played":1415877963},"language":"english","review":"this game is a total rip off of the original game \"portal\", they just added a 2 after the name so no one would notice","timestamp_created":1414168136,"timestamp_updated":1414168136,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.236522138118743896","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12611175","author":{"steamid":"76561198102721610","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1629650167},"language":"french","review":"Sa serait mieu qu'on puisse partagée plus longtemps la bibliotheque de jeux car on aimerais jouer a 2 et les 3 minutes disponible sont celle du chargement x) Mais sinon dans l'ensemble c'est le meilleurs jeux du monde ^^","timestamp_created":1414163121,"timestamp_updated":1414163121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12610252","author":{"steamid":"76561198074295635","num_games_owned":371,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1419140020},"language":"english","review":"A woman with millions of fan theories about without ever speaking a word.\nIntentionally designed to be stupid British cores.\nCruel women cores that are really good at singing.\nTurrets with low self esteem.\nA man that hates lemonade and sounds like J.

Portal 2 is a fantastic sequel to it's predecessor, Portal. With challenging puzzles that help the story along with varying difficulties, to an amazing story and hilarious dialogue and characters, Portal 2 was a blast. The 8 hours I spent in this game were amazing and both games are worth playing through even 7 years later.
