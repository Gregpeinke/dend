And naturally, Half-Life 2 is remembered one of the finest games to be realized and developed, even after a tumultuous and bumpy development.[/u]\n\n[h1]Now Episode One, really disappointed me and I will try to explain why here. [/h1]\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe game is set right after Half- Life 2 and tells the story of how Gordon and Alyx escaped the Citadel and City 17 without dying on the way.\n\nIt's a pretty weak story to be honest. The majority of the game is spent inside the Citadel and there is almost no story that is really relevant. They just go through room after room trying to escape Combine and uncovering the mysteries of the Citadel and the Regime, that seems to be affiliated with aliens in some sort of way.\n\nThe problem is that, even though the game is quite short, the story drags on and on and on, never delivering very good storytelling after all. You keep fighting through rooms of Combines for no appearent reason.\n\nThe best thing I could say about the story is the relationship and the bond you start to create with Alyx. She really feels alive and has a charm when talking to you that really makes you connect with her and care about her. It's definitely the best aspect of the story.\n\n[u]To conclude, the story on Episode One is very weak, it feels like it drags, even though the game's runtime is abysmally short, and it doesn't make you feel satisfied after going through it all. \nJust serves as a weak intermediary (or a bridge) to connect HL2 to the story they wanted to tell afterwards. [/u]\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\n[/u] Breaking everyone's arse with the Gravity Gun [/u]\n\nGameplay on Half-Life 2 was revolutionary at the time. It had a crazy amount of polish and work put into it so that it felt the most satisfying thing in the world. \nIt really was great.\nAnd the same gameplay is still here. Intact and unchanged. And that bothered me a bit.\n\nI don't mean to say that HL2 EP1's gameplay is bad or dated or anything, quite the contrary. The game has an awesome combat and it's by far the most enjoyable aspect of the game! But there is no innovation on it. No new experimentation. No nothing. \nEverything is still the same, and coming to this game right after HL2 and having the same gameplay mechanics and no new spices was really disappointing... \n\nThe story couldn't help this game much, but sadly the gameplay only made it kinda worse for me. \nThere were almost 4 levels that FORCED you to only use the Gravity Gun. It's implementation on HL2 served for awesome experimentation and creativity, but here they just forced your way into it and it made the experience even more of a let down.\n\n[u]There are almost no new weapons or attachments so it all feels the samey old... [/u]\n\n:(\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\n[u]Meh[/u]\n\nAgain, the Sound department wasn't really a great stand out either. All of things sounded the same, guns, enemies, world, almost everything, so there wasn't anything quite new here.\n\nIt's true that HL2 has a good sound design that makes the world feel even more atmospheric, and all that is brought into this sequel. So I would say that, although it's not new stuff or anythung, it's still as good as it was in HL2.\n\nThe music is almost inexistent, and when there is, it's just to highten some action packed moment with some punk 00's music, that is really good.\n\n[u]In the end, the Sound Department is no big improvement but it's as good as it was in Half-Life 2, so no big complaints here! [/u]\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\n[b]SAME[/b]\n\nSo the graphics are actually the best part of the game I would say. They are greatly detailed and the same graphical fidelity seen in HL2 is brought into Episode 1, and that is just great. But even though quality is very nice, a loooottt of reused assets were seen here.\n\nI really liked what they did with the Citadel. The graphics and lighting were really impressive and created a very \"spooky\", strange and distopian atmosphere, and I really loved the first hours of the game because of that. \n\nBut after a while things start to become repetitive, and you keep going through almost the same environments over and ovveer, asking yourself when is it going to end and when you will see some variety in design... And sadly that never comes.\n\n[u]So the Graphics are very good, they have the same fidelity as before but environments quickly start to become quite repetitive and things get very uninteresting to the eye. [/u]\n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[u]I was greatly disappointed honestly. I came out of Half-Life 2 amazed by everything, and then to see this world, to after get a sequel where the story only serves as a mere bridge to what they want to tell after the escape of Alyx and Gordon from the Citadel, is quite sad. I felt like I was going from room to room, playing the game for nothing really. Things didn't have weight to it... nothing... [/u]\n\n[b]I do not recommend this game, but it's a roadblock that you have to cross to get to the better one, Episode 2.[/b]\n\n[h1]5/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1589753595,"timestamp_updated":1594890754,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478615403175354004","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69332618","author":{"steamid":"76561198381210663","num_games_owned":911,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":291,"last_played":1589753053},"language":"english","review":"An

Разработчики из Valve, решив, что создание полноценного продолжения займёт слишком много времени, предлагают нам кушать игру по кусочкам, сделав систему эпизодов, что позволяет выпускать игры чаще. Трудно сказать, было ли это решение верным.\n\nИгра продолжается ровно в том месте, где мы и остановились в финале второй части. Реактор Цитадели взорван, однако его ядро всё ещё не стабильно и со временем сдетонирует подорвав весь город. Гордону и Аликс предстоит замедлить рекцию ядра и постаратся спасити жителей города. А так же спастись самим...\n\nИгра выходит спустя два года, предлагая нам окунутся ещё раз в историю вселенной Half-Life. Однако окунаемся мы буквально до колен, после чего игра быстро заканчивается, показывая нам смачный трейлер второго эпизода. Данная часть серии стала более динамичней, по сравнению с предшественником, однако заканчивается настолько быстро, что не успеваешь полностью насладится игрой. После двух то лет ожиданий, получаем чуть более чем трехчасовую кампанию. Отчего создается впечатление, что мы играем не в полноценную игру, а скорее в небольшое дополнение.\n\nГеймплей остался практически таким же. Понравилось лихое начало, где мы используя грави-пушку раскидываем солдат Альянса в разные стороны. В этой части схваток с зомби и мутантами стало больше. Так же было несколько необычно играть с Аликс, которая сопровождала нас практически всю игру. При этом AI был улучшен ещё больше. Наша напарница метко стреляет, перелазит через стенки, при подходе врагов слишком близко, может даже ударить с ноги или прикладом. Часто комментирует разные ситуации и делает подсказки в некоторых местах.\n\nПоявились пару новых врагов. Так же добавили технологию HDR, которую впоследствии перенесли и во вторую часть.
