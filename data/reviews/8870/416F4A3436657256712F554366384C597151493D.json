Skvelé charaktery, perfektný dabing, vizuál, soundtrack i covery licencovaných piesní. Poďme ale po poradí (no spoiler)- pokiaľ si vás nezíska steampunková Columbia už svojím výzorom, chytí vás za srdce komplexný dej. Hra rozoberá myšlienku pararelných vesmírov, cestovaním medzi nimi ale aj v čase a priestore a možnosťami či dôsledkami, ktoré takéto zasahovanie do deja prináša. Môžme povedať, že daný námet už nie je dnes taký neobvyklý, v tomto prípade je však jedinečné spracovanie námetu a jeho komplexnosť, ktorá prepája dej aj s ostatnými dielmi zo série Bioshock. A to naozaj precízne - v časových líniách sa môžete jednoducho stratiť avšak všetko dáva logiku. Záver ponúka hráčovi si koniec voľne interpretovať. \n\nDeWittova úloha je na prvý pohľad jednoduchá -priniesť dievča, Elizabeth, z tohto mesta. Odhaľujete postupne špinavé praktiky a tajomstvá navonok dokonalej Columbie, v ktorej vás ako prvé zarazí silný rasizmus. Zisťujete, že dievča rozhodne nie je obyčajné a že tu ide o viac ako len priniesť späť dievča. Nápovedy vám dávajú postupne zjavenia oboch Lutece.\n\nSoundtrack je dojemný, pekne dotvára atmosféru, svoje miesto majú aj licencované covery - pokiaľ sa radi v hre túlate, odhalíte, že známe piesne si columbijský vydavatelia ukradli z budúcnosti. A to je len jeden z mála mnohých easter eggov odkazujúcich na popkultúru či reálny svet.\n\nHra je pútavá, pokiaľ nemáte radi strieľačky, ľahko hru prejdete na easy móde a získa si vás zbieranie \"audionahrávok\" obyvateľov Columbie odhaľúce jej tajomstvá. Hra vám poskytne veľký výber zbraní ale aj vigors - akýchsi \"kúziel,\" ktoré viete vylepšovať a môžete tak zasiahnuť viacero nepriateľov naraz (práve vďaka takejto kombinácií útokov ma táto hra zabavila aj napriek tomu, že strieľačky naobľubujem... viete si skrátka prísť na svoje). Je teda veľmi veľa spôsobov, štýlov ako hru prejsť. Osobitne si zamilujete vznikajúci vrúcny vzťah Elizabeth a DeWitta ale aj Songbirda. Hlavičky si potrápite nad skvelo sa dopĺňajúcimi Lutece.\n\nK DLC - Burial at Sea je skvelý vrchol série. Dej sa posúva do Rapture, atmosféra je o dosť pochmúrnejšia, dá sa povedať že i hororovejšia. Prvý diel DLC je skôr akčnou strieľačkou so slabším dejom a prekvapujúcim záverom (slabší v porovnaní s druhým dielom, celkovo je to však dobré dlc), druhý skôr schovávačka, ktorá má však oveľa viac deja a zvratov.\n\nPokiaľ ste v sérií nový, nič nepokazíte ak začnete najprv s Bioshock Infinite - chronologické poradie deja je Infinite - Burial at Sea 1,2 - Bioshock 1 - Bioshock 2.","timestamp_created":1603580452,"timestamp_updated":1603580452,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78098875","author":{"steamid":"76561199008850023","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":283,"last_played":1604917382},"language":"english","review":"it's alright","timestamp_created":1603579368,"timestamp_updated":1603579368,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78098671","author":{"steamid":"76561198954180021","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":569,"last_played":1641692706},"language":"spanish","review":"Ha sido una buena experiencia jugando e la campaña pero eso sí, si lo vas a jugar por la Historia...

While I'll preface this with the fact that I have not played the other two games in the series in some time, the shooting in this entry feels a lot different, and I think that's where the first compromise was made. It feels like the game was trying to be more of a mass market shooter than a proper [i]BioShock[/i] game. Only being allowed to carry two guns was a huge bummer. Having a gun for every possible scenario was one of the things I liked about the series. But it's removed here in what feels like yet another compromise. Plus, you can easily beat the game with the first couple of weapons you find, which makes all the other weapons in the game feel pointless. The weapon upgrade system seems stripped down now. No longer are you treated to a different look for your weapon when you upgrade it. Everything looks the same. But the upgrade system feels entirely out of place anyway since you can only carry two and the game wants you to throw down your current weapon for something else at seemingly random moments.\n\nVigors take the place of plasmids in [i]Infinite[/i], but they just don't feel as good. Theoretically, they should be more flexible given their upgrade options and dual combat use, but they're not. That may be the fault of the gunplay feeling so bad and that spilling over into the vigors, but I found myself wishing I had the plasmid system instead. That being said, some of the animations for the vigors are cool, and the small cutscene when you find a new one was a nice touch. Unfortunately, none of that will save [i]Infinite[/i] from it's terrible combat. Combat isn't helped by the fact that Elizabeth can just pluck an endless supply of items out of thin air. Very rarely did I find myself needing to manage ammo supply or giving much thought at all to combat. And that was a huge letdown. Not only does this lead to combat feeling \"off\" overall, but it makes the game way too easy. I only died 3 times in the entirety of the game while playing on hard mode.\n\nThis extends to other elements of the gameplay as well. The game feels far less flexible in terms of your approach to moving about the environment and engaging in combat. Rather than giving you the option to use stealth like in the previous games, [i]Infinite[/i] is always pushing you forward at AAA, action movie speeds. It's not like the previous games were hailed for their stealth gameplay, but it was a viable option that allowed you to make more calculated decisions about which enemies you were going to engage. The handyman enemies seem to be taking the place of the \"Big Daddies\" from the original game, and it's not even close. Big Daddies were challenging to fight, and engaging them was a calculated decision. Handymen are pushovers.\n\nExploration in the previous games was fun and rewarding, but it's basically nonexistent here. The map design feels very repetitive, and the game actively discourages you from exploring the limited side areas that are present. You'll spend 5 lockpicks to open a side door and congratulations, you've got some coins and ammo. The experience is inherently linear, and it always felt like the game had its hand on my back, pushing me forward. You may occasionally find an audio log you would have missed otherwise, but it's not even worth listening to them. When Elizabeth isn't talking overtop of them, you're treated to bland content that doesn't integrate into the main story like they did in the previous games.\n\nI actually liked the new setting at first glance. At the beginning of the game when you're launched to Columbia, my expectations soared. Not only is it a creative city, but the focus on a creepy religion and a beautiful opening soundtrack had this excellent anachronistic effect that I loved. Not only that, but the opening section of the game that allows you to explore the fair, play games, and listen in on people's conversations made the world feel really alive. I was hopeful that kind of thing would continue as the game progresses, but it doesn't. Despite my positive reaction to the opening, I was left quite disappointed. The game's initial hook and ostensible premise had a ton of potential. The game set itself up to explore some themes that would have been incredibly interesting. The previous two games did an excellent job of that. But it all falls incredibly flat here. No great ideas are explored, and a city that looks to be interesting at first glance is revealed to be nothing of the sort.\n\nWhich brings me to the story. The story hits on things that are right up my alley. Parallel universes, alternate histories, and plot twists are all things I love. And for the most part I like what they were trying to do with the plot. I know some people find it convoluted and contrived, and I can certainly understand that. But I love this sort of thing. Combined with the soundtrack, the story was my favorite thing about [i]Infinite[/i], and it is what helped me get through this game. I loved the ending as well, which was controversial for many. I was quite satisfied on the story front overall. I only wish that the game had done as good a job with exploring its themes more deeply like the previous games did.\n\nThere's so much potential in it that just doesn't get where it could have. I think there are some fundamentally flawed design elements, especially with regards to combat, and it just doesn't feel like a [i]BioShock[/i] game. The combat is bad, Columbia is nowhere near as well crafted as Rapture, and it's way too easy. Had this been a game under a different name, I may be more apt to look past some of its flaws. I'm glad I saw it through to the end, and for me, the story was interesting enough to keep me invested even though almost everything else about the game was a huge letdown. But that being said, I can't really recommend it, especially if you're expecting the kind of experience that the title of the game implies.","timestamp_created":1603517991,"timestamp_updated":1603518089,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575247108936309814","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78054438","author":{"steamid":"76561198941462535","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":628,"last_played":1623638502},"language":"spanish","review":"tiene

experienced","timestamp_created":1603510894,"timestamp_updated":1603510894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78050897","author":{"steamid":"76561198819485080","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":292,"last_played":1603565347},"language":"schinese","review":"good","timestamp_created":1603509965,"timestamp_updated":1603509965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78050648","author":{"steamid":"76561198325409856","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1142,"last_played":1498456428},"language":"schinese","review":"伊丽莎白，天下第一。","timestamp_created":1603509540,"timestamp_updated":1603509540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78049280","author":{"steamid":"76561198977284457","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":745,"last_played":1602955012},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情很棒的游戏！","timestamp_created":1603507237,"timestamp_updated":1603507237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78044412","author":{"steamid":"76561198278262469","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":603,"last_played":1584833218},"language":"english","review":"that
