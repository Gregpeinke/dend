Una historia más elaborada, mejor contada y con mucha más carga emocional. Un ritmo de juego que va en aumento y una jugabilidad que saca todo lo bueno de Half Life y lo potencia. Es más largo que el episodio 1, todas sus fases están a un gran nivel, sin altibajos importantes y con mucha variación de escenarios, además de presentar secretos por primera vez. Podremos conocer en mucha más profundidad el universo de Half Life, en especial a la especie Vortigaunt y las hormigas León.\n\nEn este episodio 2 disfrutamos de grandes momentos de exploración de entornos muy abiertos, de nuevas propuestas jugables como la detección de lugares llenos de suministros a través de un radar y la observación del entorno. Este episodio está más enfocado a la exploración y resolución de puzzles, lo cual se agradece bastante. Además todos los escenarios que visitamos son nuevos y no se reutilizan tantos enemigos y escenarios como sí ocurría en el episodio 1. Esta vez los combates están mejor resueltos. Son más estratégicos con la inclusión de nuevos enemigos muy originales a la vez que letales. No tendremos que lidiar con tiroteos monótonos como ocurría al final de Half Life 2, sino que ahora los combates están mejor medidos, en escenarios que admiten más posibilidades e incluso con una nueva arma.\nAdemás, tenemos la posibilidad del uso de un nuevo vehículo, que en la fase final nos ayudará para detener a los robots zancudos y cazadores en la gran zona de White Forest. \n\nEn resumen, un episodio muy recomendable donde han madurado la jugabilidad, sacando partido de todos los puntos fuertes de este juego y, sobre todo, dando más importancia a la historia y los personajes, que esta vez poseen una caracterización más profunda.

With Eli gone, the Resistance has lost some of its will to fight. Even though the Combine have been crippled, they do not die, and the Resistance must struggle yet more against the shadow of their malefactors.\n\nTime will tell whether or not they succeeded. Perhaps the Resistance, after waiting for over a decade, will finally get their wish - to be free, at last. They can finally rest a little bit easier at night, knowing that they now have what they wanted.\nUntil such a day, however, this is the end of the line.

После него мне захотелось ещё продолжения, так как продолжительность у первого эпизода была не такая большая, как у второй части. Приобрёл её вместе с первым эпизодом, но не сразу прошёл её, так как она у меня вылетала по неизвестной причине. Помогла переустановка спустя долгое время. Теперь можно и высказаться о ней. \nГрафика. Движок остался тот же: Source. Но нововведения в графике есть, и их много. Также они были применены в Portal и Team Fortress 2, вышедшие в тот же год, что и она. Локации отлично изображены: дизайнеры в Valve всегда работают на ура. Персонажи классно изображены. Как и в предыдущих частях, я испытываю симпатию к Аликс Вэнс (просто милашка ^^).\nОзвучка. По прежнему русская озвучка радует. Актёры всё те же. По прежнему музыка в Half-Life радует. Ещё отмечу, как и в предыдущих частях, отличный звук у оружия. Из-за этого чувствуется оружие. \nСюжет. Это прямое продолжение первого эпизода. Сюжет интересный, интригующий и проработанный. Персонажи классно раскрываются. Появился один лишь новый персонаж. Концовка осталась открытой и намекающей на продолжение. Правда, этого продолжения нет уже 10 лет. \nГеймплей. В геймплее, как и в графике, появились изменения, которые можно заметить в процессе прохождения. Стрелять также приятно из любого оружия, а также применять монтировку или же грави-пушку. Достаточно много экшена, как и в предыдущих частях. \nОтличная игра в жанре FPS, как и все предыдущие части, с интересным сюжетом и отличным геймплеем, приятной графикой и отличной озвучкой. Насчёт Half-Life 2: Episode Three или Half-Life 3, я очень сильно сомневаюсь, что вообще появится в свет, потому что после Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (2012 год, если кто забыл) от них ни одной игры не вышло.
