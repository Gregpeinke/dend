I have completed this game in about 13 hours at a generally leisurely pace.\n\nThe story line keeps your attention if not a little repetitive and predictable. Basically escape here and get to there. The maps are quite easy to navigate; there is a lot of solving basic puzzles to navigate through. One side of map press button turn lever, other side of map door opens ect. I had to use the walk through on about 3 occasions to work out what I was meant to do.  After watching it I did think there was no way I would have worked it out in a million years. I found the ending to be the best part of the game, the last 30 minutes of gameplay where possibly the best written on any game I’ve played.\n\nThe graphics hold their own for an old game, and it used between 1 and 11% OF THE GTX 980 which you’d expect. (on the highest settings). I believe this would run on almost anything.\n\nIf you liked the original Half Life then this is a must get, otherwise buy it on sale. Arguably it is a game that all PC gamers should have played. \n\nHalf Life 2 a good way to spend 13 hours or less.\n","timestamp_created":1455737914,"timestamp_updated":1455737914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21280646","author":{"steamid":"76561198184887610","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":768,"last_played":1507401552},"language":"english","review":"Being a console gamer until very recently, I had never played any of the Half-Life games before. I did, however, constantly hear the \"Half-Life 3 Confirmed\" meme. I had sensed how beloved this series is to PC gamers, and having recently built my first gaming PC, I just now got to see what all the buzz is about. I see the appeal! This game has aged amazingly... I think of other games from 2004, and they all look like s**t compared to HL2. Both graphically and gameplay-wise, this game was clearly ahead of its time. Playing on ultra settings, there were quite a few times where I saw something and thought to myself \"This was made in 2004?\" And the physics-based gameplay was just really impressive as well. The campaign was also surprisingly lengthy; Still fairly short, but much longer than modern FPS campaigns that you'd get with say COD or Halo.\n\nCons? Hmmmm... there were a few too many \"defend this area for X amount of time\" segments for my liking. I was also annoyed by the \"shoot down these aircraft with all this rocket launcher ammo scattered about\" segments. Also, the ending was very anti-climactic. It ends abruptly without any boss battle or any real challenging segment. Other than that, not many negatives to consider. And those are rather petty issues at that.\n\nIf you haven't experienced the good time that is HL2 yet, do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n","timestamp_created":1455736803,"timestamp_updated":1455736803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21280105","author":{"steamid":"76561198180157445","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2335,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2257,"last_played":1585678097},"language":"english","review":"this game is a worthy and quite innovative succesor to the first half life.

Что же нас ждет в этой игре? Давайте разберем.\nИгра имеет замечательный сюжет, хорошо проработанную и интересную историю. Она проходится на одном дыхании. Скучать вам не прийдется на протяжении игры: геймплей тут очень разнообразный. Мы будем кататься на багги, амфибии, управлять армией муравьиных львов, убивать солдат \"Альянса\" гигантским краном- в общем, заняться есть чем. В игре по-настоящему правильная физика, которая местами лучше, чем в играх 2015-2016 года. На момент выхода (2004 год) игра имела потрясающую картинку. В Half Life 2 шикарная атмосфера, местами игра пытается быть хоррором, а именно в главе \"Мы не ходим в Рейвенхолм\" и еще в парочке моментов. И это ей здорово удается. Фанаты первой части, несомненно, уже давно прошли игру, а если нет- идите играть не раздумывая, игра вас не разочарует.\n[h1] Вердикт\nНесомненно, классика жанра, эталонный шутер, в свое время поразивший всех, как и первая часть.\n10 из 10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1455630162,"timestamp_updated":1455630225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.697391629219055176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21252227","author":{"steamid":"76561198145685356","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":483,"last_played":1451927907},"language":"english","review":"It was a great game back in the days I'm guessing.

And the updated has even better graphics. The story line,Characters and their storyline,Our storyline are all good, So in this game you are playing as Gordan Freeman a scentist from Black Mesa Facality. He made a test but failed and got all Xen Monsters to the real world (Xen is another dimension full of ohter creatures...Most are dangerous) So as gordan tries to escape by finding weapons from people who died. He later on met a mysterious character reffered to (Gman) Some say he is god while ohters say he is A goverment. But who knows. So Gordan meets this character and this character wants Gordan to be his (Employee) Oh and here is some information about him (Gman is neither a bad or good character. Sometimes he helps you while ohetr times he makes it harder for you he is a mysterious character and no one actually knows his actual name its just because in the files gmans files is  called \"G_Man\") So Gman leaves and Gordan gets teleported to where he was. I dont remember mutch more. But this is just a feedback not an entire story. So i rate 10/10 Because the storyline and characters and weapons are all just perfect im sure you should igve this game a try. But i suggest trying playing the demo.
