The characters in this game are used to move the story along while having their own unique, funny moments. The inclusion and mystery of G-man was very well placed has has immediately become my favourite character in the game. As for the story, its simplistic but effective and the game never breaks away from it throughout its play time. As mentioned before, the mystery of G man and that whole scene that it takes place in gives Half-life more intrigue and leaves players with a greater impression. \nThe setting of the Black Mesa Facility and Xen are really well thought out and fully detailed, making the player want to explore everything in front of them, however sometimes i did find myself lost at some points when trying to move to the next area. \nGraphically, even though it may have been the the best for its time, its retro style really gives it a classic feel and is just satisfying to look at. While there is an option for there to be HD textures and reworks of some skins, i would have it in its original state for anyone wanting to get the full experience. \nSound and Audio are a mixed bag as there will be weird moments for the soundtrack to kick in and kinda takes away from the experience, however the audio choices for the guns, aliens and voice acting in general work really well here, adding that immersion for players to sink themselves into. \nIn terms of gameplay, this is some solid, satisfying FPS action that loads can enjoy. You will be mainly be fighting off the aliens which i must say the variety of them is so vast, its impressive for a game like this. There are also human enemies that can pose their own challenge and is a great selection for the player to combat against. The weapon variety as well is amazing ranging from pistols to machine guns to the Tau Cannon which is really fun to use and gives players that freedom to overcome the obstacles that they face. There is also the H.E.V suit that can be charged up to give Gordon more armour against enemy attacks or protecting him from toxic waste which was a nice inclusion. The only problem i really faced was moving into a different area could cause Freeman to clip into the wall and makes the player unable to move, meaning that they would have to restart their game, however due to this being as old as it is, this issue can be put to the side. \nOverall, Half-Life is an amazing experience and fully deserves the cult following that it gained and i would recommend this to anyone who really wants to play a fun first person shooter!","timestamp_created":1630089062,"timestamp_updated":1630089062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98337350","author":{"steamid":"76561199020484225","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":1573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":233,"last_played":1649617063},"language":"turkish","review":"Hikayesi sikimde değil ama online müq(Oyun yöneticisinde rahat 300 saatim vardır)\ndüzeltme hikaye bitti","timestamp_created":1630088526,"timestamp_updated":1644427698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98336379","author":{"steamid":"76561198907257825","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1640382508},"language":"english","review":"poggers","timestamp_created":1630087243,"timestamp_updated":1630087243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98335257","author":{"steamid":"76561198210262775","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":4318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":68,"playtime_at_review":1283,"last_played":1660493337},"language":"english","review":"its half life","timestamp_created":1630085809,"timestamp_updated":1630085809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98335133","author":{"steamid":"76561198337311015","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":839,"last_played":1636302449},"language":"english","review":"Don't shoot!

Зря я ее всё время откладывал на потом, думал что пройду ее ремейк Black Mesa и с этого хватит, но решил всё же пройти оригинал и не пожалел. Играется свободно, нет этого нытья что графика устарела и т.д. Единственный минус может быть это стрельба и урон по оперативникам (+их искусственный интеллект).

Where do I start with this game?\n\nHalf-Life 1 was the first game in the series I got my hands on, and my favorite. Guess I'll start off with the obvious.\n\n1. The Approach: Half-Life was unique to FPS games like DooM, Quake, and the Build Engine trilogy at the time. It took time at the start of its campaign to build the characters and the feel of Black Mesa. \nTaking two chapters (Black Mesa Inbound and Anomalous Materials.) To focus on character development, and getting the player into the world that Valve had set up for them. Like watching scientists in the distance run around, getting their work done in the iconic train ride.\n\n2. The Gameplay: Valve wanted the player to feel like they were trapped in a scenario they couldn't control. Like they were just some guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Hence why the first Headcrab you encounter is so early you don't even have the Crowbar yet.\nAhh, the Crowbar, the only melee weapon you get throughout Gordon's entire adventure through Black Mesa. This was to enhance that feeling of 'Shit's hit the fan, time to get outta here.'\nMoreover, the player's health caps at 100, no higher, no lower. Again, you're not a super-soldier, just a scientist trying to survive.\nAnd most notably at the time. Fall Damage and Reloading. Quake went full 3D. Half-Life went full realism. Reloading was such a novelty at the time, I can think of one other game that had reloading for all of its guns. Marathon.\nFall damage was also a rare thing. The Build Engine had it, but it was negligible. In Half Life, a full 3D game unlike the Build Trilogy, had fall damage make its presence known. Take Blast Pit for example. The map's mostly vertical, and you can't jump from the top floor to the bottom without tanking some large damage. Or right after that chapter in Power Up. There's a pipe before meeting the Gargantuan that can't be lived through on low health, unless the player lands on the table with the medkits.\n\n3. The Story: You should know it by now. You are Gordon Freeman, a Theoretical Physicist working for Black Mesa. A top secret research facility in the middle of the desert in New Mexico.\nOne fateful day, after being late for work, Gordon begins the usual experiment using an Anti-Mass Spectrometer and a crystal specimen from Xen, the border world. But things go wrong, causing a Resonance Cascade, ripping open a portal to Xen, allowing alien creatures to spill through.\nGordon survives the Cascade itself and fights his way through the facility. Going toe to toe with both the Xen forces, and the HECU, a highly trained group of soldiers sent to kill everyone to cover up Black Mesa's existence.\nGordon finally reaches the Lambda labs, and is sent to Xen by the surviving members of the Science Team there, and slays the Nihlanth, the being holding the portal between Xen and Earth open.\nAfterwards, he has an encounter with the G-Man. Whom he had been seeing since his train ride to work when this whole mess started.\nBeing sent to a recreation of said train. The G-Man offers Gordon a job under his employers. Gordon accepts and is sent into stasis until the events of the second game.\nThis approach at story through the eyes of someone in the middle of the event was something the gaming idustry had never seen before. Usually it was reading the game's manual, or through on-screen text that lore was presented.\nBut Valve changed that, and made the game that would shape the way FPS games were done to this very day.\n\nThat was a wall of text, but long story short, Buy Half-Life if you haven't already. It's a great game, Immersive and fun, a great experience overall. It has its negatives, (what game doesn't?) But those negatives are outweighed by the positives. Now, \"Have a safe, and productive day.\"\n\n","timestamp_created":1629898469,"timestamp_updated":1629898469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98205954","author":{"steamid":"76561198256382448","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":137,"last_played":1638564407},"language":"turkish","review":"çok iyi oyun kesinlikle oynayın\n","timestamp_created":1629895393,"timestamp_updated":1629895393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98200735","author":{"steamid":"76561198137745382","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":112,"playtime_forever":1450,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1373,"last_played":1656052636},"language":"russian","review":"classic!)\n   P.
