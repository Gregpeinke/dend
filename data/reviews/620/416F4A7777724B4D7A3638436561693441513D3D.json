Following a more traditional 3-act structure, this game answers questions about Aperture's (and GlaDoS') origins, introduces many new mechanics for players to master, and has about triple the length of the original game (more if you get stuck on some of the puzzles, like I did). My only complaint would have to be that aid isn't provided on some of the hardest puzzles in the game regardless of how long you are stuck there; while the original game shared this, the puzzles were debatably easier. Additionally, it's effectively a one-trick pony: once completed, you really have no reason to come back. That being said, it is an excellent game, though probably not deserving of fifty dollars.","timestamp_created":1304422202,"timestamp_updated":1304422202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1874204","author":{"steamid":"76561197999151586","num_games_owned":532,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":4640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2770,"last_played":1603293519},"language":"english","review":"A worthy successor to the original.
