Weapons feel meaty, different classes have their purpose and teamplay and timing is required to beat the stronger enemies. Very immersive game with a sweet metal soundtrack. The only downside is that you have to level up your classes to even have a chance in higher difficulties and leveling up can take some time. However, even the lower difficulties are enjoyable to play because of the variety of levels. The game gets frequent updates, which also introduced new game modes lately. If you like co-op horde-mode shooters, you will most likely love Killing Floor.\n\nEdit: Since Killing Floor 2 is a thing, Killing Floor 1 will probably not get any more updates in the future. But the game already has enough to justify the purchase, especially since it's discounted heavily in pretty much every sale.","timestamp_created":1373023059,"timestamp_updated":1434737064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7181065","author":{"steamid":"76561198090727051","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":122,"last_played":1530212516},"language":"english","review":"Класс.","timestamp_created":1373021000,"timestamp_updated":1373021000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6484999","author":{"steamid":"76561198067289065","num_games_owned":861,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":10365,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3406,"last_played":1622957947},"language":"english","review":"Great fun. wave after wave of monsters with tons of blood and gore. many servers for you to play with friends and other people online.","timestamp_created":1373012558,"timestamp_updated":1373012558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3323583","author":{"steamid":"76561198020818738","num_games_owned":882,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":844,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":419,"last_played":1431238089},"language":"english","review":"a FREAKSHOW ...... nuff said","timestamp_created":1373000923,"timestamp_updated":1373000923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2684434","author":{"steamid":"76561198011032609","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1972,"last_played":1529105197},"language":"english","review":"It's fun for the whole family!","timestamp_created":1372996141,"timestamp_updated":1372996141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1326639","author":{"steamid":"76561197991460694","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":37388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32254,"last_played":1633981798},"language":"english","review":"Best $5.00 spent on Steam back in 2009, still a blast to play with great support from Tripwire and the community.","timestamp_created":1372986044,"timestamp_updated":1404725824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2275207","author":{"steamid":"76561198004997855","num_games_owned":687,"num_reviews":124,"playtime_forever":1614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":846,"last_played":1430206691},"language":"english","review":"you can only rely on your comrade. . . and your weapon only!!!\nwithout crosshair dan wave of speciment. . . ready to take the challenge??? :3","timestamp_created":1372978679,"timestamp_updated":1372978679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478723406791687012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4962242","author":{"steamid":"76561198043786584","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3545,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1827,"last_played":1601781545},"language":"portuguese","review":"O filho bastardo de Left 4 Dead com Counter Strike.

I mean, THERE'S SO MUCH BLOOD. There is a wide variety of powerful weapons with which you can obliterate the multiple types of disturbing, nightmare-inducing zombies, and the co-op is fantastic; there's no better way to do it. A coordinated squad is fantastic to have, and you will definitely notice the difference with good teamwork. The style of music and graphics will get you pumped like nothing else, especially knowing there are hordes of blood-thirsty beasts out there wanting your flesh. It's fast-paced, making it that much more exciting and thrilling. There isn't much storyline to get involved in, but that fits the game. The balancing is well done in my opinion; every round I've played has been a challenge at some point, if not the entire duration, and yet not utterly impossible. And if for some reason you don't find a round challenging, then you're on the wrong difficulty setting. Try [i]Suicidal[/i], or dreaded [i]Hell On Earth[/i]. Ooh. That just sounds terrifyingly difficult. And it is. Which makes this game great. There's always something to try and achieve. The gameplay is very satisfying (as hoped for, headshots look and feel wonderful), there is definitely a team-aspect incorporated, the music, although personally not my favorite genre, is a fantastic amplifier for the atmosphere, and the weapons just [i]feel good[/i]. There's no other way to describe it. They sound... [i]meaty[/i]. Like they can kill. Anything. And they... Oh my God just get it already.
