marco un antes y un después en la industria, uno de los juegos mas aclamados de la compañía Valve, y con mucha razón, este tiene una mecanica muy interesante e ingeniosa, el uso de portales para completar pruebas, el juego en si es basico, la historia aunque parezca simple la ejecución esta muy buen lograda ya que nos dara pistas acerca la trama del juego, pero en si solo es resolver puzzles con los portales, los personajes aqui lastimosamente no hay muchos, siendo memorable la antagonista que es algo parecido a como Jack el guapo en Borderlands 2, no puedo decir lo mismo de la protagonista ya que es algo olvidable, los escenarios hay de 2, o una sala blanca o el interior de las salas lo cual no es tan variado en escenarios, aqui el enemigo es tu ingenio ya que vas a estar luchando contra ti mismo para ver la solucion de un puzzle, un punto negativo de esta entrega es que su duracion es muy corta, tanto que te puedes terminar en una sola tarde.\nEn conclusion, de los mejores juegos mentales que te puedes encontrar en pc, la optimizacion es buena, la mecanica es muy interesante, la dificultad es equilibrada, los graficos estan decentes y la ejecución de la historia es buena, lastimosamente en el soundtrack carece bastante aunque se entienda porque el chiste es pensar, el protagonista es olvidable, la duracion es bastante corta y no es tan variado en escenarios.\nUn buen juego para pasar el rato y retarte a ti mismo,

But there is not as much variety in game mechanics as Portal 2. Most of the game has you play around with the 2 portals, the cubes, and the energy balls. No other mechanics are introduced. I would have loved some more variety. Also, sometimes, the level design was confusing and often there was not a clear indication what to do next, but a little exploration will usually result in you figuring out the solution.\n\nIt was a little too short IMO and I finished in a little under 4 hours.

It's a tradition for me to replay it every winter.\n\nWhile it's a bit old, it is still one of the best puzzle games on Steam. The concept is simple, go into a orange portal - get to the blue portal, and vice versa. This however, opens up many possibilities when you realise that momentum carries over from portal to portal.\n\nThe story is interesting also, I won't go in-depth with it - since it is one of the best parts of this game. The simple concept is that you're a test subject. This gets much more complicated as it progresses, when you discover shadow characters - and realise that everything is not what it seems lke.\n\nThis is a must-play for any gamer. I'm not nostalgic about this game - but I see what this game has done, and what it accomplished for the gaming community. Also, you get a cake at the end. It isn't a lie. Some people may say it is, but the only way to truly find out is to beat it.\n\nThis game forces you to think out of the box. The only major gripe I have with it, is that it's quite simple for a veteran gamer. It gets more complicated later on, but later on is soon since this game is only around 2 hours long.\n\nYou get used to the boxy chambers quite soon, but it's all taken away soon. The boxy design means high performance. I don't see anyone running it below 60FPS. I kept this review short, since the only way to know what this game is, is to play it. No way someone can describe it truly.\n\nThe game features 19 levels, but the difficulty spikes at the last 5 or-so.\n\nIt retails for 9e, but goes to sale for 0,99e every sale.\n\nI do recommend getting the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/234/Portal_Bundle/]Portal Bundle[/url], featuring both games for 12e. For only 3 euros more, you can get both games instead of the first.","timestamp_created":1552573333,"timestamp_updated":1552573333,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.704488873481750488","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49545270","author":{"steamid":"76561198438340128","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":252,"last_played":1530124653},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная головоломка.","timestamp_created":1552556347,"timestamp_updated":1552556347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49543341","author":{"steamid":"76561198025257368","num_games_owned":448,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":123,"last_played":1558735873},"language":"english","review":"Great game.","timestamp_created":1552541668,"timestamp_updated":1552541668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49542719","author":{"steamid":"76561198170101989","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":420,"last_played":1651193767},"language":"english","review":"Probably one of the best games of the century!
