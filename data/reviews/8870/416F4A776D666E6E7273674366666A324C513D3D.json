I came into this knowing nothing about the series with no real expectations one way or the other, and I left completely immersed and emotionally drained after the credits of Burial At Sea Part II rolled.\n\nSolid gameplay, wonderful score, insanely creative and addictive story and two very satisfying endings (the DLC is a must--the game had a good ending without it but the DLCs kick it up a notch or ten). I will probably have Vie en Rose stuck in my head for another month at least before I cave and replay this.","timestamp_created":1410787180,"timestamp_updated":1410787180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12107825","author":{"steamid":"76561198010309919","num_games_owned":393,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3330,"last_played":1610701328},"language":"english","review":"The highly acclaimed Bioshock Infinite takes place in the sky town of spingleton, where the bad man Cornstarch wants to take the lady-lamb young Queen Elizabeth from your fingertips. The interesting thing about The Queen is she cries a lot and makes lots of tears that make black-and-white things appear like in the olden days. This is used as a very unique mechanic in battles to overcome Cornstarch's, Slater's and Mr. Vox Populi's men. Additionally, the town of spingleton has many sky train tracks that Booker can latch on an take The Queen on a sightseeing journey whilst being shot at. The enemies also vary quite a significant amount, from the fireman who ironically throws fire and explodes to the handyman who has hands.The special powers in this game, also knows as nigors, are as diverse as the number 8 and offer a great variation of gameplay. For example:\n\nIn one instance you may step back and press the button for you nigor to fire birds at the enemies to finish them off, or perhaps you may choose a different route and stay back and press the button for your nigor to throw a fireball at the enemy, or maybe you might choose instead to stay back and press the button for your nigor to use the lightning on your enemy and give them a shock (get it?), or you might diverge and choose to stay back and use the nigor that throws a ball of energy at them or even choose to stay back and make horse sounds as they decide to float. The list goes on...\n\nThe story of Bioshock is even more depthy, as the man Cornstarch and the relationship between him and The Queen becomes more evident.

I had high expectations here but I was not disappointed. The game manages to keep all the core ingredients that made Bioshock so much fun. It is a gloriously detailed world with a fantastic story filled with audio diaries to flesh things out further. The combat is a fun combination of guns and, for want of a better word, magic like before which can be upgraded throughout the game. All the same things could have been said about Bioshock 2 but that just felt like it was retreading the same ground; here it has taken those key ingredients but applied them to a sufficiently different environment to reawaken that wonder of exploring the world. The other major difference is that it has less of a horror feel and more of an action feel.

Das Spiel verspricht eine spannende Geschichte um das eigene Alterego Booker und dessen Sidekick Elizabeth. Dabei werden philosophische, theologische wie auch gesellschaftskritische Fragen aufgeworfen.\n\nFernab von Rassismus und der Frage nach dem Glauben, dreht sich letztlich alles um Elizabeth die mit ihren übermenschlich, geistigen Fertigkeiten Zeit und Raum brechen kann. Ein durchaus gelungenes spielerisches Element, was Bioshock Infinite durchaus von anderen Spielen abhebt. \n\nAuch die Welt Columbia, in der die Geschichte spielt, ist durch und durch stimmig. Die Stadt über den Wolken, das Steampunksetting. Soweit, so gut. \n\nUnterm Strich wird hier jedoch nicht wirklich viel neues Geboten. Die Shooterelemente, wie Waffengattungen, Perks etc. gab es alles schon und teilweise auch liebevoller gestaltet. Auch die anfangs witzigen Dialoge zwischen dem Sidekick Elizabeth und dem eigenen Alterego Booker nerven irgendwann bzw. plötzlich von geskripteten Ereignissen unterbrochen.\n\nAuch die philosophische bzw. gesellschaftskritische Keule, mit denen das Spiel einen förmlich erschlagen möchte, tragen irgendwann nicht zu weiteren Spielmotivation bei. Auch das Setting um die fliegende Stadt Columbia wirkt aus der Ferne betrachtet lächerlich. Nehmen wir die Washington-Roboter-Gegner mit Amiflaggen auf dem Rücken. Sicherlich sollen diese den Patriotismus der Amerikaner persiflieren, jedoch ist die Art und Weise sehr plakativ. Oder vll nicht jedermanns Humor. \n\nIch empfehle statt Infinite auf jeden Fall den Serienerstling, mit der Unterwasserstadt Rapture.

Dass die Utopie nicht lange hält ist jedesmal klar. Zu groß die Versprechungen von Comstock und Ryan, zu eigensinnig die zwei Schöpfer der beiden Städte. Dem Spieler ist von Anfang an klar, dass diese Utopie nicht lange halten wird, und dass man selbst eine Art Messias im Spiel darstellt. (Dies gilt vor allem für Teil 1 & Teil 3, der zweite Teil ist spielerisch und für den Gesamtzusammenhang nicht gerade wichtig)\nSpielerisch wird nicht unbedingt viel neues geboten, die Gefechte machen weiterhin Spaß, der Einsatz der Vigors in Kombination mit den Waffen erinnert immernoch an Rollenspiele, verliert aber nicht an Reiz. Neu jedoch sind Gefechte bei denen man sich mit der \"Sky-Hook\"-Klaue an Rails festhält und während des Slidens Gegnerhorden erledigt oder per Sturzangriff \"platt\" macht. Es bleibt zwischen den Kämpfen aber viel Zeit sich das wunderschön gestaltete Columbia anzuschauen und in seine Geschichte und den Verfall einzudringen. Begleitet wird man von Elizabeth, die selbst nicht kämpft, dafür \"Tears\" öffnen kann, und wie in Bioshock 1 die Little Sisters einen übermächtigen Beschützer an der Backe hat.\nDer interessanteste Teil am Spiel sind nicht die Kämpfe, es ist vielmehr die Geschichte und vor allem das Ende, bei dem sich eine im Computerspiel in dieser Form noch nie dagewesene Selbstreflexivität zeigt. Am Schluss wird nicht nur die Geschichte der Bioshock Trilogie episch beendet, sondern es wird auch auf einzigartige Weise über das Spiel selbst und weiterhin alle Spiele die den Spieler in ein eigenes Universum nehmen philosophiert. Sobald man durch den Leuchtturm geht, und auch schon das zum Leuchtturm gehen selbst, hat man keine Wahl als den Pfad des Spiels zu folgen, auch wenn man mal links oder rechts geht, am Ende ist die Geschichte für alle gleich. Damit ist Bioshock Infinite eines der ersten Spiele die das Medium Computerspiel als selbstreflexives Kunstwerk benutzen. Auch die rund zehn Stunden Spielzeit vorher offenbaren die Möglichkeiten des Mediums durch die Erkundung der Parallelwelt, für mich jedoch ist dies das erste Spiel, das vollkommen vom realistischen Ansatz hinweggeht und auch im Sinne der Post-Modernen Kunst aus allen Epochen zitiert und etwas ganz neues Schafft.\n\nAnmerkung:\nNach dem Ende von Bioshock Infinite geht es mit 3 DLC's weiter, ein Arcade-artiges mit Kämpfen und Highscores, aber auch zwei die die Geschichte der Trilogie endgültig beenden und den Bioshock Kreis schließen. Spielerisch ist wohl vor allem das zweite interessant, da man einen Schleich-Shooter erhält, man muss sie aber nicht unbedingt spielen, die Geschichte wird etwas runder aber interessanter ist eigentlich das Hauptspiel.","timestamp_created":1410650402,"timestamp_updated":1410698796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12090499","author":{"steamid":"76561198097222546","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":823,"last_played":1447563723},"language":"english","review":"This game litteraly blew my mind!","timestamp_created":1410648645,"timestamp_updated":1410648645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12089000","author":{"steamid":"76561198093605370","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":5284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5204,"last_played":1607727667},"language":"french","review":"Bioshock infinite nous offre une histoire différente, mais tout aussi prenante, surprenante et émouvante à la fois (oui tout ça en même temps, avec une pointe d'action, des fusillades, de l'émotion, des rentournements de situation, en voulez vous, vous en avez là^^).\n\nLe seul bémole (pour moi, je dis bien pour Moi^^) c'est...... la fin, je n'arrive pas à digérer de voir, le personnage que l'on incarne, mourrir ainsi....\n\n\nJe vous encourage de le faire par vous même pour comprendre ce que je veux dire.\n\nMais à part cela, je le recommande grandement pour les fans de Bioshock, et aussi les DLC pour mieux comprendre l'intégralité des Bioshock.\n\nEdit : je préfère la fin du DLC, on voit très bien que la boucle est bouclé.","timestamp_created":1410639380,"timestamp_updated":1480347515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12088481","author":{"steamid":"76561198024212247","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":811,"last_played":1410109655},"language":"thai","review":"เป็นเกมที่เนื้อเรื่องน่าสนใจเป็นอย่างยิ่ง แม้จะไม่เคยเล่นภาค 1-2 มาก่อนก็ตามก็สามารถเล่น ส่วนตัวสอยมาตอนยังไม่ลดราคาและไม่คิดว่าเสียดายเลย คุ้มค่ามาก\n\nคะแนน 10/10","timestamp_created":1410636768,"timestamp_updated":1410636768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12088070","author":{"steamid":"76561198060404443","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":874,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":771,"last_played":1470627249},"language":"english","review":"damn.","timestamp_created":1410634499,"timestamp_updated":1410634499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12087203","author":{"steamid":"76561198008067028","num_games_owned":819,"num_reviews":186,"playtime_forever":1065,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1065,"last_played":1410630032},"language":"german","review":"Kurz gesagt ein fantastisches Spiel was man doch mal spielen sollte.

MOSTLY.  \n \n   Let me just say straight up - and this may well be an opinion subject to change, given that I've played the first two games twice and this but once - that this is probably my \"least favourite\" of the three games.  This is a purely personal thing:  I am, on the whole, more a fan of \"horror\" than other fantasy-related genres, and while the first two games were perhaps not strictly of that genre, they certainly leaned more heavily toward it than this latest instalment does.  \n\n   Which brings us to the first two significant decisions made during the development of this game. First up, the change of setting from a ruined, claustrophobic underwater city to a city in the clouds rapidly HEADED towards downfall. And secondly, the shifting of the main \"enemy\" type from insane, physically-deformed mutants (some with the rough equivalent of supernatural powers) to well-armed soldiers and revolutionaries caught in a power-struggle to either defend or bring down the mad \"prophet\" who founded their would-be utopia.  \n\n   It's obviously a matter of personal taste which of these two \"tones\" one prefers. But in spite of myself generally favouring the earlier of the two settings, I have to admit that they really COULD NOT have gotten away with a third game set in the city of Rapture.  So all things considered, I'm conceding that they probably made the \"right\" decision.  It was due time to change things up a little, and they've done so in a way which is equal parts \"obvious\" (moving from a city under the sea to a city in the clouds) and \"inspired\" (they really could have just done another POST-apocalyptic scenario, but instead chose to tell an entirely different story...and good for them)!\n \n   This said, the actual GAMEPLAY is remarkably similar to the earlier games, with one important exception:  they've replaced a bunch of lovable (if slightly creepy) little girls with a single grown woman, and this is arguably where things differ the most.  Say goodbye to the oddly endearing task of liberating and/or baby-sitting \"Little Sisters\", and say hello to a sassy, would-be \"romantic\" interest who's constantly torn between despising our (anti-) hero for his \"brute\"-like behaviour, and being strangely attracted to him for, well, basically the same reasons (hmmph...women)!  \n\n   Not only does this change the tone of the piece quite significantly - call me a sap and/or misogynist, but I was actually quite moved by all the \"take care of the cute little gals\" antics of parts 1 and 2 - but in effect also makes this a much more linear experience than the first two games. Our only reason to \"backtrack\" now is to get more goodies hidden behind doors which our female companion can helpfully pick the locks of, rather than the far more involved task of harvesting \"ADAM\" required in the first two games.  \n\n   In short, we've lost a bit of tiny bit of strategizing along the way, in favour of a more straight-forwardly arcade-y experience of moving from location to location and killing lots of things and picking up a bunch of stuff.  Again...personal preference will decide for the individual whether this is a good or bad thing.  I myself found it all a bit repetitive and \"draggy\" towards the end, and found myself mainly using only two of the eight \"vigors\"/special powers on offer, but y'know...that's just me.  \n \n   Whichever way you look at it, this is still a pretty smart, classy game.  It boasts some of the best graphics in video game history (think an ultraviolent \"Disney\" cartoon, and you're getting warm), and a pretty interesting storyline to boot (though I gotta say, the people who made such a huge fuss over the supposedly \"controversial\" ending...you people really need to read more, or at the very least stop watching all those fucking Michael Bay and Marvel movies, 'cause it really wasn't THAT much of a mind-blowing revelation at the end).  \n\n   There's every chance I'll even find myself utterly adoring it the second time around, but right now...frankly, I'm a little \"spectacular\"-ed out.  Which is a way of saying this game isn't exactly anyone's definition of \"subtle\", so if that's what you're looking for...I dunno, maybe try Gone Home or something instead.  But if it's slam-bang action and jaw-dropping scenery you want, with just a pinch of cleverness and mind-fucking thrown in to lend a little spice, there's not much risk of finding disappointment here. \n \nVerdict: 9/10.","timestamp_created":1410621668,"timestamp_updated":1512059678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.628501057624816895","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12085248","author":{"steamid":"76561198012397577","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":775,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":726,"last_played":1433246279},"language":"english","review":"People seem to be most impressed with this games story.

The gameplay is solid, although quite unrealistic; but this is understandable for Bioshock.\n\nGood things: It was fun, the story was engaging and the world was unique, it gave a nice open-air feel as opposed to underwater.\n\nBad things: People were too bullet resistant. I think this changes on the easier difficulties, but on the hardest (not 1999 because I hadn't unlocked it) you would be shooting someone from the the Columbia PD 3 or 4 times in the head before they died. The sky hook thing was a nice game mechanic, but I never understood and still don't understand how a spinny metal thing on your arm lets you run and jump 30m through the air and grab onto a hook. Why it doesn't dislocate your arm at the elbow and the shoulder is also a puzzle. When Booker is holding two handed guns, he suddenly doesn't have the massive metal thing on his arm, but when you melee he swings his arm out and there's the sky hook. The front sights and rear sights were way too large on all of the firearms, and realistically you could not shoot accurately with them. The weapons were a little weird, with some of them quite antique for 1912 and others way ahead of the time period. This was explained via the tears though. I've seen the video about how everyone would be throwing up from motion sickness, and I won't elaborate on that. It seems that the only currency in Columbia is the Silver Eagle, which you spend like dollars in the 21st century. All the signs that have fireworks and popcorn at prices like 10c are meaningless unless you have those coins.................you don't. Like all games of this type, there's the ability to carry thousands of coins the size of your palm around in some kind of mega wallet that doesn't make you move like a snail, need I say more? Fink has all of the workers making the manufactured goods, but where does the fresh fruit come from? I see oranges in baskets, and yet I see no floating agricultural area anywhere in game or on the map. There are quite a lot of people in Columbia, but they don't really seem to do much apart from look at the various monuments or talk to each other. There are the shops and businesses, but not much in the way of employment for everyone else. In that time period it was common for the rich to live off inheritance and investments, but it's not like the economy in Columbia could thrive without trade.\n\nHonestly I could go on for a thousand pages and I think I'll leave it there.\n\nThe game was fun but the society/world/city would not work.

But the best is the story... I promise you, that you will be left speechless after seeing the end. Not only did this game keep me wanting more, it kept on giving me more. This is a MUST-PLAY game. Do not let this game pass you by. The story is unmatched by other games. I mean playing with reality and jumping into parrallel universes is quite awesome! You will constantly wonder what will happen next and you might guess a few twists if you're lucky, but there is no way of expecting the end.\nThis game is brilliant.\n(If you agree with my statement, try playing Bioshock 1 and 2, then play the dlc packs. Irrational games is the Einstein of story writing for games. I'm amazed beyond words.)\nKeep up the excellent work Irrational Games.

This is one of my top 10 games of all times. \n\nJust like the focus of TV series took an incredible turn for STORY the last 10 years, computer games in 2014 is only as good as its STORY. Bioshock Infinite has an AMAZING STORY. \n\nThe game is not nearly perfect in most other ways, but for everyone extremely tired of the \"fight, fight, fight, reward, fight, fight\"-mechanism of most games these days, the STORY of Bioshock Infinite will be extremely pleasing. The fighting sessions are easy, and won't take more time than what they should in any game to advance the story and the characters.\n\nWhile I'm at it, let me recommend the Bioshock 1 and 2 games at the same time. They are VERY different, but still some of the gloominess and is retained throughout the series.\n\n(spoiler alert, stop reading if you don't want to know)\n\nThe biggest problem I have with this game, is how the story actually manages to destroy the whole Bioshock Universe. The scriptwriters probably felt it would give \"infinite possibilities\" but the ending actually destroys all my feelings for the Bioshock Universe, and I'd rather not visit it again. TREMENDOUS loss. But at the same time the 3 Bioshock games will forever stand tall as a ginormous gaming trilogy, however without any further prequels or sequels - pretty much like the Lord of the Rings movies - the trilogy is \"it\". There's no more, and can never be. The story ends here.\n\nBut MAN what an amazing journey until that point.","timestamp_created":1410530367,"timestamp_updated":1410530367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12071318","author":{"steamid":"76561198093089739","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":345,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":345,"last_played":1403272803},"language":"russian","review":"Слишком ярко","timestamp_created":1410525536,"timestamp_updated":1410525536,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457053601741790771","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12071094","author":{"steamid":"76561198026467603","num_games_owned":788,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1760,"last_played":1410007427},"language":"english","review":"After the mandatory 'localisation' update you might notice a large number of the original player base have uninstalled the game\n\ngood work\n\nbefore this i would recommend the game and all its dlc but i cannot justify a 5.1gb update that just adds more languages\n\nThe file size is now 42gb so if your data is capped just keep that in mind","timestamp_created":1410523661,"timestamp_updated":1410523889,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12070800","author":{"steamid":"76561198126795876","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":601,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":538,"last_played":1461768109},"language":"russian","review":"По началу я думал что игра не так хороша, как кажется, но подходя ближе к концу, я понял, что это ШЕДЕВР!!!

Она настолько хороша, что может сравниться с моей любимой трилогией [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/worganomor/recommended/24980/]Mass Effect[/url].\n\nИзначально, еще до того как начать играть, я почитал много восторженных отзывов, но относился к игре с некоторой долей скептицизма. Однако, после того как я погрузился в этот мир, у меня не было ни тени сомнения в том, что Инфинит поразит меня до глубины души.\n\nСюжет этой игры невероятно динамичен и сложен, с одной стороны он развивается постепенно и создает иллюзию предсказуемости, но резкие развороты в самые неожиданные моменты напрочь разрушают это иллюзию. Сюжетная линия мощная и драматичная одновременно, а концовка настолько сложна и неожиданна, что вызывает чувство радости, горести и смятения одновременно.\n\nОтдельно хочется отметить проработку персонажей в целом и Элизабет в частности. Скажу честно, большую часть игры я провел за наблюдениями, происходящими с Лиз, по мере совершения сюжетных событий. Девочка из башни попала в реальный мир, полный жестокости и страданий, даже в такой утопии как Колумбия, и все события, происходящие с вами, оставляют свой след на ней. Легко можно заметить как рушатся ее представления и как ей приходится принимать новые условия, в которых она оказалась. Характер Элизабет создан настолько качественно, что ей не возможно не сопереживать.\n\nГрафическая составляющая так же на высоте, как и дизайн уровней. Единственный минус - текстуры начинают прорисовываться когда подходишь к ним, а на расстоянии они низкого качества. Такой же проблемой страдал и второй Байошок, а вот в первом все было нормально. Но это не так страшно и привыкаешь за 10 минут.\n\nПодводя итог, можно сказать: BioShock Infinite определенно одна из лучших игр, когда-либо созданных. С мощным сюжетом, интересным геймплеем, атмосферным саундреком, харизматичными персонажами и отличной графикой. Что еще для счастья надо?

And belive me in this genre I do not use that word lighlty. Bioshock Infinite is a game ripe with unexpected plot twists and all sorts of shenanigans to uncover and explore. Irrational games clearly hit the ball out of the park with their final ever game. And with Ken Levine closing down his company to make other games for Take Two Interactive, my only hope is that I get to experience his groundbreaking innovations again in the future.\n\nWithout fail Bioshock infinite has changed the landscpe of not only what it means to be an FPS game, but what it means to make a video game all together. This is something that the origional Bioshock did at the start of the last generation of consoles and here I can clearly see that Bioshock Infinite has done at the end.\nThe story is perfectly paced, the setpieces are spectacular and as not only a Bioshock fan utterly and completley but rather a fan of the FPS/Adventure genres all together...

A lot of people say that games are becoming pieces of art more and more, well Bioshock Infinite reassures this. It has one of the best story's from all the games I have ever played, in the beginning I was a bit confused and did not really payed enough attention to the story because I had a hard time figuring out the controls but after an hour of playing it all felt in to place and I enjoyed it very much. I have not yet played any other Bioshock game (yet) but I will certainly do so. The graphics are very nice, the voice acting is one of the best I have seen in a videogame. It's just a joy to see this story evolve but I really recommend to pay attention while playing or else you will have a hard time understanding this wonderfull story. \n\nThe gameplay itself was fun, you had your primary weapons (ranging from pistols to rocketlaunchers and you can hold 2 of them) and you also have these \"vigors\", they are abilities that your character can do, throw fire, electrify people and so on... \n\nIn the end I really recommend this game and would give it a 9/10 for graphics 8.5 for the gameplay and a 10/10 for story.\n\n","timestamp_created":1410378855,"timestamp_updated":1410378855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12044915","author":{"steamid":"76561198074152009","num_games_owned":424,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1437406234},"language":"english","review":"A very beautiful game, amazing scenery and interaction.\n10/10 would waste time looking at stuff rather than follow the plot again.","timestamp_created":1410366706,"timestamp_updated":1410366706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487746983766555786","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12044552","author":{"steamid":"76561198094084800","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1938,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1938,"last_played":1410571282},"language":"brazilian","review":"Outra obra-prima da Irrational Games.

The time travel component is handled even worse than Star Trek plots usually do, which is really saying something.

Bought it as a combo pack with all three games.  Friend has been raving about the series for years to me. I play the first and am blown away by the story.  Start the second one and couldn't even get past an an hour into and am thinking total garbage.  So the third installment I put on hold for quite awhile.  Finally get a wild hair to sit down and play it.  It is a very graphical stunning game.  I'm a little at a lose on written this review because it's a good game possible a great one with one thing I'm not 100% sold on the story.  The story is good but it was completely rushed it starts out slow like the first one that's fine getting your bearings and the lay of the land.  But then you hit the action and it's done quicker then a plate of oreos' at a weight watchers meeting.    It leaves you wanting more or it does in my opinion.  A person could easily finish this game in ten hours just rushing it not exploring or all that jazz.  I would feel even more cheap, dirty, and used like a five dollar hooker if I had paid full price for the game.  I did not so the feeling passed pretty quickly think I picked up all three and the season pass for idk around $20.  The story itself is good but you wish it had a little more detail to it.  All in all a good game don't let this review discourage your from purchasing it.  And the ending linking up to the Bioshock original wasn't even needed.  Love how they did just not fundamental to the story.  I would rate this game a 7.5 maybe an 8 but more towards the 7.5 mark.   Graphics superbly done. Story I liked it but didn't love it.  All in all if your a fan of the first skip the second and purchase this one.  If your new to series doesn't matter the order you play them just skip the second and your golden.
