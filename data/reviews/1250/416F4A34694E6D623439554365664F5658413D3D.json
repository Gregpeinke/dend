Great. This game was fantastic and even though it was not Early Access, the devs kept updating it, and kept releasing amazing free content including some fantastic DLC. Steampunk Weapons Pack and Community Weapons Pack are pretty much essential and I was willing to pay that money because the devs more than deserved it. \n\nThis game has easily the best firearms ever made for a video game, the sound design is stunning, the satisfaction from killing enemies by a headshot in zed-time is OVER 9000.. There is very little I can criticise this game for, because of how much fun I've had with it over the years. \n\nHowever it is not a a game that will be loved by everyone. It is hardcore in the best sense of the word, there is no melee attack besides the knife, there is no sprint button, the guns have massive recoil, unless you are using the appropriate perk. The levelling up can take weeks, but it is worth hitting that golden star.

A combinação de cada estilo de armas é o que permite que o jogo não seja monótono, existem várias maneiras de matar os inimigos com cada arma. A forma de matar tais também muda dependendo do mapa onde você joga e a dificuldade que este está, o jogo acabará exigindo mais da sua experiência.\n\nA inteligência artificial do jogo não é a melhor, em cada mapa existem bugs onde os Zeds e inclusive o Patriarch acabam travando, ficando parados, entre outros problemas, prejudicando a partida, porém não altera tanto o \"andar\" desta. Os gráficos não são dos mais bonitos, por ser um jogo antigo, eles são relativamente leves, e não muito complexos, na minha opinião, isso não interfere tanto na gameplay, nada que alguns ajustes não resolvam. O som também é simples, um bom fone de ouvidos ou caixas de som é uma boa para você jogar pois pode lhe ajudar bastante.\n\nKilling Floor conta também com o Workshop e o SDK, onde você pode criar QUALQUER estilo de conteúdo ao jogo, mapas, zeds, armas, personagens, menus, HUD's, perks, entre outros. Graças a isso, você pode incrementar o quanto quiser o seu game para jogar com seus amigos. Na seção Internet do próprio, existem muitos servidores que se dedicam exclusivamente a serem modificados com inúmeros inimigos novos, modos de jogo etc.\n\nO sistema de níveis do jogo é simples porém exige parte do seu tempo para elevá-lo até o nível máximo, conforme você joga, aumentará seu nível e assim ficará mais fácil conseguir completar os mapas, as dificuldades mais altas tem uma exigência maior para que tenha os níveis máximos pois os inimigos são bem fortes.\n\nO jogo é muito divertido para aqueles que gostam de desafios e não desistem tão fácil, este não é um jogo que você vá zerar em algumas horas, levará dias para completá-lo, porém até lá você já consegue virar um bom jogador que vai saber apreciar o game da forma como ele é. Você vai rir muito com certas coisas que acontecem inside game e também sentirá muita raiva, sejamos sinceros, nenhum jogo é perfeito!\n\nAgradeço se você leu esta análise até o final!  :)\n\nNota:\n-Jogabilidade 10/10\n-Gráficos 7/10\n-Som 7/10\n-IA 7/10\n-Cooperativo 10/10\n-Dificuldade 8/10\n-Diversão GARANTIDA\n\nGeral 9/10","timestamp_created":1469113324,"timestamp_updated":1469113324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24442226","author":{"steamid":"76561198043448625","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":6230,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2285,"last_played":1509505329},"language":"koreana","review":"킬플은 렙도 중요하지만 실력도 중요한겜이라서 물렙은 지옥난이도에서 얼마 못버틴다.\n크로스헤어가 없지만 하다보면 감이 온다\n지금은 킬플2를 주로하지만 전작도 재밌는건 여전하다.\n(서든2 협동모드보다 몇백배 나음","timestamp_created":1469109229,"timestamp_updated":1469109229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53977513313293457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24436660","author":{"steamid":"76561198058411211","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":440,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1470630454},"language":"english","review":"tried killing the floor but it didnt work\n10/10","timestamp_created":1469077439,"timestamp_updated":1469077439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24436550","author":{"steamid":"76561197990205716","num_games_owned":380,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":495,"last_played":1392950641},"language":"english","review":"dude its a zombine","timestamp_created":1469076681,"timestamp_updated":1469076681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24434972","author":{"steamid":"76561198073390215","num_games_owned":308,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":25297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18432,"last_played":1636182538},"language":"english","review":"This game is a once in a while game.
