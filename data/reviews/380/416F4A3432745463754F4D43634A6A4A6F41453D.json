Half-Life по-прежнему остается образцово-показательным экшеном, на который можно и нужно равняться.\n\nПри этом отчетливо видно, что и Half-Life 2, и Episode One разрабатывали уже не фанаты своего дела, а просто профессионалы. Опытные, умелые — но не более того. Первая часть Half-Life стала шедевром во многом потому, что ее делали настоящие сумасшедшие. У многих из них не было никакого опыта, отдельные уровни моделировались всего за несколько часов (подробнее об этом можно почитать в книге Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar), но благодаря зашкаливающему энтузиазму игра получилась именно такой, какой все мы ее знаем. Half-Life 2 и Episode One создавали те же самые люди, но за восемь лет они порядком устали от сериала и растеряли былой энтузиазм.\n\nИменно этим и объясняется то, почему Valve так упорно держится за старую формулу. За всю игру мы не слышим от Фримена ни единого звука, скриптовые ролики наблюдаем исключительно от первого лица, а вместо нормального сюжета нам опять предлагают игру в загадки — вся история Episode One укладывается в то описание, что мы привели в начале статьи. Музыка звучит дай бог если в двух или трех местах, хотя давно известно, что саундтрек справляется с нагнетанием нужной атмосферы лучше чем что бы то ни было (см. Metal Gear Solid или, ну мы не знаем, тот же самый Silent Hill). Причина такого поведения разработчиков вполне очевидна: они просто боятся сделать что-то не так, потому что былого чутья у них, похоже, уже нет. И вот это как раз самое печальное.\n\nP.S. Episode One распространяется через Steam и в традиционном коробочном варианте, оригинальный Half-Life 2 при инсталляции не понадобится. Вне зависимости от того, какую версию вы выберете — онлайновую или коробочную, вам потребуется подключение к интернету, чтобы завершить инсталляцию. Взломанные версии брать не рекомендуем — возможны проблемы с искусственным интеллектом, как это было в пиратском Half-Life 2.\n\n","timestamp_created":1529398934,"timestamp_updated":1529398934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42818348","author":{"steamid":"76561198140940012","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":243,"last_played":1529349482},"language":"russian","review":"норм игра","timestamp_created":1529352509,"timestamp_updated":1529352509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42815402","author":{"steamid":"76561198419522083","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1590264711},"language":"russian","review":"это более чем охуeно","timestamp_created":1529343130,"timestamp_updated":1621853795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50669485330581665","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42813193","author":{"steamid":"76561198100582342","num_games_owned":247,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1528988605},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life 2: Episode 1 - первый с трех эпизодов для Half-Life 2, обещанных компанией Valve. В данном сюжетном эпизоде нам поведают про жизнь Сити-17 после смерти Уоллеса Брина, а также об побеге Аликс и Гордона с этого города. Данная игра почти не отличается от предыдущей части, за исключением новых локаций. Тут тоже прекрасный сюжет, замечательный саундтрек и хорошо сделаные персонажи. \n\nПлюсы:\n• Сюжет.\n• Геймплей. \n• Достижения. Очень интересные достижения, в особенности достижение \"Одинокая пуля\". Выполнять его не сложно, но без оружие проходить эту игру - немного сложновато.\n\nМинусы:\n• Маленькая продолжительность игры. Игра спокойно проходится за два часа.\n• Глупые боты (Всё так же, как и в основной игре)\n\nВ общем, игра заслуживает вашего времени, если вы фанат игр Valve\n\n6/10\n","timestamp_created":1529336266,"timestamp_updated":1529336266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42804112","author":{"steamid":"76561198108080797","num_games_owned":602,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":333,"last_played":1503360566},"language":"spanish","review":"¿hay algo malo que decir del episodio 1? solo que dura muy poco, nuestra gran salvadora (por su munición infinita) Alyx, solo disfrutar de su historia & a lo que conlleva: Half Life 2 Episodio 2.","timestamp_created":1529299665,"timestamp_updated":1529299665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539312243461608887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42800528","author":{"steamid":"76561198003422578","num_games_owned":1280,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":559,"last_played":1528074941},"language":"english","review":"Episode 1 is great, picking up right where Half Life 2 left off.

We got that with The Orange Box and Episode Two wouldn't have been possible without the evolution the Half-Life architecture went through in Episode One.\n\nIt's evident that this installment is mainly about Alyx, her emotions, reactions and her relationship with Gordon. In the beginning, she is delighted to find you amidst the rubble. She is given a lot of space to express her anxiety about going back inside the Citadel to delay the reactor's core's meltdown and whispers your name at the very end of the Episode.\n\nShe is your companion and will stand by your side through most of the game. Her AI and reactivity were improved a ton as she is very helpful, moves away when she gets in your way, and you can count on her during the more precarious situations. In the chapter Lowlife when you are left wandering through pitch black underground garages, you will have to cooperate with Alyx by using light sources like your flashlight to illuminate zombies so that she can shoot them.\n\nThere are no new weapons, just the good old Valve creativity. They added flares that can light zombies on fire. Antlions now spawn from burrows that can be sealed with car wrecks using the Gravity Gun and a new combination of an armored Combine soldier and a zombie dubbed Zombine is present. Graphically the game's lighting was drastically improved with the addition of HDR.\n\nThe overall mood of the game is again top-notch.

There's just so much to say. Half-Life 2 is, simply put, the best single-player shooter ever released for the PC. It does so many things right in so many ways that it might be possible to write a thesis on the topic of Half-Life 2 compared to other single player shooters. What Valve has created is simply a masterpiece -- a work of art in the genre. Not only does it engage the mind with mysterious happenings, vagaries, and mostly intelligent dialogue, but also captures the senses with a superb visual style made possible by brilliant technology. And once the initial shock of it all wears off and it becomes possible to peel back the polished layers of sight and sound, there is an excellent shooter here. Half-Life 2 doesn't do anything particularly new; it doesn't really innovate in many ways. But what it does is set a new height for all other designers of first-person shooters to reach. It still isn't exactly perfect, but it's about as close as I've seen in my tenure here.\n\nBefore I really get into the review, you should know the background of how this game was reviewed. Valve did not want to send out copies of their game (for fairly obvious reasons) before it was released to the public. In order to play the game, I, and several of my colleagues throughout the industry, took a trip up to Seattle to visit Valve in order to have some private time with the title. I was given a little room to myself where I could close the door, turn off the lights, click my little red slippers, and pretend that I was sitting at home. It worked for the most part, largely because I was so engrossed with the game that when I came out of my trance I often had to take a moment to get my bearings. Obviously, Valve was happy to bring me into a controlled environment for ideal playing conditions.","timestamp_created":1527614055,"timestamp_updated":1527614055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42359209","author":{"steamid":"76561198169388532","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":78,"last_played":1536294044},"language":"russian","review":"игра отличная но минус нет беты и когда ты в тунеле я воопще путаюсь и заставка валве очень страшная всё время я закрываюсь мишкой","timestamp_created":1527593650,"timestamp_updated":1527593650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42338000","author":{"steamid":"76561198249940634","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1513627984},"language":"polish","review":"Chociaż ta seria bije na głowę konkurencje, to epizod pierwszy zostawia po sobie uczucie typu „JUŻ?

There are quite a few annoying areas (pitch black areas that I can't see in and the flashlight battery runs out way too fast), but it's not too difficult to get past on normal mode. Alyx accompanies you a lot in this game, but I never really found it to be frustrating or anything. In fact, it's quite helpful since you can just get her to shoot enemies while you hide in a corner or something. She has new AI and attacks, like swift kicks to take out attacking zombies. It's pretty nice. There's also quite a lot of other new features. I'm pretty sure this is the first time in which you fight stalkers and they have functionality, in which they can shoot lasers to stop your progress. Alyx can change the alliance of rollermines so that they attack the combine instead of you. There are now zombie combine soldiers, nicknamed zombines. These big guys will charge at you, and also pull out a grenade in an attempt to kill both of you. I guess they still have basic instinct on how to use grenades but never think about the throwing part.\n\nThat's honestly about all I have to say.
