génie de Valve n'était déjà plus à prouver après les sorties de Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead et Portal. J'apprécie énormément les quatres jeux que je viens de citer, mais je pense pourtant que Portal 2 reste à ce jour leur unique chef d'oeuvre intemporel.\n\nPortal 2 possède la qualité assez rare de pouvoir s'adresser à un public de touts horizons. C'est paradoxal à écrire quand on sait de quoi parle le jeu, mais l'absence d'intelligence artificielle au sein du gameplay démarque ce jeu de la plupart des autres productions à gros budget. Aujourd'hui, dans un jeu vidéo non-indépendant, il est rare de ne pas avoir de personnages ou monstres qui s'opposent \"physiquement\" à l'avancée du joueur. La progression dans un jeu est souvent synonyme de destruction ou contournement de ces ennemis. La plupart des grosses licenses agrémentent leurs jeux de séquences plateformes ou de quelques énigmes, mais généralement, la route du joueur sera entravée par des créatures hostiles, faites de code et de polygones. La série Portal n'utilise presque aucun ennemi \"animé\" (la nature des boss finaux m'oblige à utiliser le mot \"presque\") et base donc ses entraves à la progression sur les deux autres éléments mentionnés : l'énigme et la plateforme.\n\nProgresser dans un jeu vidéo, fondamentalement, revient à effectuer le trajet qui sépare un point A d'un point B. Les obstacles qui se situent entre se posent en tant que force à la direction contraire à ce que le joueur cherche à accomplir. Surmonter ces épreuves revient à dire au joueur qu'il a su faire preuve des qualités d'intelligence, de reflexe ou de courage (toutes proportions gardées quand on sait qu'un jeu est rarement punitif) requises pour atteindre son objectif. Un bon level design garde ces notions en tête et cherche à valoriser celui qui le traverse. La prouesse de Portal 2, c'est qu'il parvient à doser ses énigmes pour qu'elles soient suffisamment casse-tête sans jamais devenir désespérantes pour celui qui y joue.\n\nLe jeu se base sur le concept du Portal Gun, un appareil permettant, comme son nom l'indique, de créer un portail entre deux points différents d'un espace. Dans la pratique, ça donne des énigmes qui demandent à se positionner aux bons endroits, à réfléchir à la séquence d'évènements requis pour atteindre la solution, ou à se servir de la gravité pour donner de la vitesse à quelque chose, ou au contraire à retarder son déplacement. Une seule contrainte quant à l'art d'ouvrir des portails : seules les surfaces blanches et planes peuvent les accueillir ; le code couleur de Portal 2 est simple et instinctif.\n\nVous l'aurez compris, Portal 2 n'est pas un jeu très demandeur. Il est certes intéressant et intelligent au niveau des exploitations de la physique qu'il utilise, mais il n'est pas là pour faire souffrir le cerveau de ses joueurs (ses mods ont décidé de remplir cette case). Tout le monde bloquera à un moment ou à un autre sur une énigme qui deviendra leur bête noire, mais il sera rare de passer plus d'une demi-heure dans la même salle. Car de toute façon, votre réussite s'avère également être une volonté consciente du scénario.\n\nLà est la grosse différence entre Portal 2 et son prédécesseur, qui tenait plus de l'expérience vidéoludique que du vrai projet destiné à faire rentrer de l'argent dans les caisses. Portal 2 raconte une lourde histoire. Une histoire cruelle à propos de la place qu'occupe les robots, l'informatique et l'automatisation dans une société. Une histoire à propos d'un humain de plus en plus perdu et isolé au milieu de tous ces éléments synthétiques et digitaux. Une histoire mise en scène par des décors et des environnements extrêmements narratifs, où la crasse et les surfaces aseptisées évoquent énormément de choses sur le passé des laboratoires d'Aperture Science. Une histoire racontée par deux personnages aux scripts exceptionnels : GLaDOS (Ellen McLain) et Wheatley (Stephen Merchant). Une histoire pleine de surprises, de références et de lignes de dialogues mémorables. \n\nTout est cohérent dans Portal 2. Tous les élements qui composent le jeu, que ce soit le ton de la bande-son, la difficulté des énigmes, le contenu des dialogues, le design des environnements, les rebondissements du scénario... s'imbriquent les uns les autres avec une maestria digne de certains chefs-d'oeuvre de l'histoire du cinéma. La narration est fluide et reste divertissante sans trop sombrer dans l'héroïsme ou la justice narquoise qui plaît tant au grand public. Il y a énormément de choses à interpréter dans le scénario de Portal, et dans ce qu'incarnent Chell, un personnage qui cherche à échapper à sa condition de rat de laboratoire, GLaDOS, une IA extrêmement développée mais toujours soumise aux directives de feu ses créateurs, et Wheatley, un robot à l'existence encore plus ingrate que celle d'un des innombrables Cubes à Test manufacturés par les usines d'Aperture Science.\n\nPortal 2 est LE jeu que je recommanderais à n'importe qui. peu importe son âge, son origine, son (in)expérience en matière de jeu vidéo. Il est accessible au plus grand nombre sans s'abaisser à l'idée reçue qu'un jeu doit mâcher le travail du joueur.","timestamp_created":1448942118,"timestamp_updated":1451133848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19403914","author":{"steamid":"76561198091993008","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2067,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1490999857},"language":"english","review":"The game won't even launch in the first place for macs.","timestamp_created":1448940657,"timestamp_updated":1468780688,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.388105660676956177","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19403853","author":{"steamid":"76561198116676786","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4961,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2135,"last_played":1552224290},"language":"schinese","review":"nice game！！！！","timestamp_created":1448940458,"timestamp_updated":1448940458,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19403352","author":{"steamid":"76561198226782984","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":477,"last_played":1598145312},"language":"english","review":"Ok.
