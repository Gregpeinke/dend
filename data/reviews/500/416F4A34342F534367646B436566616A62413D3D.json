мой юный дружок![/h1] Если ты до сих пор не знаком с этой прекрасной игрой, то присаживайся поудобней, сейчас Григорий Александрович поведает тебе о том всплеске адреналина в крови, когда я тыркаю по кнопке \"играть\" рядом с великой аббревиатурой l4d.\n [h1]LEFT 4 DEAD[/h1] - это прекрасный survive-шутер с небольшими нотками хоррора. 4 героя, получивших иммунитет к \"зеленому гриппу\"(Эпидемия), выживают на улицах бездушных городов, где кроме них вряд ли кто то остался, а если и остался, то давно эвакуировался в ближайшие лагеря для беженцев, охраняемые военными. В этих условиях, эти 4 абсолютно разных человека, становятся друг другу практически родными, защищая друг друга ценой собственной жизни. Я не стану рассказывать вам о компаниях, которые вам предстоит пройти, не стану рассказывать о тысячах прыжков совершенных мною в роли 'Ханта' и т.д.  Я считаю что главным преимуществом этой игры является ее атмосфера. Ты проживаешь каждую минуту компании, как будто ты сам находишься в этом котле, каждый момент, когда наконец-то приходит чувство безопастности ,каждое мгновение страха проходит по тебе. ([spoiler]Ну если ты конечно не дол*аеб.[/spoiler]). В этом шедевре даже выбивание ачивок вызывает оргазм!!! Что касается игры с млекопитающими: В игре нет абсолютно никакой \"дедовщины\"!!! Если вы еще учитесь играть, то смело идите на сервер. И я вас уверяю, что любой здравомыслящий опытный игрок, почувствует себя мамочкой и научит тебя дол*аёба как ложку держать. А происходит так, потому что 'лефта' уже не так популярна как раньше, и если человек предпочел второй части (полному г...) первую, то он уже вызовет огромное уважение со стороны игрока. Вам же в свою очередь остается быть адекватным и хоть как то прислушиваться к людям, которые уже не 5 минут в 'лефте'. Мир данной игры, пасхалки, персонажи задуманы таким образом, что появляется куча мифов, слухов в игре. Атмосфера настолько восхитительна, что ты сам ищешь пасхалки там где их нет. И уж поверьте, они очень загадочные и интересные. Лучшая атмосфера! Лучшые игроки! Лучшая игра! Да это все она самая. И если меня хоть кто то спросит жалею ли я о том что приобрел данный шедевр, я с гордостью отвечу: Если бы она стоила в 5,10 или даже в 25 раз дороже, я бы ее неприменно купил. Лучшее что со мной случалось в стим. Идут н***й те, кто говорит что я старомодный, ну или просто дегенерат, но вторую часть я даже не считаю за игру!. P.s. Я дико извеняюсь за отсутствие лексики и знания мною русского языка, но по иному я обьяснить бы не смог.

Valve took the simple premise of a zombie apocalypse first-person shooter and added mechanics to make it more unique and interesting so it isn't a game where you just mow down endless hordes of zombies with nothing else to it (although you will be doing a lot of mowing down zombies).\n\nFirst off it's multiplayer but instead of going against other players and comparing skills (although there is a versus mode) it requires teamwork. As in teamwork is not helpful in this game but rather it is absolutely vital to be able to survive with teamwork in this game. Special infected which are zombies with \"special powers\" will invetiably constrict or pounce teammates or yourself and the only way to break free of the grasp of special infected is to have a teammate help you out. (So basically without at least 1 teammate you're completely fυcked).\n\nThere are many other things to take into account while playing the game such as how much damage or how effective a certain gun will be in different maps and against different enemies, situations where it's appropriate to use pistols (unlimited ammunition) or primary weapons (limited ammunition), when to use pills (quick boost of health but health is only temporary) or a med kit (slower boost of health and health is permanent, so it will be a requirement for a teammate to cover their teammate while he or she is healing).\n\nThere are three modes to play through on this game which are campaign, survival and versus. Campaign is pretty straightforward: you progress through maps, kill zombies and special infected until you get rescued by a rescue vehicle near the end and there are four difficulties on this mode to suit to your skill level. There's versus mode which is essentially the campaign but this time players get to take control of the survivors and the special infected so the special infected team's job is to make it difficult as possible for survivors to survive and the survivors job is to try and get through and beat the level. Survival is the last mode and in my personal opinion the most fun especially if you have skillful players on your side. It requires the most strategy and teams need to formulate shooting positions for all teammates based on how much room they have to kill the infected and how far away ammo and resource runs are. Certain players are still attempting to break records on this map.\n\nWhich leads me to the biggest con of the game which isn't really the fault of the game itself but the community and not the fault of the community itself but rather the lack of community. While there still are active communities who still play the original Left 4 Dead they are in the rarity. Finding partners to play with particuarly as a newcomer is difficult and annoying. Relying on searching for online lobbies is near useless now since you probably will never find a group of people on and when you do they're already full. If you are an active player yourself you could post a comment saying \"feel free to add me\" to make it easier for people wanting to play with others. \n\n[h1]Comparison To Left 4 Dead 2[/h1]\nThe most prominent reasoning for this game receiving a \"not recommended\" review is usually because Left 4 Dead 2 has all the campaign and versus mode maps from here ported over with the addition of new maps exclusive to the sequel and it has increased choice for weaponary including melee weapons and more special infected. However in my personal opinion I prefer the original to the sequel, not to say the sequel isn't any good in fact it's definitely worth getting. The thing about this game is it has a different \"feel\" to it in terms of gameplay which I can't particuarly describe, this version just feels better. It's almost like Left 4 Dead was different in its approach to how it would be played while the sequel has adapted to the feel of modern shooters. \n\nAnother plus is this game has better survival maps and the workload of zombies is much more bearable and reasonable instead of having a ton of special infected and tanks up your bum within the first minute of playing so this way you can go for much longer without constantly failing. But even if you like Left 4 Dead 2 better you have to admit the community is much less toxic than in the original and this is a huge positive on Left 4 Dead 1's behalf because seeing as it is a co-op game the community is an extremely important part of how enjoyable the game is going to be. Being a beginner or rather anything under being an expert player will have you kicked in Left 4 Dead 2 but the Left 4 Dead 1 community is much more supportive and friendly and will more than likely try to help you out and play with you regardless of skill level.\n\nAs for the characters they're more likable in this game in my opinion but I suppose that isn't really a valid reason since you can play as them on the maps in the L4D2. All in all I can't say for certain that I recommend this game to \"you\" because it depends who you are. If you absolutely loved Left 4 Dead 2 I recommend buying this game or if you want to pursue bigger feats like in survival and are considering becoming an expert player I recommend buying this game but if you're just looking for a game to play casually with friends then I would recommend the sequel over this. \n\n[spoiler]PS if you're an achievement hunter like me it gives you more incentive to perform certain challenges and makes playing the game feel more worthwile and rewarding. It's definitely a great game to complete, it's challenging but it isn't unbearably difficult.[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1481798035,"timestamp_updated":1516366569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":36,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.748071193695068359","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44/SCgdkCefajbA=="}
