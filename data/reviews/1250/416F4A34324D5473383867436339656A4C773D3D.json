Берсерк танчит, а Медик его хилит, Коммандос со Снайпером прикрывают своих напарников, Инженер не допускает появлению монстров в определенном секторе, а вот Пироманьяк с Подрывником безумствуют где-то в краю. Короче говоря, чем команда слаженно работают между собой, тем больше шансов, что они затащат эту игру. \n Цель игры проста - выжить! Выжить как можно дольше, попутно закупаясь у Трейдора и удирать от лап Отбивальщика.\n Уничтожайте орды мутантов, разнесите бошку Толстяка, взрывайте толпу Клотов, раздовите е-б-у-ч-и-х Ползунов и закройте рот истеричным с-у-ч-к-а-м, и, о боже, за это вам даже платят, чтобы приобрести более могучие пушки для этих уродов! И не забывайте прикрывать спины вашим сослуживцам.\n\n––––––––\n\nИзюминки игры:\n\n- Кооператив до 6 игроков!\n- 7 разных перков, от медика до НЕИСТОВОГО БЕРСЕРКА! Их можно апать [strike] з-а-д-р-о-т-с-т-в-у-я [/strike] выполняя определенные задачки, такие как: \"Нанести миллион (да, да, миллион!) урон огнем; разнести 9000 бошек мутантов и т.д\".\n- 10 разных видов, нет, не зомби, А НЕУДАЧНЫХ ЭКСПЕРИМЕНТОВ, которые жаждут полакомиться вашей нежной плотью. А главный гвоздь программы - [spoiler] ОБЕЗУМЕВШИЙ ДОКТОР КЕВИН КЛАМЕЛИ, БОЛЕЕ ИЗВЕСТНЫЙ КАК \"ПАТРИАРХ\"! [/spoiler]\n- Про оружии можно и не говорить, просто мечта манчкинов!\n- Полностью открытые карты, еще немного нелинейные. Прячьтесь хоть в самом незаметно углу карты, или же наоборот, обороняйтесь в эпицентре битвы!\n- Сэндбокс и Steamworkshop как-бы намекают, что в игре туева-куча модов, так что вы не соскучитесь, если приелся ванильный KF. Хоть нудистов-мутантов или Гордонов Фрименов с Мастером Чифом поставьте!\n\n––––––––\n\nСюжет игры прост – все началось с корпорации «Horzine Biotech», получившие заказ на создание универсальных солдат, которые могли бы превосходить своих “человеческих” коллег, имевшие даже определенные паранормальные способности. Но что-то происходит не так, ученый постепенно сходит с ума и начинает создавать орду (нет, не зомби) клонов! И так точно, он намеревается ЗАХВАТИТЬ МИР! И мы, славные игроки, выступаем в роли Наемников и должны искоренить зло от всего мира, а попутно уничтожить и того безумного [spoiler] Ученого [/spoiler]. \n\nСоглашусь, сюжет как в низкобюджетном фильме Уве Болла, но важен ли он для взрывного шутера? Определенно нет! \n\n––––––––\n\nГрафон - 10 из 10, а если настроить гамму, яркость и контраст, то может дать отпор любому Крузису!\nЗвук - 10 из 10\nМузыка - 10 из 10\nГеймплей - 15 из 10!\nФан от игры - 25 из 10!!!\nКОЛИЧЕСТВО МЯСЦО - 60 ИЗ 10!!!!!!\n\nОбщая оценка - over9000!

Patriarkka on kestävä kuin tankki ja omaa minigunin ja singon lisäksi kyvyn muuttua näkymätömäksi. Jos kuulostaa vaikealta niin sitä se onkin, mutta juuri tässä piilee killing floorin viehätys. Ensimmäinen vaikeustaso on kuin kävely puistossa, mutta jo normal-vaikeustaso saa hampaiden kiristelyä aikaan hiemankaan huonommassa ryhmässä.\nPelissä on erillaisia vihollis tyyppejä Left 4 Dead tapaan. \nPerus zombi ei paljoa huoleta, mutta se voi tarttua pelaajasta kiinni ja näinollen tarjota isommille mölleille tilaisuuden helppoon tappoon.\nCrawler on pieni ja matala, sekä se hyppii päin pelaajan näköä lähietäisyydellä, joten siihen on vaikea osua.\nHusk ampuu tulipalloja järkyttävistä etäisyyksistä aiheuttaen tarkka-ampujille ongelmia.\nLödöstä suoraan pöllitty lihava oksennus zombi pistää räjähtäessään näön pimeäksi ja aiheuttaa silmitöntä vahinkoa.\nGorefast on perus zombista nopeampi versio, joka jatkaa menoaan jopa ilman päänuppia, joten karkuun juoksu vaikeutuu huomattavasti.\nSiren huutaa niin lujaa, että se pysäyttää singot ja kranaatit kuin seinään, samalla tehden vahinkoa pelaajiin.\nStalker on heikko, mutta näkymätön ja kohtuu suuri kiusankappale.\nScrake on iso jampperi jolla on moottorisaha ja ottaessaan tarpeeksi vahinkoa se käy pelaajan kimppuun apinan raivolla.\nSitten kaikista suurin ongelma eli Fleshpound.\nFleshpound syö luoteja kuin sieni ja pelkästään raivostuu pienemmistä tuliaseista. Se myös pistää pelaajat kylmäksi jo kahdesta lyönnistä, joten koko tiimin on työskenneltävä yhdessä sen kaatamiseen, varsinkin jos niitä on kaksi liikkeellä samaan aikaan.\nPeliin tuo lisämaustetta myös eri hahmoluokat joista pelaaja voi valita.\nField medic pitää huolta muiden pelaajien kunnosta ja on erikoistunut konepistooleihin.\nSupport specialist hitsaa ovia kiinni pitääkseen kalmot loitolla ja suosii haulikoita.\nKuten nimestä voi päätellä sharpshooter erikoistuu kivääreihin ja pistooleihin.\nCommando näkee vihollisten elämät ja stalkereiden näkymättömyydestäkään ei ole hyötyä. Ase varastoon kuuluu kaikenmailman konekiväärit tommygunista faliin.\nFirebug pistää maailman palamaan ja Demolisher räjäyttää maailman taivaan tuuliin.\nHurjapäisimmille pelaajille on myös Berserker, joka on up close and personal melee hahmo, jonka arsenaaliin kuuluu kaikki viikatteesta palokirveeseen. Berserker ottaa myös livempää vahinkoa, mutta se ei paljon paina vaikeammilla tasoilla. Hahmoluokkien tehokkuutta voi myös kehittää pelatessa.\nPeli sisältää myös mielettömän määrän aseita ja skinejä joita ostamalla pelaamisesta tulee sen asteen hauskempaa, kuten stempunk ase pakkaukset, jonka antimista suosikkini on höyryhaulikko.\nMusiikit ovat raskasta kissankuritus/kirkonpolttometallia, jotka sopivat mutaatio muusituksen taustalle mainiosti.\nJos siis aaltopohjainen kimppateurastus kutittaa kasuaalipelaajan nystyröitä, niin killing flooria pahemmaksi on vaikea pistää.
