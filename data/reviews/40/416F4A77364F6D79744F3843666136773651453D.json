Давным-давно в далекой галактике, безумные высшие разумы наигравшись в Кваку решили создать свою реальную арену. Они вторглись в первый попавшийся на их пути мир и похитили несколько местных существ, дав им в руки оружие. Этот мир был вселенной Half-Life и даже G-Man стал пешкой в их руках. Не важно кто ты был в своем мире, Гордон, G-man, или даже ходячий зомби с хедкрабом на голове, у всех теперь лишь одна цель: выжить. Убей, или будешь убит. – таким мог бы быть сюжет, но его там нет. Нам лишь предстоит выбрать свою аватару, взять в руки оружие и разгромить всех вокруг!\n\nДанная игра всецело пытается походить на сетевые баталии первой Кваки скопировав с нее все по максимуму, оставив лишь свои модельки персонажей, да топор заменив монтировкой. Что касаемо карт, я не эксперт в этом деле, но как по мне, они не просто взяты и скопированы все с той же Quake 1, а воссозданы, хоть и на их основе, но с нуля. Что еще можно сказать об этой игре? Да, она уже достаточная старенькая, но онлайн, пускай хоть и в пару калек, но все же есть.\n\nСтоит ли вам ее покупать? Я бы не рекомендовал брать ее отдельно, если только вас не интересует ностальгия, а вот взять в бандле самое то! Что касаемо поиграть в нее, тут уж решать только вам. Но скажу по себе, что до этого я не был знаком с этой игрой, но зайдя, как я рассчитывал, на пару минут, я задержался на несколько часов.\n\nМаус одобряет! =)","timestamp_created":1589380216,"timestamp_updated":1589380216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.697126865386962891","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68928140","author":{"steamid":"76561198272924217","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52,"last_played":1608330765},"language":"english","review":"10/10 why","timestamp_created":1589152058,"timestamp_updated":1589152058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68861715","author":{"steamid":"76561198033623656","num_games_owned":359,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":1656769862},"language":"turkish","review":"Ya bizim Türk insanında cidden bir sorun var.

Valve multiplayer game that's completely dead. No story here so we're jumping straight into graphics. \n\nGraphics:\n\nSince this is running of the same engine as the first Half Life game, it's no surprise that this game is dated in the art department. There's nothing really that special about it and most textures (apart from guns) seemed to be ripped out from Half Life. \n\nAudio:\n\nThe audio design is decent, but overall nothing special. The guns sound meaty and the explosions have the same nice sound like in Half Life, albeit a little distorted. Overall nothing too note worthy. \n\nGameplay:\n\nDeathmatch Classic is Valve's throwback to Id Software's arena shooters like Quake. It's honestly a decent game, but sadly like most other Valve classic multiplayer games, it's absolutely dead. Unlike most of their other games I managed to play a match, but this was on a server that had insane ping, making it basically unplayable. \n\nMy shots would go straight through people, so I couldn't kill anyone and after sometime I just quit out. Other servers were completely empty and I couldn't get any matches going. \n\nVerdict:\n\nThis one seems like a decent game, but sadly it's completely dead so I cannot recommend this one, when games like Quake still have players kicking around in their servers. So skip this one. \n\nFinal Rating:\n5/10\n\nPros:\n+ Gameplay is fun \n+ Guns have meaty sounds\n\nCons:\n- Game is completely dead and some servers have too high of a ping\n\nIf you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews","timestamp_created":1586298057,"timestamp_updated":1586298057,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617642700672149658","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66724711","author":{"steamid":"76561198097652737","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":153,"last_played":1604212686},"language":"english","review":"Fun game for a nice deathmatch with the only rule being K I L L","timestamp_created":1586149611,"timestamp_updated":1586149611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66665316","author":{"steamid":"76561198416940043","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":40,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22,"last_played":1655475544},"language":"russian","review":"Классический дефматч Халф-Лайф.

Do not expect a easily joined multiplayer experience with frequent players: you will have to create your own multiplayer experience with [i]Deathmatch Classic[/i].\n\nI feel as though the complete lack of dedicated players speaks to the quality of this release on its own, and frankly, if it was truly of great quality like positive reviews assure you of, I think there would be at least one other living, breathing being in a lobby after multiple attempts at finding one, and with this in mind, it's hard to believe this was a great experience in the first place if it is dead and buried while other games of its time are still kicking.\n\n[b][RATING: N/A][/b]","timestamp_created":1579825468,"timestamp_updated":1625043812,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505988001823425293","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62244329","author":{"steamid":"76561198146697186","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":119,"last_played":1577128063},"language":"english","review":"So much blood, explosions, body parts and respawn sounds...
