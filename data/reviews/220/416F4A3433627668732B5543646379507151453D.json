Weapon models look better and there's a lot less graphical glitches than before. The major issue I noticed was that the weapon models do flicker when you move fast and there are frame rate drops here and there. However, the whole experience is much better now playing this in VR. It almost looks like native VR if it weren't for those graphical glitches. Also, you can now customize Vorpx so that you can move your camera up and down with the mouse so you no longer have to choose between mouse-aiming or head-tracking. This is awesome!\n\nYou can see my gameplay here in VR: https://youtu.be/MJCbMzd0K2Y\n\nVR Rating 8/10. It's getting close to a 9/10 (only native VR would be better!)\n\n*** Original Review Below ***\n\n[h1] VR Review with 3rd party injector [/h1]\n\nI am not reviewing the game. I will say that for the purposes of my VR review (using Vorpx) that I did play the game extensively in non-VR so that I could have something in my mind to contrast the VR experience with. Obviously, this is a great game and there's a reason some people claim it as one of the best if not the best game ever. I wouldn't go that far, but I do think it was GOTY for it's time back in 2004 for a very good reason and it is a game that is still enjoyeable to play, even today. \n\nIn VR (using Vorpx) this game looks amazing. Somehow, the 3D character details come alive in VR in a way that you really can't notice on a flat screen. In fact, the whole world looks amazing, especially the 3D holograms in-game. The action is fast and frenetic and there's just some breathers in between all the action. All actions feel really good in VR even though you're using a mouse & keyboard. I did turn off head tracking because I prefer to aim with my mouse and not my head. Obviously, this is a compromise, you can turn on head tracking and it'll be easier to look everywhere, at the loss of having to do gaze shooting.\n\nThe game itself ran smoothly. However, the visuals do have several glitches that may be impossible to get rid of completely. I turned down resolution. I went 4:3 and I turned down shadows. I think that helped some with the flickering (the starting subway scene in particular had a lot of flickering), but it did not eliminate it completely. I think geometry looks a lot better than z scale so I wouldn't change that. \n\nI have to admit, I preferred playing this in VR even with the graphical glitches. It looks that good. I was surprised. I didn't think a game this old would translate well to VR. [i][b] [u] Valve has some hidden VR config files in game and there's an Enable VR option in the menu settings. However, I couldn't get that to work.

Honestly though, this game to me still does feel overhyped as there are some major flaws that piss me off and prevents it from being a \"masterpiece\" as many of the PC community claim it to be. To be fair, it has aged pretty well and is hell of a lot better than HL1 in pretty much every single way possible, from the graphics and music, to the level design and gunplay, it's a must have for any shooter, puzzle, or PC gaming fan. \n\nI haven't played Episode 1 and 2 yet but those will be reviewed probably some other time. Anyhow, the story...is actually existant now and the game focuses heavily on plot to progress through the game. Again like its prequel, there are no cutscenes as you experience the scripted events and dialogue first-hand and can have some interaction in most. You don't even need to play the original Half-Life games as HL2 takes place almost 20 years after the first game and occurs in which I think is Eastern Europe. There will be characters that will give you some backstory and lore, and some few references from the first game such as the H.E.V charger module and familiar enemies. \n\nJust know that the Combine are an alien empire from a parallel universe that has taken over the Earth, enslaved humanity, and it's up to Gordon Freeman to ally with the rebels and vortigaunts (yeah, those electrical shooting aliens) to take them down...or at least the Combine sent to Earth. It kind of sucks that stupid events which I won't spoil prevent the story going as it should be, forcing Freeman to take alternate routes to get to his destinations. Though it's a somewhat justifiable excuse to explore the wilderness and enemy territory, and ofc the game would be beaten in 5-6 hours otherwise. Like I understand things don't always go the way you want to, but if it happens too often then it becomes cliche.\n\nValve has done it again by blowing away my expectations by having extremely beautiful graphics not only for a 2004 game, but also for a PC game in general. Many of the character and weapon models look good even to this day, and the levels that take advantage of the HDR lighting puts HL2 visually superior or equal to later Valve games like L4D1, Portal, and Team Fortress 2. Even newer games like L4D2 don't have the realistic lighting that HL2 has despite using a newer version of the Source engine. I can't put it into words but let's just say if you were amazed by the lighting in CS:S, then take that and multiply the awesomeness tens of times. \n\nExpected from such an old game, the textures for the levels and most map props look absolute shit or passable for last decade standards, but viewing it far away and increasing the Anisotropic level helps. Levels that don't have much lighting or HDR at all look ugly due to the \"greens, browns, and greys\" that are scattered throughout the game's world. I also am not a huge fan of the industrial and Soviet-like setting, but the suburban, wildnerness, and sci-fi sections more than make up for it. Music is less rock 'n roll and techno, moreso atmospheric and of many other genres, while the sound effects are more realistic and satisfying to hear; voice acting is phenomenal and opposite of HL1's shitty voices.\n\nI guess fans have had their voices heard or maybe Valve realized it themselves as the enemies are now less OP and more easier to deal with, except in some levels where they are a pain in the butt. Weapons finally don't suck with accuracy, fire-rate, recoil, and range improved and slightly smaller selection. Combat is much better too as I won't easily take so much damage from enemies and their AI don't feel cheap anymore (hated the HECU somehow having perfect aim with the same guns you use). Half-Life 2 is less focused on action and moreso on exploration and puzzle-solving, with many of the puzzles requiring some knowledge of how physics work in real life.\n\nDifficulty of puzzles is also reduced for the most part, or maybe it's just because they seem easier since I already played the first Half Life? Many of the puzzles won't even seem like puzzles and can blend in with obstacles and props in the environment. Navigation can also be confusing as many paths and rooms will seem very similar and you are truly alone except in some events so no scientists to tell you what to do. Oh, and besides using weapons you can also take control of two vehicles, a hovercraft (or airboat) and a jeep both equipped with a sci-fi turret. Later on in the game, you'll have some members of the Resistance helping you out and even some main characters with decent AI.\n\nUnlike Half-Life, there is no multiplayer included so you'll have to buy HL2: DM separately or as a sale bundle. This time around however, there are achievements that you can get, about half of which are story-related and the other half either easy to get or takes a little effort or scavenging the area. The chapters each take anywhere from 15 minutes to over an hour and a half, with the game in total requiring 15 hours to beat instead of the 10 for HL1. Optimization isn't the best as some areas I got below 60fps, other parts below 90fps, and many times from 150-200fps and up!

opinion i have about the previous one, maybe i am late to the party but i can’t understand why people praise so much this game, some shooters have aged well, this one haven’t. at least it has several improvements compared to the previous one, the gameplay its better and so are the graphics, and the story, although not as mesmerizing as people would have you believe it’s not so bad and MUCH easier to follow compared to the previous game, still though it’s so convoluted and told in a way as if you should know already everything that its going on, maybe that’s the reason people love it because it makes you feel that you need to read and make theories to understand everything, but i know of so many examples of confusing stories that are told in an understandable way with good writing and storytelling. Finally you have the gameplay which is not very varied just go here shoot things, keep going, so you can’t even say that you didn’t mind the poor story because of strong gameplay, and lastly you have the platforming sections, WHO SAID THAT SHOOTERS AND PLATFORMERS MIX? It just doesn’t work really, most of the times you will be failing because of poor controls.
