Dummfuch and the universe was subjugated by a Mac Walters clone.\n\nAfter playing through Burial At Sea I'm back to square one. I don't know what to think.

But with this \"quantum metaphysics\" nonsense added into the mix, all the protagonists just seem entirely superfluous to the events of both Rapture and Columbia.\n\nThe least they could do is patch the first two games so that they stand the test of time. Because now I just want to go back and pretend that Infinite is a completely separate story. Because on its own, it's great. It'd just be infinitely better if it truly were a stand-alone game. But since it interjects something which was entirely inevident beforehand (there were absolutely NO hints that Rapture was part some sort of pocket-multiverse spectrum in the first two games) I am reminded of things like ST:ENT and Starsiege Tribes. Because screw the original story, let's just punch a few holes in it and then take credit for filling those holes!\n\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed every minute of Infinite and its DLC.

Why put melee on 'v'? That's a terrible default place for a melee weapon, especially considering that opening crates/looting bodies has been put on the 'f'-key.
