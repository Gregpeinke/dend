Можно часами думать и пытаться пройти камеру, а решение окажется настолько простым, что ты даже не думал об этом, а иногда наоборот ищешь простое решение, а оно оказывается таким сложным, что твой мозг был просто не готов воспринять это. Вот этой непредсказуемости часто не хватает в подобных играх. Так же есть камеры, где нужно успеть с огромной скоростью поставить портал, добежать до другого конца комнаты поймать летящий куб и моментально поставить его на кнопку. То есть есть и камеры, где нужен навык быстро и безошибочно нажимать на кнопки. Иногда можно перепутать оранжевый портал с синим, хотя ты пол часа мучился, что бы поставить его, и все эти действия коту по хвост, и приходится переигрывать этот жестокий момент. Постоянно меня выбешивали комнаты, где есть турели. Эти имбовые роботы убивают тебя за пару секунд, а ты их не сможешь убить ни как, если в комнате нет лазера и зеркального куба, или если турель стоит не на поверхности, на которую моно поставить портал. Так же нельзя не оценить сюжет, в который я вжился всем телом и душой, волновался за героев, злился на них, благодарил, радовался и грустил вместе с персонажеми. После прохождения игры я постоянно надеялся на третью часть, думал что там будет, но похоже, что VALVE просто не умеет считать до трёх...\nВсё это делает игру невыносимо сложной, но разве не этого вы ждали, кокда покупали Portal?
