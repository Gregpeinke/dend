Given my old account is gone, I bought this game again and played it for the first time since at least 2002. It's absolutely insane....just insane how well this game holds up. Of course there are some small nitpicks when it comes to a game that is over 20 years old. But they don't take away much from the overall experience. Replaying this game has been amazing.

Although a bit dated by today's standards, still a fun and engaging shooter.  The story is told entirely through the player's eyes as you take on the role of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist working deep within the Black Mesa facility.  When all hell breaks loose after an experiment goes awry, you must fight your way out of the facility amidst the chaos.  \n\nFor it's time the graphics and sound were state-of-the-art, though today the graphics are very block-like and the sounds are a bit simple.  Play-control was always a little loose and imprecise, though you do get used to it.  Music was always sparse, only playing during important revelations during the game, but very unique and well-done.  What made the game great was the story, told entirely through Gordon Freeman's eyes.  There is no point at which you are pulled from the gameplay to watch a cut-scene and as a result you get to experience everything first-hand.  Weapon and enemy variety are very well done.  The array of common and alien weaponry available to you allows you to be creative in how to deal with your enemies, and the extensive cast of enemies provide an interesting challenge.  Another feature of the game are the intricate puzzles you encounter as you navigate the facility.  Getting around blocked areas and past environmental hazards will test your skills and provide for a good change of pacing from the combat.\n\nOverall, Half-life was an amazing game when it first came out and is still solid all these years later.

So, overall? It's pretty good, though I believe the hype is too much. The game is important as far as what it was for the industry, but in terms of the game as such it is kind of just above average. The storytelling is a bit above average, the atmosphere is a lot above average (though it tends to drag on at times), the gunplay is above average, the enemy variety is above average...you get the picture. There are quite a few bullshit moments especially later on when enemies start teleporting spawning in behind you though due to the audio hints it isnt too bad.\n\nWhat needs to be said is that there are barely any bugs so it plays smoothly (for it's age) and the game feels very robust. \n\nIs it the great, marvelous, fantastic, amazing, brilliant masterpiece that some people get wet over remembering? Nope. Is it a textbook example of how to get all aspects of a game solid? Absolutely.
