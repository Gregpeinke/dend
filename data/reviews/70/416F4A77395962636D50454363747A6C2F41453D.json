That being said, I believe that this is the first game to truly immerse me into it´s atmosphere and locations, which is quite weird considering it´s aged engine, mechanics and visuals. I can see why this game was so revolutionary back in ´98 when it came out. Around that time first person shooters were still coming into their own, with each one of them having different control schemes. Half Life was one of the first games of it´s genre to feature WASD movement. Nowadays we couldn´t imagine an FPS not including this function. When I sit and think about it Half Life 1 controls almost exactly like a modern fps and that´s quite remarkable. This goes to show that HL has set a template for all future games of it´s type. Another cathegory in which this game changed the landscape was it´s story and non violent interactions with the npc´s and enviroments. For the first time in an FPS there was an actual story with visual and dialogue exposition. Listening to what npcs had to say, proves helpful in solving enviromental puzzles, without the game ever holding your hand. It wants you to think and search for the right solution. This is a very stark contrast to the modern day linear shooter. Actually almost everything about the game´s level and visual design is brilliant. Even compared to it´s successor: Half Life 2, the first one in the series had a far greater weapon and enemy variety. This goes a long way, considering that the main thing that you are going to do for it´s 15ish hour runtime is shoot. The Black Mesa facility truly feels massive and diverse, a feeling that you first experience during the game´s impressive, albeit a bit too lengthy introduction. It´s impressive how it manages to keep this feeling going and even add to it until the very end. All in all it´s a true classic which you should at least try out, although you may need some adjusting at first. Beware of difficulty, unfair enemy spawns and cryptic solutions to puzzles. 9.5/10","timestamp_created":1585812795,"timestamp_updated":1585812795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66401207","author":{"steamid":"76561198382348618","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":855,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":855,"last_played":1609414151},"language":"english","review":"Loved It\n","timestamp_created":1585809618,"timestamp_updated":1585809618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66401147","author":{"steamid":"76561198238320498","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":714,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":402,"last_played":1586576200},"language":"schinese","review":"除了画面，其他都很好","timestamp_created":1585809534,"timestamp_updated":1585809534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66400362","author":{"steamid":"76561198965909351","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1586150348},"language":"english","review":"I'm new to PC gaming.

Após jogar Half Life, fiquei com vontade de jogar mais! Joguei as outras expansões Opposing Force e Blue Shift, realmente fiquei animado pra jogar esse jogo. \nMinhas críticas: O jogo possui alguns bugs na movimentação, eu sinto as vezes que o seu personagem desliza pelo chão e isso pode atrapalhar na hora do jogo, tem bugs que eu acho que a Valve até sabe que tem, como as vezes que quando você empurra ou puxa um objeto, esse objeto vai numa velocidade muito alta; o áudio é meio ruim (acho que é até entendível porque é um jogo de 1998); a história é meio mal contada, acho que só há algumas explicações da história em diálogos com personagens, mas acho que dependendo do seu inglês fica difícil de entender sem legendas.\n\nRecomendo o jogo, ele é considerado um marco na história dos FPS por várias pessoas.

The story is not conveyed through cutscenes, but either first-hand experience or exposition given to the player by survivors in Black Mesa. \n\nThe shooting feels pretty solid and responsive. The guns all sound good (with the 1998 audio quality to boot) and you get a variety of your traditional FPS guns, like the shotgun, grenades, machine gun, and the revolver, among others, topped by unique weapons like tripmines, the gluon gun, and the crossbow, but you also get a few alien weapons, like the Hornet Gun with an regenerating amount of homing hornets, and Snarks, which are man-eating insects. \n\nThe graphics have aged surprisingly well. You are instead focused on the story and the gameplay, which is the real highlight of HλLF-LIFE. If you only play games for their graphics, you’re doing at least one thing wrong in your life.\n\nGood soundtrack. Diabolical Adrenaline Guitar and Surface Tension are good combinations.\n \nThe game’ll probably last you anywhere from 15-18 hours depending on your competence (mine is non-existent). To add to that, you have dozens of mods for this game, that’ll easily extend the s-half-life of the game. There was a Source version of this game by Valve, but it was pretty much only some noticeable changes in some areas, and numerous bugs in general. (For example, the shotgun doesn’t make the chk-chk sound if you hold down the fire button even though it shows the animation of him pumping the shotgun. That’s just a bruh moment.) So get this.\n\nGood game. Worth the 10 bucks. Definitely grab when on sale for a dollar.","timestamp_created":1585706980,"timestamp_updated":1585707058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522293031215667725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66304038","author":{"steamid":"76561198094023503","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":800,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":798,"last_played":1649362229},"language":"spanish","review":"Una joya de arte, 10/10","timestamp_created":1585706669,"timestamp_updated":1585706669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66302641","author":{"steamid":"76561198322904683","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":640,"last_played":1585690511},"language":"spanish","review":"Buenardo.","timestamp_created":1585705162,"timestamp_updated":1585705162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66302094","author":{"steamid":"76561198040744235","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":708,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":432,"last_played":1585729851},"language":"english","review":"yeh good","timestamp_created":1585704577,"timestamp_updated":1585704577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66301474","author":{"steamid":"76561198447799984","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":3089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1037,"last_played":1655963580},"language":"english","review":"Its very good!","timestamp_created":1585703840,"timestamp_updated":1585703840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66298353","author":{"steamid":"76561199025097137","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":952,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":144,"last_played":1586156783},"language":"spanish","review":"si","timestamp_created":1585700367,"timestamp_updated":1585700367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66296147","author":{"steamid":"76561198316221439","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1585690794},"language":"english","review":"This game is awesome.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game is outstanding and immersive with only occasional music playing for certain events or scenarios, it's very well done. There's a great deal of puzzles involved and it's important the player can understand the certain sequence of events that must happen for you to pass an obstacle in your way. In fact, it's a very good blend of linear progression, puzzles and careful platforming when traversing through the facility.\n\nThe NPCs are fun to interact with and the actual story doesn't hold your hand a lot, which makes it interesting and something to think about. The gun combat is satisfying and fun, but it still expects you to manage your resources properly so the game isn't piss easy.\n\nHowever it's still a very old game so it doesn't look amazing and there's a few bugs here and there which can be very annoying, the finale to the game is not amazing, unfortunately it is probably my least favourite part of the game. It definitely does not have the charm of other parts of the game.\n\nRegardless Halflife is amazing in my opinion and a lot of its features hold up today to be a fun
