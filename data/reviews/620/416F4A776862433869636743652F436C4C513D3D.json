Is there such a thing as too much awesome?  It would seem wrong, though, to harp on the sequel for stretching the concept a little too thin after everyone said the original was too short.  The game is divided into distinct sections, however, and each section introduces a new twist on the concepts.  There's also a more developed story that keeps you playing in order to find out what happens next.\nThe one thing I'll say for certain is the environments.  The first game had very simple, sterile chambers, while this one has debris and plants, painted areas and catwalks all over the place.  This makes it look a lot more realistic, but gets in the way of the simplicity of seeing where you can put portals or not.  In fact, a lot of the times you get stuck will just be a problem of observation, rather than puzzle solving.  Once you spot that out-of-the-way place that can hold a portal, the solution becomes much more obvious.\nI can't say which one is better. They're different games, but both very much worth playing.","timestamp_created":1409186440,"timestamp_updated":1409186440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538709700107574463","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11891600","author":{"steamid":"76561198140568334","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1453943551},"language":"english","review":"amazing game worth evey penny","timestamp_created":1409185896,"timestamp_updated":1409185896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11891164","author":{"steamid":"76561198028827452","num_games_owned":2242,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1010,"last_played":1409176755},"language":"english","review":"Great game with a nice history and great puzzles.\n","timestamp_created":1409182739,"timestamp_updated":1409182739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11890765","author":{"steamid":"76561198141756496","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":117,"last_played":1418837856},"language":"russian","review":"Я заебался это проходить 1/10","timestamp_created":1409180019,"timestamp_updated":1409180019,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.339064449071884155","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11890391","author":{"steamid":"76561198026195758","num_games_owned":582,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1060,"last_played":1644018768},"language":"english","review":"One of my favourite games of all time.","timestamp_created":1409177232,"timestamp_updated":1409177232,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503498077392578125","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11890354","author":{"steamid":"76561198063827750","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1083,"last_played":1523118062},"language":"french","review":"20/20\n\nce jeu est un ovni tout simplement\n\nun FPS de réflexion avec un scénario de malade et des moments très forts\n\ndrôle, triste, sérieux, effrayant\n\nun gameplay qui creuse les méninges\n\nbref j'ai pas trouvé mieux que ce jeu sur PC","timestamp_created":1409176946,"timestamp_updated":1409176946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11890316","author":{"steamid":"76561198056519925","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":575,"last_played":1468519444},"language":"english","review":"Amazing.

In addition to the single player, there is also a coop mode so you can play with a friend both locally and online.\n\n[b]STORY[/b]\nThe story is pretty interesting with great and memorable characters that other games can only envy. It'll leave you wanting more.\n\n[b]REPLAYABILITY[/b]\nThe amazing thing is that you can make your own test chambers or download chambers made by others from the Steam Workshop and there's tons to choose from. You can keep on playing the game for several hours even after completing the single player and coop campaign.\n\n","timestamp_created":1409081351,"timestamp_updated":1550746631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11875855","author":{"steamid":"76561198056321466","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":20379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13260,"last_played":1590819550},"language":"english","review":"Amazing Game\nBest Game there is","timestamp_created":1409077248,"timestamp_updated":1409077248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11875829","author":{"steamid":"76561197969901712","num_games_owned":429,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":915,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":915,"last_played":1409236896},"language":"german","review":"ein sehr geiles spiel, da muss man ja auch mal die birne anstrengen, finde ich sehr gut","timestamp_created":1409077087,"timestamp_updated":1409077087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11875722","author":{"steamid":"76561198082474132","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":774,"last_played":1408893484},"language":"turkish","review":"Portal efsanesi hala oynamadıysanız çok şey kaybediyorsunuz demektir.","timestamp_created":1409076512,"timestamp_updated":1409076512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11875582","author":{"steamid":"76561198082064330","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3828,"playtime_last_two_weeks":600,"playtime_at_review":943,"last_played":1660171618},"language":"english","review":"Awesome, simply awesome.\n\nGénial, simplement génial.","timestamp_created":1409075697,"timestamp_updated":1409075697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11875210","author":{"steamid":"76561198091444849","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":21822,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4290,"last_played":1652547220},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito foda!","timestamp_created":1409073534,"timestamp_updated":1409073534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11874209","author":{"steamid":"76561198027169092","num_games_owned":438,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":2139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":73,"playtime_at_review":1361,"last_played":1660585180},"language":"dutch","review":"Brilliant puzzle game, a classic.
