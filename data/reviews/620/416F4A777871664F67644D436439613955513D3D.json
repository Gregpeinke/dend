But I'll give it a shot anyway.\n\nThis game is perfect. If I were to recommend any single PC game to a friend, this would be it, the most essential game to own for any PC gamer. Or any sort of gamer. Or any person at all, really. \n\nThis game has everything. The levels are spectacular: from the gorgeous overgrown testing chambers of the modern Aperture Laboratories to the goo-covered classic Aperture Science Innovators levels of the 1950s, there is always something amazing and new to look at. \n\nAnd the puzzles? The best in gaming. Portal 2 has all of the fun puzzles that you loved from the original, plus a myriad of new features that make you feel clever and stupid at the same time. Classic Portal.\n\nThe story of Portal 2 introduces Wheatley, your rescuer from your prison cell within Aperture Labs and loyal companion ([spoiler]sorry Companion Cube[/spoiler]), and Cave Johnson, the founder of Aperture Science who you \"meet\" through prerecorded messages that play throughout the levels. Both characters are hilarious and end up with surprisingly deep character arcs. And, of course, GLaDOS returns with her usual compliments and motivational speeches to help you along.\n\nIn short, this game had me laughing and pulling my hair out at the same time and I've never enjoyed myself more. Portal 2 is much deeper and more cinematic than Portal in most of its aspects, but mostly in its story. The ending made me sit with my jaw hanging open for what felt like 10 minutes; it alone was a masterpiece of storytelling. All of this from a puzzle game\n\nOn the off chance that you haven't already picked up a copy of this game and aren't just reading reviews to affirm your own opinion, I strongly urge you to quit reading reviews and just try it.

 单人模式通关撒花纪念，大概用了14小时\n\n\n===原评测====\n\n刚通了1代，2代刚开始玩。\n首先让我惊讶的是1代2代竟然配置要求都非常低，我的渣MacBook air集成显卡也能流畅运行，2代甚至风扇响声还没1代大。从没见过优化这么好的游戏。\n从开始的剧情画面上看，1代更像一款硬核独立游戏，2代更有一点大作的气质。\n从上手难度来看，2代上手比1代简单，新手提示也做得更到位。后续会不会比1难还不知道。\n虽然两款都是98%好评神作，但考虑到这类游戏挺杀时间，如果时间有限建议直接玩2代。\n玩1代的好处是对背景剧情有更多了解，因为2一开始就是光圈公司崩坏，之前的背景没有介绍。\n\n先写这些，待更。\n=====\n第一章最末尾的场景即是1代的最终boss战废墟。好怀念。\n\n=====\n进程过半，目前玩到第七章。\n中间有些部分还是比较难的，看了两次攻略。主要是道具比一代复杂了许多，有些地方就不是靠乱试就能找到答案的。\n中间谜题部分玩久了有些枯燥。然而第五章结尾剧情大转折，又一下子有了干劲。\n\n\n====\n晾了大半年，这两天拾起来继续往下打。\n六、七章是逃脱剧情，主要是找白色墙壁和各种高空弹跳，这部分难度不算很高，但白色墙壁有时候很小又很高，到后来都养成了没事抬头走路的『好』习惯。\n第八章回到实验室，一看有19关吓尿，还好实际上没这么多。最后一关有点难看了攻略才过。\n\n====\n16.10.13 通关撒花~~\n第九章是最后一章，没什么难度，但音乐紧张剧情也非常好。最大的惊喜来自boss战，击败boss的脑洞真是给开发者跪了。好评如潮！！\n结尾[spoiler]还挺感人的，一代的大反派GlaDOS竟然说出了那样温情的话，看着昔日让自己逃得屁滚尿流的Turret炮台收起红外探测，在一片合唱中目送『我』重返地面获得自由，顿时觉得辛苦这么久，值了。[/spoiler]\n\n整部作品没什么可挑剔的，从创意到可玩性，到剧情、音乐、优化，全都满分。最爱的是GlaDOS和Weatley的配音，印象非常深刻。接下去有时间再玩玩合作模式。同时非常希望出第三代（虽然听说G胖不会数3……）","timestamp_created":1456119615,"timestamp_updated":1476344985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21380081","author":{"steamid":"76561198158489727","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":59,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59,"last_played":1452784720},"language":"schinese","review":"非常动脑经的游戏。。","timestamp_created":1456118786,"timestamp_updated":1456118786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21378742","author":{"steamid":"76561198275476338","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":515,"last_played":1456593482},"language":"english","review":"One

Abwechslungen/ Neuerungen sind auch in Portal 2 sehen die es im Vorgänger noch nicht gab wie z.B.: Gel oder Laser.\n\nEin wirklich gutes Spiel für Leute die mal ein paar Rätzel machen wollen und schon den recht kurzen Vorgänger mochten.\nAber ich empfehle durchaus den Vorgänger davor zu spielen da man dann besser die Geschichte und die Einzelheiten versteht.\n\n:p2turret: Ich bin anders.","timestamp_created":1456061690,"timestamp_updated":1456061690,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21363302","author":{"steamid":"76561198251944334","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1105,"last_played":1578209931},"language":"english","review":"CO-OP in a glance\nFriend- stand on the white panel\nMe- what if I dont?\nFriend- ...\nstand on the black panel\ndies\nFriend- laughs\nMe- haha\nquits skype call\n10/10 make good friends","timestamp_created":1456059273,"timestamp_updated":1456059273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21362322","author":{"steamid":"76561198261696494","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":656,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":620,"last_played":1467618034},"language":"english","review":"Very good!","timestamp_created":1456056175,"timestamp_updated":1456056175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21361704","author":{"steamid":"76561198088821875","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1657032802},"language":"turkish","review":"Oynayacak arkadaşınız varsa saatlerinizi harcayabileceğiniz bir oyun","timestamp_created":1456054070,"timestamp_updated":1574872484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21360421","author":{"steamid":"76561198111408783","num_games_owned":4482,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1340,"last_played":1530553773},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun her ne kadar sürekli oynanan bir oyun olmasa da oynadığınızda acayip zevk veriyor.\n\nGerek hikaye modu olsun gerek coop modu olsun süper zevkli.\n\nKesinlikle oynamadıysanız arkadaşınızla coop oynayın tavsiye ederim pişman olmazsınız.","timestamp_created":1456049705,"timestamp_updated":1456049705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500022470951080322","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21360050","author":{"steamid":"76561198125192563","num_games_owned":792,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1030,"last_played":1477477867},"language":"french","review":"...\nQue dire ?\nUne jeu basé sur le moteur source, dirigé par valve...\nUn gameplay fluide, des graphismes impressionnants...\nUne musique géniale...\nUne histoire franchement prenante, et intéressante...\n\nBref, que dire, si ce n'est que ce jeu est l'un des meilleurs jeux que je connaisse...","timestamp_created":1456048262,"timestamp_updated":1456048262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21359975","author":{"steamid":"76561198185982234","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":331,"last_played":1530652549},"language":"polish","review":"Nieskończony samouczek.
