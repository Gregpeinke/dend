Portal — герметичное произведение, вещь в себе: есть пушка, которая открывает в любой точке пространства вход и выход, есть череда стерильных помещений, где с помощью этой пушки необходимо решать головоломки. Этот подход идеально работал в условиях камерной независимой постановки, каковой Portal, собственно, и являлся.\n\nПользуясь статусом концептуального произведения, Valve позволили себе ряд художественных допущений, главное из которых — игра ни на секунду не покидала границ созданного ей жанра. Даже когда главная героиня вырывалась за пределы тестовых комнат Aperture Science, Portal все равно оставался пазлом от первого лица, менялись лишь декорации. Этот подход прекрасно работал в условиях показной театральности Portal, но он с большими оговорками применим к полноценному коммерческому блокбастеру, каковым явно хочет быть Portal 2.\n\nСама идея сделать из Portal настоящую, большую игру, пересадив ее экспериментальную механику на шутерную почву, казалась невероятно привлекательной. Это как раз тот редкий случай, когда геймплей, выведенный в лабораторных условиях, буквально просился на волю. При попытке представить себе полноценный шутер с участием portal gun, мозг моментально достигал температуры кипения и захлебывался в эйфорической истерике: враги, стреляющие друг другу в зад благодаря метко расставленным порталам! Уровни, где понятия «пол» и «потолок» так же относительны, как пространство и время! Архитектурные парадоксы! Пространственная импровизация! Вынуждены с прискорбием признать, что ничего этого в Portal 2 нет.\n\nМеханика, структура, устройство уровней и логика взаимодействия с окружающим пространством с незначительными изменениями переехали в сиквел из первой части. Вместо того, чтобы сделать настоящую, полноценную игру, Valve заняты тем, что у них прекрасно получается, — поддают жару.\n\nВот прямо на наших удивленных глазах собирается тестовая камера: жужжат управляемые панели, складываются из перегородок целые стены. Вот кусок недостроенного уровня приезжает в кадр, осыпая меблировку и грохоча кафелем. Вот уходят вверх бесконечные хитросплетения труб, а мы тварью дрожащей семеним где-то внизу. Вот фирменный длинный план: в полупрозрачном тоннеле мы проплываем среди лязгающей машинерии и колб, в которых снуют под давлением ящики и турели.\n\nПроблема в том, что в этих грандиозных, гарантированно впечатляющих декорациях разыгрывается тот же самый Portal, каким мы его помним. Проверка деньгами и масштабом — излюбленный голливудский студийный тест, который проходят далеко не все уважаемые авторы.\n\nПри этом Valve честно стараются усложнить и углубить оригинальную механику, для чего придуман целый ряд фокусов разной степени удачности. Есть, например, гели, которыми можно покрывать окружающее пространство: одни превращают любую поверхность в натуральный батут, другие смазывают ее ускоряющей жидкостью, третьи позволяют открывать порталы там, где это запрещено делать.\n\nВ итоге вся игра проходит в томительном ожидании, что «сейчас начнется». Нас заботливо ведут через легкие, явно обучающие уровни, знакомят с новыми игрушками, но игра так и остается чередой изолированных пазлов, каждый из которых имеет единственно верное решение.\n\nНо это по-прежнему лучшие пазлы в мире. Все журналистское брюзжание застревает порталом в горле, когда у тебя перед носом, булькая и извиваясь в прозрачном тоннеле, проплывает синий гель. Да, Portal 2 остается деборианским спектаклем, где все действия аккуратно отделены друг от друга невидимым антрактом.\n\nКроме того, это еще и первая в истории человечества интерактивная комедия. Ни одна другая игра в мире не использует юмор как органичную часть собственного геймплея. Юмор тут — это не просто остроумные диалоги, юмор — это составная часть игры, ее механики, анимации, ее ДНК.\n\nPortal 2 — это, безусловно, разочарование. Но по уровню, мастерству исполнения, вкусу и изобретательности оно стоит иных триумфов.\n\nПлюсы: реиграбельность, классный сюжет, легко освоить, отличный геймплей, великолепные интерфейс, музыка и озвучка.\nМинусы: несмотря на все голливудские ужимки, безупречный юмор и возмужавший геймплей, Portal 2 остался герметичным набором пазлов, театральной научно-фантастической пьесой от первого лица. Но любим мы его от этого ничуть не меньше.\n\nОЦЕНКА: 9/10","timestamp_created":1396896539,"timestamp_updated":1396896662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567968547344207764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9755603","author":{"steamid":"76561198040123580","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1583,"last_played":1448504291},"language":"english","review":"Played Portal 2 from start to finish in single player mode.

Yes, I've played Half-Life 2. No, I didn't enjoy that. 1. Gameplay: The core idea that Portal 2 holds is very simple. Shoot two portals, walk through one, you walk out the other. But as you progress through the game it begins to add many layers to this formula which make it into the complex, semi-difficult puzzle adventure it's known as. 2. Story: While this may be somewhat odd to pick up without having played the first game, Portal 2 is definitely accessible to those new to the franchise's short plot line, and certainly welcomes them. The few characters you meet along the way all have very distinct personalities, and just ooze charm with some of their memorable quotes throughout. The main story line (SPOILER ALERT) is a sort of escape story at the start, just trying to find a way out of the clutches of GladOS, but after being betrayed by Wheatley, the story takes a turn for the more complex, giving inciteful backstory on Aperture Science and GladOS herself, makin this somewhat more entertaining for those who played through the first as well. In the end, it's got a good solid story, and the ending is amazing. Also, finding all the Rattman dens is worth your time if you're not planning to rush the game. 3. Control: The physics and controls in this game are some of the tightest I've seen in a 3D puzzle physics game, and that's absolutely necessary, because without pinpoint precision, you're not going to complete the tests, now are you? 4. Audiovisuals: The soundtrack for this game holds a mysterious feel throughout as ou explore the abandoned halls of Old and New Aperture, and although it never truly holds a forefront position in the game's atmosphere except in a few more intense situations, it holds it's own. The graphics are stellar and make for a nice attention to detail. This looks good for a game from 2011. Overall, Portal 2 is one of Valve's most solid titles and is certainly worth your time, more so than Half Life 2.
