I read the reviews and knew it was a brilliant game and I was truly blown away. \n\nIt's challenging but fair, it has frequent \"checkpoints\"(not in the traditional sense) and you don't have to spend a lot of time walking back if you mess up, which gives you a chance to try again and again till you make it, without being frurstrating. It feels quite rewarding when you manage to go through a tough section of a puzzle. There's no hand-holding(aside from the introductory stages) and you have to use your brain to figure what you should do in each section. It's an impressive feat how in the short length of the game you manage to adjust seamlessly to the requirements of each puzzle and you end up combining the portals  intuitively. I imagine there's some room for creativity too, especially in the tougher levels, it seems like there could be more than one ways to complete some levels depending on your imagination/perception.\n\nThe humor might not appeal to everyone but it's there and it's great. It's subtle, dark at times and it made me laugh out loud on a few occasions. There's also a mysterious undertone and the game will also make you question your actions sometimes.

[/spoiler]\n\nI finished the game in one sitting (when you start playing you'll want to see what's next, it's addictive) in 3.3 hours, so you could say it's a short game but it's absolutely amazing! Actually the game's length can be considered as a positive, it's perfect if you only have a few hours to spare.
