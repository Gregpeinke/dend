O jogo foi lançado em um pacote chamado The Orange Box para PC e Xbox 360 em 9 de outubro de 2007, e para PlayStation3 em 11 de dezembro do mesmo ano. Para a versão para PC a como comprar separadamente via o Steam.[/b]\n\n[b][HISTORIA][/b]\nEm Portal você controla Chell(Pouco se sabe sobre ela), que acorda em uma Cúpula de Relaxamento na Aperture Science uma empresa que é responsável pela criação da Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device (Arma de Portais) . Depois de um momento explorando o lugar Chell é surpreendida por uma voz feminina, essa voz era de GLaDOS(Assistente de Pesquisa e sistema Operacional em Disco Artificialmente Inteligente) que apresenta o lugar a Chell e também apresenta a Arma de Portais, diz que terá que passar por 19 testes, para encorajá-la diz para CHELL que no final do teste 19 ganhará um BOLO... ,  O problema é que com o passar do tempo, Chell percebe a verdadeira intenção de GLaDOS... com informações achadas nas partes finais do jogo e juntado com a intenção de GLaDOS, Chell poderia ter descoberto a causa do possível abandono desse centro de pesquisa que parece estar deserto e o pouco de sua história...\n\n[b][GRÁFICO][/b]\nPortal utiliza o motor gráfico SOURCE, mesmo motor utilizado em TEAM FORTRESS 2, CS GO, HALF LIFE 2...\nEu resumo o gráfico de PORTAL em uma palavra, BALANCEADO. O porque da palavra balanceado, é por causa que em portal tudo é bem feito. Todos os aspectos se igualam, ou seja nem chega ao ponto de ser ÓTIMO e muito menos de ser PÉSSIMO. É maneiro =D.\n\n[b][JOGABILIDADE][/b]\nPrimeira coisa que tenho que citar que é uma coisa ótima na jogabilidade do PORTAL é a física. Os comandos são muito fáceis de pegar. Muitos falam que o jogo é curto, sim é curto, mas por ser um jogo do gênero PUZZLE, a duração vai contar mais de acordo com sua facilidade de resolver os PUZZLEs isso claro se for a primeira vez jogando, agora você rejogando, com certeza vai achar que é curto. Antes de você comprar esse jogo a primeira coisa que você deve ver é se VOCÊ tem PACIÊNCIA, por que vai ter parte no jogo que ele vai ter \"pedir\" Agilidade e PACIÊNCIA, exemplo: Em algumas fases você terá que criar um \"3º portal\" para lhe dar impulso para passar sobre um barreira, esse \"3º Portal\" você terá que criar quando você tiver caindo... Não entendeu ? Jogue, Mas antes tenha em mente que PACIÊNCIA é chave para \"comprar\" e \"jogar\" esse jogo, ele não é um jogo difícil, as vezes a falta de paciência acaba tornando as coisas fácies em difíceis.\n\n[b][ÁUDIO][/b]\nEm questão de fala, os únicos que falam nesse jogo são os Dróides e a GLaDOS. OS efeitos sonoros são bons, Melhor Áudio do jogo, é a voz da GLaDOS.  \n\nFiz um vídeo, que tem uma música que descreve muito sobre o jogo, assista: \nhttp://youtu.be/fCz6kxygs9k\n[b]☑ FINALIZADO---------------------------------------------------------------NOTA: 8.5 [/b]","timestamp_created":1419446137,"timestamp_updated":1454537848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13572625","author":{"steamid":"76561198126345910","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":487,"last_played":1460156712},"language":"spanish","review":"Un gran juego para pasar el rato pide algo logica y de cordinacion pero es buenisimo yo me lo pase en una hora y algo , tiene un jefe final bueno en mi opinion y pruebas algo complicadas pero faciles al practicar mi nota es un 9/10 no le doy 10 por que los niveles son algo cortos y no tiene muchos pero en portal 2 eso cambia .","timestamp_created":1419443961,"timestamp_updated":1419444218,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13572349","author":{"steamid":"76561198134554219","num_games_owned":640,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":126,"last_played":1459284440},"language":"spanish","review":"Increible juego de puzzle y recomendado mucho mas el 2","timestamp_created":1419443012,"timestamp_updated":1419443012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13572209","author":{"steamid":"76561198071866939","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":5003,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":109,"last_played":1643483125},"language":"russian","review":"Ну чтож,эта пространственная головоломка мне довольно понравилась!

She made me cry with laughter at points, too.\n\nAnd, tbh, the entire game is worth it for The Song.","timestamp_created":1419423390,"timestamp_updated":1419423390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13566340","author":{"steamid":"76561198145111259","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1440605196},"language":"russian","review":"гавно","timestamp_created":1419421599,"timestamp_updated":1419421599,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464956432580947876","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13565014","author":{"steamid":"76561198049704611","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1420392087},"language":"english","review":"wow ... first time I play it ... couldn't stop until the credits.","timestamp_created":1419415709,"timestamp_updated":1419415709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13564232","author":{"steamid":"76561198047865084","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1536375042},"language":"english","review":"Really good game I finished it in 3-4 hours the mood is really nice the banal menace of the stages and the articulate variables in completing stages is a nice change from the usual.\nI'd say it is the best puzzle game that I have ever played because it is so cathartic...\nEsoteric metaphysical and complete.\nI like how it could be something that is happening at the same time as Half-Life 2 or Half-Life 1...","timestamp_created":1419411552,"timestamp_updated":1419411552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13563464","author":{"steamid":"76561198046610853","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":137,"last_played":1419397252},"language":"english","review":"Tons of fun and its a great time killer.","timestamp_created":1419407428,"timestamp_updated":1419407428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13562771","author":{"steamid":"76561198155934212","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":91,"playtime_forever":2908,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2908,"last_played":1578411762},"language":"english","review":"Quick and fun portal is a great game with a great sequel.","timestamp_created":1419403584,"timestamp_updated":1590610782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13562743","author":{"steamid":"76561198040805915","num_games_owned":365,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":896,"last_played":1419316445},"language":"english","review":"[b][i]Porta[/b]l[/i] is an absolutely fantastic game. It is an example of what games can be and what games should be, especially puzzle game. [b]The mechanics and feel are entirely unique, and yet comfortably familiar.[/b] The game brilliantly teaches you the mechanics right from the first from, it never moves too quickly or too slowly, constantly providing a wonderful engaging training free of literal tutorials. You are awaken in the testing centers for the ethically-questionable scientific R&D company, Aperture Science. The facility is run by a cynical, dry, sarcastic AI, GLaDOS, whose halarious monologue provides a wonderful direction and build-up for the story. There are plenty of easter eggs and [i]Half Life[/i] references, as well as a healthy set of achievements. If you've finally become bored with the rest of the game, there is also a developer commentary mode included which provides lots of brilliant insight and knowledge about the process of development and principles of game design imployed in [i]Portal[/i].\n\nFor anyone who already loves this game, I recommend some of Valve's other closely related titles such as the many entires in the [i]Half Life[/i] series, and of course [i]Portal 2[/i], the sequel to this game which sports a wonderful co-op mode in addition to its single-player.","timestamp_created":1419403450,"timestamp_updated":1419403598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13562565","author":{"steamid":"76561198090691828","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":1486932193},"language":"english","review":"finished it it was amazing best game ever 10/10","timestamp_created":1419402592,"timestamp_updated":1419402592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13561921","author":{"steamid":"76561198125015644","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":480,"last_played":1422757816},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game in every aspect.
