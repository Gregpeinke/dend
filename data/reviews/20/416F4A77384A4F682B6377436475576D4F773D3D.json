I hope you don't have a pair of rose colored earbuds to go with those rose tinted goggles because if you do then I hate having to be the one to break this to you. The original Team Fortress sucked! Street Fighter 1 anyone? Oh yeah no one has played it either or ever should for that matter. Wow that was harsh. While not as bad as Street Fighter 1 it's hard to say it's worth playing (Especially in 2016) and to be honest I can't even say that I can see what could have made it a good game to begin with. You may say that it's inovative as it was a teamwork focused hero shooter way before Team Fortress 2 made it cool but even if the original did it first it also did it worst. I recall playing this more than a decade ago when it was bundled with Half-Life and a retail version of Counter Strike. Two out of those three games were awesome. Guess which one wasn't? The gunplay is awful, the maps are bad, the balance is nonexistant and the graphics even for it's time are just awful with no appeal what so ever unless you like the color brown and generic Quake wannabes. It has aged terribly and it about as much fun as playing Miscreated or Street Fighter 1.

Если не играли в Team Fortress Classic стоит преобрести, понравится больше чем шляпная версия 2.0.","timestamp_created":1434641125,"timestamp_updated":1434641125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":34,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":"0.649758458137512207","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16499455","author":{"steamid":"76561198085645473","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1380,"last_played":1593476324},"language":"english","review":"get tf2, its better.","timestamp_created":1434639429,"timestamp_updated":1434639429,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447368413209915161","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16497711","author":{"steamid":"76561198129184320","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":658,"last_played":1500203328},"language":"russian","review":"Пизда у меня во рту!","timestamp_created":1434634174,"timestamp_updated":1480080051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479452043771743774","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16487295","author":{"steamid":"76561198038992499","num_games_owned":366,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":41,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37,"last_played":1435921438},"language":"english","review":"It's a $1.24, it's a good game, why haven't you bought it yet?\n","timestamp_created":1434593274,"timestamp_updated":1434593274,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16483985","author":{"steamid":"76561198150136941","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1496554349},"language":"english","review":"tfc what should i say about this game its really a good game\n\n1.even though there aint allot of players but its still fun to play\n2.the classes are easy to get used to\n3.love how in tfc the heavy is called heavy weapons guy \n4.it's very addicting","timestamp_created":1434580957,"timestamp_updated":1476068700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522293031215667725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16479924","author":{"steamid":"76561198143933019","num_games_owned":235,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":9783,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":637,"last_played":1595982574},"language":"english","review":"This game is a very good representation of the original FPS games out there. First, this game was a Quake mod and then developed to it's own game, leaving us Team Fortress Classic. This game has all the thrill of games like Deathmatch Classic, Counter Strike, and Quake. The diversity of the classes is what makes this game the most fun. Instead of having to worry about overpowered weapons, this game is completely equal because everyone has the stock weapons, period. I purchased this game to see what came before the game, Team Fortress 2, in which I play frequently. This game is an all-around classic and is one of the best FPS games i've played, dispite it's age. Pretty much as long as you are into First Person Shooters or games like that, you'll enjoy this one. On the downside, Valve doesn't actually have official servers like they do in Counter Strike: Global Offensive or Team Fortress 2, and are all Third Party Community Servers, but as long as you find a good server, that's all that matters. If you are apprehensive of purchasing this because of the graphics, don't be. It's like that because it's old, and remember that the gameplay makes up for it. I promise you, as long as you keep playing and don't give up you'll like it. It may take you a few hours to get as good as you are at other FPS games, because at the beginning, you're not going to be so hot. One thing for TF2 players, there isn't hats or any way to waste your money. So just remember that one purchase is it. Anyway, as long as you are open minded to trying this game out, you should enjoy this game very much.","timestamp_created":1434570488,"timestamp_updated":1434570488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.634544312953948975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16464509","author":{"steamid":"76561198057849347","num_games_owned":405,"num_reviews":150,"playtime_forever":364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":242,"last_played":1503794394},"language":"english","review":"tf2's better","timestamp_created":1434525365,"timestamp_updated":1434525365,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.29218253493309021","comment_count":15,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16459670","author":{"steamid":"76561198140075327","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":103,"last_played":1659270410},"language":"english","review":"This is actually pretty fun, i just bought it and i really like the game, but i have to drag my mouse and its not as cooperative, like how the cursor is supposed to move when the mouse moves and how its supposed to stop when the mouse stops. but it doesnt.","timestamp_created":1434504597,"timestamp_updated":1434504597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16443253","author":{"steamid":"76561198063230076","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1434460275},"language":"english","review":"I stared at a black screen for five minutes before it completely crashed\n\n11/10 best refund of my life.","timestamp_created":1434460895,"timestamp_updated":1434460895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16428377","author":{"steamid":"76561198207958408","num_games_owned":366,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41,"last_played":1654377299},"language":"brazilian","review":"Eu recomendo se vc gosta de jogos antigos mas agora esse jogo nao esta muito bom pra se jogar","timestamp_created":1434403048,"timestamp_updated":1434403048,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241358757019043","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16413990","author":{"steamid":"76561198040196744","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":181,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1434366120},"language":"english","review":"I get it, it`s made by Valve.

В этой игре много различных классов бойцов и каждый сможет найти класс на свой вкус. Множество оружия, множество разнообразных карт и ураганный игровой процесс  - всё это вы сможете найти в этой игре. Единственный минус - это маленькое количество игроков, но найти сервер с достаточным количеством игроков вполне реально. Я приятно провёл время в этой игрушке. Все кто когда-то пропустил эту игру, могут в любое время посмотреть на настоящий классический шутер от первого лица. Но ради этого покупать отдельно игру не стоит, лучше взять сборник Half-Life: Complete. Так вы сэкономите денег и поиграете в другие интересные игры, входящие в состав данного комплекта.

If you've played Team Fortress 2, some of the maps are the same just with lower graphics and a completely different look.\nValve, you certainly did really well with this game when it first came out.
