К сожалению с каждым годом шутеров с глубоким сюжетом всё меньше и меньше, а подобных вообще - раз, два и обчёлся. Именно сюжет и история здесь главные, а шутерная механика на втором месте. То есть мы имеем дело с оригинальным художественным произведением а не просто с банальным шутаном, механика стрельбы в котором довольно условная. И всё же хорошо, что это именно шутер а не полноценная РПГ, потому что в РПГ истории слишком затянуты, а здесь все события происходят молниеносно. То есть в игре есть всё что нужно, хороший сюжет и весёлый отстрел мобов, и всё это не отнимает недели времени.\nКстати, я сразу поставил русскую озвучку, и плевать, что голоса у актёров не всегда совпадают, всё это ерунда, с озвучкой в любом случае играть комфортнее, а не официальная озвучка к этой игре считается одной из лучших, если не лучшей, благодаря известной косплеерше «лица Элизабет» Анне Молевой, которая её и озвучила.\n","timestamp_created":1579650100,"timestamp_updated":1579650100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562208592891693115","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62204113","author":{"steamid":"76561198379698249","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":917,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":649,"last_played":1619822797},"language":"brazilian","review":"uma das melhores séries de jogos que eu joguei","timestamp_created":1579649547,"timestamp_updated":1579649547,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62202050","author":{"steamid":"76561198107668901","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":12826,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3892,"last_played":1580644614},"language":"latam","review":"* Muy atrapante, la historia es muy original.\n* Los gráficos siguen siendo de calidad, incluso 7 años después de su lanzamiento.\n* La ambientación \"Steampunk\" es de las mejores que ví, cada sector tiene su temática propia.\n* Las armas están bien logradas, cada una tiene su modo de atacar.\n* Los \"vigors\", hasta donde jugué, también son originales y muy útiles en combate, y sirven para acceder a zonas ocultas o restringidas.","timestamp_created":1579645380,"timestamp_updated":1579645380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62201601","author":{"steamid":"76561198267553911","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1908,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":773,"last_played":1600030898},"language":"english","review":"twas fun, trippy af","timestamp_created":1579644563,"timestamp_updated":1579644563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62201212","author":{"steamid":"76561198142607640","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":402,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":402,"last_played":1405954453},"language":"english","review":"I know I didn't play this game for too long, but I seriously couldn't stand it. I believe this is the first steam game I ever purchased, and honestly, I was very excited to play it. The reviews were amazing and everyone I know who had played it loved it. But me... well I really didn't like the majority of it.\n\nFirst I will say, the art and animation is truly outstanding and a pleasure to view. However, even it's greatest attribute segways into my first gripe. Everywhere looks the same. I'm ok with linear games, but this game is TOO linear. All the buildings look the same, all the NPCs look the same, and all the enemies look the same. This is genuinely 50% of the reason I never finished this game, I just got bored with looking at it.\n\nThe second reason is that the combat is numbingly bland. That's really all I have to say about that, it's just very repetative and every time you think it will become more engaging it doesn't.\n\nI will say that this was my first Bioshock game and I am yet to play any other game in the franchise because this one scared me off.\n\n5/10","timestamp_created":1579643858,"timestamp_updated":1579643858,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500819385051727295","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62200802","author":{"steamid":"76561198193997882","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":688,"last_played":1647416002},"language":"english","review":"Best Story ive played so far","timestamp_created":1579643043,"timestamp_updated":1579643043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62197286","author":{"steamid":"76561198051111763","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":691,"last_played":1406563145},"language":"english","review":"A beautiful game with a great story.

Una sola cosa no más quería decirte, me agradó mucho tu juego, en serio, es de lo más sensacional que he visto por el momento, es una obra de arte, sin exagerar, es algo que, a simple vista, podría haber sido hecho por el mismísimo Da Vinci, la genialidad que tiene se puede notar desde kilómetros de distancia, ni siquiera la peor de las malas lenguas podría decir que no nos encontramos ante una majestuosidad vista una sola vez cada mil años. No he visto en todos mis años de vida algo de esta magnitud, te provoca una sensación indescriptible, una alegría inmensa a pesar de no haber hecho acción alguna, un sentimiento raro de encontrar pero fantástico, algo así como lo que se siente una brisa en un caluroso verano, o ver la alegría de un niño al abrir sus regalos de navidad, o simplemente estar con esa persona que tanto queremos. No hagas caso a las malas lenguas que critican sin cesar a cualquiera que no cumpla con absolutamente todas sus expectativas, solo créeme a mi y a todos aquellos seres que consideran y admiran a tan grandiosa obra de arte. Siempre va a haber personas que te van a decir que lo que hiciste no tiene valor, pero el secreto está en ignorarlas, esas personas darían lo que fuera por haber creado algo tan magnífico como lo que estamos viendo. Así como Dios en su infinita sabiduría creo la humanidad, o así como un hombre enamorado crea un poema para expresar sus más profundos sentimientos, o como un pintor crea una obra de arte de algún tiempo que ni siquiera él conoce, así es como fue creado este juego, de la misma forma. Puede parecer que estoy exagerando, repito, pero no es así, ni de cerca, exageraría si dijese que no me encuentro ante una creación admirable, increíble, de una belleza de proporciones bíblicas. De hecho estoy tan encantado con semejante aporte que decidí escribir un poema al respecto, se titula \"mis ojos te lo agradecen\", aquí va: -\"Mis ojos te lo agradecen, ya que han sido acariciados, mis sentimientos te alaban, ya que han sido despertados, mi corazón te idolatra, porque lo has hecho bailar, y mi ser te dice gracias, por tan delicioso manjar, estaré esperando nuevamente, que me compartas tu alegría, aún en medio de la noche, o en el más radiante día, solo sigue creando, creando hasta que las manos pesen, así te diré nuevamente, mis ojos te lo agradecen\"-. Espero que hayas disfrutado mi poema tanto como yo disfruté escribiéndolo, te diría que lo disfrutes como yo disfruté tu juego, pero no creo que haya situación en el mundo que se asemeje a tanta dicha. Para terminar siendo breve, te quería agradecer de corazón, uno en esta vida se encuentra con situaciones que lo ponen de malas, piensa que no va a encontrar nada bueno en estos días y de repente se encuentra con algo así, es difícil decidir donde uno va a dejar sus puntos, y de hecho ya cansa denunciar la mayoría de los juegos que ve, siento que muchos son creados por trolls y personas con ganas de molestar, nada que ver con lo que estamos observando, aquí uno piensa todo lo contrario, simplemente lo ve y se dice a si mismo \"no debe haber lugar en esta tierra, ni en el cielo ni en el inframundo, ni en otros planetas, galaxias o universos, donde sea mejor dejar mis puntos, he encontrado la verdadera Atlantida, aunque no sea un lugar físico, su simple belleza es suficiente para no titubear en hacer dicha comparación\". A veces me pregunto cuanta destreza o cuanta habilidad hace falta tener para poder realizar una creación de esta índole, a veces me comparo con los creadores de hermosuras como esta y pienso que no soy si quiera un simple ser humano, al lado de dichos creadores me siento como una hormiga frente a un imponente elefante, como un peón al lado de una reina, como un niño frente a un super héroe de estas historietas que tanto gustan leer. A veces veo al cielo y pregunto \"¿podré yo crear algo que, al menos, pueda compararse con este juego?\" \"¿podré algún día ser tan genial, tan creativo y talentoso como el creador de esto?\" \"¿que debe hacer uno en esta vida para conseguir tanta genialidad?\" pero por mucho que pregunte y pregunte, jamás consigo respuesta. Sueño a veces que despierto y delante de mí, junto a mi cama, se encuentra un juego como este, pero en mi sueño el juego tiene algo diferente, el creador soy yo. Sí, se que parece una locura, algo tan glorioso como esto no puede ser creado por un simple ser como yo, pero no hay que olvidar que se trata solo de un sueño. Si pudiera pedir un deseo, ese sería que este juego jamás saliera de la home, que las futuras generaciones puedan observar su magnificencia y llenarse de dicha con lo que ven, llenarse de felicidad, de locura, de pasión... Si todos los juegos del mundo fueran como este, no habría guerras, no habría dolor, olvido, tristeza. Levantaríamos la cabeza y entonando un canto al unísono, cual coro de arcángeles diríamos: \"yo creo en el mañana\"","timestamp_created":1579535520,"timestamp_updated":1579535520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560000002384185791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62137686","author":{"steamid":"76561198173722875","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":400,"last_played":1604847610},"language":"french","review":"Très

They are classic games both with fantastic story and graphics. Even in 2020 they stand up to the test of time. I've played through both over the years roughly 7 times...they are that good people.\n\n This game however, it isn't BioShock. This game is as far from the first two as you can get, while just stapling the name onto it. The storyline is mediocre at the best of times, outright shit on average. By around hour 3 I stopped exploring the side areas fully, simply popping in to grab what upgrades there are and moving on. The gameplay also has a lot to be desired. Planning out how to take a Big Daddy down? Nah, rather just bullet sponge your way through it. Big Daddy and little sisters aren't even in this one lol. Carefully deciding to take that plasmid upgrade now, or later when it is slightly less, saving precious ADAM? Nah, instead we have watered down powers swappable at any time with upgrades costing money which is easy enough to farm. Trying to decide which two powers to use for this level? Nah, instead just pick them on the fly killing any strategy needed. Tough part you can't get through? Just run through everything with the shield power up and be invincible with infinite ammo. An ending that felt like they were trying to be inception, with less plot. If you love shooters, give BioShock 1 & 2 a try, they are fantastic.
