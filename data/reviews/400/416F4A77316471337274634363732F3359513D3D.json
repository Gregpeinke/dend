And I must say just like on the PC version, the game is still simply amazing. Instead of giving you the story right then and there. The game builds it up, not a whole lot is known, but eventually the pieces will fall into place in Portal 2.\n\nUnlike the Half Life series where action-adventure mixed with science fiction and horror dominate the games. Portal is famously known for it's puzzles, simple yet challenging puzzles. Some puzzles might be obvious but other times it 'might' be obvious and then GLaDOS pulls a troll on you and you have to think more and more. If you thought rage quitting at Dark Souls was a thing. Try rage quitting at something so simple, a child could beat this game. And yes, there are many players in the past, and present who still get frustrated with some of the puzzles. \n\nThe game offers developer commentary (which I highly recommend). The game also has challenge puzzles and advance test chambers for you to play on. There are easter eggs in this game as well. Not obvious so be aware at all times. Lastly, GLaDOS for an AI entity has never been more amazing than any other AI entity in video game history. Her witty sarcasm attitude towards you in either serious or playful banter makes the game much more enjoyable. \n\nI highly recommend this game to any and all puzzle fans.

Ich persönlich finde den zweiten Teil sogar besser als den ersten, aber das ist Geschmackssache.\n\nNachdem ich Portal 2 jahrelang gespielt hatte und langsam Steam für mich entdeckt hatte, gab es kein langes Zedern und Zaudern und schon fand ich Portal in meinem Warenkorb wieder. Während eines Angebotes muss man da einfach zuschlagen!\nPortal begründet die Portalreihe und revolutioniert im Jahre 2007 das Puzzlegenre. Entwickelt von nur zehn Mann ist Portal ein Meilenstein in der Gamingindustrie und eines meiner Favoriten. Zwar finde ich Portal 2 noch ein Stück besser, da es neue Dinge wie das Gel einwirft und noch mehr über die faszinierende Hintergrundwelt und Geschichte bietet. Portal hingegen ist im Vergleich wohl eher ein nacktes Abenteuer, doch auch ein gelungenes Fressen für Speedrunner aus aller Welt!\n\nSo, genug geredet! Auf gehts zur Pro-Contra-Liste!\n\n[u][b]Pro:[/b][/u]\n\n+ sehr gelungene und witzige Story (Spieldauer für einen Laien ca 10 Stunden, ein Speedrun kann sogar nur 10 Minuten dauern!)\n+ leichtes und verständliches Gameplay\n+ netter Soundtrack\n+ Grafik immer noch sehr ansehnlich gepaart mit sehr guter Performance. Danke Sourcengine! Ich liebe dich einfach! <3\n+ Leichte und schwere Puzzle, die in der Linearität sich steigern.\n+ Eastereggs\n+ GLaDOS\n+ manuelles Speichern\n+ Sollte man versuchen auf einer portalunfähigen Stelle an der Wand ein Portal zu schießen, so wird das Portal irgendwie weggeschleudert. Diesen Effekt findet man leider in Portal 2 nicht mehr.\n\n[u][b]Contra:[/b][/u]\n\n- Der Hintergrund des Menüs und die Schriftzüge im selbigen sind weiß, weshalb ich da manchmal Probleme habe, das von mir gewünschte auszuwählen.\n\n[u][b]Prontra:[/b][/u]\n\n+- Das Menü ist schlecht gealtert. Die Schrift ist sehr dünn und alles wirkt altbacken.\n+- Das \"Lade Daten\" in den Aufzügen zum nächsten Test können manchmal sehr abrupt sein und dementsprechend nerven.\n+- Zoomen mit der Portalgun ist nicht möglich\n\nMeiner Meinung nach stand Portal schon immer im Schatten seines Nachfolgers. Irgendwie schade, doch man muss es Portal 2 einfach anrechnen. Apropos rechnen. Der Normalpreis von 9,99€ ist bei einer Spieldauer von ca. 10 Stunden mehr als aktzeptabel und kann sofort in den Warenkorb!

Я помню как впервые включил эту игру в 2009 году. \nПортал создала команда студентов и с помощью Valve выпустили самую годную игру в этом жанре. А что такого было в этой игре? Во-первых, неплохая графика для 2007 года. Во-вторых, своими персонажами, пусть их тут только 2 это GLaDOS и сама главная героиня, Челл. В-третьих, GLaDOS с её шутками и сарказмом. В-четвёртых, отссылками и пасхалками, например: упоминание о Black Mesa (Чёрная Меса).\nКак я мог забыть упомянуть о главной фишке игры, о порталах . Порталы работают по схеме \"Что быстро влетает то быстро и вылетает\" В игре есть только два портала синий и оранжевый. Порталы можно ставить только на портало пригодных поверхностях. Проще говоря, порталы можно ставить только на белых стенах.\nУ портала на мой взгляд есть лишь 1 минус, продолжительность. 19 камер и битва с GLaDOS. Игра проходится за 2-3 часа максимум. \nОценка игре 9.5/10","timestamp_created":1475163410,"timestamp_updated":1475163410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499362677335739136","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25762093","author":{"steamid":"76561198160611604","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":948,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":266,"last_played":1571841617},"language":"dutch","review":":D","timestamp_created":1475136681,"timestamp_updated":1475136681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25761842","author":{"steamid":"76561198095361058","num_games_owned":516,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":6839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1365,"last_played":1657453131},"language":"german","review":"\"The cake is a Lie!\"   ich glaube jeder kennt diesen Spruch, aber überaschend wenig Leute wissen das er aus dem Spiel Portal kommt.
