The Steam Platform first shipped with these original CD-R disks. If my memory serves me right, there were 10(?) CD-Rs to install HL2, Counter-Strike Source, original HL, original CS, and Day of Defeat. Could be slightly wrong but I know the version I got back then had those games. At the time Half-Life 2 was the most inovative and graphically advanced game to be released. It was the \"Benchmark\" game of the time, and boy, the physics in this game were impressive, too. It also had old Direct X Version Support, so my old Geforce FX 5200 ran it fairly well at Direct X Level 7 mode. Many people don't realize this, but the Source Engine has changed very very little since 2004, Half-Life 2 still looks virtually the same, and Garry's Mod isn't a whole lot different, they just added a whole ton of game modes (something that was non existent in the original Gmod MOD). More importantly, the Story. Believe it or not, at one point in time, the Story was the most important part of a game, and Half-Life 2 was simply brilliant. The story was dark, adventeruous, and super chaotic at times and really kept you glued to the screen and stuck to your chair for hours. Episode 1 and 2 were also very good \"Expansion Packs\", and boasted upgraded graphics with HD-R effects. Half-Life 2: The Lost Coast Demo was one of (if not the very first) to show off HD-R technology! It is now used in virtually every game, in our phones, and cameras! In retrospect, I have owned probably three steam accounts since the early days of steam. I haven't spent a lot of time on it since I opened this account back in 2011, but one of these days i'll have to do a speed run. Highly recommended as this is one of the most legendary PC games of all time!","timestamp_created":1452412795,"timestamp_updated":1452412795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20439999","author":{"steamid":"76561198122522081","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":519,"last_played":1490242178},"language":"english","review":"still a better love story then twilight","timestamp_created":1452405572,"timestamp_updated":1452405572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20438659","author":{"steamid":"76561198022163893","num_games_owned":825,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":262,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1596235397},"language":"english","review":"The standard on which all games should be judged.","timestamp_created":1452399100,"timestamp_updated":1452399100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20436657","author":{"steamid":"76561198119816850","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":297,"last_played":1605729561},"language":"russian","review":"2 из 2!

Помню, мы ходили в компьютерный клуб и там была игра Half-Life Deathmatch, в нее и играли часами. И как-то раз, ради интереса я нажал кнопку одиночная игра. Начал проходить и... И все. Сюжет, геймплей затянули меня на долгие годы.\nСпустя несколько лет мне в руки попал диск Half-Life 2. На моем тогдашнем компьютере она работала плохо, часто вылетала, но все равно, тогда это казалось шедевром! Идеальное продолжение саги о молчаливом бородатом ученом с монтировкой в руках.\nКазалось, в первой части мы победили всех врагов, убили Нихиланта, спасли землю и нашли новых работодателей, но не тут-то было...\nКонечно, в ныненшие времена уже старенькая HL2 не может порадовать ничем новым. Однако тогда это был действительно шедевральный продукт. Был, и, для меня, остается.\n\nЧто же такое халф-лайф 2?\n\n1. Неповторимый сюжет, с примесью эпика, но при этом достаточно классический. Мы снова на коне и снова спасаем человечество, на этот раз от инопланетных захватчиков и переметнувшегося на их сторону бывшего \"коллеги\". Мы решаем головоломки, продвигаемся через дебри врагов, приобретаем новых друзей и находим старых, и все это, как повелось, без единого слова.\n\n2. Ураганный экшн. Когда на тебя прет несколько зомби, HP на исходе а в пистолете заканчиваются патроны, остается взять в руки монтировку и с дикими криками скакать вокруг них, стремясь попасть заостренным концом в темечко. Но вот, через несколько минут ты заходишь в брошенное здание, и натыкаешься там на патроны к давно опустевшему магазину автомата. И тут же, с другой стороны зала врывается несколько комбайнов. Твои действия? С автоматом наперевес метаешься между столами, улами комнат, отстреливаешься и пытаешься выжить, потому что несколько попаданий в неприкрытую бородатую черепушку, и Гордон встретится с создателем ( Гейб?;) ). И вот ты сидишь за столом, заряжая в автомат последние патроны, а врагов еще ой как много и вдруг к твоим ногам падает продолговатый тикающий предмет с красной лампочкой. Граната?! О боже! Мозг за доли секунды решает возникшую задачу, ты хватаешь эту гранату и закидываешь обратно владельцу. Звучит взрыв...\n\n3. Легкие, но довольно интересные головоломки. Враги повержины собственным \"подарком\". Собрав оружие и амуницию, слегка подлечившись аптечкой на стене, ты отправляешься дальше. Но, черт, что же делать? Двери, через которые тебе надо проехать закрыты, рычаг сломан. В первый раз я долго тупил над этой задачей. Пока не увидел, что тяжеленная балка на троссах покоится на плаформе, а под ней - взрывающаяся красная бочка. Выстрел решает проблему и импровизированный таран выбивает тяжелые двери.\n\nИтог: Великолепная игра, пусть морально устаревшая.

Really, really fun game.  This is a fantastic FPS.  I'm sorry I missed it when it first came out.  Way better than the first Half-Life game.   This time they got almost everything right.\n\nPros:\n- Controls are very responsive in this game, unlike the original HL, which makes this a blast to play.\n- Story is simple but compels you to play to try and find out WTFudge is going on.\n- HL had tedious puzzle-lite sections where you had to push crates around to progress to the next part of the game.  I found these boring and annoying.  HL2  also has these simple puzzle aspects, but for some reason they got it right this time.  Hard to explain, but this time around I did not find it tedious or boring.\n-Fun variety of weapons which you do switch around for various reasons.  Not just a 1 gun run.\n-The vehicles were a nice change of pace.\n- The AI on the Combine soldiers is pretty good but not perfect.  Once in a while they would do something stupid, but for the most part they would offer a good fight.  And they are annoyingly good at aiming thier gernades.  8 out of 10 on the Combine AI.\n\nCons:\n- The WTFudge aspect of the story does not go away.  But that may be a Pro because you want more.\n- The AI on the rebels who insist on trying to help you is BAD.  No wonder the aliens are in control!  These humans are so stupid, they deserve to be oppressed.  They were often in the way and got me killed several times because it was difficult to move around them in tight quarters.  And they constantly apologized for being in my way which made them more annoying.  And they had no tactics and no idea of duck and cover.  They are cannon fodder and they play the part well because of the stupid AI.  I will admit, I was amused several times just watching them get creamed.  The annoying thing was, more kept popping up to take the place of the ones that kept getting killed.  3 out 0f 10 on stupid rebel AI.\n-Bugs and Glitches.  Yep, the game has some, at least for me,  None make me want to stop playing, but they can be annoying.  \n---At one point within 48 hours of play time, screen crashed to a black screen, had to reboot PC.  So far this only happened once.\n---Game crashed on 2 other occasions, just had to restart the game. \n---Several times audio has glitched.  The game will freeze for about half a second, then when it starts again, the audio is messed up.  Either there is no audio or now you only get one sound effect, like machinery droning and no other sounds.  This has happened a few times.\n---And the most annoying glitch, getting stuck in the terrain or stuck to moveable objects.  This happened often enough to really annoy me. The worst of this was in a fight with a gunship.  You have to use wrecked cars as cover so you hide behind them.  The gunship shoots at you, hitting the wrecked car, causing it to move slightly.  And because it moved while you were next to it, you are now perma-stuck to it like glue!  frozen in one spot, unable to move.  The gunship swings around to the other side and tears you a new one.  And even if you do not die, you can never unstick your self.  You have to reload the last saved game.  This kept happening over and over for this particular fight so I finally just abandoned that fight and moved on.\n\nBottom Line:  9 out of 10  (no glitches and better rebel AI would have been a perfect 10)\n","timestamp_created":1452232694,"timestamp_updated":1452232694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20390633","author":{"steamid":"76561198150443970","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":8,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1437140118},"language":"english","review":"Its shit","timestamp_created":1452232097,"timestamp_updated":1452232097,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.39911302924156189","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20389436","author":{"steamid":"76561198120670979","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":400,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":86,"last_played":1517496479},"language":"english","review":"great game","timestamp_created":1452225645,"timestamp_updated":1452225645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20389359","author":{"steamid":"76561198069568694","num_games_owned":423,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":979,"last_played":1521261775},"language":"english","review":"Its just a pretty generic fps shooter, i dont see whats so amazing about this game.\n\nalso vehicle controls are awful","timestamp_created":1452225293,"timestamp_updated":1457564870,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.434088051319122314","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20388653","author":{"steamid":"76561198243613498","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":74,"playtime_forever":1551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1035,"last_played":1529796324},"language":"english","review":"Eaty my meaty","timestamp_created":1452221589,"timestamp_updated":1499587420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458043694496154785","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20388510","author":{"steamid":"76561198233000164","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4954,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":733,"last_played":1594765767},"language":"spanish","review":"A pesar de que el juego lleva mas de 10 años en el mercado, sigue siendo una experiencia unica, la narrativa, gameplay y el universo creado por Valve son unicos, 15 de 10, ahora entiendo todo el sufrimiento de miles y posiblemente millones de fanaticos que estan esperando la tercera parte o minimo el tercer episodio de este juego, se los recomiendo artamente.\nPD: Valve deja de darle vueltas al asunto y termina esta y tus otras franquisias, porque si bien hora son los unicos genios que no pueden contar hasta 3, aunque su vida dependiera de ello","timestamp_created":1452220967,"timestamp_updated":1452220967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20387338","author":{"steamid":"76561198117849989","num_games_owned":300,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":1176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1041,"last_played":1489356141},"language":"english","review":"[Update 2] Okay fine I'll admit it. It's a fun game, but I just don't think it deserves the insanelly high praise it's gotten. \n\n[Update 1] I guess I'll give this an actual review as opposed to what I had written previously. So mechanics wise it's nothing we haven't seen currently, but an improvement from the first as the control are a lot more responsive and a hell of a lot less slippery. You'll get a couple weapons, a lot less than the Opposing Forces expansion for HL1, and they handle well. The shotgun comes in handy more than any other weapon as it's one of the most powerful weapons and you'll also find a decent amount of ammo for it. The revolver is more powerful but ammo is scarce so save it for emergencies. \nHealth depletes rather fast since the enemies rarely miss their shot. Finding medkits can be tricky to find so play safe. \nVisually it is still nice, but there is not much to be said about it in my opinion.\nNPC animations can be awkward and wonky, especially during the pseudo cutscenes.\nStory wise it is not as great people led me to believe. My friends kept telling me how HL2 has one of the best stories and I just didn't see that. There was no depth and the way it was told felt lazy. Most of the story is generated by the fanbase, instead of being told by the game and the developers. This is the context of review that was here prrior. \nThe music is kickass. Oh and the puzzles are not at all difficult. \n\nSo all in all I don't hate it, but I just don't like it as much as others. I wish steam had a neutral tab but it doesn't so I went with \"negative\" based off the weak story telling. \n\n[Old Review] \nImagine if I wrote a book that was 130 pages long and it was blank except for the first page and every 30th page. Every thing between must be filled in by the reader. Readers can join together or go solo and bridge the gap between the pages and any interpretation, as long as it brigdes the gaps, is acceptable. Naturally multiple intepretation will arise each with their own justification. I, as the writer, won't accept nor deny any interpretation. Does this seem like a good way to start a series of novels to you? What if J.K Rowling did this; you think the Harry Potter series would have been as successful? I don't think so. In fact I think it's a crappy way to make a book series. So WHY should it be done in games? \nThis is why i dislike the half life series.","timestamp_created":1452215592,"timestamp_updated":1489172568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20385948","author":{"steamid":"76561198075546071","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2922,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2733,"last_played":1640001973},"language":"russian","review":"Экшен (шутер) от первого лица и квест. Большой арсенал пушек, и у каждой свое применение, нет универслаьного оружия, и порою простой ломик оказывается эффективней гранатомета. Хорошая физика объектов. Научная фантастика.\n\nВ игре ждет по-прежнему не раскрытый до конца глубокий, антиутопичный сюжет. Как и в первой части, игра достаточно долгая, хватит на месяц, если хотите все достижения. В начале вас разбудит G-man и отправит на поезде в один из немногих оставшихся городов Сити-17. Вы увидите, что мир захватила некая организация Альянс, всем правят пришельцы, поставившие на Земле в качестве представителя д-ра Бринн из Черной Мезы. Ведется активная пропаганда против размножения людей и призыв подчиниться пришельцам, люди находятся под жестким террором. Вместе с тем, вы находите старых коллег, ученых по Черной Мезе, и того самого полицейского Барни, работающего под прикрытием в Альянсе. Они вместе с повстанцами ведут скрытую войну против Альянса.\n\nУзнав о вашем возвращении, Альянс отправит все свои силы на ваш захват, либо уничтожение. И, как обычно, д-ру Фримену предстоит истребить бесчисленное множество врагов, разрушить кучу высокотехнологичного оборудования и прогнать подальше пришельцев с матушки Земли. На вашей стороне будут ученые, повстанцы и классная дочка вашего коллеги Илая. Вам дадут покататься на шустрых и неубиваемых катере и машине, а также вести с них стрельбу. Вам доверят гравипушку (новое оружие), которая при умелом обращении превратится в эдакий швейцарский нож, которым можно делать, да, практически все.\n\nВ игре теперь, вообщем-то, достойная трехмерная графика и неплохо прорисованные персонажи при отличном показателе FPS даже на не самом мощном компьютере. Глаз радуется. Отличная музыкальное сопровождение (саундтрек доступен в Steam) и голоса персонажей.\n\nНа этот раз игра русифицирована полностью, включая озвучку. Наконец, можно насладиться приятной слуху русской речью персонажей, сюжет становится понятней.\n\nИгра отлично идет на Linux (Linux Mint), вылетов, зависаний и прочих глюков замечено не было. Консоль только почему-то не смог вызвать, но она и не нужна в одиночной игре.\n\nИгру несложно дождаться со скидкой, хотя она своих денег стоит, но учитывая, что есть еще эпизоды и мультиплеер, лучше купить все разом на распродаже. В игре умеренное насилие, порою злишься из-за частых смертей, но вроде все школьники, по-любому, играли, возрастную оценку дать сложно, но можно отталкиваться от слова \"антиутопия\", и если подросток способен его понять, и оно ему нравится, значит, уже пора бы сыграть.","timestamp_created":1452209953,"timestamp_updated":1452558338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20384786","author":{"steamid":"76561198049675486","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1986,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1579,"last_played":1569684563},"language":"english","review":"Plays game and the episodes..\nNow we wait...","timestamp_created":1452205643,"timestamp_updated":1452205643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20384293","author":{"steamid":"76561198200600842","num_games_owned":834,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":1401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":899,"last_played":1645654692},"language":"spanish","review":"LO MEJOR DEL MUNDO","timestamp_created":1452204060,"timestamp_updated":1452204060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20383786","author":{"steamid":"76561198140582419","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":404,"last_played":1599084182},"language":"czech","review":"Nejlepší hra !!!","timestamp_created":1452202419,"timestamp_updated":1452202419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20382373","author":{"steamid":"76561198044148668","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1025,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":856,"last_played":1535637944},"language":"turkish","review":"Güneş parlar; kuşlar uçar;  Half Life kült oyun.","timestamp_created":1452198227,"timestamp_updated":1452198227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20381273","author":{"steamid":"76561198211560564","num_games_owned":465,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":527,"last_played":1587664694},"language":"spanish","review":"Padre de los FPS, obra maestra del género.
