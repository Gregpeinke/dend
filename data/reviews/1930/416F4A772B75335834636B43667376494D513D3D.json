Right up there with elder scrolls. I like Two Worlds  better than oblivion and equal with morrowind. The graphics are a bit dated but not that bad - like xbox 360 era graphics. Its a little slow getting started but you level fast so the talent tree will have you growing more powerful in no time. im level 29 at the moment and there are still areas in the game i will not survive. I think the main story is good and i enjoy the side quests/stories as well. lots of reviews are complaining about the voice acting....its not that bad at all. ive definitely heard worse !   I highly recommend this game i got in in a package deal \" Two Worlds collection\" im glad i played this first before jumping right into the more modern Two Worlds 2. its really a great adventure worth playing. if you like elder scrolls type games you wont want to miss this.\n\n The only thing that had me frustrated at first is the registration.  If you have a PC that has onboard graphics and hgh powered video card it will probably auto run the game to the onboard if its decent ( i have HD 4600 which is impressive for onboard ) anyway when i tried to force my high powered video card to run the game, the game thought i was trying to register the same game code on a different computer and wouldnt allow me to log in. so make sure you force the correct video card to run the game before you register,","timestamp_created":1421107038,"timestamp_updated":1421107038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13958264","author":{"steamid":"76561198082538307","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":275,"last_played":1484840152},"language":"russian","review":"Это одна из моих любимых игр.

Tons of framerate issues, game-breaking bugs, and moreover a very unimpressive intro and beginner newbie area. The game eventually got patched, and I enjoyed it enough to later buy the PC version, and for my friends and I, Two Worlds 1 has become a guilty pleasure. I actually bought this twice on the PC, directly from publisher and later via Steam, so my hours don't reflect all of my accumulated playing time.\n\nI have to stress, though, that you have to weather the horrible beginning of the game. The game cinematic intro is uninspiring, then it drops you into a forest area, eventually giving you a barebones tutorial that doesn't show you the cool features of the game. On top of that, you have to make your way to your first town which sports some of the worst voice acting I've heard heard in a game. Fortunately, the voice acting improves a bit as you get further into the game, however the dialogue is still pretty bad, but you get used to it.\n\nOn your way to the town, you may get mauled by wolves, which travel in packs, which until you learn the agro system of the game, you may die repeatedly.  So often, gamers will just quit at this point, several hours into the game, which is a shame, and I believe why most people didn't give this game a fair shake.  Lots to learn -- how to use the magic system, how to collect ingredients, how to handle night time creatures in the game (you won't be able to kill them initially so run away from them), etc.\n\nI really liked the weapon-combining system which I wish more games would implement.  You can combine similar weapons to upgrade your main weapon, so alleviates inventory issues, just keep combing that generic sword over and over. It also solves the moan-and-groan of finding junk loot, because in this game, you can make an uber weapon out of crappy weapons. Of course, eventually you'll want to combine higher-level weapons, but it's a great way to lessen inventory issues.\n\nI also loved the co-op feature, able to the play the entire game again with a friend. Not sure if you can still do this, though, because I don't remember if it needed access to original Two Worlds servers.\n\nCharacter models may look a bit dated, but the world still looks pretty good, and it has a lot of variety. Lots of side-quest and secrets to explore and enough variety to replay the game with different classes, which is also a strength, Classes aren't set in stone, but you can develop your character however way you want. Some people have issues with the mounting system, getting aggravated with the horse mount, but I found the PC version is far improved over the 360 version.\n\nTwo Worlds 2, the sequel,  is by far, a more polished game, but TW1 sports a larger world, and doesn't have the weapon combining feature. If you can do some reading of the game mechanics, and not give up right away, you may find yourself enjoying this game.","timestamp_created":1419880833,"timestamp_updated":1419996422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500147044658660889","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13686599","author":{"steamid":"76561198120992702","num_games_owned":550,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1420713685},"language":"russian","review":"Очень неплохая игра есть как плюсы так и минусы.

Try Gothic 1, then compare games again... or try Arx Fatalis and come back.\n\nTwo Worlds is a grand effort from a small team to try to make a game they'd want to play. A labor of love, so to speak. It's for that reason why I love the Gothic series (especially the third one).\n\nIn Two Worlds, you don't get the feel and controls of a triple A game franchise. You get handcrafted, homecooked, delicious, awkward experimentation from gamers who love games.\n\nRemember Peter Jackson's first few movies? Would it surprise you to know that the guy who gave us all the Lord of the Rings movies started out just making random, insane films, like \"Dead Alive\" and \"Meet the Feebles\"? Innovation requires risk.\n\nTwo Worlds does things a bit differently and that's what's worth taking notice of. Sure, horse controls are awkward, and your main character says \"Mayhap\" and \"Perchance\" enough times in the first hour to make you want to invent time travel and murder ancient languages... but keep playing.\n\nKeep playing and discover an absolutely massive world with very, very little loading time, and a Morrowind-esque combat system. I dislike the Oblivion comparison because that game was truly real-time and Two Worlds is more die-rolls and random chance based on skill percentages like Morrowind, Dungeons and Dragons, Shadowrun, and... well... 80% of CRPG's that have come out in the last 35 years.\n\nIn summation:\nVoice acting: Bad to the point of comedic.\nCombat: Die rolls... not Oblivion.\nWorld: HOLY COW this thing is huge.\nGameplay: Enough variation to keep me coming back.\nHorses: Not as good as Mount & Blade, but better than Ride to Hell Retribution.\nReplayability: Mayhap I should complete it once before I judge this.\n\nTwo World's Epic Edition is of such quality that I can only compare it to Seth Rogen's \"The Interview\": A lot of people said a lot of things about it, but when I finally saw it for myself, I realized that people don't really know anything and I should just judge things for myself.

The skill system makes sense and I honestly have no problem with it, it has a sense of progression. For instance you have to be a certain level before you can put more points into a skill. This way you don't find yourself leveling one skill the entire time. I also like the fact that there is reputation with the factions in the game. It runs on a scale of 1-10, 1 being not important and 10 being very important. The more quests you do for a faction the more rep you gain.

Not sure of how much sense that makes but both my friend and I have noticed it; patience is necessary.\n\nDespite all that, I feel this game does not deserve the terrible reviews it has garnered; perhaps I'm a dope for being satisfied with it, perhaps others expected too much of it. \n\nThis game is reminiscent of the Souls games + Oblivion; the gear and progression is apparently like in the Souls games (so says my buddy, I've not played them much) - the environments are straight out of Tamriel. \n\nThere is a bare minimum of hand-holding; every time I play the game, I learn something new. If the combat/connection was tweaked a little tighter, I would no doubt be playing the game constant. There is a sequel though, and it is seriously mind-blowing how much better it is (though some of the tweaks are for the worse).\n\nYou can combine gear of the same type to strengthen it; you can learn any skill you want to - can respec your character - though it might just be better to pay the 500 gold (not so steep after a few levels) to make a new one. ALSO, BE SURE, after your first character, TO GO BUY EVERY SKILL YOU WANT WHEN YOUR NEW CHARACTER IS LEVEL 0 - each skill costs 100 gold from the beginning, but after a few levels, it goes from 1,000 to 10,000... so yeah.\n\nFor what it is, and the discounted price of $1 - if you have great patience and the ability to find fun in a game's faults (none quite so game-breaking, have crashed only once, because of Steam, not the game), Two Worlds is worth consideration.\n\nShould you get it, addressing your choice of Class:\nRecall what I said about melee, if you want to be a Knight/Barbarian - be patient and bear in mind it is an old game (if nothing else, go to single player, I had zero issues in the short time I tried it);

So, say you take out a tower, and like every other guy had the same weapon. You can then take all the weapons and combine them together and get a weapon that may just be better than what you're using.
