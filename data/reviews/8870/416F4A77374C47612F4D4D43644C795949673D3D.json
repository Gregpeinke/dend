As the story/game progresses things change dramatically, throwing in plenty of combat and spicing up the story perfectly.\n\nAfter ruthlessly slaughtering countless numbers of enemies I found the combat got a bit dull, and in a way a bit easy after getting most of the upgrades and new weapons/vigors. The enemies are also a bit on the bland side, since most of them are just a darkish colour and little detail on the uniforms I found my self killing what I thought was the same person over and over again, this was especially prevalent towards the end of the game.\n\nThe combat incorperates a lot of 'fantasy' into it, with things like Vigors and more modern guns with a little less realism and less punch. The physics of the weapons felt great too, they were not way too unrealistic but they weren't too reaslistic either, which provided a nice blend making those heads look as bigger target as always. If I were to have 1 major complaint about the guns it would be how underpowered some guns can be towards the end of the game, where I ran out of ammo for  my sniper and had only a pistol as a replacement. The pistol been my main weapon at the beginning of the game and could take down enemies in what felt like 1 blow, but the pistol had no such effect when taking down the same enemies later on, making one have to completely spray all their ammo at the opponents head to actually take them down.\n\nAt the end of the story things get very weird and confusing but when the game ends, most previous events in the game begin to come together, but some do not leading to a lot of confusion and possibly sequels (?). The end left me wanting to play again, so that I can find all those little events that link to the main plot and then giggle, thinking about \"how could I have not noticed this before?\"\n\nThis game is one of a small ammount of games that have left me happy and satisfied at the end, and I can definately see myself playing it again sometime in the future. To get a game this great for only $10 was itself amazing. I have seen games that cost a lot more and has been realeased a lot earlier, that are absolutely terrible. \n\nOverall I believe Bioshock Infinite to be well worth the time and money, and that Irration games & 2K have done an exellent job, creating what is probably, a masterpiece. \nI would definately recommend getting this game, and I guarantee (A guarantee? Who has time for all that paperwork?)  you will have fun! \n I give it a 10/10","timestamp_created":1391774375,"timestamp_updated":1391774375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578313291072845459","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9004334","author":{"steamid":"76561198033828058","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":535,"last_played":1479246218},"language":"english","review":"Utterly confused in the first 10-20 minutes of this game.

Sadly, the game falls flat on his face in every other category. The two-weapon limit is beyond retarded for this kind of game and renders the upgrade system almost completely useless. Most vigors are useless as well, and many enemies are just horrible bullet sponges if you play on Hard. The worst offender is the story. It starts out promising, and then the themes like American Exceptionalism and Mainfest Destiny are completely discarded for a hackneyed time-travel-plot that doesn't make a lick of sense no matter how you look at it and tries to fool the player into thinking that it's deep. Also, the game has to have the worst ending since Mass Effect 3.

Si esperas encontrar la dificultad de los anteriores Bioshock ya puedes ir buscándote otro juego: Es fácil. Y eso si lo juegas en difícultad difícil. Puedes desbloquear modos de dificultad más para \"hombres\" una vez finalizas el juego, pero Infinite tiene la característica de que no te apetece repetirlo al menos hasta pasado un tiempo.\n\nEl juego incorpora enemigos predecibles y algo escasos de inteligencia colectiva, que se repiten hasta la saciedad incluso en bandos distintos que son los mismos soldados pero de otro color y con algo de mal gusto para elegir su catálogo de armas, las cuales, si bien son variadas, están tan desequilibradas que siempre irás con las mismas. Y no te preocupes que no te quedarás sin munición en ningún momento, hay máquinas expendedoras en todas partes. ¿Qué estás en un globo? Máquina expendedora. ¿Bajo tierra? Máquina expendedora. ¿En el lavabo? máquina expendedora. Y si ves que no hay máquina expendedora no te preocupes, hay mujer expendedora. Porque ahora ya no vas solo, una agraciada e inmortal muchacha te acompaña a todos lados equipada con el bolsillo de Doraemon, pues cada medio minuto oirás un \"DeWitt, catch!\" et voilá, tendremos un montón de balas, monedas, salud etc... de nuevo. Hasta el Big Daddy del DLC es un mal chiste comparado con los del Bioshock original. Se comenta por el pinganillo que si lo pones en dificultad normal y te matan viene un técnico de Steam y te borra la cuenta para que no te acerques más a un videojuego.\n\nLo positivo del juego es que aporta una historia bastante interesante y bien planteada, con pocos fallos y muy absorbente que termina en un final simplemente apoteósico. De los mejores finales de videojuego que puedes encontrarte hoy en día. Por desgracia la disfrutarás poco pues el juego dura aproximadamente cuatro horas sin morir, es decir, en nivel difícil. En detalles menores destacar un apartado gráfico impecable y vistoso, buenas físicas y buen apartado sonoro, que hacen que el juego entre por los ojos y te olvides temporalmente de esa maravilla de I.A.\n\nEn resumen: Buen juego y buena vuelta de tuerca a la saga de Bioshock, ahora apta para jugadores menos amantes de los juegos duros, si bien podrían haber hecho algo más con esa I.A. tan nefasta. Si te gustan los Bioshock o los Shooter en general y piensas que una grandiosa historia puede camuflar una dificultad para novatos, no dudes en adquirirlo.\nNota: 8,5/10.","timestamp_created":1391699421,"timestamp_updated":1391699554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8994722","author":{"steamid":"76561198068227610","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":648,"last_played":1437663381},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра,много магий,очень интересный гемплэй,советую поиграть всем.","timestamp_created":1391695361,"timestamp_updated":1391695361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8993959","author":{"steamid":"76561197971379878","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1067,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":951,"last_played":1601915165},"language":"english","review":"Ah what an ending!

First of you are in a story unrelated to the other bioshocks so don't worry if you didn't play these in this story you are sent to Columbia a floating city in the sky to find a girl to repay a dept. You find the girl and she becomes your AI companion but don't worry she cant be harmed and follows you without your doing anything she also finds health, ammo, and money which she gives you when you need it. Now i'm going to stop talking about the story because its super complicated and the ending doesnt really makes sense to me so lets talk game play. You of course have a good variety of guns machine guns grenade launchers and different versions of all of them the one downside is you can only carry two of them unlike previous bioshock where you carried all your guns and had three ammo types for each. You also have powers known as vigors which there are 8 of ranging from shooting lighting, fire and crows to absorbing enemy shots and turning enemies friendly. All the shooting and powers plays well and feels good all the powers feel useful and are handy for different situations. The two other things at your disposal in combat are you sky hook which lets you jump onto railings and zip around making you harder to hit and getting places much faster, and your companions power to materialize random preset objects such as turrets and cover. all these elements make the combat feel fun and fast pace but crusty what about the enemies well they are mostly just guys with guns there are some melee based ones and robots ong with a teleporty guy and the game has a few enemies that are only in brief parts of the game which i thought was gay i think they should have somehow made different combos of all the types to make situations more challenging but they didn't so whatever. Now bioshock also has upgrades and equipment. The upgrades are lame and you simply purchase them with money which you scavenge from the world and you have to buy every guns upgrade individually which is retarded like say you upgrade the machine gun but run out of ammo and switch it for one of the other four assault rifles they will be shit because they still need upgrades and you dont earn nearly enough money in the game to even come close to fully upgrading everything. The game is rather linear i mean you can explore to a degree like if your in a building you can check every room but if your for supplies but that's about all it adds to. The game also isn't that challenging except for some key parts, you will never need to purchase health or salts for your powers because there are a million items scattered in the world that refill them. The one thing i will say i really liked was the game has a lot of moments that you can just walk around and not worry about getting shot its a much more calm game then the previous bioshcok that was more dark and always had you being careful with you resources which i liked but at least this game isn't just a replica it is different and that's a good thing. Overall the game is fun and the story is enjoyable with some interesting characters, the combat is smooth and the enemies arnt stupid just not as tough as you might want, It looks nice and is a decent length all things considered and if you can get past the very questionable endings its a great experience and defiantly the best game to come out so far this year, right i'm talking about you dead space and gears you shits.","timestamp_created":1391659585,"timestamp_updated":1391659585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8991136","author":{"steamid":"76561197989957692","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":666,"last_played":1365490800},"language":"english","review":"One of the best FPS game of this generation.

There are many ways to play this game, and if you utilize all the features properly you'll find yourself ripping through enemies, with combat still being challenging and intense. Combat is extremely gratifying, and hardly ever feels forced or repetitive. Level design and  atmosphere of this game provides a beautiful and immersive environment that both keeps you on edge, and encourages you to sight-see. \n\nThe story of this game is a masterpiece. This game's characters seem to be real people. They are very believable, and are remarkable at creating emotional attachment. Voice acting and dialog is executed perfectly in this game. The plot is very interesting and complex, leaving you excited to find out what comes next in your character's journey, and how it will play out for your companion. This games conclusion is unexpected, and satisfying, while leaving you trying to comprehend everything surrounding it. Replaying it will reveal many unnoticed or overlooked details of the plot as well.\n\nAs of now I would call this game the best I've ever played.

Thanks for pointing out the obvious guys. This game is nothing like the first 2 at all really. It's an entirely new beast altogether. Evidence: 1 & 2 are set in a dreary, enclosed, underwater dystopia whereas Infinite is set in the sky, in what is (initially) a happy \"American dream\". Things really don't get more opposite than that.\n\nThe differences don't end there though. Plasmids (or Vigors as they're called here) return, but are generally different to their Rapture counterparts. Guns too hae recieved an overhaul, though not always for the better. Whereas in Rapture you fought with cobbled together harpoon guns and tin-can grenade launchers, here you have access to accurate, reliable (though fairly generic) military grade guns... 1910-20's era generally, but still actualy manufactured guns. You can only carry two though, which is a bit of a letdown.\n\nAlso different is the general style of game. Where 1 and 2 were a blend of action, survival and horror, this game focuses on the action primarily. This new emphasis has, in my opinion, massively improved the combat, though I find it a bit more... generic than the others, It's smoother, but it's changed from quirkily poor to just average. The exception is the Sky-line system, which is a real game changer and a lot of fun to use.\n------------\n\nThe game also boasts some of the best characterisation I've ever seen in a video game. Elizabeth. the other main character. is one of the best female characters i've personally seen, and pretty useful too. Booker also is well developed and likeable (or iritable) enough to keep me interested. Other characters fall short of this, but they only play a minor part in the story and are fleshed out through the traditional audio-diaries.\n\nThe story itself is very, very bold. I personally think it's brilliant, as it actually forces the player to think about things, which may happen later or already have. At the end looking back I realised just how much my mind had been blown away by the whole experiance. All i'll asy about it hear though, is that it's complex. and don't hurt your brain thinking about it too hard at the end.\n--------------------\n\nOverall, this has been one of if not my favourite game that has come out in the past 3 or so years. However, if you're looking for another Bioshock 1/2, or only care about the gameplay and combat, then you won't enjoy this. For most people though, I reckon you're gonna love it.\n","timestamp_created":1391546361,"timestamp_updated":1391546361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8976479","author":{"steamid":"76561198010864973","num_games_owned":769,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":88,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":88,"last_played":1387588708},"language":"english","review":"An amazing twist in story telling like never done before!\n\n...except for almost everything involving time travel...","timestamp_created":1391544102,"timestamp_updated":1494575865,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8976384","author":{"steamid":"76561198037808776","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":820,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":623,"last_played":1396029178},"language":"german","review":"Beste Story die ich je in einem Spiel sah.","timestamp_created":1391543557,"timestamp_updated":1391543557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8976264","author":{"steamid":"76561198048175095","num_games_owned":343,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3267,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":854,"last_played":1606586673},"language":"spanish","review":"Otro juego con una idea 100% original, y otra gran juego de la saga bioshock.

Asimismo su ambientacion sonora se compone de piezas que van desde finales del siglo XIX hasta bien entrados en la mitad del siglo XX, piezas que encajan con la estetica del juego de una forma muy natural.\nEl diseño de personajes es muy bueno si hablamos de los protagonistas o de personajes clave siendo Elizabeth la que mejor diseño lleva y en la que se nota hubo mas tiempo invertido; mas sin embargo los personajes genericos que encontramos a lo largo del juego tienen diseños faciales muy repetidos lo cual rompe un poco la 'ilusion de inmersión' que se genera con los otros puntos antes mencionados.\nEn cuanto a la historia, simplemente sublime, todo al principio puede parecer confuso pero a medida que vamos avanzando las piezas comienzan a encajar... y de una forma en la que no nos lo esperariamos, uno de los mejores usos de la mecanica cuantica como base de la trama de un juego, mas exactamente de los viajes en el tiempo, las paradojas, los multiversos y la teoria de cuerdas; aun asi se ven cosas como la lucha de clases, la sublevacion de los oprimidos, el fanatismo religioso entre otros temas que aparentan ser el eje del juego pero en realidad no lo son del todo(no digo mas para no spoilear) y el final, definitivamente pone a pensar y da para multiples interpretaciones...a gusto del consumidor :D .\nEl sistema de juego si bien es sencillo nos presta el uso de los vigorizadores para realizar diferentes combinaciones que nos brinden alguna ventaja, pudo se algo mejor pero de por si es muy bueno.\nLa IA te embosca, se cubren y trata de ponertelo no tan facil pero a veces solo corren hacia ti para que los mates XD, definitivamente esta pudo ser mejor. Por otro lado la IA de Elizabeth si que esta muy bien trabajada y en ningun momento ella supone una carga, todo lo contrario, de hecho es un personaje que genera bastante empatia.\n\nA mi me dio para 17 horas en la primera partida jugandolo en dificil y con un control de ps2 (para que me durara mas el juego jajaja) recorriendolo lentamente, explorando (hay muchos voxafonos a lo largo del juego que basicamente son grabaciones que desvelan mas detalles de la historia) y contemplando el paisaje.

The stage is set for another adventure through the grim, but surprisingly sunny, world of Bioshock. [/b]\n\nThe original [i]Bioshock[/i] is a landmark in immersive videogame narrative and incredible design. It combined wonderfully designed aestethics with cool gameplay elements and a nice story to boot. For those who were truly interested there was plenty of room to explore and learn more of the fallen city of Rapture. [i]Infinite[/i] then had a lot to live up to.\n\n[i]Infinite[/i] takes you to the flying city of Columbia, a seceded state from early America that left the blasphemous world below behind to ascend to a plane closer to god. You're former private eye with a checkered past who is hired to retrieve a girl from this flying utopia. How hard can it be?\n\nPlenty hard. As it turns out, you're expected, and they're not happy. [i]Inifite[/i] has you duke it out in the streets of Columbia while listening to the zealous chants of radical prophets and out of control rebels. The atmosphere is piled on at every turn and the game spares no expense to show you new and crazier things than you held possible. It is an exercise in world building of the highest order that adresses social, racial and religious themes to make you, the player, contemplate your actions and you make your way through the game. \n\nHowever, for all the grandeur and splendor found in its presentation, the execution leaves something to be desired. Do not misunderstand, the story unfolds perfectly and you're still given room to explore. The problem is in the gameplay. [i]Infinite[/i] borrows much of its combat from the original [i]Bioshock[/i], but trims away a lot of the fat and only leaves a bare bones set of options. Most battles revolve around bullet pumping and a bit of power flailing, while the combat systems in [i]Bioshock 2[/i] introduced so many cool things. This is [i]Infinite's[/i] main problem. After a few hours, the sun doesn't shine so bright anymore while you stride into another gunfight. \n\nLuckily, [i]Infinite[/i] spares no expense to keep the pace up so you can make your way through the story at a proper pace. This makes it a game to be enjoyed for its content, while it skimps a bit on the gameplay. That said, if you fancy yourself a masochist, feel free to dive into the 1999 mode. A super hard mode that leaves you reeling if you don't prepare. That'll keep you occupied for a while. Still, [i]Bioshock Infinite[/i] is an experience you will need to try at least once.","timestamp_created":1391452943,"timestamp_updated":1391453008,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593810439109802246","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8964838","author":{"steamid":"76561197999473801","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2147,"last_played":1403029754},"language":"finnish","review":"Pelaamisen arvoinen yksinpeli joka tarjoaa viihdyttävän katsauksen erillaiseen historiaan, missä rotuerottelu ja vanhurskaus on arkipäivää.
