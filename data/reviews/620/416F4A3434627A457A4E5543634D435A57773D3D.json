It's simple concept of going from one place to another is most definately expanded on from level 1 to the end. It may not stay easy necessarily, but every level feels like it either adds a new concept and expands on it. Another wonderful thing is that when you finish everything (Or not! It is always unlocked!) you can go to the community test chambers and see what players just like you and me have made, or even make one yourself!","timestamp_created":1467250284,"timestamp_updated":1479990267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23940635","author":{"steamid":"76561198156349535","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":415,"last_played":1499869821},"language":"schinese","review":"Portal2一款旋转跳跃闭眼的闪现游戏","timestamp_created":1467246587,"timestamp_updated":1475288867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23940584","author":{"steamid":"76561198112312318","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":537,"last_played":1514591940},"language":"english","review":"This game is addictive and challenging!

This is a must have![/h1]\n\n\n[h1]Game Mechanics[/h1]\nThe game mechanics of Portal 1 were already amazing, but in Portal 2 they are even better. Adding the gels adds a whole new element to the game. The way the portals work and the momentum works feels much nicer compared to the first game. The controls are tight and all can be changed.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThis game by no means looks realistic. It is a stylized game and it looks beautiful. This is in the same realm as Mirrors Edge or Wind Waker where it is going to be a beautiful game for a long time.\n\n[h1]Optimization[/h1]\nI feel like all I have to say is, it's a Valve game. It uses the amazingly optimized Source engine. On my super budget Radeon HD 7750, I could run this game at 1080p 60fps at max settings. My friend could run this game and the same settings on an HP Pavilion with an APU. If you have a computer from the mid to late 2000s or any sort of APU, Intel HD graphics, or graphics card, you should be able to play this game no problem.\n\n[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]\nCompared to the first one, Portal 2 focuses more on the comedy and story progression as opposed to the puzzles and difficulty. Don't get me wrong, the puzzles are still great, but they aren't as fleshed out or difficult as the first one. The story is very well made and kept me interested with only a few plot holes. You get to explore old Aperture and the beautiful run down facility. The voice acting couldn't be better and the entire story sticks with the lore set in the first game.\n\n[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]\nThe multiplayer is completely optional but I still highly recommend it. It has a loose story that I have never really followed, but the tests and puzzles are very fun, difficult, and well made for two people. It has so much replay ability due to the steam workshop support where people can post both singleplayer and multiplayer maps. This is a great way to have fun and get mad at your friends for not doing something right. [b]I would definitely recommend playing with somebody that you know and not just random people online. It is a much better experience with friends.[/b]\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, yes, 100 times YES! Anyone who doesn't have Portal 2, needs Portal 2.","timestamp_created":1467232699,"timestamp_updated":1475633967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23935822","author":{"steamid":"76561198185394282","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1096,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":92,"last_played":1606539676},"language":"english","review":"it goodest game my brain was small\n","timestamp_created":1467232671,"timestamp_updated":1605084568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.275402635335922241","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23935821","author":{"steamid":"76561198071446178","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":788,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":761,"last_played":1452012231},"language":"english","review":"Great game..
