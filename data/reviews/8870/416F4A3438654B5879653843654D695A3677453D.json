Pra mandar a real é minha segunda série favorita de joguinhos.\nTenho de assumir que a primeira vez que vi os vídeos do Infinite eu estranhei.\nO clima mais \"superficialmente\" alegre me deixava um pouco desgostoso pra ser honesto. \n\nErro bobíssimo de minha parte. \n2020 ta ai e finalmente joguei esta belezura.\nDe início: Eu nunca na minha vida peguei um vínculo emocional tão forte a personagens de jogos quanto com o Booker e a Elizabeth. \n\nÉ em um dos pontos que mais me fez gostar deste jogo. Ser acompanhado da garota pela jogatina é uma das coisas mais satisfatórias que já joguei. Me emocionei, chorei, fiquei extremamente irritado. Eu não consigo pensar em um relacionamento que me marcou tanto e que me sinto TÃO ÓRFÃO ao terminar quanto o do Infinite. \n\nA jogabilidade eu achei bem mais satisfatória que dos anteriores, apesar que o role dos trilhos eu acho um porre. \nPorém, mais uma vez remeto ao fato da Elizabeth acrescentar EM MUITO. Não apenas pela ajuda, mas a companhia em meio ao caos é esplendida.\n\nQuanto a história em si. Prefiro o primeiro ainda, o plot do Andrew Ryan é um dos meus arcos narrativos favoritos de todos os tempos. \nPorém depois de digerir o final do Infinite eu até que gosto dele. Algumas coisas sobre universos são meio de engolir apenas.\nAinda em tempo: Pior parte de todos os bioshock's é aquela da Lady constock... MEUAMIGO.\n\nNo final das contas, Infinite entra na vibe de uns dos meus jogos favoritos. Mesmo com o final um pouquinho desgostoso.\n\nBooker e Elizabeth, eu amo vocês.","timestamp_created":1578884572,"timestamp_updated":1578884572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61778188","author":{"steamid":"76561198370107017","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":955,"last_played":1579006505},"language":"english","review":"This is my first Bioshock game I played and I quite like it.

Rather than the Art-Deco/Diesel Punk aesthetic from the first two games, Infinite has a Steam Punk aesthetic with the Edwardian-Era fashion and architecture. The levels are more linear than the previous games that works for what the game is, an action-adventure game rather than an immersive sim. The music as usual is fantastic that fits in the setting, but like BioShock 2, the louder music during combat is very common, that could be tiring after a while. There are quiet moments and parts with no combat between story moments and parts in between combat, but there are still more combat overall, more so than BioShock 2.\n \nThe gunplay on it's own improved upon the previous games alongside the improved sound design for each game improves upon for each weapon. The vigors also works similar to BioShock 2 by allowing you to use both your firearm and powers at the same time. Unlike Plasmids, vigors has a secondary fire mode that allows you to shield yourself or lay out traps, depending on the vigor. As for the mechanics around the gunplay, it's honestly a downgrade, the lack of ammo types removed the counter to bullet sponge enemies. The Vox sandbox also felt unneeded, I felt these weapons would be better suited as alternate firing modes or different ammo types. Overall, the gunplay is very fun while playing around the vigors, despite the downgrade to the mechanics surrounding the gunplay.\n\nThe other mechanics like hacking is removed and somewhat replaced with the possession vigor. However, this mechanic somewhat returns in the form of lockpicking in Burial at Sea Episode 2. There are other changes like the Halo two weapon limit, which never bothered me personally, but I do understand why this change is frustrating and limits others. \n\nThe game were streamlined overall to the previous games. I can understand why others were disappointed, as I felt a similar thing with Fallout 4 based on being a fan of the Fallout series for years. As I had no bias to any of the BioShock games and never played any of them prior to 2019, the changes in Infinite doesn't bother me as much, but I do understand why these changes are very frustrating to others.\n\nAs for the story, I personally enjoyed it. The characters are mostly memorable, I loved the foreshadowing after replaying the game, I loved seeing how the city collapses throughout the game and the story between Booker and Elizabeth is the strongest part. However, I do have some issues with the pacing during the middle act, the Vox are very underdeveloped and the story is too ambitious in places. \n\nEnemies are mostly fun to fight like the previous games. Infinite introduces some great enemies like the Firemen, Zealots and Patriots who has their strengths and weaknesses. There are only two enemies I disliked, the Handymen you fight 4 times and the Siren you fight three times. I'll leave it up to you to decide.\n\nIn conclusion, Infinite is a game I loved while being open about it's flaws with the gameplay itself and parts of the story, I also typed this earlier, but the review never saved.","timestamp_created":1578871100,"timestamp_updated":1578871100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.638084650039672852","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61768539","author":{"steamid":"76561198798551165","num_games_owned":397,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":1143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":857,"last_played":1586559482},"language":"brazilian","review":"","timestamp_created":1578866299,"timestamp_updated":1578866299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61766483","author":{"steamid":"76561199010404507","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1365,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":892,"last_played":1598323125},"language":"spanish","review":"LA BELLEZA QUE SE EXTRAÑA\n\nSi echas de menos que un título tenga una historia que conmueva cómo las de hace años, todos los títulos de Bioshock son los indicados.

It's full of twists and turns, interesting and likeable characters and with enough mystery to keep you wanting more until the very end, which wraps everything up and leaves no loose ends. The gameplay is great too, with fast-paced action and more movement options than in most FPS games. The voice acting is good, it's visually appealing, and everything just falls into place. Except for one thing:\nReplayability. \nOnce you're done with the story, that's kind of about it. Sure, the gameplay is still fun, and there are DLC's you can get to expand the experience, but once you've finished Burial at Sea and gotten all the collectibles in Clash in the Clouds (Which is relatively easy), there's not much left to do unless you're going for a 100% achievement run or aiming for top of the leaderboards in Clash in the Clouds.\nOverall, is Bioshock: Infinite worth $40.00? Depends what you're looking for. If you're looking for a rich, storytelling experience with some fun and engaging gameplay thrown in, absolutely. If you're looking for a game you can keep coming back to blow some bad guys away, somewhat less so. Maybe when it's on sale, but otherwise, probably not. Overall though, I would definitely recommend this game. It's a hell of an experience, for the first playthrough at least.","timestamp_created":1578782868,"timestamp_updated":1578782868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61708756","author":{"steamid":"76561198314865928","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":2111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1817,"last_played":1606656319},"language":"english","review":"bioshock infinite is what a bioshock game is but in za sky!!\nhere comes that cons and pros stuff!!\nPros:\nthe story\nthe characters\nplot\nmusic\nthe sky theme\ngameplay\n\ncons:\ngameplay\nthat u cant unquip the golden guns in the menu (so i played on hard mode lol that was fun)\n\n\nimo the second out of all but sadly not what the trailer promised but still fun as frick. this game gets a 8/10 from me !!","timestamp_created":1578780780,"timestamp_updated":1657939152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61707862","author":{"steamid":"76561198054086924","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":3680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2562,"last_played":1610301107},"language":"english","review":"Booker: Elizabeth, can you make a review on this game?\n\nElizabeth: I can do that.\n\n10/10\n\nElizabeth: Done.\n","timestamp_created":1578779538,"timestamp_updated":1578779538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61706088","author":{"steamid":"76561198008747500","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":797,"last_played":1615736539},"language":"english","review":"Gameplay, story and style.

Сюжет начинается немного вяло, но чем дальше, чем больше деталей раскрываешь, тем становится интереснее. За всю жизнь, я прошёл множество игр, самые разные жанры, вселенные, но сюжет этой игры смог меня удивить, смог задержать, сложно было оторваться. А ведь, чем взрослее становишься, тем сложнее задерживаться в играх, сюжеты слабо цепляют, геймплей надоедает за час игры и всё это очень быстро начинает утомлять. А тут, такое, что на утомление нет совсем времени, ты бежишь в след за героями, за их путешествием, не замечая игровой рутины, именно сюжет + детали держат твоё воображение в поисках новых крупиц, это информативный голод. Весь мир игры продуман до мельчайших деталей, учитывая, что он еще связан с предыдущими играми, честь и хвала авторам. А Элизабет, это самый лучший, самый живой и отличный напарник, под ногами не путается, не тупит, смотреть на неё, слушать, любо-дорого. После прохождения, даже скучаешь по ней.  \n\nЭту игру я купил давно, также давно начинал играть, но на старте забросил. Но вот пришло время этой игры, её бенефис, её 15 минут славы. Я сел и за пару вечеров прошёл на одном дыхании. Как писал ранее, меня сложно удивить шаблонными поворотами сюжета, игры становятся всё более предсказуемыми, как и кинематограф, всё сложнее отыскать именно то, что заставит вас сказать в конце \"ВАУ\". Когда вам захочется стереть себе память, чтобы вновь вкусить этот шедевральный плод талантливых авторов. Аплодисменты создателям этого чуда! Фантастический ретро утопический шедевр! Если вы не играли, то настоятельно рекомендую. Также прошёл два ДЛС, ну что сказать, всё также прекрасно. Жалко, что Irrational Games закрыли, нынче не хватает, таких креативных игр как Биошок...\n\n10 из 10.","timestamp_created":1578764119,"timestamp_updated":1581999491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.655412793159484863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61694826","author":{"steamid":"76561198014587370","num_games_owned":409,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":668,"last_played":1580576372},"language":"russian","review":"Халф-Лайф сосёт!","timestamp_created":1578763821,"timestamp_updated":1578763821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477848082780838013","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61694802","author":{"steamid":"76561198219147315","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1016,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1016,"last_played":1576416365},"language":"turkish","review":"güzel","timestamp_created":1578763786,"timestamp_updated":1578763786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61694040","author":{"steamid":"76561198108882286","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1086,"last_played":1642962339},"language":"english","review":"i like","timestamp_created":1578762958,"timestamp_updated":1608392990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61693919","author":{"steamid":"76561198141356555","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":417,"last_played":1578916320},"language":"schinese","review":"神作。10/10\n一个13年的游戏，放在7年后的9013年来看依旧不为过时。\n上一个让我觉得如此经得起时间考验的游戏叫做 “时之笛”。","timestamp_created":1578762841,"timestamp_updated":1578840026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61693732","author":{"steamid":"76561198102085526","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1018,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1018,"last_played":1578571342},"language":"thai","review":"ดีงามทั้งเนื้อเรื่องและเกมเพลย์ โดยเพลงประกอบนี่เดอะเบสสุดๆ","timestamp_created":1578762624,"timestamp_updated":1578762624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61692317","author":{"steamid":"76561198860266548","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":886,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":886,"last_played":1578760842},"language":"english","review":"An endearing adventure unlike any other with gun play and combat that defined itself before anything else.

However, the reason for not recommending this has to do to the fact that there are bugs that are still in the game that will probably never be rectified because I mean this is 2k and Irrational Games disbanded once this game came out. What bugs? Namely Elizabeth bugging out (disappearing, glitching) and game freezing seemingly out of nowhere. The former happened to me after a checkpoint but somehow it let me continue afterward. Unfortunately in the dlc itself, I am getting constantly frozen out and Elizabeth disappeared twice. So I restarted Burial At Sea 3 times and after that I said fuck it.
