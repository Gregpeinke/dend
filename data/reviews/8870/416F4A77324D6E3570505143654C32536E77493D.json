Все 3 части игры я проходил на высоком уровне сложности и первые две игры предоставляли какой-то челендж по убийству противников, а в 3й на высокой сложности их не сложнее убивать, чем на низкой сложности. На любой сложности они остаются тупыми болванчиками, которые в большинстве случаев передвигаются в одной плоскости, а то и не передвигаются вовсе. Повышение уровня сложности просто увеличивает их кол-во хп и урон по вам, что просто сильно замедляет темп игры но сложности никакой не добавляет. \nВраги из 1й и 2й части активно использовали пространство вокруг себя, падали на тебя с потолка, выскакивали под ногами, использовали ближний и дальний бой, чарджили и кидались гранатами, которые можно было успеть словить телекинезом и метнуть обратно во врага и были интересны сами по себе. В 3й части они стали просто скучными болванчиками с пушками не особо влияющими на их поведение.\n\nПлазмидов стало меньше, как и область их применения. Полезен плазмид который создает сильные потоки ветра, т.к. можно вышвыривать противников за пределы летучих островов, но на каком-то этапе начал использовать только плазмид, который заставляет врагов воевать на твоей стороне. (Просто это оказался самый быстрый способ расправиться с тупыми и жирными врагами, т.к. по окончанию работы плазмида те совершают суицид, а действие плазмида автоматически заканчивается, если вы нашли другую цель). \nВ 1й и 2й части был грамотный дизайн локаций, разлитые на полу горючие элементы, вода, бочки, опять-же враги швыряющиеся в тебя разным взрывоопасным мусором и взаимодействие с окружением было одной из основ геймплея, а в 3й такого нету. \n\nПрокачка оружия не имеет смысла вообще. Кол-во ресурсов ограничено, а под конец игры оружия становится очень много, т.к. у каждой фракции есть несколько прототипов одной и той-же пушки. Каждый прототип пушки прокачивается отдельно, а носить с собой можно всего несколько пушек. В итоге патроны от стрельбы по жирным врагам заканчивается и приходится менять оружие на то что сможете подобрать, а тут уже как повезет прокачали вы ее или нет. Если раньше прокачка определенного оружия влияла на ваш стиль игры, то сейчас это не имеет никакого влияния. В середине игры просто забил на прокачку, так как было лень листать и читать здоровенный список совершенно бессмысленных улучшений.\n\nПро сюжет и контент:\nСюжет претендует на какую-то глубину и заумность с попытками в сложные квантовые теории, параллельные миры и прочий бред, но информации по этому поводу дают очень и очень мало, а вопросов очень много. \nШок контента тут вообще нету. Если в первой части игры мы постоянно встречались с безумными и интересными персонажами по типу пластического хирурга, который уродовал своих клиентов, художника который устраивал выставки трупов, гениального ботаника которого травят газом на ваших глазах, да и сам концепт больших папочек и сестричек. \nТо в 3й части весь шокконтент - это 1я встреча с финком, когда вас заставляют кинуть мяч в пару с разным цветом кожи, а 2й это собственно смерть финка на глазах у его собственного сына, с попыткой горереволюционерши убить ребенка. На этом шок контент собственно все. \nПерсонажи совершенно не интересные и не запоминающиеся. В 1м биошоке каждая локация рассказывала историю определенного персонажа и в конце локации вы могли их даже встретить и увидеть что с ними в итоге стало, а в 3й это проходные персонажи которые так часто меняются, что совсем не успеваешь к ним привязаться . Не проникаешься их борьбой и желанием за что-то мстить или кому-то помогать. \nНу а про слитую концовку я думаю все и так слышали.\n\nЧто хорошего? - Елизабет. Этот персонаж заставляет вас умиляться. Разработчики очень много времени уделили проработке этого персонажа. Она с самого начала игры бегает и пытается взаимодействовать с разным окружением, самостоятельно передвигается по комнатам и с большим интересом рассматривай все вокруг и это выглядит хорошо. За ней интересно наблюдать и мне правда хочется верить в ее историю, про то как ее закрыли в башне, как она там жила в одиночестве, где ее единственным другом был здоровенный крылатый монстр и теперь она попала на волю и активно изучает мир недоумевая от происходящего. Приятно слушать ее детские фантазии и разговоры с Букером, приятно смотреть как меняется ее персонаж по мере прохождения из-за постоянно увеличивающегося кол-ва сюжетного насилия в игре. Но Елизабет - это единственное достояние этой игры. \n\nИтог: Хотите поиграть в хороший и атмосферный биошок с запоминающимися персонажей и приятной механикой взаимодействия с окружением? - топайте играть в первую часть. \n3я часть сегодня уже неактуальна и неинтересна.","timestamp_created":1599184387,"timestamp_updated":1599184387,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454097986221313477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75401721","author":{"steamid":"76561198119950162","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1726,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1662,"last_played":1599214277},"language":"spanish","review":".","timestamp_created":1599183654,"timestamp_updated":1599183654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75395726","author":{"steamid":"76561198120227869","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":521,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":92,"last_played":1617335757},"language":"english","review":"Good","timestamp_created":1599171576,"timestamp_updated":1599171576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75392574","author":{"steamid":"76561198278654613","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":1584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":539,"last_played":1651172273},"language":"russian","review":"ШЕДЕВР","timestamp_created":1599165817,"timestamp_updated":1650126705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75392077","author":{"steamid":"76561198020415096","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":864,"last_played":1599316236},"language":"russian","review":"Крайне рекомендую!

Don't let my Steam hours deceive you: I've also played this game on the PlayStation 3 for over 100 hours easily. To say that it's a great bit of fun is a definite understatement; BioShock Infinite is profoundly unique in its setting and remarkable in its fusion of gameplay mechanics with storytelling, as well as the development of its characters and ability to make the player care about them very soon after meeting them.\n\nColumbia is a place full of genuinely unforgettable experiences: the entrance to the city through the rocket and the walk through the church to the tune of \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\" (that actually brought me to tears the first time playing, no lie); the beautiful first look at the city proper, and the dynamic world you've entered playing out in front of you, including the little conversations you can listen to and other small yet notable interactions, to the fairground, to the flight across the city using the brilliant Sky-Lines. The introduction to Elizabeth was perfect, especially the section on the beach as she danced to \"Rory O'More / Saddle the Pony,\" and watching her interact with her surroundings and develop her character, which she had enough of to fill multiple games of this caliber, was an experience simply unmatched by any other game I've ever played. I have to praise the tastefully anachronistic music you can listen to, mostly including old-timey renditions of mid-to-late 20th century classics that provide such charm that they alone can pull and immerse you in the BioShock Infinite Universe. I'll never forget \"The Bonnie Blue Flag\" playing as sniper rounds [i]psssh[/i]ed past my head, or \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" as I walked around with Elizabeth and observed Columbia's horrifically racist past, bottled up and presented as a presence of American glory and strength, or \"Fortunate Son\" and \"The Girl They Call Fitzroy\" as the (indubitably based) Vox Populi's communist revolution sounded off all around the industrial areas and sweatshops of Columbia's working-class underbelly. I also want to mention the two small bits of music found in \"tears\" (miniaturized sections of non-local reality which can be bent by Elizabeth for a variety of purposes, such as aiding in combat or worldbuilding), \"Fortunate Son\" and \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,\" both of which were, though a minor detail, just cool to listen to. I'll never forget the post-revolution aftermath, strolling through Columbia's remains and finding bodies and possessions in the streets, the bloody consequence of capitalist exploitation and oppression of working men and women. I'll always remember the Comstock House, the atmosphere of which was...well, it's hard to describe, but I found it both horrific and wondrous, as an alternate future played out in front of me in all its glory as you face weird and unnerving enemies unseen in any other section of Columbia.\n\nBooker and Elizabeth are easily two of my all-time favorite characters I've encountered in any of the games I've ever played; it's extremely difficult not to enjoy their interactions and growth as the game progresses. Booker is a hardened, bitter and cold former Pinkerton agent, experienced in breaking workers' strikes and forcing Native Americans off their land, and as a result, comes across as little more than a jagoff antagonist, but by the end of the game, [spoiler]I was devastated at his death, technically by his own hand[/spoiler]. Booker is a dynamic character, and his change from grim taskmaster to genuinely empathetic is helped mostly by Elizabeth, the girl he is sent to Columbia to rescue in order to clear a debt. Elizabeth is a gem; gorgeous, knowledgeable, fun, funny, creative, curious and, most importantly, [i]positive[/i]. She is a master class in how to make a companion for an escort mission that will make a player [i]want[/i] to escort them, to hang around them and watch them learn and grow from their experiences with the world. Elizabeth comments on facets of Columbia she knows about, on its history and her understanding of it, and speaks with Columbia's citizens on some occasions, even giving a poor young boy an apple and singing \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\" while Booker plays the guiter. This was just one of many striking moments that just took me out of the real world and into BioShock Infinite, one that I still remember. She and Booker made this game for me, and with other characters such as the manipulative reactionary Zachary Comstock, the badass revolutionary Daisy Fitzroy, the opportunistic and greedy Albert Fink, and the mysterious and eccentric Lutece twins, all of them solidified Infinite as a gaming experience I will never forget.\n\nIt's not for everyone, and it's not 100% perfect, but it's damn close, and I loved playing it, for what it's worth. If you're interested in a story-driven, combat-heavy, good-looking and, at times, wacky and out-there experience, you'll probably like it, too!","timestamp_created":1599075054,"timestamp_updated":1641362540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75341589","author":{"steamid":"76561198126697823","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":92,"last_played":1602699862},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo excelente vale cada centavo!","timestamp_created":1599074940,"timestamp_updated":1599074940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75340416","author":{"steamid":"76561198085969408","num_games_owned":381,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1736,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1735,"last_played":1599073580},"language":"english","review":"Well, in few words it was brilliant, astonishing, complement...
