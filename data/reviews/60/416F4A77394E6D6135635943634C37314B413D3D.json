And is the main reason not to recommend this for purchase.\n\nOtherwise, the game is not horrible. It was good for what it was supposed to be - bonus mod. You jump between platforms using boosters and throw discs at opponents, either to push them off into void or to kill them. You regenerate discs ammo all time up to 3 of them. Pushing requires 1 discs, thus can be spammed. Decapating disc wastes all 3 \"ammo\". There is regular respawning power-up. And with usage of HL Engine advanced maneuvering (air strafing) you can try to outsmart enemies by landing on different platform than what is expected.\nAnd most often, you will fall into void due to your own clunkyness. Or bump into another player and fall down together.\nIt's just that it tried to push on art direction of \"arcade/virtual\" style too much, thus it lacks any casual fun of \"shoot them the terrorists from awesome guns\", nor does it has any pleasent art in levels themselves.\nOtherwise, nice bonus mod, for 2-4 players DMing.","timestamp_created":1408020913,"timestamp_updated":1408020913,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532931506633758545","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11593609","author":{"steamid":"76561198025578387","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1407448391},"language":"english","review":"This is the worst creation Valve has ever made.

Геймплей непонятный, сервера пустые, даже музыки нет. Никому не рекомендую, не тратьте деньги попусту. Покупать исключительно в комплектах и только для увеличения количества игр в библиотеке - больше Ricochet, к сожалению, ни на что не годится.

I cannot stop playing this game. I would let my hours speak for me, but I would rather ramble on how amazing this game is. \n\nTL;DR If this game was a person I would bend her over. \n\nFirstly, let's talk about the plot. A glorious twist on the famous franchise 'Half-Life', Gordon now has the ability to talk and must lead his army against the vast Black Mesa... in space. The introduction of new characters such as Chell from Portal and the SWAT team from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive really improved the quality of this story. I won't try to spoil the plot, but there is a very dramatic death scene towards the end of the game (you'll know when it happens). If you've ever seen a person quote \"Et tu Brute?\", those were the actually words of the final boss. Again, the main campaign was fantasic, I played it through at least 5 times.\n\nSecondly, the gameplay mechanics. The controls are so natural, I felt as if I was Gordon. I kid you not, I went to the hospital because my mom thought I was bats**t insane. I'm not insane, unless you consider that I am bats**t insane for this game. Throwing the frisbee, feels like actually throwing a frisbee. I had to take a break after my first 3 minutes of gameplay, because my shoulder was hurting from the recoil of throwing. BUT THERE'S SO MANY FRISBEEs! :D Do you prefer fast? Done. Do you rather use three? Done. Knife? Done. Anything else? Done. You can literally kill them with anything. Think GTA V, but better.\n\nThirdly, the community. Believe it or not, Ricochet has the largest community and more online players than any other game. After 2 weeks of the release, it broke every single record with community involvement. That's pretty impressive. I once got into a game and was playing for maybe 10 hours when someone decided to randomly give me a bunch of *ok* games (skirym, Day y, Team Fort 3). Is there any other game where someone just randomly decides to give you free money? That's what I thought. And that is the Ricochet difference.\n\nTo summarize, this game is visually and mechanically stunning, it is definitely worth every cent that you earned to spend it on this game. To be serious, this should be Game of the Year, every year. To be actually serious, if you wasted your time to read this far in a bs review, than you would probably enjoy wasting your time on this deserted game.\n\n11/10 -IGN\n420/69 -Rock, Paper, Shotgun\n9/11 would rather be in a plane crash than give up this game\n6/9 would give up sex again for this game","timestamp_created":1404096861,"timestamp_updated":1434722621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10946715","author":{"steamid":"76561198055610791","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65,"last_played":1436560240},"language":"english","review":"░█▄░▄█░█▀▀░█▀▀▀░ █▀█\n░█░█░█░█▀▀░█░▀▄░█▀▀█\n░▀░░░▀░▀▀▀░▀▀▀▀░▀░░▀\n░█░░█░█░▀▀█▀▀░█▀█ ░ █▀█\n░█░░█░█░░░█░░░█▀▄ ░█▀▀█\n░▀▀▀▀░▀▀▀░▀░░░▀░ ▀░▀░░▀\n░█▀▀ ░█▀█ ░█ ░█▀▀\n░█▀▀ ░█▀▀ ░█ ░█\n░▀▀▀ ░▀ ░░░▀ ░▀▀▀\n░░░░░░░░████\n░░░░░░░░█░░█\n░░░░░░░█░░░█\n░░░░░░█░░░░█\n███▄▄█░░░░░███▄\n▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░█\n▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░ █\n▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░█\n▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░ █\n▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░█\n▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░█","timestamp_created":1404062918,"timestamp_updated":1404062918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496134012937545776","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10922103","author":{"steamid":"76561198037347550","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1403996857},"language":"english","review":"There is no one online for playing it.
