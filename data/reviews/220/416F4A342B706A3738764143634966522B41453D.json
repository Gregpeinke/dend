I played Half-Life on and off for a few months, but I did not like it. It was not that it was not a good game, it was just so old and I would get stuck on the puzzles so often. I had originally wanted to beat Half-Life 1 before I started Half-Life 2, but that never happened so I never played Half-Life 2. Until a few days ago. I decided that I was going to get Half-Life: Alyx, so I needed to play this game first to get the backstory. The first time I booted this game up I played it for 5 hours straight. It is super fun. The story is very interesting and the setting is so unique and cool. The combination of action, puzzles, and story in this game is done so well. The graphics are much improved from the original Half-Life. The physics in this game are amazing and the gravity gun is so much fun. Each section of this game is unique and well done. The story is good, and G-Man adds another dimension to it. This game will make you feel like a bad ass when you are gunning down the combine and other aliens. The puzzles in this game are better, I did not get stuck as often, and I never had to search up a walkthrough to find out what to do. In the end this game is one of the best I have ever played, it still holds up to this day as a classic. If you don't already have this game, get it.

Начну с главного: я понимаю, что у многих людей это любимая игра в серии, но как по мне, первая часть намного интереснее и антуражнее, даже со своей старинной графикой и движком. Скитания по атмосферному заброшенному комплексу, постоянные боевые действия с самыми разными врагами и - как апофеоз всей крутости - телепортация в завораживающий, но безумно опасный инопланетный мир Зен, где простой физик-теоретик Гордон Фримен совершает невозможное и уничтожает, как предполагалось, главного врага человечества. \n\nА что у нас здесь? В начале нескончаемое количество унылых восточноевропейских улиц с большим обилием крайне надоедливых кислотных болот. Затем антуражный, но все же абсолютно необязательный и не к месту вставленный в общее повествование Рейвенхольм, а в конце всего этого.. да, парочка неплохо продуманных уровней в Цитаделе, напоминающих о позднее вышедших таких же культовых Portal и Portal 2. С одной стороны в этой игре усилился масштаб трагедии: землю захватил некий Альянс и на протяжении многих лет он терроризирует и использует человеческую расу в своих целях. Однако, с другой стороны, все место действия сузилось до одной Земли, сюжет двигается крайне медленно и неспешно, лишь иногда подкидывая прикольные экшн-моменты под музыкальное сопровождение Келли Бэйли, где основную часть драйва создает музыка автора, а не сама игра. Противников вроде стало больше и они разные, да вот никак не вписываются в то, чем являлся Half-Life в первой части. Другими словами: атмосфера абсолютно иная. И вроде это должно создавать интерес, да вот у меня его, по большему счету, не было. Говоря о графике и геймплее - вопросов нет. Играется все также хорошо и многие механики пошли сиквелу на пользу (разве что кроме отрядов бойцов, которые мешают нормально играть и постоянно стопят в коридорах), однако все что касается локаций и общего антуража, лично для меня, в большинстве своем мимо. \n\nВ целом впечатления положительные, поэтому, конечно же, рекомендую всем и каждому к ознакомлению, если еще вдруг не играли. Все же, несмотря на то, что это не совсем то, что лично я хотел бы видеть после 10-ти часов марафона в первой части (со второй такого желания не было, близко подошли только эпизоды) - это один из лучших шутеров 2000-х.","timestamp_created":1584484455,"timestamp_updated":1585263518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524462699890136719","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65233521","author":{"steamid":"76561198799439906","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1293,"last_played":1619346839},"language":"german","review":"Gud Gaem  \nI really reccomend.","timestamp_created":1584483868,"timestamp_updated":1584483868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65233053","author":{"steamid":"76561198143278513","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":129,"last_played":1619752726},"language":"english","review":"RISE AND SHINE,MISTER FREEMAN.....\nThe best game honestly, it may be old but it beats many games of this time, the story is incredible, the gameplay is the best, it clearly makes you think and that suspenseful music puts you in the mood.
