Понравились динамичность сетевых баталий. Во время игры вы не заскучаете! Естественно, графика устарела, но это здесь и не главное. Многочисленные карты и большое разнообразие оружия - вот, что цепляет и затягивает тебя. Когда я играл, я получал только положительные эмоции. Многие современные шутеры не могут похвастаться такой динамикой, которая есть в Half-Life Deathmatch: Source. Если имеется желание поиграть, то смело заходите в игру, на пару весёлых часиков её хватит.  Но покупать её сейчас нет смысла, только если взять сборник Half-Life: Complete, в который входит и эта игра.","timestamp_created":1433677031,"timestamp_updated":1577887484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.723154723644256592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16228971","author":{"steamid":"76561198162865832","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":152,"playtime_forever":34,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1433619310},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life + Multiplayer killing chaos.

То что я увидел, нельзя было назвать Настоящим халф лайфом. На первый взгляд выглядит все хорошо на движке Source и ты в предвкушении сразиться с другими игроками на crossfire и почувствовть динамику детмача оригинальной игры в новом цвете, но меня сразу огорчило, что карты были переделаны под source очень халатно, так сказать сделали что бы они выглядели внешне как надо. Что сразу огорчило, дак это crossfire. Турели не могут использоваться, люки с башен закрыты, лифты багнутые и я не мог поверить что эту х*рню сделали valve. А если не обращать внимания на многочисленные баги на картах, то геймплей так же был убог. При попытке кинуть снарков или С4 они выкидывались только, если секунды полторы - две удерживать ЛКМ. При попытке ощутить былой драв от гауссджампа, я был сильно огорчен, что гаусс теперь далеко не мощный, а эгон, и стекла сломать не может... Так же прочитав ранние коментарии увидел сообщения, что игроков там нет. И это правда, там играет человека 4 на двух серверах и все. И я нисколько не удивлен, что в это убожество никто не играет.
