Portal 2 not only has an entertainingly fun and challenging single player, but also an extremely fun co-op campaign separate from the single player campaign. The Co-Operative gameplay of portal 2 is some of the most fun you will ever have with a friend or your significant other. If you’re anything like me you will consistently be looking for good co-op games to play and find out the hard truth that there aren’t many to be had. With the lack of good co-op games to play, Portal 2 is a defiant must have, and one of the best co-op games you will play for years to come.  Valve is one of the few developers I don’t have anything bad to say about, their games are consistently in great quality and in great fun. Over all I highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone looking for both a good game to play on their own, but also with a friend. \n\nPros:\n\n+ Co-Op\n+ Story progression\n+ Remember-able and Fun characters\n+ Amazing set pieces\n+ Gameplay\n+ Graphics\n+ Sounds\n+ Atmosphere\n\nCons:\n- The game eventually like all things, ends.\n\nScore:\n\n10 out of 10","timestamp_created":1386013480,"timestamp_updated":1386013480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7884714","author":{"steamid":"76561197976882736","num_games_owned":365,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1407089727},"language":"german","review":"einfach nur Geil!\nzwar etwas einfacher wie der 1.

game builds on the original gamplay that made the first Portal very good, but in making a full-length game, it brought out something that was not an issue in the short original. This game gets pretty boring in the middle. Because the main character is silent and spends most of her time alone, the game relies entirely on Wheatly or GLaDOS to provide personality. Much like any form of gameplay that isn't substatiated by story or interesting characters, the blue and organe protal system gets boring. There are several large portions of the game in which both Wheatly and GLaDOS are completely silent, like when I spend an hour in silence while trying to figure out hard puzzles. I understand that those two can't be an endless source of sarcasm and funny quotes lest they become dry, but a full-length game needs to account for these silent empty spaces. There is a limit to how much ambiance can make up for a lack of personality.\n\nIn all this is a really good game when it gets moving. I loved hearing Cave Johnson talk about science so haphazardly, and the vocal characters are excellent companions. While I cannot recommend this game if you have Norton Internet Security (since it hates the Source Engine), I can say that it is worth a purchase, especially since it goes on sale for $5 all of the time.","timestamp_created":1386005813,"timestamp_updated":1386005813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7882835","author":{"steamid":"76561198086492551","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":13266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9622,"last_played":1605500378},"language":"english","review":"The Portal games are some of the best puzzle games ever made.

Однак в PORTAL и PORTAL2 эта идея доведена до логического конца - игрок сам может создавать порталы, и  портальная пушка является единственным иструментом для прохождения игры. В самом деле, зачем нам растреливать турель, если её можно  просто  провалить куда нибудь. Хотя брешу- основной инструмент для прохождения  игры - это мозги игрока. Игра полна головоломистых уровней, прохождение которых не даст заскучать, и что самое вкусное, всё это связано  неплохой сюжетной линией, причём сюжет второго PORTAL  продолжает историю первого. Так  что для получения   удовольствия, повышения ЧСВ и прочего, крайне рекомендуюется пройти сингл обоих игр, Оно того стоит. Ну а когда, захочется  сладкого, можно пригласить товарища пошпилить в кооперативе, причём для этого режима, совсем другие головоломки, так что не надоест проходить одно и тоже по второму разу. Режим  кооператива, думается мне, даже более крут,  чем сингл. Ибо, как народна мудрость гласит - \"за компанию даже жид удавился\",  в компании с лучшим врагом/злейшим другом проходить намного интересней.

It will never get bored, lol... The story line has also great humour. You will laugh sometimes or with big smile.\nThe story is still beautiful and when in the middle of the story line, you are in the best part of the game: far underground, in the biggest puzzle cave. That part is always the best of all levels. Even game is from 2011, the graphics are still at good level.\n\nThe dynamic world with unlimited portal effects still amazing every time. I know Valve has many problems to solve the complex dynamic portals (camera and project interaction through portals) but they did it.\nAnd the challenge to make puzzle yourself or solve puzzles from others, makes the game timeless fun with Workshop.\n\nActually, i want next gen Portal 3.... with even more amazing world views.
