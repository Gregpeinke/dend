You can do single player, but it is likely you'll be overwhelmed. It is a surival horror themed game. It feels mostly like a polished mod with one typed of gameplay which is what it is. On a give map, you get money for shooting monsters and surviving a wave. You use that money to buy better weapons, get armor, and ammo. There are usually 10 waves. Each wave has more monsters and progressively tougher ones added. There are several classes that offer perks such as discounts on weapons, increased damage, or more ammo per clip on a certain type of weapon. You can level up each class to get increased benefits. I have found that the normal difficulty is harder than what I would expect in a normal difficulty. Since the game is a bit repetitive and only features a survival mode, I would give it a 6-7/10. I got it for 90% off, so the price was worth it at the time.

I have played just a few hours of this game and obtained a few of the achievements, so it's easy to say this is still in my favorite games list. However, I am now more aware of some of this game's more frustrating aspects that are worth noting before playing. Namely, the spawn system. It is still leagues above Killing Floor 2's teleporting zeds, but it has its own problems. There are plenty of places on maps for zeds to spawn that are inaccessible to the player for them to spend some time moving to the main map area before you have to worry about them, but there are also plenty of instances of a group of zeds spawning too close to the player's current position. In some cases, I have experienced six clots suddenly dropping right on top of my head in places they had no place to drop from other than spawning in the air. Large groups of dangerous zeds have a habit of spawning too close to the player, especially at the beginning of a wave. This becomes a problem since a player's current position in relation to the zeds' is the most important factor in a round's success. This problem is less apparent in multiplayer co op than in solo play. You'll have to spend the first minute of each wave kiting the map around zeds until you are certain that all of the spawns are on one side of you before you can safely engage them. The other problem that can impede the experience is hitbox quality. Headshots are another important aspect of gameplay, and zeds can frequently hop up and down over pieces of debris or change their vertical position briefly while navigating the terrain. You'll have to be very careful about judging the zeds' current headshot positions since they shift so frequently and often unpredictably.\n\nThese problems can be considered a learning curve, and while they can be a hindrance, they can still be adapted to and overcome. At that point, the fun factor and satisfaction of the game shines through. Every weapon looks and sounds fantastic and zeds splatter and explode in chunky and gory glory. As the game amps up in the difficulty you select and later waves, it evolves into a ballet of rapid and intense decision making: which zed in a crowd you target, where you decide to run, which weapons you purchase and use, every decision is the difference between success and failure. You have to learn each zed's behavior and patterns and every weapon's strengths and weaknesses to survive as you use rapid combo techniques to take down the largest and most dangerous zeds as well as large packs. Zeds will work together to use their abilities, so players must also work together to support and cover each other as the number of zeds increases with the number of players in a game.\n\nSo, the game is challenging and a lot of fun. However, there are many weapons and characters behind an additional paywall. This is frustrating, since some of these weapons are key for certain playstyles and strategies, and some are just silly. I don't want to encourage TRIPWIRE's price gouging, so just start with the base game and only get a few additional paid weapons if you REALLY want them. Avoid the stupid gold and neon weapons (unlike me). The base game is still plenty strong enough for a strong recommendation.","timestamp_created":1342492960,"timestamp_updated":1490499291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3386606","author":{"steamid":"76561198021847293","num_games_owned":308,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5782,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5730,"last_played":1422771402},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor is a FPS where your only objective is to make it through each wave of Zeds and live.
