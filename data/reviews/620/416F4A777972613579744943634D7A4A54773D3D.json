Co se týče CO-OPu tak jde vidět že autoři mysleli na všechno. Od dvou kamarádů co je jeden velký a chytrý a druhej kterej je malej, hloupější, a tlustej. V co-op tam máte různá kola kde se naučíte různé dovednosti.\nTahle hra se mi líbila a byla ÚŽASNÁ!!!. Tuhle hru dokážu hodnotit jenom palcem na horu. Pokud tuhle hru chcete koupit tak jen doporučuji.","timestamp_created":1454229242,"timestamp_updated":1454229242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20865704","author":{"steamid":"76561198166127253","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":174,"last_played":1614489285},"language":"schinese","review":"泡妞搞基必备，双p，，，，，污，，，，\nmake gay","timestamp_created":1454222814,"timestamp_updated":1454222814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20865496","author":{"steamid":"76561198143265205","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":732,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1463342588},"language":"brazilian","review":"Otima Jogabilidade , ta de Parabens o/","timestamp_created":1454221801,"timestamp_updated":1454221801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20864845","author":{"steamid":"76561198099995437","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":3683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1990,"last_played":1611282253},"language":"english","review":"This is a puzzle game, just in case you were unable to figure that out. You can beat the entire storyline in a afternoon but there is replay value. Yes the game does tie into the Half-life serries but you do not need to know anything from Half-life 2 to understand the entire storyline. While this game stresses your brain, do not look up walk throughs, it will ruin the pourpose of the game and its theme.","timestamp_created":1454218605,"timestamp_updated":1454218605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20864550","author":{"steamid":"76561198181906657","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1019,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":760,"last_played":1628192987},"language":"english","review":"I think this is am amazing game!!

The game is pretty simple but fun, you shoot portals and solve puzzels. The story is also pretty cool and Portal 2 is a game that most people can enjoy and not find it to be too diffictult or challenging. Even though this game is fun I wouldn't reccomend it if you own a Mac, the game freezes every few seconds on the Mac even when I don't have it in fullscreen. On Windows it seems like Portal 2 runs just fine. Another issue I found and this is probably just my controller is I had to adjust the controlls as when I first plugged in my controller. The A and B buttons were swapped, but like I said I think it was just my controller. Overall I would give this game a 9 out of 10, it is a really fun game, but if you have a Mac you may run into issues.","timestamp_created":1454208218,"timestamp_updated":1454208218,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20861874","author":{"steamid":"76561198050451442","num_games_owned":723,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":74,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":74,"last_played":1440876422},"language":"english","review":"The moment I saw GLaDOS' lifeless body, I made Chell teabag her face while staring right into Wheatley's eye.\n\nThe game's a work of art, what else can I say?
