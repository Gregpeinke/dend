Valve egyik legjobb játékai között van a Portal franchise. Ez gondolom egy egyértelmű tény.\nGondolom az lehet a legnagyobb kérdés, hogy miért ekkora siker ez a játék? Hét okot most felsorol neked.\n\nEgy: Remek már az alap gondolat menet is. Két lyuk helyett egy. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nKettő: Igen szép grafika. Lehet mellékes, de ez egy 2007-es játék, és meglepődne az ember, hogy milyen dolgot tettek le akkor tájt. Mondanám, hogy volt akkoriban szebb látvány világgal bíró játék, de ez akkoriban egy nagy újdonság volt, nem kevés téren. (Megjegyezném, ez a játék a Valev híres motorjával, Source Engine-nel készült, és akkoriban még csak ők fejlesztettek játékokat ezzel.)\nHárom: (Ameddig a Valve sose tanult meg elszámolni.) Remek sztorija van, és ami szerintem pláne jó húzás volt, hogy egy univerzumban van a Half Life játékkal.\nNégy: Rá vesz arra, hogy használd az agyadat. Ez nem csak egy egyszerű FPS játék, hanem közben egy logikai játék is. \nÖt: A fő Boss, név szerint Glados tudtommal benne van a kedvelt fő ellenségek kötött a legtöbb videó játék kedvelőnek.\nHat: Támogatja a legtöbb köntrollert. Szerintem ez nemcsoda, hiszen Xbox 360-ra. és PlayStation 3-ra is megjelent. (Megjegszem, Xbox 360-om van, és azon is már nem egyszer ki vittem.)\nHét: Bár menyire is azt mondja neked a Steam, hogy nem támogatja a magyar nyelvet, ez egy akkora hatugság, mint a játékban a torta. (Bocsi a Spoilerért.) Van a játékban magyar felület, felirat, illetve nyelvi beállítás is. Sajna szinkron nincsen, de én az előbb felsoroltaknak is bőven örülök.\n\nHa sikerült elolvasnod eddig ezt az értékelésemet, akkor szerintem fel merülhet benned az a kérdés, hogy megéri megvenni ez a nem túl fiatal játékot 2021 idején?\nA válaszom rá, igen.\nAttól függetlenül, hogy mennyi idő telt el e játék megjelenési éve óta, ez egy remek játék, és szerintem megéri többször végigvinni. Lehet nincsen Online részlege, de ez így tökéletes.","timestamp_created":1628857381,"timestamp_updated":1628857381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97479521","author":{"steamid":"76561198133102800","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":25,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1625206284},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩","timestamp_created":1628854761,"timestamp_updated":1628854761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97478919","author":{"steamid":"76561198374161401","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1275,"last_played":1628853953},"language":"english","review":"2021 got me doing portal challenges","timestamp_created":1628854009,"timestamp_updated":1628854009,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97478261","author":{"steamid":"76561198372600338","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":319,"last_played":1628874553},"language":"english","review":"gud puzzles","timestamp_created":1628853109,"timestamp_updated":1628853109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97477178","author":{"steamid":"76561198984033495","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1638039420},"language":"english","review":"just fun","timestamp_created":1628851627,"timestamp_updated":1637886398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97475816","author":{"steamid":"76561199033742528","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":193,"last_played":1628516208},"language":"schinese","review":"不玩后悔一辈子","timestamp_created":1628849681,"timestamp_updated":1628849681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97472633","author":{"steamid":"76561198830447081","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":598,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":356,"last_played":1635798683},"language":"russian","review":"\"Одна нога здесь - другая там\" ©Челл из Portal","timestamp_created":1628845375,"timestamp_updated":1628845375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57548058032989502","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97465557","author":{"steamid":"76561198276115911","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1498318557},"language":"turkish","review":"oyun süresi kısa ama kaliteden ödün vermemiş.

And this is the most intense and exciting hours in the company of the first person in recent years ... if, of course, Portal can be called a \"shooter\" at all. Gabe Newell said even before the release of the game that, perhaps, the ending of Portal is the best thing that Valve has managed to do in recent years. He didn't lie, damn it! It turns out that the labs we saw in the game's promo videos are just the beginning of a short but unpredictable and impressive adventure. Telling how it ends is to spoil the pleasure. Let's talk better about the portals.\nIt all started with Narbacular Drop, which was released in 2005 by students at the DigiPen Institute in Redmond, the world's first institution of higher education dedicated entirely to video game creation. The idea, as they say, \"went\", and the entire team of creators was taken to Valve, provided with the technologies, knowledge and resources necessary to make the game at a qualitatively new level. Portal is a continuation of the ideas of Narbacular Drop, a game with portals. Our heroine's name is Chell, she becomes the subject of a series of experiments in the laboratories of Aperture Science. In the snow-white halls, the girl is accompanied by the mechanical voice of the all-seeing electronic assistant, the GLaDOS operating system. The program collects data on Chell's behavior, forcing her to solve riddles: at first simple, then harder and harder. At the beginning of a series of experiments, the girl receives a portal gun, which can only place one portal-entrance, and the exit is predetermined and unchanged. A few more experiments, and the cannon in Chell's hands becomes fully functional. Now both the portal-entrance and the portal-exit obey her.\nThe plot about a series of experiments could be submitted to a yawn depressingly, but the authors of Portal, based on such tasteless material, managed to make a beautiful and exciting game. It can be seen that many ideas came here directly from the first Half-Life: we start the game from scratch, knowing nothing about either Aperture Science or our heroine. And as we guessed what was happening, driving up the monorail to the Black Mesa complex and listening to the welcome speech of the automatic announcer, so everything that will be known about the experiments and Chell, we will learn from the ubiquitous GLaDOS. She promises a pie for completing all tasks, then promises not to follow you, then promises not to lie that she will not follow, then warns that “the next experiment has been replaced with an obstacle course for combat androids” and rewards for passing with a warm “congratulations, android! \". This pair, Chell and GLaDOS, are all the heroes of the game. The almighty GLaDOS comments on events, and you answer her not in word, but in deed. And remember, this is how the first Half-Life was built. The meeting with the soldiers in Black Mesa will surely be remembered by everyone, because then both you and Freeman tried to understand what was happening together and decided not to obey the government forces. Portal is served in exactly the same way. You know that GLaDOS can lie, that experimentation is deadly, and whatever decisions Chell will later have to make are up to you, the player. This is where GLaDOS experiments you, it is you who come in the nineteenth experiment to an unexpected, dramatic, unpredictable outcome and to one of the best credits in the history of video games. After them, I want to listen to Jonathan Colton's Still Alive sounding there continuously for at least the next week.\nAgainst the background of such an outstanding storyline, the role of professional game design no longer seems to be the main advantage of the game. Just think, a hole in the water wall, a hole in the other. You grasp the idea of ​​a portal gun on the fly, so that after nineteen experiments in a row you can be surprised at a thousand ways of using it. Portals can be used to cross chasms, direct energy balls to generators, dump crates on machine gun turrets, climb inaccessible heights and solve diabolical puzzles. This is really a completely new game mechanic, which is no less informative to master than the already familiar gravitational cannon. And which is just as difficult to describe.\nThe portal is the most difficult game to approach with a well-established rating system. Is three hours of a first-class single a lot or a little? After all, only three hours. But first class. But three hours. Six \"advanced\" levels, Challenge mode and no multiplayer - where are the advantages and where are the disadvantages? The portal gun is a great innovative idea, which is not so easy to add to regular multiplayer and, apparently, in the valve they decided that less is better, but
