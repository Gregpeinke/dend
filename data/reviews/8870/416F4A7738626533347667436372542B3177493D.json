The world is very beautiful and the sky rails are very fun to hang on to and attack from. And the enemies and guns are interesting at first, but this is ruined by you only being allowed to carry two at any given time. I find myself only sticking to the shotgun and sniper rifle, making all the other choices void. And unfortunately the thing that makes the Bio-shock games unique, the vigors, is better off unused in this game as shooting enemies in the head is far more efficient.\n\n And the tough characters you would use them on are mostly resistant to the effects. The story is confusing, convoluted, and hard to follow.

[/h1]\n\nNever mind anyone's stance on whether or not the original Bioshock, Bioshock 2, or Bioshock Infinite was the superior of the series, the games are all individually great. The Bioshock series offered me the greatest gaming experiences I've had thus far. By any means, do try Bioshock Infinite. Regardless of your interest in the rest of the series, this game on its own is a work of art. You will not regret diving deep into the world of Bioshock whichever game you choose to try out yourself. They all come with their charm and Infinite does not let you down with it. Try out Infinite.\n\n[h1] What was Bioshock Infinite like for me? [/h1]\n\nI appreciated the game's story. Some may find it confusing, but I found it to be interesting and compelling. While it seemed to fall short early on, the more you stick around the more you get rewarded. I do appreciate the philosophical aspects of the game. Infinite, as well as the rest of the series, did a fine job standing out with their symbolism, philosophy, and Easter eggs. The ending itself makes all you've experienced have a whole different meaning. The story is the strongest point of the game by far.\n\nThe core mechanics are good. The fighting fluid and at some parts exciting with each new element you're introduced to. I am a big fan of making use of the environment in combat and this game offers a lot of ways for you to experience different styles of combat. The skyline on itself and the tears mechanic adds so much more to fighting than I expected initially. I adore how significantly combat has improved across the series.\n\nIt is one of a kind. A floating city during the 1900s, Columbia is just as unique and complex as Rapture. Seemingly a Utopia, the city presents its values and underlying philosophy. It presents goodness and righteousness, a place that is meant to shelter the pure from the sins of the world below. The amount of detail and work put into creating a world so beautiful to get immersed into, only for you to discover all its flaws and secrets, is a brilliant concept. They did not disappoint when it came to world-building.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects is the connection to the rest of the series. While initially, you find little similarities, you sense a greater connection as the game goes on. Be it the lighthouse we venture into as the game starts, or similarities between Vigors and Plasmids the game keeps bringing your mind back to where it all started, the original Bioshock. As you reach the game's ending, it all rushes back to you, flooding your heart with joy.\n\n[spoiler] \"There is always a lighthouse, there's always a man, there's always a city.\" [/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1618490526,"timestamp_updated":1618490832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90344638","author":{"steamid":"76561198337937674","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1623073488},"language":"english","review":"it's a super gaming experience","timestamp_created":1618484151,"timestamp_updated":1618484151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90334267","author":{"steamid":"76561198035766609","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1293,"last_played":1619985643},"language":"english","review":"god tier","timestamp_created":1618464295,"timestamp_updated":1618464295,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90333123","author":{"steamid":"76561198094304449","num_games_owned":516,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":367,"last_played":1618461422},"language":"spanish","review":"el mejor juego que te rompe la cabeza amigo 10/10","timestamp_created":1618461732,"timestamp_updated":1618461732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90332270","author":{"steamid":"76561198132168610","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":902,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":458,"last_played":1651510482},"language":"english","review":"Always will be the best.","timestamp_created":1618459851,"timestamp_updated":1618459851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90330726","author":{"steamid":"76561199121947243","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1039,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":623,"last_played":1637469399},"language":"english","review":"For being a game from 2013 this game is amazing, if you want a great story with some fighting involved i 100% know that you will love this game.

Check pcgamingwiki website in order to disable depth of field and fix some ui features\n+had 0 crash, some areas have fps drops but its not disturbing that much\n+Story is amazing too, like any other bioshock titles\n+Game lenght is super long, its like never ending. Bunch of story elements and collectibles. Took 25 hours on hard for me (plus i havent died) tried to explore everywhere though.\n+Guns and vigors(plasmids from previous ones) perfectly fine and numerious\n+3 great DLCs\n+nice achievements\n+Voices and sountracks.

The combat is boring and is just like any other shitty shooter on the market. The mechanics fail in almost every way to the point where dying is the smartest thing you can do. I played through this on hard mode, constantly just running into fights, using up all my ammo and then dying, only to find that i now had ammo, and was able to beat the fight. The enemies are boring and generic with absolutely nothing unique about them. Money is useless, and the limit of 2 weapons at a time neuters any and all tactic or thinking within combat. \nNow, all of this i could forgive. The combat is the epitome of the phrase \"dog ass\", but if a game has a good story, I could care less if the gameplay was worse than Sonic Forces, but if the story is worthwhile, I'll be happy. \nHowever, the story is ABSOLUTELY NOT worthwhile, or good in any sense of the word. Coming off of the first 2 \nBioshock games, its very easy to notice the drop in writing quality. Where the first game had complex themes, and a narrative that unfolded over the terrifying hours of exploring rapture, we now have literally, LITERALLY the moral complexity of \"racism bad\". Now, I have no problem with media exploring racism and such disgusting bigotry as a topic, in fact its one of the most interesting topics I've seen explored. But this game does it worse than anything  else I've seen before. (Maybe putting aside Detroit: Become Human, but at least that game had some pretty well written parts) The game constantly shoves it's half-assed themes down your throat from the very moment you enter the city. Now, very poor social commentary put aside, the rest of the story is somehow worse. \nFrom the beyond irritating Elizabeth, to the stupid and boring villain. From the beyond generic protagonist, who's a carbon copy of every milquetoast white dude with a shady past, to the stupid, convoluted ending that leaves you confused, not in the sense that you don't understand it (because it's actually quite simple, despite what the angry 2000 IQ fanboys will have you think), but confused at the fact that someone likely got paid to write this, and they were probably really proud of it. The themes are stupid with the game amounting to a moral of \"nothing you do matters\". If it was done well, if the idea of your choices all leading to the same place was executed well, I would have loved it. What an amazing and interesting idea for a video game. (it may sound like I'm being sarcastic, but in a medium defined by player choice, having a game with that idea sounds very interesting to me. IF it is done well.) But the game simply does not convey that very well. It's abundantly clear that absolutely nothing you do has any meaning within the game, but then they act as if its a big reveal that you didn't have any real choice. \nNow I'm just gonna say, Elizabeth is the most fucking annoying character ever. She is constantly saying some stupid shit, blocking you from areas because of her terrible inclusion into the gameplay mechanics, or just all around being the most annoying companion since the companions of Skyrim. Her character \"arc\" is cliche, uninteresting and just plain boring. \nAll in all, this game ends up being a generic shooter, with very poor mechanics, and an even worse story, that fails to even scratch the surface of how great the first game was, and the second to a lesser extent.

Pero este en especial, necesita uno. Es uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado desde hace 10 años, nunca me he enganchado a un juego ya sea por la trama, jugabilidad o graficos.\nColumbia se siente viva... sus filtros de colores es perfecto, su historia totalmente inmersiva y chocante (sobre todo al final). Su jugabilidad bastante fluida, y los paisajes que presentan a lo largo del juego... son maravillosos.\nLa forma en que la trama se conecta con los juegos previos, es bastante buena y resumida. Quede con tantas ganas de saber más sobre la historia que incluso, despues de terminar los DLC's y demas, tuve que ver videos sobre la saga Bioshock por que me he quedado impresionado de tal juego.\nLos DLC's no tienen desperdicio, explican bastante sobre la saga, y lo que no me esperaba... Es volver a Rapture.\nComo he dicho, es una experiencia totalmente inmersiva, literalmente, sientes que estas en Columbia. Cada personaje, las músicas, las casas y la ambientación... Es increible como lograron tal cosa.\nCon respecto a uno de los personajes mas importantes de la historia, Elizabeth. Es sin lugar a dudas el personaje más carismatico y vivo de todos los juegos que he jugado. Su desarrollo a traves de la trama esta muy bien pulido, e incluso llega a ser útil.\nY la historia... es maravillosa, no sabes por donde empezar a unir cada pieza para lograr entenderla, pero una vez que lo logras. Sientes que todo conecta y empieza a cobrar sentido. Una narrativa espectacular.\n\nLo único negativo que tengo que decir, es que el episodio 1 de Burial At Sea, es bastante corto para mi gusto. Pero el resto es perfecto.\n\nEs totalmente recomendable, pero te recomiendo comprar Bioshock: The Collection. Asi podras enteder toda la saga y como conecta con este juego junto con los DLC's. Y aparte podras ahorrar un par de billetes.\n\n\"Son un millon de mundos. Todos diferentes y todos similares.

Detto questo, dissento da tutti quelli che sminuiscono tanto il gioco  affermando che \"non è all'altezza dei primi due\" o \"non merita il nome di Bioshock/non appartiene alla saga\", in quanto, nonostante molte meccaniche siano state stravolte, ho rivisto in diverse occasioni elementi e situazioni già adottate nei precedenti. Riconosco inoltre al team dietro a questa memorabile saga, una capacità incredibile di creare atmosfera: in BioShock Infinite è MAGICA, e mentre nei primi era quasi tetra/claustrofobica (sempre restando particolare e accattivante), qua riesce a portarci in un luogo che è l'esatto opposto - totalmente aperto e spazioso. \nLo consiglio davvero, dategli una chance.","timestamp_created":1618237205,"timestamp_updated":1618237325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90189540","author":{"steamid":"76561198125245528","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":834,"last_played":1618192297},"language":"english","review":"The gameplay is a huge improvement from the first games, you never get bored of killing\nthe story sucks you in and the atmosphere is lovely, and the characters are very well written, especially your companion\nshe keeps you supplied all the time, gotta be the best companion out of the games i've ever played.","timestamp_created":1618235137,"timestamp_updated":1618235137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90189008","author":{"steamid":"76561198082468973","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":124,"last_played":1617633559},"language":"english","review":"Solid entry to the franchise","timestamp_created":1618234452,"timestamp_updated":1618234452,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90188251","author":{"steamid":"76561198377354737","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":142,"playtime_forever":1127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":655,"last_played":1618738897},"language":"schinese","review":"CN NO.1\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠋⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⢁⠈⢻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠃⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠈⡀⠭⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⠄⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣷⣶⣿⣷⣶⣶⡆⠄⠄⠄⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⢀⣼⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠄⠄⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣇⣼⣿⣿⠿⠶⠙⣿⡟⠡⣴⣿⣽⣿⣧⠄⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣾⣿⣿⣟⣭⣾⣿⣷⣶⣶⣴⣶⣿⣿⢄⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⣩⣿⣿⣿⡏⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣹⡋⠘⠷⣦⣀⣠⡶⠁⠈⠁⠄⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣍⠃⣴⣶⡔⠒⠄⣠⢀⠄⠄⠄⡨⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⡘⠿⣷⣿⠿⠟⠃⠄⠄⣠⡇⠈⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠟⠋⢁⣷⣠⠄⠄⠄⠄⣀⣠⣾⡟⠄⠄⠄⠄⠉⠙⠻\n⡿⠟⠋⠁⠄⠄⠄⢸⣿⣿⡯⢓⣴⣾⣿⣿⡟⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄\n⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⣿⡟⣷⠄⠹⣿⣿⣿⡿⠁⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄","timestamp_created":1618233451,"timestamp_updated":1619095276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90184121","author":{"steamid":"76561197994718314","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":618,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":618,"last_played":1618167145},"language":"english","review":"When I first played this game as younger I found it absolutely fascinating but when I replayed it now I found it to be a bit better than decent.
