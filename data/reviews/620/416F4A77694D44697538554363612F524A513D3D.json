No really, its humor is 100% perfect. The jokes are spot on, the characters delightful, and the situations hilarious. Gameplay wise, it is, as one would hopefully expect, a portal game. The mechanics are more or less the same as the first game, but with a few inclusions. The level editor and workshop support is a very nice addition, and has been used to its fullest, meaning that anybody who uses the map finder enough, will come to witness an entirely new story. \n\nI honestly do not care that much about the gameplay. Puzzle games are just not my thing, yet that is what makes this game so amazing. Even though I hate this genre, this is still probably one of my favorite games of all time, based purely on the characters.","timestamp_created":1398189680,"timestamp_updated":1398189680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9901989","author":{"steamid":"76561198001828174","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1168,"last_played":1590362638},"language":"brazilian","review":"o

Anyway, Portal 2 was longer and more challenging compared to the first one, which made it a lot more fun. Plot twists made this game even better. The gaps in the story line between Portal 1 and Portal 2 made it a bit hard to follow, but if you read some comics or websites they will explain most of the information. Overall, this was a great play and I recommend this game for anyone, it will provide hours of entertainment.","timestamp_created":1398169559,"timestamp_updated":1398169559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9897961","author":{"steamid":"76561198069445646","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":6883,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1909,"last_played":1655838781},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная рилтайм головоломка!)","timestamp_created":1398152552,"timestamp_updated":1398152552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9897940","author":{"steamid":"76561198042301527","num_games_owned":1149,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":8201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7836,"last_played":1487835668},"language":"english","review":"Good game, but way to scary for my tastes.","timestamp_created":1398152267,"timestamp_updated":1398152267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9897502","author":{"steamid":"76561198115571428","num_games_owned":558,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":765,"last_played":1459285304},"language":"english","review":"This game kept me guessing, laughing, and testing my brain throughout the entire journey through Aperture.

The test chambers get much harder, but it is so much fun experimenting to see where that Portal is supposed to go. The one part of the single player story I just love, is the plot twist. Not going to say what it is. (You will have to see for yourself)\n\nAfter completing the single player storyline, you can do co-op. You will probably need a friend, being that not many others do co-op these days. The co-op story features GlaDOS, who constantly reminds you in the tests they were originally supposed to be done by humans. The end of the co-op story though, has got to be the greatest ending for a co-op game ever. \n\nAfter completing the co-op and single player, you may think you are basically done with the game. WRONG. The community continues to create tons of maps, and even mods, to expand even the Portal 2 story, or even just fun chambers you can do. The one thing I just love about this game is the community. The community keeps on creating, making Portal 2 a joy to play, and see what awesome chambers were created, and which peek your interest. I'm sure you will find great maps, even created in Hammer, not just the in game test chamber creator. \n\nOverall, this game deserves a 10/10, for being a great puzzle game, and for having a great story, and huge community.","timestamp_created":1398010507,"timestamp_updated":1398010538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518072307109832764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9881607","author":{"steamid":"76561198111464103","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":468,"last_played":1546037822},"language":"hungarian","review":"hát jó játék :D","timestamp_created":1398003292,"timestamp_updated":1398003292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9881123","author":{"steamid":"76561198032510792","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":930,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":930,"last_played":1345100400},"language":"english","review":"witty and smart, fantatic humor","timestamp_created":1397999743,"timestamp_updated":1397999743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9880462","author":{"steamid":"76561198111896041","num_games_owned":325,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2077,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":158,"last_played":1623792638},"language":"french","review":"trop bien!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n","timestamp_created":1397994552,"timestamp_updated":1397994552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9879380","author":{"steamid":"76561198104376903","num_games_owned":300,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1853,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1191,"last_played":1588801943},"language":"japanese","review":"パズル好きなら一度はやったほうがいいゲーム３D酔いしやすい人はあまりお勧めできないかもだけど展開がとても面白く、飽きがこないストーリですぐにストーリークリアしてしまったｗ","timestamp_created":1397984549,"timestamp_updated":1397984549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9878006","author":{"steamid":"76561198072760196","num_games_owned":702,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":417,"last_played":1391803521},"language":"koreana","review":"포탈1을 이은 속편이다. 포탈시리즈는 정말 재밌다. 특히 이번 2편에서는 좀더 긴 러닝타임, 멀티플레이, 맵 에디터등 포탈을 즐길수있는 모든 기능들이 포함되어있어서 강추하는 바이다. 물론 몇몇 아쉬운점이 있다. 예를 들면 스토리모드에서 좀.. 루즈한 부분이 있고, 멀티플레이는 제대로 작동하지 않는것 같다.(사람이 없어서 그런걸지도..)  심지어.. 2014년에 속편인 인디게임이 나왔는대..정확하지는 않지만 그내용이 충격이다..개인적으로는 포탈2 엔딩은 괜찮은 마무리였다. 그런대 그게 짝퉁?

If you are the kind of person who loves challenges, and mental games, this one is perfect for you, and if you love the games with ALOT of secrets and UNREVEALED stories, you will love to play this game, while making your own theories about the game and its SECRET story!\nThe singleplayer campaign is awsome. the story is very simple, but the Secret story... well, you will need to pay alot of atention to the dialogs and the whole game, and parts of it, you will need to make your own theories.\nNow, the multiplayer is awsome, you will be hours completing the multiplayer campaign with your friends! You will meet lots of new people! But, the campaign is very short. I think Valve should add some EXTRA levels every week, but the good thing is you can create your own levels.\nIf you are one of those guys that hate waiting, or that are impatient and/or silly, dont buy it, just buy it if you are ppatient and know how to solve things.\n\nI will give it a 9-10, or maybe a 95-100 because think of this, after you complete the game and the multiplayer campaign, there will not be so much to do, but there are some achievements you can try to complete.\n","timestamp_created":1397869904,"timestamp_updated":1397869904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiMDiu8UCca/RJQ=="}
