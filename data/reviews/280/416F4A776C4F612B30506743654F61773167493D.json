Autosaves are much more frequent, the new gun physics are neat, the visuals are much better than they were (which isn't saying much, but the water, for example, is on another level). I'm very new to Half-Life, so I'm not sure what people were expecting when this came out, but the game plays better than expected for someone who heard so much bad stuff about it. I almost didn't like it because a bug occurred early on in my session, but a load from the autosave fixed the issue (I wasn't being let in into the experiment room). I'm not going to finish the game because I JUST played the original and its two PC extensions, and then watched HL: Decay. But I got to as far as \"We've Got Hostiles\" and the game honestly has not disappointed me so far.\n\nI just remembered that loads take longer than they should, and that guards and scientists grunt too much and in situations where they're not in danger. And I had another graphical glitch happen to me early on, so I'm knocking the score down from an 8 to a 7. Still not as bad as people say, from my admittedly short experience.\nScore: 7/10","timestamp_created":1619339681,"timestamp_updated":1619340271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510150611400604248","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90869282","author":{"steamid":"76561198284102790","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27,"last_played":1619416352},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bom cara o jogo ta muito bem feito e uma honra joga half life ou qualquer outro jogo da valve eles fazem jogos muito bem feitos\n","timestamp_created":1619311679,"timestamp_updated":1619311679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90866247","author":{"steamid":"76561198044267428","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":905,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":905,"last_played":1347951600},"language":"english","review":"I'm still wondering when this is going to be fixed, since the original game in GoldSrc is still superior and can still run natively on modern Windows.\n\nPlay that or Black Mesa instead.","timestamp_created":1619306365,"timestamp_updated":1619306623,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626631855964660645","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90862569","author":{"steamid":"76561198315313354","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1619331010},"language":"spanish","review":"Está rotísimo debido a el nulo soporte que Valve le ha dado al juego, de todas formas se me bugea menos que el original que para mí literalmente es injugable, no le puedo dar una reseña negativa porque los clásicos se respetan, pero es un juego roto","timestamp_created":1619300761,"timestamp_updated":1619300761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90855789","author":{"steamid":"76561198130679813","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":69,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":68,"last_played":1658803332},"language":"english","review":"its good only for gmod maps and assets","timestamp_created":1619291670,"timestamp_updated":1619291670,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90854023","author":{"steamid":"76561198865813354","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1775,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1099,"last_played":1635895668},"language":"spanish","review":"Ipso buenardo","timestamp_created":1619289393,"timestamp_updated":1619289393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90805425","author":{"steamid":"76561199095616387","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1619306874},"language":"spanish","review":"Es muy bueno\n","timestamp_created":1619218849,"timestamp_updated":1619218849,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90788538","author":{"steamid":"76561199159847763","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1651638714},"language":"russian","review":"Игра хорошая 8 балов из 10 только надо поправить игру там есть очини сильные баги но респект что кучу багов поправили","timestamp_created":1619196346,"timestamp_updated":1619196346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586469829082489014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90779229","author":{"steamid":"76561199021129824","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1657010384},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life: Source — переиздание игры Half-Life 1998 года на базе более eбaнутого игрового движка Source с рядом нововведений в исполнении багов и поломанной видеокарты.

But after all this is just a bad version, it has a lot of bugs that didn't have in the original.\n\nEDIT: After doing some research it looks like this game got f*cked by updates like the SteamPipe update. And also if you still want to play half-life source there is this mod call \"Half-Life Source Fixed\" which is much better and id say this is the way to play Half-Life Source.\nhttps://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-source-fixed\nNot only this mod fixes bugs but adds quality life features. Like rezised maps so you dont get a loading screen every corner of the map and there's still the option to play the original maps, enable the half-life crowbar hits sounds so sounds hits will be diferent when hitting diferent surfaces just like in the original, half-life 1 style movement and sounds, half-life 1 mp5 recoil style, gibs, subtitles and some other misc options.\n\nAlso the good thing about this without the \"Half Life Source Fixed\" mod, you cant mount the game to others such as Garry's Mod to get all the textures and models.\n[spoiler]hehe garrys mod dlc (sh*t joke lol)[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1618530660,"timestamp_updated":1656007758,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90367107","author":{"steamid":"76561198353035458","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1070,"last_played":1621653559},"language":"english","review":"i love Half-Life: Source!","timestamp_created":1618514533,"timestamp_updated":1618514533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90354955","author":{"steamid":"76561197971409107","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1545070257},"language":"english","review":"just get the original game the only reason to get this is for gmod assets","timestamp_created":1618498868,"timestamp_updated":1618498868,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90313278","author":{"steamid":"76561198845057934","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1231,"last_played":1636963134},"language":"turkish","review":"Bu oyun tam bi başyapıt.

When it first came out Half-Life revolutionized the FPS genre. And still to this day, you can feel it's effects on many FPS games. Before Half-Life there was DOOM, Wolfenstein. These games were just about running and gunning. Half-Life changed that formula. You can see that in the opening section in the game. Half-Life slowed down the gameplay and added more elements. In Half-Life, you have to be tactical. You can't rush into every enemy otherwise you'll be dead before you know it. You have to use every tool in your arsenal to get out of tricky situations. Half-Life was a huge deal back then and now years later playing it feels really good. The soundtrack is good, weapons sounds are great and gunplay is amazing. Level design is superb. There are platforming sections, stealth sections, creepy sections, we have lots of variety. The story is well written, characters are memorable. Mysterious G-Man, security guard Barney, protagonist Gordon Freeman, everyone has a charm to them. Enemy design is great. Headcrabs, houndeyes, every alien has a distinct feature and distinct behaviour. This game was ahead of its time, and it shows. It really is a masterpiece and better than most of the FPS games come out nowadays. If you are a FPS game fan and haven't played it, you definitely should play it. Half-Life is and always will be every FPS lover's favourite game.\n\nNOTE: Source version of Half-Life is glitchy. It has some bugs and graphical issues.
