HL:OF is an expasion that delivers and expands the original game for the best while keeping what made it an amazing game, every addition that Gearbox is really nice to mix the gameplay and not keep the player.\n The story puts you in the shoes of the bad guys that you fought in the base game, the Marine Corps Forces with you being Corporal Shepard that is sent to Black Mesa Facility. But unfortunately you crash with no orders to follow so you try to escape while helping along the way not only the Marines but also the Scientists and Security Guards instead of slaughtering them.\n During the campaing, you encounter new enemies with them being a new race of aliens and the male assassins with you also being provided along the way news awesome weapons, abilities and marines sometimes that you can use.\n Game also has some good fan service with the player having sometimes deja vus of areas that were already seen and visited on the base game. Also in the game you can encounter Doctor Freeman himself and if you try to follow him, you will die with cause being that the player tried to create a paradox, something that I thought was really a unique touch.\n Overall I recommend this expansion, in your 1st playthrough you will finish in like 5-6 hours and in the meanwhile it will be your best hours, this expansion does everything right with the expansion keeping what made the original HL so good while giving new things to explore, use and kill.

Для одного боевика надо высадить чуть ли не всю обойму или 6 выстрелов из дробовика, а на больших тварей надо тратить всю свою тяжёлую \"артиллерию\", даже на лёгком уровне сложности так. Кстати, ко всей этой картине добавляются вылеты игры, когда пытаешься зайти на свой сейв или умираешь на нём. Не знаю, почему или у одного меня ли так, но это очень раздражает. Вообще, высокой токсичностью грешат и первая часть, и другой спин-офф, и блэк меза, но именно в этой части токсичность доведена до своего апогея.
