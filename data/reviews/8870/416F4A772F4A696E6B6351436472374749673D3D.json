The games beauty is somewhat hindered by the poor combat experience which I feel dominates the Bioshock Franchise; although you don't play this game for the combat it is a tiny but obvious let-down to an otherwise awesome game. 9/10.

The role playing portion of the game consist of choosing which [i]paranormal or magic[/i] abilities to upgrade for currency which you pick up while completing the game. The abilities them selves you get as you progress through the game. Unfortunately all the abilities are basically the same and thus I found that portion of the game inferior to its predecessor. If the powers had been left out of the game as they are I wouldn't have missed them. Basically what ever you'll pick wont matter. Weapons can also be upgraded, on normal difficulty atleast you don't need to upgrade anything to complete the game but it does give you mini-goals ingame that keep you interested. Some upgrades change the characteristics of the weapons in entertaining ways. The story is good but nothing special what is good however is the depth of the non-player characters you interact with (in various ways), there are some interesting individuals in the world of BioShock Infinite. I absolutely recomend this game to anyone who enjoys a good single player experience. I just think this game has been greatly overhyped that however doesn't make it a bad game.","timestamp_created":1392319677,"timestamp_updated":1392319835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9088408","author":{"steamid":"76561197977993958","num_games_owned":576,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":637,"last_played":1378986001},"language":"english","review":"WAIT A MINUTE...

Except where Postal knows what it is and the makers intended nothing less, Bioshock Infinite is just using a sci-fi adventure shell to deliver a defamatory message.\nIf they had cut just a single word from the dialogue of the game at one specific point my argument would crumble, we could say it's all fiction and be on our merry way, but obviously they put that one word in to incite this type of response.\n\n\n\nOn the gameplay front, I have to say I'm not terribly impressed either.\nNot to say that what they accomplished isn't an incredibly polished experience, but it's definitely losing the roots of what anything ending in \"shock\" is supposed to be. Warren Spector is the creator of System Shock, Thief, and Deus Ex. All three follow a similar gameplay theme (stealth, with multipath levels and a focus on player choice), but set in future, past or present (near future) settings.\nThe original Bioshock was a spiritual successor to that lineage after Warren Spector hadn't produced anything new for a while, but this game loses most of what defines a title in that genre. There is little to no stealth, few choices in how to make your way through a level, and even the upgrades are largely forced on you at specific points in the game. You have the rails, which are fun, but if anything it symbolizes what is happening to the rest of the game. It's turning into the dreaded \"rail shooter\" that currently floods the industry, which is really ironic since the main selling point of the original was that it is supposed to be anything but a rail shooter. Not to say that you can't make a good one, but again, Irrational Games is selling you on the name and giving you something different.\n\nI recommend Dishonored to those looking for another Warren Spector style game.","timestamp_created":1392304092,"timestamp_updated":1392402482,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9083610","author":{"steamid":"76561197962444566","num_games_owned":332,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1150,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":937,"last_played":1528587037},"language":"english","review":"This game is absolutely stunning!

Many mechanics from previous entries to the series have been simplified to the point where most aspects of character building and progression have been lost, resulting in a traditional first-person shooter. Many of the enemies feel anonymous or unimportant, and the level design seems to consist largely of arenas where enemies are fought and corridors that connect them.\n\nIn spite of the bland gameplay, the art design is nothing less than beautiful. Colors are vibrant and radiant, and truly serve to convey the theme of early twentieth century American Exceptionalism taken to extreme lengths. The city of Columbia is home to some extraordinary scenery, and it's unfortunate that its potential wasn't explored further. The game's narrative is fanciful and grandiose, befitting the setting in which it takes place.\n\nAll said, Bioshock Infinite has its high points and low points.

The gameplay is leaps over the previous Bioshock games. The weapons are fun to use and the powers (vigors) are even more devilishly wicked in terms of taking on the enemies that the game throws at you. Coming up with combos of the vigors and weapons to use just made it quite compelling and not once felt boring to me. The same can be said about the storyline; it was fascinating, addicting and had me wanting more. The main character Booker DeWitt had a Han Solo vibe happening. And that ending was just heart pounding and had me shocked at how it kept me thinking about it hours and even days later. Hollywood can only dream of coming up with anything original that would come as close to what these game studios are coming up with lately. \n\nMy two year old computer ran the game flawlessly with it looking so incredibly gorgous. The graphics are just breathtaking and beautiful to look at - I was in awe the entire time. I was expecting it to lag with the settings on ultra, but that wasn't the case. Yeah, I love this game and look forward to playing the DLC now. Heck, I may just play through this one again before I tackle them next.","timestamp_created":1392249027,"timestamp_updated":1392279700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9071787","author":{"steamid":"76561198015809945","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":528,"last_played":1608393988},"language":"english","review":"The only downside i could find with this game is that the combat can get kind off monotonous.\nBut that's the only downside. Bioshock Infinite was 2013's best story driven FPS, hands down. The story will confuse you if you don't pay attention and play through it with an open mind, but that's part of what makes it a great story.\nAlongside the story there is the beautifully designed floating city of Columbia and the graphical style of the game will immerse you into it's world. This game is a graphical gem without requiring you to build a €1000 gaming rig.\n\nIf you are sick of all the military multiplayer focused shooters that have flooded the FPS genre, then this might be the game for you.

Combat is a boring grind, and here is little interaction with the people of Columbia other than fighting them. The vending machines and recordings which were somewhat entertaining in the original Bioshock failed to interest me this time around.\n\nIt's still worth playing, but wait until its on sale. I feel that this game was so anticipated, so over-hyped and so long in the making that it was unable to take the real chances with the gameplay that it really needed.

Having beat it well over a month ago, I still think quite fondly of it and how the entire game blew my mind. It's atmosphere, graphics, engaging story, balanced and solid gameplay had me coming back for more. It deserves all the praise it gets, and more so. I'm a massive BioShock fan, and an avid player of the original (Which I've beaten numerous times). The second one was a little disappointing for me, but still a solid and well-made game. So when I first picked up Infinite, I was more than a little apprehensive. However, my doubts flew out of my head the instant I started it up. If you're a fan of incredible stories, great first person action, or just love video games, check this one out. It's worth every minute. \n\nSoundtrack: 9/10\nGraphics: 9.5/10\nGameplay: 9.2/10\nStory: 10/10\nOverall: 9.7/10","timestamp_created":1392160862,"timestamp_updated":1392160862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9058612","author":{"steamid":"76561198055397552","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":172,"last_played":1452387696},"language":"english","review":"very good game to play over 3 screens","timestamp_created":1392160075,"timestamp_updated":1392160075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9058365","author":{"steamid":"76561198102759478","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":670,"last_played":1392156139},"language":"russian","review":"Годная игра, очень понравилась.
