One is larger and thinner, the other smaller and thinner. You make it through rooms the computer (Hencely called \"GLADOS\" as her new name) make to test how people (or robots meant to think like robots) would escape. That what end? I dunno, to be honest.\n\nYou use gunes (portal guns) to make wormhole ends, on  various materials only.  For example, shooting a wall beside you and then the moon will open a portal to suck you out.\n\nThe computer has no interest in life, but in science and how squishy that life might be.\n\nThe game as a whole is a three-dimensional puzzle that's truly fun to play, and has different maps for multiplayer co-op.\n\nEven with the standard price tag of $9.99 for the base, first portal game installment, I'd fully recommend it (unless you get it cheapter or questionably download it from the internet. It may be available on romhustler.net again.
