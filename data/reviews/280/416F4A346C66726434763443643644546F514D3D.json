If you're looking to play the half life series for the first time, don't play Half Life Source thinking its superior to the original game. However there is a major pro to this game, this being that thanks to it's port into Source, it can be used as a map on Gmod, unlike the original one which was developed with the Goldsrc engine. The benefits of this means that not only can you mess around with it in Gmod, but the VR mod for Gmod means you can play Half Life 1 in VR simply by downloading the VR mod on Gmod and then opening a map on this game there. Although I'm not entirely certain, I believe this is how the youtuber WayneRadioTV set up his \"Half Life VR but the AI is self aware\" youtube videos. (just as an example). To conclude if you're thinking of getting this game as an introduction to the Half Life Series, don't, just get the original, but I 100% recommend buying it to open it in Gmod and mess

this is ROUGH\n\nby its own merits, its arguably not a bad game, but its so inferior to the original and specially Black Mesa, theres no real reason to play this, the only real improvements are the ragdoll physics and less obnoxious ladders, but everything else is wrong, theres constant bugs, from the harmless stuff like NPCs constantly screaming in pain if they take ANY damage at all, to more serious stuff like scripted events being constantly broken, im pretty sure i havent seen a single scripted event involving an NPC that didnt break in some way, and ive played less than 2 hours\n\nbut then again probably the only reason youd ever play this is BECAUSE is broken, otherwise youd just play HL1 or Black Mesa\n\nso as a little trainwreck i think its an alright time waster, as a Half-Life 1 alternative, it fails, as a Half-Life game in general, it fails, as some random source shooter, its ok, but there are far better options\n\nits good if you want more models and NPCs for Gmod tough\n\nEdit: after finishing the game, ive decided to change my recommendation, the game is EXTREMELY broken, but it can be finished and honestly ive played jankier games, plus theres a fan patch that solves most issues, this is still the worst version of HL1, but theres some value in buying it if you want to use it with Source mods, besides the underlying game, HL1, is still good","timestamp_created":1644290160,"timestamp_updated":1644724614,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514285683631896973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109757506","author":{"steamid":"76561198883423201","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3094,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2605,"last_played":1659115237},"language":"english","review":"plays
