Es uno de los pocos juegos en los cuales me he sentido sumergido en un mundo utópico con una ambientación que tiene vida propia, en el que me he sentido transportado fuera de la realidad.\nPersonajes que encariñan, ambientes majestuosos y fantásticos, historia compleja que trasciende la realidad, calidad narrativa totalmente inmersiva, etc, etc. Un \"game of the year\" totalmente merecido, en el cual sobresale y extiende fronteras del género.\n\nAplausos se lleva el doblaje al español del juego, es una grata sorpresa encontrar un trabajo tan bien realizado... tanto que si no fuera por los textos en ingles que se encuentra en la ambientación del juego, se podría decir que directamente el juego fue concebido para la lengua hispana.\n\nLo único negativo que se puede decir del juego es su bajo nivel de dificultad, algo que pasa totalmente desapercibido al jugar y llegar al final de todo. Es sumamente entendible que la baja dificultad puede deberse a facilitar la historia a aquellas personas no duchas en los fps, algo que ellos parecen tener conciencia y buscan buscar el balance integrando el \"modo 1999\", el cual es un güiño a fps de antaño (como system shock 2), en los cuales la dificultad y la desición a la hora del building del personaje son duras y exigen la habilidad y experiencia del jugador para poder afrontar el desafio.\n\n\nUn juego totalmente recomendable!\n","timestamp_created":1390493917,"timestamp_updated":1390493917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8819837","author":{"steamid":"76561198001779311","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":961,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":793,"last_played":1396194244},"language":"german","review":"Bestes Spiel 2013!","timestamp_created":1390493615,"timestamp_updated":1390493615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8818979","author":{"steamid":"76561197992395260","num_games_owned":388,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":663,"last_played":1390422454},"language":"english","review":"Nothing like a good old sip of piss mixed with vodka to give you special powers to summon some whore ghost to cause people to shoot themselves, or to have the ability to burn the flesh right off your masturbation hand. BioShock Infinite has re-defined the meta in gameplay with these game-breaking new abilities that look exactly like that of any other shit game that came out a few years before. More about the gameplay includes shooting the founding fathers right in the face, and an awful half-assed plotline that makes references to Christianity and patriotism. They tried pulling a Sonic 06, which was arguably one of the worst video games of all time, but failed even against that dingle berry of a game. If you want textures that look like its a photo of the inside of a public toilet, and the subtlety of leading some bitch hoe around for the entire game, then this kind of gameplay is straight up your alley. It should also be noted that the cunt is unkillable, and therefore serves as nothing more than an immortal dispenser with a vagina.\nThe game itself is a very stripped back version of its predecessors, less plasmids/vigors, less guns, shitty meaningless upgrades and boring-as-fuck combat. It can only be enjoyed being played on easy - otherwise killing the big guys becomes tedious, not because of improved AI, but because of increased HP; unsurprisingly though, when put on easy, the rest of the enemies become insultingly simple, just like Elizabeth. Also, that fight with Lady Comstock's ghost (Probably also Elizabeth) three times was easily the best part that shits all over Casual Souls.","timestamp_created":1390487637,"timestamp_updated":1390487637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8818700","author":{"steamid":"76561198037051638","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1049,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1049,"last_played":1390094201},"language":"german","review":"HAMMER !!!!!!","timestamp_created":1390485552,"timestamp_updated":1390485552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8818586","author":{"steamid":"76561198018099053","num_games_owned":320,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":2587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1802,"last_played":1527316673},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game start to finish.

For that reason I know that by not recommending it, I stand to see some backlash from the fans of the series.\n\nTruth is, I had a pretty good time playing this game. The story, though I found it to be somewhat predictable (I completely figured out the \"twist\" ending about halfway through), was still pretty interesting. The action got fairly intense at times. The game had a decent amount of challenging segments without becoming frustrating. Overall an entertaining package. Game of the year is a definite stretch in my opinion, but not bad.\n\nUnfortunately, like many so-called \"AAA\" games these days, this one slaps you with a premium price, and delivers a very limited amount of entertainment. That is to say, once I finished this game, I felt no desire to pick it up again. It has a decently long single-player campaign mode when compared to other FPS games, but it still suffers from the same lack of replayability. The story, the stages, everything is very linear. The choices you make have no effect on the chain of events that occur. There are no alternate routes to explore. Nothing really makes me want to play through this a second or third time. \n\nThis would all be fine coming from a lower-budget indy title with a more modest price tag, but I hold these \"AAA\" titles to a much higher standard, and expect them to earn that self-proclaimed \"AAA\" status with something a bit more than prettier graphics and voice acting.\n\nSo in a nutshell, I dont think BioShock: Infinite is a bad game. There just isn't enough of it to be worth the premium price. If you can pick this up during a Steam sale (as I did), by all means go for it. Otherwise, you'll get more bang for your buck with other titles.","timestamp_created":1390406906,"timestamp_updated":1390406906,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8808820","author":{"steamid":"76561197974023325","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":150,"last_played":1410181793},"language":"german","review":"sehr geiles spiel....total abgefahren\n","timestamp_created":1390406524,"timestamp_updated":1390406524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8808715","author":{"steamid":"76561198011344507","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":2888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2437,"last_played":1450728394},"language":"english","review":"Just a wonderful game. \nActually i disliked \"Clash in the Clouds\". \nDo not get it wrong.

To be honest its a case of game design and player expectation not meeting for some. There are so many ways to entertain but the target is different for everyone. Bioshock Infinite does entertainment well - it's like a rollercoaster ride - it thrills and amuses for while it lasts and then its over. If you have played a lot of games and expecting a lot - really deep game play, realism, and choices (that matter) - the typical gamer pipedreams - you might be disappointed. Bioshock Infinite is maximally entertaining for those without preconceptions and without much desire to play a game to death. Thus when playing this game\"Expectation Management\" might be necessary that is do not indulge your fantasies and optimism in what could be. Also not feeling thrifty when you a deciding to buy the game helps too!  With that said the game is AAA quality and slick, extremely stable and I found it genuinely fun perhaps due to me rarely dipping my feet into the action game arena.

The combat is limiting and repetitive with a two weapon limit with an expensive as hell upgrade system. The \"Vigors\" (plasmids with a new coat of paint) all do the same thing with three exceptions: Possess machines for a short period of time (Not the same as hacking from Bioshock 1), charge at enemies with a strong melee attack (comes with a certain upgrade that makes it stupidly overpowered so you'll probably not use anything else), and an ability to catch and reflect bullets (would have been pretty cool if it wasn't given to you at practically the last part of the game), all other Vigors are just the same crowd control effect with a different look.\n The story doesn't save the game either. In the beginning it tries to send a message about racial equality and revolution but that's thrown away in favor of theories about alternate-dimensions/realities (which don't make any sense at all the second you start thinking about them).\n Also; [spoiler]why did they feel like they needed to have a twist ending in Infinite? Just because the first game had one? They also did it in Infinite's DLC. Are twist endings now a staple for this series? Do they understand how a twist ending is supposed to work? A twist only works if the audience isn't expecting it, just by making your series the \"Series with twist endings in them\" you're ruining the surprise because people will be expecting it. That's what made the twist in Bioshock work, the game gave everyone enough hints towards the twist without giving it away; no one was expecting it. In Infinite the twist is not hinted at at all, I played the game twice just to make sure I missed something but any actual hints towards the big reveal were extremely vague.[/spoiler] \nIt's only 12 hours long but many areas felt like unnecessary padding. The ending is 20 minutes long and it's whole purpose is to provide an explanation to many of the mysteries in the game, but it fails. Not only are many questions left unanswered, many more questions are raised. They try to explain most mysteries with alternate dimensions and quantum physics which ends up not making any sense.\nOn a sunnier note, Columbia as a setting was pretty cool, but I honestly think this is the only thing the game truly has going for it.\n\nWait a minute that card/10","timestamp_created":1390372655,"timestamp_updated":1390373800,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":61,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54834979772567749","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8804720","author":{"steamid":"76561198015209798","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":692,"last_played":1390371246},"language":"russian","review":"игра полное гавно. дизайн херня, стремные перестрелки.","timestamp_created":1390371605,"timestamp_updated":1390371605,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471777260303497314","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8804687","author":{"steamid":"76561197975775232","num_games_owned":422,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":365,"last_played":1446068785},"language":"english","review":"Good game, but way over hyped...

Screw it, I wouldn't even say I played it. I lived it. I felt like I was there, it feels so real. Would I recommend this game? I don't know how I couldn't. With the best storyline of any of the games I have, or maybe even will play, and the most beautiful art style since games like Journey, this is my favorite game.

I DO recommend this game!\nThis game was superb. I know that that contributes relatively little to the mountains of praise it has already earned, but there is a very good reason it has done so. The characters are fairly standard in terms of personality and even the backdrops are concepts oft visited before. But the way that the entire tapestry is woven together is what helps this game to prove that cliches and archetypes can still be powerful things in the hands of a good storyteller. \nAt first, playing with Bioshock in mind, I felt myself stangely uncompelled by what was occurring in the story, but I continued on. I later found myself being swept up in everything that was occurring, all leading up to the tumultous climax which ends, suddenly, with a startling conclusion. \nThe game is gorgeous, the combat and interaction engaging, and the stylistic concepts a delight for anyone who enjoys steampunk design or noir storytelling. Tapping modern philosophy and science and age-old social issues, this game is sure to provide much post game thought experiments and quandaries to puzzle through.","timestamp_created":1390358252,"timestamp_updated":1390358252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8803021","author":{"steamid":"76561198032078661","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1908,"last_played":1395971012},"language":"english","review":"I found it way better than BioShock 1 and 2.
