This game, for me, even though I played it and it had the looks of something developed for the Wii, touched so many levels of myself and the depth of my personality and logic of my touchy that nothing had touched before; it made me find ideas I had never even imagined before; it made me feel emotions that until that moment I had never felt before; it made me have a small taste of perspectives and feelings I had yet to have and possibly will never develop; and the best of it — it made me remember why I loved gaming and would always love it. I loved it because it was (and still is) —for me— one of the most absolute and whole experiences and examples of the limits where things like music composing, painting, drawing, architecture, scheming, storytelling and feeling could reach.\n\nThis game made me remember what feeling alive and desperate for a plot made me feel like.\nThe only 10/10 I’d give from 2008-2012 (where I gave
