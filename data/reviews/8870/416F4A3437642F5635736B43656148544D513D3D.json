To describe this game as \"beautiful\" would be like describing the Sun as \"a bit on the warm side.\"\n\nI originally bought BI as part of a package deal which included all three of the DLCs, so I was fortunate to be able to play the entire epic without having to wait between releases. The story is stunning, and stunningly told. Although [I]Infinite[/I]'s storyline is self-contained, and prior familiarity with the Bioshock universe isn't necessary to fully enjoy it, those who have played either of the other two [I]Bioshock[/I] games will almost certainly want to pick up both episodes of [I]Burial At Sea[/I] as well--they not only add new depth to [I]Infinite[/I]'s plot, but they go one step further and provide some simply mindblowing tie-ins to the first two games in the series. I'll bet dollars to doughnuts you'll never look at Rapture the same way ever again once you're done (I just finished Episode 2 of Burial at Sea earlier this evening, and I'm still getting chills thinking about the ending).\n\nOf course, given that [I]BI[/I] is an actual game as opposed to a movie, there's a great deal of action here as well (with some very impressive attention to physics to boot). While the plot itself moves on fairly linear rails, the player has a great deal of freedom to move about the train on their own, so to speak. Which is a definite bonus, because if your idea of eye-candy includes attention to detail, then you'll find a great deal to snack upon here. 99% of the game's action occurs in a version of late 19th-century/early 20th-century America, and the game designers clearly did their research, right down to the backdrops (friendly note of warning: that period of American history was highly, publically racist, and the developers decided to incorporate those attitudes into the scenery without apology. While you won't find anyone spouting the dreaded \"n\" word, other racial slurs are mentioned from time to time. But it's all done so naturally that I never once found it detracting from my overall enjoyment of the game. The designers were simply being true to history, which I can respect for the immersion value).\n\nThe voice-acting and the dialogue are both top-notch, and possessing the same attention to historical detail as the world in which the characters speak their lines. And some of those lines are truly marvellous in both their writing and delivery--[spoiler]My personal favourite being, \"Elizabeth! Your mother...is raising...the dead.\"[/spoiler]\n\nLet's see...I suppose I should take some time and talk about some of the more technical aspects of playing this game, eh? Players are given the option of using either a controller or the traditional keyboard/mouse setup, with a variety of presets to choose from for the former, and fully configurable key-bindings for the latter. I can't imagine anyone having issues with the controls--if something seems awkward, it's a piece of cake to go into the options menu and change it at any time. The number of options for tweaking graphics, alas, isn't nearly as robust--but it isn't allll that limited, either. Unless you're the sort of person who just can't be happy unless they're able to micromanage their graphics settings, I don't think you'll have any complaints.\n\nI wish the same could be said for the way the game handles saving your progress. [I]Infinite[/I] exclusively uses an auto-save feature (aka \"checkpoints\"), and while it fortunately [I]does[/I] seem to provide a reasonable number of said checkpoints, I remember there being a few places where I groaned in frustration after having been reset to the complete beginning of an area because I stopped playing before I was able to reach the next savepoint. At least the game gives a pretty clear visual indication of when a savepoint has been reached (an animated icon in the upper right corner of the screen), as well as actually telling you the time of your last savepoint when you first exit out of a session. All things considered, I found it a minor quibble, but YMMV.\n\nThe only other caveat I want to mention is that the game doesn't kid around with its listed \"minimum\" and \"recommended\" hardware requirements. Even if you have a graphics card that meets the recommended specifications, if your processor is subpar then you're likely to experience moments of stutter during particularly intense fights, especially if you try running the game on high graphic settings. Fortunately, the game's still pretty gorgeous even if you DO have to play with lowered settings for the sake of performance, but if your PC can actually handle the load, you'll be well-rewarded in terms of visual appeal. Will you ever!\n\n[B]TL;DR: [/B]It's worth the price, whether on sale or not. It'll suck you in and keep you there for many wonderful hours. If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have waited so long to buy the game myself. I can't speak much for the game's replayability (apart from the _Conflict in the Clouds_ DLC, which provides solo arena-style gameplay), but honestly, in this case I don't think you'll really notice. By the time it's all over, you'll walk away knowing you have enjoyed a truly grand gaming experience.\n\nUnless you're a philistine, but let's assume you aren't.","timestamp_created":1416916299,"timestamp_updated":1416917342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13076878","author":{"steamid":"76561198082639200","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":450,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":250,"last_played":1427570858},"language":"russian","review":"Просто лучший сюжет 10 из 10, графон 10 из 10. геймплей заслужил бы доработки эти еб№чие  трассы х№й пойми куда ехать стрелки всё время разворачиваются, да и бои не очень можно просто прыгать на всех с трассы по очереди а закончатся патроны и Элизабет даст тебе еще немного. в общем 7 из 10.

Su forma de moverse, de interactuar con el mundo es asombrosa, encuentra dinero, municiones, eve y medicina para ti, además de indicarte rutas hacia objetos, recordarte que olvidaste algún diario, abrir candados para ti y además descifrar códigos ocultos.

Not because there were glitches or because I found it to be too difficult but rather just because it is not a good GAME. There is absolutely nothing new or interesting. It doesn't have charm. It doesn't have intelligence. But that doesn't make it a bad game by itself. I love playing games like doom or duke nukem where there isn't much depth and the entire goal is just either \"shoot the baddies\" or \"make it to the end\". Those games are fun so they don't need to be smart. It's not a bad game because it doesn't have depth and is not fun. It's because it's just a game designed to look deeper than it is. And it's not deep. It claims to setup the world as a backdrop for the lead characters, but there is no real world to help frame the characters. It's just set-dressing. All the times when you think you make a choice (deciding who to throw a ball at, picking emily's broach) are pointless. I am aware that it is claimed that the choices serve the game's themes including saying the choices don't matter but in that case isnt it just as pointless to include it? Speaking of pointlessness why exactly was this a first person shooter anyway? In what way, if any, does that help the story? The gameplay aspects are horrificly bad so I don't think it was to make it fun (because it doesn't) so the only thing left is for it to attempt to serve the story. It does not do that. It's only a detriment. Is booker meant to be a man or some sort of space marine super soldier? The FPS aspect serves only to confine the player. There is no freedom of movement that might bring life to the setting. And the setting is what is supposed to be the selling point if i'm correctly informed. So why do something that would deminish it? To make way for more lightning and fire from your hands? Why are the TONICS even included? Because the developers liked them in bioshock so much? In bioshock they served as both a gameplay element but also, more importantly, as a vital plot element. In bioshock infinite they have no story purpose. And when you are trying to get a game to seem \"deep\" and \"intelectual\" you really need to make sure that the GAME part of the game is complimentary to the story part. The only thing \"deep\" about this game is the convolutions. If a game leaves me asking why a character is doing something instead of something else that makes much more sense then it needs to be explained! You can't just not mention it and assume the player doesn't think about it. In a game that wants to seem so smart it sure misses the simplest things.","timestamp_created":1416791684,"timestamp_updated":1416791684,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506726622581481934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13061695","author":{"steamid":"76561198038236755","num_games_owned":432,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2045,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2010,"last_played":1416784187},"language":"english","review":"This is the first review I have ever written, but this game made me want to provide some comments.

The game looks amazing and it's got a great story with plentiful twists. The combat is kept fresh by earning new weapons and vigors to play with along with the skylines and tears. Elizabeth serves as an actually useful companion throughout the game because she'll throw you supplies you're running short of during fights. It's got a decent level of difficulty and moderate music. The DLCs are great too, Burial at Sea takes you back to the Rapture we all know from the first two games, along with it's creepy and disturbing atmosphere. It also includes new vigors and the classic weapons from Bioshock 1. Clash in the Clouds provides short-term fun by letting you gear up and fight waves of various enemies, earning cash and completing tough tasks along the way. The only thing wrong that I could find with the game is it's checkpoint system, but that isn't bad enough to alter my rating.\n\nPro/con summary:\n\nPros:\nBeautiful graphics\nGood story with plot twists\nFresh and exciting combat\nDecent music\nUseful AI companion\nGreat DLCs\n\nCons:\nCheckpoint system\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1416702152,"timestamp_updated":1471316047,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13047196","author":{"steamid":"76561198010733387","num_games_owned":988,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":528,"last_played":1428432621},"language":"english","review":"its a good game :D i promise","timestamp_created":1416698520,"timestamp_updated":1416698520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13046556","author":{"steamid":"76561198112583756","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":798,"last_played":1521380820},"language":"german","review":"Ein sehr tooolles Produkt ;)","timestamp_created":1416694980,"timestamp_updated":1416694980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13046479","author":{"steamid":"76561198139343085","num_games_owned":287,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":962,"last_played":1417291832},"language":"spanish","review":"buen juego si te gustan los malos juegos.\n\nHamburguesa con queso caducado.","timestamp_created":1416694539,"timestamp_updated":1428228271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13045809","author":{"steamid":"76561198118088629","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":10027,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3270,"last_played":1605576497},"language":"brazilian","review":"Fantástico!","timestamp_created":1416691172,"timestamp_updated":1416691172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500454127788543701","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13044289","author":{"steamid":"76561198058864774","num_games_owned":348,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":993,"last_played":1423885327},"language":"english","review":"Game is amazing PERIOD PLAY IT NOW!!

Bioshock je životní styl! [/h1]\n\nVe světě her se pojem FPS táhne již od prvních pixelových krůčků a od prvních vizuálních slov. Je to vlastně prvorozený celého herního průmyslu, který již od svého začátku vrhá obrovský stín na ostatní druhy her. Za krále prvorozených by se dalo považovat Call of Duty, které se nám zarývá do hlav již celá léta, ale i tento král má svůj stín ve kterém se nám pomalu rozrůstá nový uchvatitel FPS trůnu. Bioshock. \n\nTřetí syn Irrational games s tajemným přívlastkem [i] Infinite [/i], nás místo do temných hlubin oceánu unáší do prosluněných oblak naoranžovělé barvy a na rozdíl od ostatních FPS her, které by nás tam poslaly pouze za účelem zbarvit oranžovou do ruda, nás Bioshock Infinite posílá prozkoumat na pohled hezký svět jménem Columbie, který má ale zkažené srdce. Hra začíná velmi pěkně. Jste vržen do světa vytvořeném v již ověřeném Cry Enginu, který patří dle mého názoru mezi jedny z nejlepších a to hlavně díky tomu, že hra vypadá opravdu nádherně a to i přes poměrně malé nároky. Prvních pár minut jste pouze unášen plujícím městem a poodhalujete co vás asi tak bude čekat. Je to jako pít velmi dobré pití a vy pouze lačníte po dalším a dalším loku ale… tak dlouho se se džbánem chodí pro vodu, až se… Columbie utrhne. Bezspoilerově mohu říct jenom to, že v tomto světě nejste prostě vítán (jste v něm doslova zakázán) a z náhlé změny atmosféry vám naskáká tak husí kůže, že byste na ní mohli strouhat ovoce. Přece jenom Columbie má být něco jako mýtický ráj a zakázané ovoce přeci chutná nejlépe a tak začíná vaše honba za krásnou mladou dívkou, která má ty nejhezčí herní oči jaké jsem kdy viděl.\n\nHratelnost hry patří mezi opravdové AAA prvky, které by měla mít každá hra s cenou nad dvacet euro. Bioshock Infinite má přece jenom stále titul „akční“ a to právem. Souboje jsou vám servírovány přesně na čas. Nečekejte to, že celu hru projdete pouze s prstem na spoušti. Občas budete mít dokonce i na výběr zda se probojovat nebo pouze projít. Při hraní si pamatujte, že násilí opravdu není vždy řešení! Ale když na to přijde, můžete nadělat z Columbie pořádná jatka. K dispozici budete mít na výběr několik kouzel (zde představených v podobě vigorů), které bude možno mezi sebou kombinovat a to jakýmkoliv způsobem k tomu budete moci ještě použít velmi rozsáhlý arzenál zbraní a to nejlepší nakonec… Elizabeth, dívka, kterou máte chránit, má určitou schopnost pomocí které, může otvírat brány do jiných světů. Navíc si můžete své vigory a zbraně vylepšovat což vám zajistí nikdy nekončící zábavu. Obtížnost hry se postupně zvyšuje stejně jako zamotanost příběhu a tak první dohrání hry určitě nebude vaše poslední a tak se nemusíte bát, že nevyzkoušíte všechny možné kombinace zabití, které vám hra nabízí. \n\nBioshock Infinite je opravdu akcí, dějem i dojemností nabitá hra, která nikomu neleze do zelí. Docela by mě zajímalo, jak by u takové hry vypadal multiplayer. Ano… možná by to už nebylo ono, ale to si mnozí říkaly, už když se dozvěděli, že by třetí Bioshock měl být v oblacích, místo pod mořem a jak to dopadlo? Hodnocení: [i] Až na výjimky kladné [/i] hovoří za vše. Zatímco ostatní FPS s každým novým dílem pomalu upadají do oceánu obyčejné smrtelné rudé krve, Bioshock s každým svým novým dílem stoupá nahoru a svou krev mění z obyčejné na královskou modrou a musím uznat, že mu to jde opravdu dobře.","timestamp_created":1416652925,"timestamp_updated":1416653117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":40,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.789594769477844238","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13038037","author":{"steamid":"76561198046514591","num_games_owned":313,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1421111790},"language":"english","review":"This game is amazing","timestamp_created":1416651086,"timestamp_updated":1416651086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13037781","author":{"steamid":"76561197990294604","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":6069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":18,"playtime_at_review":3633,"last_played":1660395415},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite:\n\nI do believe that this game deserves an in depth review from me. I consider Bioshock Infinite to be the greatest video game masterpiece yet made. It has made me view games \nin a different perspective. It has showed me that games can be a form of art. Bioshock Infinite succedes in everything that it does. It has taken game storytelling to the next level,\nit has renewed bioshocks gameplay and improved it and it has once again made the most facinating game world and setting. When all of it is mixed together it obviously makes an perfect game.  \n\n\nStory\nThis is where Bioshock Infinite truly shines, the story. You are Booker DeWitt (VA Troy Baker), a private investigator and a war veteran with a debt to settle. \nTo clear the debt you must rescue Elizabeth (VA Courtnee Draper), a mysterious girl imprisoned for her whole life in the sky city of Columbia. Simple as that, guess again.\nI was a lot of fun following the story especially Elizabeth on your side. She is the emotional center of the game and she is easily the most functional and best game follower ever made.\nIt is incredible how the character change throughout the game. How Elizabeth changes in the game is probably the saddest thing in this game. It might seem like simple and\nrelatively happy game, but trust me closer you get to the end, darker the story gets. Thing that amazed me is how Bioshock Infinite goes from a simple job to the \nunbelievable ending that none of us saw coming. \nThis is truly the most unforgettable and intense game story ever made\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=178743331\n\n\nGame World and Atmosphere\n\"What is Columbia if not a another ark in a different time\".Bioshocks are known for their unique game worlds and Bioshock Infinite delivers it yet again. Now it takes place in the sky city \nof Columbia and the year is 1912. Columbia is easily one the most beatiful and well made game worlds out there. During the first 20 minutes it feels ridiculous but yet amazing.\nAfter some time, your start to see how well is this city made, the rasist, xenophobic and the religious people makes the city feel so natural and alive. During the gameplay you will truly feel\nthat you are in a early 20th century utopia built into the sky.\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=135697019\n \n \nGameplay\nBioshock Infinite has largely improved the gameplay over bioshock 1 and 2. Guns are awesome and vigors (aka plasmids) are powerful. Combat is now more diverse, you can move rapidly through the battlefield with new sky-rail \nsystem. Guns in bioshock infinite are much more accurate and effective. Using then are much more fun then in bioshock 1 and 2 but this time you can only carry 2 weapons. Its both a good thing and a bad thing. \nProbably the best new thing in the gameplay is Elizabeth, She'll throw ammo, med kits and salts just the right time. She will even revive you if die and find you money when \nyou most need it. Another thing that Elizabeth can do is, bring you cover, turrets (etc) with her tears. A Tear is a rip in dimensional time and space, revealing an alternate universe.\nElizabeth isnt just a helping hand during fight. When you are out of combat she can lockpick doors and she is also a talented codebreaker. You will mainly be looting money, \ngears and infusions from the city. In a nutshell gameplay is fast and brutal but most of all, fun. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=178743607\n\n\nSoundtrack and Audio\nLike my pal Mr. Anderson once said \"One of the best soundtracks ever\".Bioshock Infinite has excellent musics and audio FXs. Music of Bioshock Infinite is driven by small string quartet style that feels lighter\nand brighter as you explore sunny environments. Quickly turning dark and menacing when things go wrong. Game also contains old timey covers of pop songs found here and there, such as, tainted love and fortunate\nson in a 1912 version. The sound effect sound absolutely mesmerizing. An firemen exploding his fuel tank, the ambient sounds of columbia or the punching sound of a shotgun. These are just great examples of amazing\nsound effects which are heard throughout the game. Only soundtrack and audio design equal to Bioshock Infinite is The Last of Us.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=135697091\n \n\nGraphics\nGraphics in Bioshock Infinite are stunning and extremely well optimized as well. Bioshock Infinite uses Unreal Engine 3 which explains the good visual quality and performance.

This one-of-a-kind FPS is just simply one of those extraordinary games that only comes around once every few years, and is a testament to the very best of originality and the art of game design.\n\nIf you did not play the original, don’t worry, as the story is seemingly very nicely contained. But if you play the Burial at Sea DLC, then I must say it is a must for previous Bioshock players who loved the story, as it is truly a remarkable experience that ties the whole series together in a way I would have never thought possible, and is singlehandedly the most transcendental DLC I have ever come across story-wise.","timestamp_created":1416572877,"timestamp_updated":1416572877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13025870","author":{"steamid":"76561198009884878","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":987,"last_played":1422269395},"language":"koreana","review":"흑흑ㅠㅠ 게임은 마약이 아닙니다. 예술입니다!","timestamp_created":1416567271,"timestamp_updated":1416567271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13025696","author":{"steamid":"76561198074404968","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":280,"last_played":1546799442},"language":"russian","review":"Отичный сюжет, запоминающиеся персонажи, харизматичный главный герой, няшка-стесняшка Элизабет.

Через несколько секунд он попадет в \"рай\", повсюду неимоверная красота, приветливые граждане, город, летающий в облаках, но вот не задача, тут многие белые люди ущемляют права чернокожих. И вроде бы ладно, хрен с ним (Опять же, извините меня), но вдруг вы становитесь врагом народа №1. И тут начинается... Спойлерить не буду, кому надо - пройдут игру, а кто-то уже все это знает.\nТеперь по пунктам, начну с минусов, т.к. их меньше (на мой взгляд):\n- Боевка, а именно стрельба однообразна и скучна.\n- Таков же и поиск лута.\nПлюсы:\n- Не ясно: что, как и почему, что  за люди преследуют нас (женщина и мужчина) на протяжении всей игры, что притягивает игрока, придает игре шарма, ее хочется проходить, хочется вникать в сюжет. (Даже после полного прохождения не до конца многие понимают, что и как).\n- Энергетики (Энергетики прокачки персонажа, его возможностей и т.д.)\n- Помощь Букеру от Анны Д. Взаимодействие с ней.\n- Сама героиня Анна Д. (Элизабет).\n- Графика просто шедевральна.\n- Музыка высший класс.\n- Игра берет атмосферой.\n- Ну и конечно же СЮЖЕТ и КОНЦОВКА.\nМоё впечатление об игре:\nСюжет, как и концовка, бесподобен. У меня нет слов, чтобы его описывать, игрок сам должен прочувствовать все эмоции, все, что испытывает Букер и Элизабет. Скажу лишь, что он очень запутан и эта не та игра, которую надо просто пробежать за 3-5 часов. Это своеобразная книга, в которой надо уделять свое внимание каждой мелочи. Вслушивайтесь в разговоры людей на улицах, в разговоры героев во время пострелушек и после них. Все это нужно, чтобы как можно лучше понять сюжет данной игры. Концовка непредсказуема. В конце у игрока так или иначе останется больше вопросов, нежели ответов на них.\nКасательно дополнений:\nМы получили дополнения, которые якобы помогают нам понять все, что произошло до этого. На деле, игрок еще больше запутывается в собственных мыслях и доводах. Но к концу более-менее, как и в оригинале игры, становится все ясно. А еще, в \"Burial at Sea-ep.2\" можно играть за  няшку Элизабет :)\nМоя оценка такова: 10 Элизабет из 10 (10/10), не смотря на ее вышеперечисленные недостатки. После прохождения игры и дополнений осталась чертова куча эмоций, которую я выплеснул здесь, спасибо за прочтение.\nP.S.
