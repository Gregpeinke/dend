I love the story from the views of a security guard at Black Mesa and that take.\n\nNow I remember back in 2005 when I first played Half-Life: Blue Shift it had DirectX 8 support and now with VALVe pushing Linux support and removing DirectX 8 from the Gold Source engine video games adding OpenGL support to the Gold Source engine video games I keep getting OpenGL errors every now and then and some freezing issues, which I do not remember ever happening with DirectX 8.\n\nHere is a screenshot of one of the few OpenGL errors I experience here and there. Followed by freezing of the video games that use OpenGL, before crashing.\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/887417416764768257/926930307003850792/OpenGL_errors_on_video_games_that_use_OpenGL_on_Windows.png\n\nVALVe please add DirectX 8 support or at least a more up to date version of DirectX 9 support which supports 64-bit, which is DirectX 9.0C I believe?\n\nSave game bug again encountered.\n\nOtherwise I cannot give Half-Life: Blue a positive review due to these technical issues, which I cannot seem to fix even if I reinstall Windows or Half-Life: Blue Shift.","timestamp_created":1641071434,"timestamp_updated":1641073023,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.609451234340667725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107084502","author":{"steamid":"76561198312056830","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":560,"last_played":1641072844},"language":"english","review":"cool but its too short","timestamp_created":1641070981,"timestamp_updated":1641070981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107061842","author":{"steamid":"76561198441383346","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":190,"playtime_forever":251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":251,"last_played":1641043423},"language":"russian","review":" ᠌᠌","timestamp_created":1641050791,"timestamp_updated":1641050791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107057010","author":{"steamid":"76561198868500458","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":38,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1638105485},"language":"english","review":"Feels more like a fan game","timestamp_created":1641046207,"timestamp_updated":1641046207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107054680","author":{"steamid":"76561198201729379","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":332,"last_played":1640961761},"language":"english","review":"Blue Shift is relatively short but still it covers/adds to the parts that are already seen/present in Half-life and Opposing forces.

É um jogo difícil sem necessariamente ser frustrante. Entretanto, se os gráficos ou a jogabilidade mais antiga não te agradam, hoje em dia existe uma opção extra se quiser experimentar a essência de Half-Life: o jogo chamado Black Mesa, uma reimaginação de Half-Life com permissão de desenvolvimento da própria Valve. É preciso informar, entretanto, que Black Mesa não possui nem a DLC Blue Shift, nem a Opposing Force.\n\n[b]REVIEW SOBRE A DLC BLUE SHIFT[/b]\n\nHalf-Life: Blue Shift é mais do mesmo, mas você joga com algumas armas diferentes e segue a história de um dos policiais/seguranças da Black Mesa, no mesmo espaço de tempo que o jogo original mas com uma perspectiva diferente. Enquanto o original se passa em, aproximadamente, dois dias completos (16 de maio de 200x e 17 de maio de 200x), Blue Shift se passa apenas em um dos dias (16 de maio de 20xx, com o final sendo bem breve na manhãzinha do dia 17).\n\nÉ interessante jogar se você jogou o original porque coloca em dimensão os lados diferentes da história e também o quão absurdo era o protagonista Gordon Freeman em comparação aos outros nesse mesmo universo. Além disso, algumas coisas que acontecem no original são explicadas em Blue Shift. Mas de novo, é mais do mesmo, se você não gostou do primeiro, evite as DLCs Blue Shift e Opposing Forces.\n\n[b]Half-Life: Blue Shift 7/10 - SATISFATÓRIO[/b]","timestamp_created":1640558643,"timestamp_updated":1640559539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106608833","author":{"steamid":"76561197987119320","num_games_owned":604,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":130,"last_played":1640553735},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life: Blue Shift is the shorter of Half-Life's two mission packs, clocking in at around 2.5 hours. While short, it's still worth the price of admission, particularly on sale (at the time of writing, you can grab it for 79p, an absolute steal).\n\nAs with Opposing Force, Gearbox manages to pull off an interesting campaign that provides gameplay which feels distinct from the main game. There are fewer scripted sequences than in Opposing Force, but what's here is still entertaining, with some great levels and encounters. Blue Shift also has the distinction of providing a more palatable Xen excursion than what can be found in both OpFor and the original Half-Life (though, that may be partly due to the brevity of it).\n\nBlue Shift has a more fun final scenario than Opposing Force, but its actual ending is a bit more pedestrian than the end of Adrian Shephard's tale, which has kept players wondering about his ultimate fate since the mission pack first released. Maybe it's the fact that we actually know what happened to Barney Calhoun thanks to Half-Life 2, but this ending is less likely to stick with you once the credits roll.\n\nOverall, this is well worth the price of admission as an enjoyable bit of Half-Life history and an engaging, if short, campaign in its own right.","timestamp_created":1640554326,"timestamp_updated":1640554518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559916138648986816","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106601586","author":{"steamid":"76561198323346502","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1640548133},"language":"english","review":"I
