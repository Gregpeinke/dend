The game play was fun yet challenging and the two main characters work extremely well together. Not just their characters, but the companion AI is near flawless with how well you naturally interact with her in battle. The story is great (even if the twist had already been spoiled or me) and there were a lot of good world building subtle touches that really hit your heart. The example that comes to mind is a voice log you find of a man who caught an enemy courier expecting an adult but caught a kid. The audio was honestly gut wrenching and I had to actually stop playing for a second to process it. That being said, there was plenty of wonderful comedy with the two leads.

Don't fall prey to the fanboy hype. Is it fun? Sure. But Bioshock Infinite suffers from a convoluted plot that does not make much sense and seriously repetitive combat. The setting is a departure from the earlier games in the series. Instead of being in an underwater city your character brawls through a cloud city-nation in the early years of the 20th century. It's an interesting mashup. But it became tedious after the novelty of the scenery wore off. Progression through the game's world felt limited and linear. The new gimmick is using a hook to whip around from point to point on tram rails. It did not do much for me. \n\nAs with previous Bioshock installments you have a few powers that you can choose to equip and upgrade but it's all the standard stuff. You are limited on weapon load out which I found to be disappointing, and they did not pack much of a punch until they had been upgraded significantly. There's a steampunk element to it all which is kinda hip, but for me the game really started to shine once I completed the main story and began the Buried At Sea DLC's. Both installments brought this full circle back to the earlier games in the series and that was a nice touch.\n\nGet this on sale including the Buried At Sea DLC package.","timestamp_created":1558307747,"timestamp_updated":1558309750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456255912780761719","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50728670","author":{"steamid":"76561198167987604","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":479,"last_played":1621525444},"language":"spanish","review":"¿por que buscas reseñas negativas?

Schon der Vorläufer Bioshock war herausragend. Für beide gilt: keine Ansammlung von überzuckerten Features, sondern eine perfekt ausgewogene Kombination aus Ambiente (Grafik, Sound, Musik), Gameplay (Waffen, Fertigkeitsmods, Strategie, Geschicklichkeit, Steuerung) und Story Line bzw. ihrer Erzählformen. Und die Geschichte ist dabei durchgehend konsistent und glaubwürdig! Für mich als narrativ-philosophisch veranlagten Gaming Veteranen ist das besonders wichtig. \n\nDas Gameplay ist anspruchsvoll genug um auch versiertere Gamer nicht zu langweilen. Lediglich die Fertigkeitsmods fallen etwas dünn aus. Nur vier Slots für ein paar wenige, mehr oder weniger nützliche Fertigkeiten, [spoiler]wobei im ganzen Spielverlauf nur drei Build Varianten hilfreich sind (Hauptteil: Electro/Gunfight, Comstock Rehab Center: Electro/Melee und End Fight: Invulnurability/Melee)[/spoiler].\nAber ich will ich mich nicht beschweren, denn zuviel des Guten würde das Ambiente zerstören!\n\nDie wahre Größe von BioShock Infinite offenbart sich allerdings nur dem, der eine Affinität zur Philosophie hat. Am Ende bekommt man einen InformationShock verabreicht, den man dank der finalen Ereignisse gar nicht sofort verarbeiten kann. Ich für meinen Teil mußte das alles erst mal ein paar Tage sacken lassen. Erst mit Erklärung der Handlung (Youtube) und erneutem Durchspielen bzw. Analysieren der verstreuten Hinweise wurden die Zusammenhänge im Detail klar. Glaubt niemandem, der behauptet, er hätte sofort alles verstanden! Das ist ohne Vorabwissen nicht möglich! Wahrscheinlicher ist, das derjenige die Tragweite der Geschichte überhaupt nicht überrissen hat.\n\nDas bringt uns nun gleich zu den DLCs. Die Meinungen respektive Bewertungen gehen da etwas auseinander und ich selbst hatte auch zuerst nur das Hauptspiel gekauft. Das war übertriebene Vorsicht, würde ich heute meinen, denn im Rückblick auf die Haupthandlung kann ich wieder nur eines sagen: Hut ab! Ambiente, Gameplay, Geschichte, Konsistenz: trifft 100% meine Erwartungen, die erwartungsgemäß schon recht hoch waren. Und wie bisher gilt auch hier : erwarte das Unerwartete! (Ist das jetzt eigentlich ein Widerspruch?!)\n\nWenn man schließlich auch das zweite DLC gedanklich vararbeitet hat - was dann schon schneller geht - wird einem klar, daß man ein Theaterstück vom Allerfeinsten in Drei Akten mitspielen durfte.

It does have cool gameplay elements with the addition of tears; which adds a whole level of variation to the combat scenarios. However it does take away the ability to hold all your weapons at once. (which is a little more realistic lol) The Vigors are cool and all have a unique ability that adds dimensions to the combat. Movement is good and is a little more fast paced than the previous games. \n\nOverall 3.5 / 5\n\nGraphics: They were really good and fit the theme of Columbia. I liked them they were in between realistic and cartoonish which creates an eye pleasing combination. \n\nOverall 4 / 5\n\nCharacters: I found them interesting and I thought that Comstock played a more active and menacing villian like that of Andrew Ryan. Elizabeth was interesting and had quirky dialogue. Booker was haunted and had some really good lines. These characters were more flushed out and relatable than that of the first 2 protagonists in the series. \n\nOverall 4 / 5\n\nScenery/Atmosphere: I really liked the scenery in this game it was like some patriotic art deco or something, but it was great. It really had character to it; it felt like a living breathing world in the brinks of destruction. It tackled social issues that were very present in the era and it really showed how bad things could be back then. But aside from that the overall atmosphere was insane the clouds and the colors popped and the architecture was well designed. It was an excellent sequel location to Rapture. \n\nOverall 5 / 5\n\nMy problems with the game were mostly the gameplay. I liked the gameplay of Bioshock 2 way more. But it is definitely worth your time to check out. I would recommend you play one and 2 first though; especially if you plan on playing the DLC.\n\nOverall Review 4 / 5","timestamp_created":1558145133,"timestamp_updated":1558145133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50694281","author":{"steamid":"76561198342647510","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3526,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1551,"last_played":1637535171},"language":"english","review":"it is a master piece","timestamp_created":1558143799,"timestamp_updated":1558143799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50693465","author":{"steamid":"76561198439981914","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":1060,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46,"last_played":1560076024},"language":"schinese","review":"神作","timestamp_created":1558138575,"timestamp_updated":1558138575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50688658","author":{"steamid":"76561198084313480","num_games_owned":306,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2533,"last_played":1558111994},"language":"french","review":"Ainsi, la boucle est bouclée. \nEffectivement, ne commencez pas ce jeu sans avoir fait les Bioshock 1 et 2 (avec si possible les DLC).\n...\nC'est bon ?

This is definitely going to be a narrative review and I wouldn't take a simple good/ bad as telling the story.\n\n    The fundamental problem is now starkly revealed.  The Bioshock games set up what would be superb environments for an RPG and instead gives us a FPS.  John Carmack's claim \"Plot in a computer game is like plot in a porn movie\" is now outdated - but not for FPSs.  As a result Bioshock Infinite creates an amazing new world, gives you a longish half hour to take in the sights, and then becomes an on rails shooter.\n\n   This is actually a bigger problem in Bioshock Infinite than the earlier games because your character knows a lot more than you do so the morality of the game becomes more problematic.  The opposition are generally set up to be unlikeable but not necessarily so unlikeable that your killfest is justified.\n\n   The graphics are beautiful but combat is a step backwards.  In the reverse of ultra dark environments there are now super brightly lit areas where enemies covered by glare can be accurately shooting you.  There's nothing particularly good in the weapons, some old favourites are gone, and the replacements for Plasmids are generally weaker, more awkward to lose,  and use more power.  You now have single health and power bars and can't carry med kits and hypos.  However this is offset slightly by acquiring a Halo like rechargeable shield.  The worst change is that you can now carry a maximum of two weapons.  Through most of the game this wasn't a problem since ammo and weapon drops were plentiful but there's a longish section where both dry up and I eventually got through on the clumsy melee attacks alone.  Outside easy mode this might not have been viable.  There aren't that many different kinds of enemy and certainly the variety seemed reduced from 1 and 2.  The new McGuffin is a melee arm that allows you to grab hold of overhanging projections and ride sky rails but the biggest impact is making map traversal that more awkward.\n\n    Loot is scattered around generously but I never found any of the more interesting stuff to which clues were dropped.\n\n   I'm sorry but I didn't like the story.  From the outset I didn't know why I had to do what I had to do and part way through something happens that makes you think - is this still even relevant ?  It also goes the slightly irritating route of you need to get B, but before you get B you need C, but then now you need D to get C etc.  There are also hints that undermine even the little you think you know - so the entire game feels like \"The Hangover\".\n\n   The game looks gorgeous.  The degree of invention is amazing.  The opening, combat less, thirty minutes show how much care was invested in the world.  But then you spend most of the next ten or so hours shooting things.  NPC interaction is as spartan as always - just so much more notably in a world where interaction is so much more feasible.\n\n   Bioshock Infinite on sale comes in at a price now where the game should be bought and played just to experience it.  Criticisms that an early controversial scene have no later relevance were simply false - that conflict drives the parallel story unfolding around you.  It's an amazing world that the devs have created and the FPS is ... okay.  TF 2, Depth - John Carmack is right - you don't need that much story and here the dissonance between the environment and you running around killing hurts the game.\n\n   The reality is that Bioshock's depth of creativity would work far better with a Mass Effect style RPG and Bioshock Infinite provides an amazing arena for second division sport.\n\n   Sorry.\n\nS.x.","timestamp_created":1558034013,"timestamp_updated":1558034013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482316911220550537","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50673964","author":{"steamid":"76561198378954461","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1225,"last_played":1632944327},"language":"english","review":"Really loved the gripping story it gave me. \nRPG style of it is kinda weak, the choices you make don't matter.\nPretty good FPS, in my book.","timestamp_created":1558025668,"timestamp_updated":1558025668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50673655","author":{"steamid":"76561197977269463","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":127,"playtime_forever":1834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1834,"last_played":1555271325},"language":"english","review":"gameplay -- A\nstory -- A\nsound -- A-\ndesign -- A-\nui -- B+\nenjoyment -- B+\n===\noverall -- A-","timestamp_created":1558024224,"timestamp_updated":1558024224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50672612","author":{"steamid":"76561198004038352","num_games_owned":1673,"num_reviews":217,"playtime_forever":690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1558020613},"language":"english","review":"I played this game for a while in 2013 then I stopped and didn't ever play it again since that time...

Ken Levine is great at disguising his trash political messages with a great looking environment and pretty colors, proving that nothing has to be really deep or meaningful but instead look nice in order for humans to buy it. On the surface, it looks like a great game and the gameplay is enjoyable but wayyyyy too easy, and no I'm not a 600lb gaming legend with a 240Hz gaming monitor. The gameplay is fun but it's a complete ripoff of Halo in every way shape and form, they even admit it through the introduction of rechargeable shields and even allow you to carry only two weapons for some odd reason. \n\nTHE CRAP STORY\nNow onto the worst part about this game that even Elizabeth herself admits when she yells \"IT'S JUST LIKE LES MISERABLES,\" which by the way is the worst possible thing to do for your story. That is pointing out the \"original\" story you're trying to tell is basically the same as another, the game knows it's just a ripoff and I swear I get a Dr. Who vibe from the Luteces who are apparently omnipotent with their reality bending capabilities but cannot just end the game by teleporting DeWitt to the end of the journey with Elizabeth in hand. Which leads to the next worst part of this game's broken nonsensical story which are it's plot holes, and trust me, there are a metric ton of them. Ken really tried to make this game appear cool and super deep but really it's a giant goop of nonsense that to the average idiot like yourself will seem ZMOG!!!!11!!1! SUPER DUPER DEEP!!111! You could make the argument that the Luteces were doing this as a giant experiment all along but if they're basically omnipotent and can travel through time, then wouldn't they know the answers to everything before it all happens? The ending is a complete mind flub as well, it makes ZERO sense as in it is a complete breakdown of any logic. Most will likely have to play the ending again to fully understand what happened, but I'll sum it up here, Booker is Comstock in a different timeline, Elizabeth is his daughter and given to the Luteces to create another omnipotent trans-dimensional traveler like themselves. Just one problem, instead of meeting Comstock at the point of which he was created, Booker fills in his role when they jump to the time Comstock was created, so the only way to kill Comstock is to then kill Booker so that he never becomes Comstock, which makes absolutely no sense when they could've just jumped into the timeline that would've killed him without killing Booker. Not only that, this whole story ends up being completely pointless because of the burial at sea DLC where Comstock apparently was never destroyed despite the events of the main game(so great, none of your efforts even mattered, what a story Ken). I really want to like this game because it is very visually appealing, but Ken needs to get a job as an interior decorator instead of making these nonsensical games.","timestamp_created":1557946806,"timestamp_updated":1557946806,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.396341443061828613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50659449","author":{"steamid":"76561198028193407","num_games_owned":327,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1371,"last_played":1585524597},"language":"english","review":"It has some major bugs, that may or may not affect your gameplay.
