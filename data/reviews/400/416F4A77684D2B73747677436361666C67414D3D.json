amazing game, however I'll note it here that the sequel is a lot better, despite what most people would say.\n\nIf you're coming into this game thinking it's a puzzle game: please, think otherwise, because in my opinion this is not a puzzle game.\n\nIt appears as a puzzle game, but if anything, it is more of a first person shooter that requires you to think a bit, however the game rarely ever becomes challenging.\n\nThe reason I say this is because the game goes through a cycle multiple times, where a mechanic is shown, 2 or 3 chambers is done on it, and a new mechanic is shown in a chamber with the same difficulty as the one from 4 chambers before.\n\nThis makes the game go from easy to hard, to easy, then back to hard, and you get the point.\n\nOnly the final few chambers actually fully become slightly challenging, incorporating multiple elements (except the turret chamber), however these chambers aren't even really puzzles, they're just levels that require precision and good timing to complete them, instead of thought like Portal 2 had.\n\nThis pacing is then ruined again by the 'Behind The Scenes' portion of the game, as I'd like to call it, where the cycle begins again with rocket turrets and then the final boss.\n\nIf you're looking for a puzzle game, for sure get Portal 2, but if you're looking for a first person shooter get this.\n\nDespite the heavy amount of criticism in here, the game I think is one of the most replayable games for that very reason, as it becomes less of a puzzle game and rather as a fun challenge you can play a number of times.\n\nPortal 2 overall is a better product than this due to it's longer length and massive amount of content it has, but this game is still fantastic and should be a must-buy.","timestamp_created":1634162088,"timestamp_updated":1636733868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101009555","author":{"steamid":"76561199121043753","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":372,"last_played":1636565780},"language":"english","review":"this

игра превосходна! Она продумана до мелочей, в меру сложна и у неё отличный сюжет. В игре всего 2 героя: вы и Glados. Ваша задача - решать головоломки и проходить игру всё дальше с помощью портального устройства.\nЭта игра заставляет думать вас совершенно по другому. Все другие игры достаточно однотипны и схожи. Здесь же нет ничего схожего с ними. Игра буквально меняет меняет ваш разум, к концу игры вы начнете думать совершенно иначе!\nИгра достаточно сложна для новичков, но пройдя пару уровней вы освоитесь и начнете чувствовать себя как рыба в воде. Однако, некоторые задачки всё-таки могут ввести в ступор, но хорошенько подумав вы легко найдёте их решение. Строго не рекомендую искать готовые решения, всю игру вы должны целиком пройти САМИ. Ведь для того она и рассчитана.\nОчень понравился оригинальный юмор в игре, оказывается даже роботы умеют шутить!\nАтмосфера в игре просто необычайна. Ни в одной игре не встречал такой затягивающей, необыкновенной атмосферы.\nМузыка в игре превосходная, есть и спокойные мелодии и динамичные. Графика в игре не шедевральна, но радует глаз, нет ничего лишнего.\nОднако у игры есть один большой минус - она очень короткая. Однако пройти её всё-таки стоит, ведь те чувства и эмоции, которые вы испытаете, пройдя её, надолго запомнятся вам. Ну а потом можно и в Portal 2 поиграть.

Графика в игре всё ещё смотрибельная и не режет глаз, особенно мне, человеку, который очень долго играл лишь в старые игрушки.\n\nИгра работает как аттракцион, показывает все преимущества и возможности движка, заставляет немного подумать и катит игрока по горкам до самого конца. Хорошая ли это головоломка? Да, особенно для меня, который чувствует себя дебилом. Она достаточно лёгкая, но и подумать пару раз придется.\n\nВдобавок к замечательной механической части, в игре присутствует харизматичная Эллен Маклейн, она же GLaDOS, которая присутствует в игре для того, чтоб развеять обстановочку и не дать игроку заскучать и с этой задачей, игра тоже справляется.\n\nИгре присущ приятный и лёгкий юмор, на ровне с чёрным юморком. Людей вроде меня это заставляет улыбнуться.\n\n[h1]Итог[/h1]\n\n«Portal 1» — отличный двухчасовой аттракцион на вечер, который пару раз заставит вас улыбнутся и, если вы всё ещё не знакомы с ним, так же как не был знаком и я — вперёд! Это хорошая вещь, периода, когда в Valve делали игры. Эталонная головоломка, которая заслужено стала классикой, геймдизайн и нарратив в игре просто божественны! Надо будет и с половинкой жизни ознакомиться.\n\n[h1]Что мне понравилось?[/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Механики игры.\n    [*]Финальная песенка.\n    [*]Графическая составляющая.\n    [*]Монологи GLaDOS, харизматичные реплики турелей. Даже жалко было их расщеплять.\n    [*]Отличный режим игры, который откроется после прохождения игры. Режим с комментариями разработчиков крайне хорош, надо будет пройти игру и в нём!\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Что мне НЕ понравилось?[/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Скоротечность. Будь игра дольше, она могла бы надоесть, но я действительно был удивлен, что игра столь короткая. Когда-то я ознакомлюсь со второй частью.\n    [*]Технические трудности, с которыми я столкнулся. Возможно, это не вина игры, а вина моего железа, но имеем, что имеем.\n[/list]\n\nТорт - это ложь, торт - это ложь, торт - это ложь, торт - это ложь.","timestamp_created":1633931817,"timestamp_updated":1633931817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.719775378704071045","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100877625","author":{"steamid":"76561198272003494","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1633925088},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1633925116,"timestamp_updated":1633925116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100874555","author":{"steamid":"76561199209891318","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1633893228},"language":"english","review":"This is an amazing game but it is kind of short, other than that the game is perfect! 10 out of 10!","timestamp_created":1633918877,"timestamp_updated":1633918877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100873178","author":{"steamid":"76561198847402557","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2016,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1510,"last_played":1634506211},"language":"spanish","review":"ta weno","timestamp_created":1633916076,"timestamp_updated":1633916076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100870817","author":{"steamid":"76561198038317862","num_games_owned":337,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":907,"last_played":1634586440},"language":"english","review":"I will never forget my first time playing this game; a desolate and sterile environment belie something unsettling and strange, 'Where am I?' 'What am I doing here?' 'Am I alone?'. I could not keep my eyes off the screen while exploring this game.\n\nIf you think that puzzle games aren't your strong suit and would normally pass up games like this, I implore you to give Portal a try. It's not only got great atmosphere, it also rocks a top soundtrack and the gameplay itself will change your perception of portals and have you think in ways you hadn't considered before. One of my favorite games in any genre and platform.","timestamp_created":1633911303,"timestamp_updated":1633911303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100870769","author":{"steamid":"76561199194691001","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1655172861},"language":"english","review":"Its pretty good ya know","timestamp_created":1633911208,"timestamp_updated":1633911208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhM+stvwCcaflgAM="}
