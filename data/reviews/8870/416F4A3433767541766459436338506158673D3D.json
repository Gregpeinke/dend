I may be in the minority here but I found this game underwhelming. Don't get me wrong I liked it but I didn't absolutely adore it like so many other reviewers. Here's why (spoiler free) :\n\n1. Storyline: This has got to be the most story rich game I have ever played. However, don't be fooled it is 'story rich', doesn't mean that it's going to satiate you in any way. It's going to leave you thinking but not in the \"man I need a joint and think about morality and life and spirituality\" kind of way but rather the \"wtf just happened, I need to wiki this shit right now\" kind of way. This can be both a good and a bad thing depending on the kind of person you are. I for one am a bit impatient and want to be instantly gratified at the end of the game having persevered through it all.\n\n2. Gameplay: They should probably have made a movie instead to do justice to this story. I  didn't enjoy the gameplay much. I felt that it was there just for the sake of progressing through the arc and nothing more. In FPS games I for one like to see attenention given to the array of weapons provided. I want to feel excited about unlocking a gun I really wanted or going through a challenging level all the while seeing my skill evolve. Sadly I didn't feel that about this game. The weapons were just there to take, the levels only involved walking a bit, a few random enemies, walk some more and just progress with the story. \n\n3. Replaybility:  As a logical corollory of the mediocre gameplay I don't forsee myself playing this game a lot in the future. Once you have beaten the game (especially in singleplayer FPS's) the thing that draws you to play again and again is the actual gameplay and that is for me a big disappointment here.\n\nSo all in all, your experience may vary greatly depending on what you look in a FPS. Are you here just for the story or does it take more to get you to keep coming back ? I still recommend this game it's narrative but not at this price point, wait for a Steam sale and then get the game.","timestamp_created":1471242280,"timestamp_updated":1471242280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24926946","author":{"steamid":"76561198045778304","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":950,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":950,"last_played":1471219977},"language":"english","review":"Simply Amazing","timestamp_created":1471236041,"timestamp_updated":1471236041,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24926510","author":{"steamid":"76561198087256970","num_games_owned":398,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1905,"last_played":1517654762},"language":"english","review":"This game is great.

Me lo he pasado del tiron en un dia, empezando por la mañana tempranito, en nivel medio. Total unas 11-12 horas de un domingo. Lo compre hace tiempo por creo que 5 pavos y no veas que chollazo, lo tenia aparcado y me lamento solamente de no haberlo jugado antes, porque es una maravilla.\n\nPuntuaciones:\nGraficos personajes 8  (60 fps jugando en 1080p calidad ultra con ocasionales caidas de framerate en algunas zonas a 40-45fps)\nGraficos entornos 8  (los escenarios estan muy logrados)\nMusica 7\nJugabilidad 9\nDificultad 7 (salvo algun detalle dificil puntual, en general es un juego facil en el nivel medio, moriras algunas veces pero sin desesperarte)\nIA enemigos 7 (decente tirando a buena, pero mejorable)\nHistoria 8 \nDoblaje 8\nGlobal 8\n\nEs un shooter facilon, no necesitas ser un aguila disparando, la dificultad solo es notable en algunos jefecillos que hay que son un poco bestias y que no hay herramientas para curarse en combate a menos que a la chica que te acompaña le de por darte una curacion que solo lo hace cuando estas casi muerto (tambien te da balas cuando te quedan pocas pero nunca suficientes). Ademas de la vida, que no se regenera salvo con comida o botiquines, tienes un escudo de energia que se regenera con el tiempo. Gestionando bien la cobertura no tendras problemas con la mayoria de enemigos.\nEn cuanto a punteria y apuntado es como los primeros Call of Duty o Battlefield que la punteria era legendaria, aqui igual, apuntas desde la cadera y le das a la gente bien sin esfuerzo. Esta pensado en esta aspecto para mandos de consolas, se ve claramente, porque con el mando no se apunta con la misma precision y velocidad que con un raton bueno. Probe con el mando primero pero el movimiento de camara me mareaba un poco y al final lo he jugado con raton.\n\nLa dificultad estriba mayormente en la escasez pertinaz de municion que no se puede apenas ampliar la capacidad (82 disparos con carabina, 180 con pistola, 150 con ametralladora, etc...), ocasionales hordas de malos en algunos puntos del juego y algunos bichos elites que te vienen en algun momento y que cuestan de matar bastante, como el handy man o el tio ese que va ardiendo y carga hacia ti. Me han recordado algunos bichos un poco a los headless bombers del Serious Sam por lo de cargar hacia ti a saco como paco jejeje.\nLos enemigos flanquean a poco que te quedes a cubierto un rato, tienen bastante buena punteria y aunque no son Guillermo Tell no puedes ir por ahi en plan rambo o duras mas bien poco, especialmente con los francotiradores que disparan muy bien. La IA de enemigos es bastante decente aunque las he visto mejores. Se ponen a cubierto un poco mal la verdad, no tan mal como en el Fallout 3 o 4 que se quedan con medio cuerpo a la vista los cantamañanas, pero vamos que no son ninjas tampoco, se les suele ver un poco la cabeza o un pie asomando y si apuntas bien les daras.\n\nHay un tramo al final del juego, como una hora o poco mas antes del final, que me han tenido literalmente media hora sin balas, he tenido que matar unos 25-30 tipos que te atacan a porrazos (afortunadamente no tienen pistolas) a golpes de melee, y por supuesto no tiraban balas para lotear, porque no llevan pistolas :P\nHay algunas luchas finales que lo mismo, la dificultad es mas tener balas disponibles para disparar que el propio enemigo en si. Solo te dejan usar dos armas asi que estas batante limitado tacticamente ya que si llevas un arma pesada tienen muy poca municion y no compensa mucho. Yo me lo he pasado con todo pistola y carabina y algo de ametralladora cuando me quedaba con pocas balas de lo otro.  Las balas de carabina casi nunca caen, te toca comprarlas y no veas lo poco que duran 82 balas en un rifle semiautomatico de disparo rapido. La escopeta me ha parecido un poco inutil como arma comparandola con las demas, tiene muy poca municion, 24 cartuchos o asi, y el daño es muy bajo para tener tan pocas balas, que necesitas 2 o 3 disparos para los enemigos normales y una jarta para los elites, que te queda sin cartuchos y siguen vivos, vamos. \n\nCon la salvedad de la escasez de balas y que solo se pueden usar dos armas a un mismo tiempo, para ser un juego de hace cinco años deja en mantillas a muchos juegos mas modernos que he jugado ultimamente. Las texturas son buenas y los movimientos de los personajes bastante fluidos. La ambientacion esta muy lograda y la historia es muy buena aunque me hubiera gustado algo mas larga, unas pocas horas mas.\n\nAñadir que el doblaje al castellano es muy bueno. Normalmente me chirrian las voces y las traducciones de andar por casa que se ven a veces (Fallout 3 jugue dos horas cuando lo compre y lo aparque muchos meses porque no soportaba las voces de algunos personajes femeninos, me taladraban el alma). Si el doblaje es malo o mediocre prefiero el ingles  pero en este caso es una delicia tal y como lo han hecho, no he notado nada raro en las traducciones y los actores de voz lo hacen muy bien.\n\nRecomendable 100%, sobre todo de oferta. Si le añadieran la posibilidad de usar una tercera arma equipada seria perfecto para compensar la poca municion que hay. Tendre que investigar a ver si hay algun mod.\n","timestamp_created":1471219463,"timestamp_updated":1471219463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24919919","author":{"steamid":"76561198272516125","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1599231682},"language":"english","review":"A Masterpiece even in 2016.. because of its art style.

I played the first Bioshock when it was first released, but for some reason I wasn't looking forward to Bioshock Infinite (a city in the sky? Ridculous). Because of that I didn't get it until about 18 months after release date.\n\nAfter I played the game, I immediatley wish I bought it opening day. Although some opinions are mixed as to whether Infinite is better than the original Bioshock, I don't think anyone can argue that the game isn't an outstanding game in its own right.\n\nArt / Graphics: \nThe graphics and the art style are fantastic. I first played the game on a really crappy computer, so I actually had to play it on low settings at 800x600, and it was certainly playable mainly due to how vibrant the art style is. On my current computer I can play the game on Ultra, and it looks amazing for a game that came out a few years ago.\n\nGameplay:\nOverall it's a pretty standard shooter. None of the weapons you get particularly stand out, but they are still fun to use. The Vigors (basically Plasmids from the first game) are fun to use and mess around with. They aren't necessary by any means, but if you heavily integrate them into your gameplay the game becames a breeze (difficulty wise).\n\nThe game doesn't have a lot of exploration; most areas are pretty straight forward, although I personally enjoyed that. There was enough to look for/look at without it feeling like I was wasting my time checking every corner or worrying that I missed something by not being thorough enough\n\nStory:\nThe story and chracters are the main reason I love the game.

But o'boy where they wrong. It's awesome!\nWhen i started playing i was nailed to my chair, and could not stopp playing until i had finnished the entire game. And this was on a sunday and i had to get to work the next day, but it didn't matter. When the credits rolled i looked at my phone and saw it was 4:30 AM, and i had no regrets. It's a game thats not as much about the gameplay, for me atleast, but the story! The story (which im not going to spoil) is like Inception on steroids. Afterwords you just sit there like \"Wow....  mind blown\". They could defenitly make a movie out of it (please do that and only stick to the original story. DON'T change stuff just to be able to make a sequal). There is only one complaint i have with this game and that is, that the game is too short in my opinion. 8 hours is not enough for me, when i buy a game i want to be able to squeeze atleast 100+ hours out of it. But im getting of topic. To sum up my thoughts on whether you should buy this game or not; If you like the story element of your games it's defenitly worth it, especially if you get it discounted. If you are just looking for a game to breeze through and shoot stuff maybe it's not for you unless, again, you get it on a steam sale.\nOverall a great game that i wished was longer. \nThanks for reading through this giant wall of text, and i hope it helped you!","timestamp_created":1471020929,"timestamp_updated":1471020929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24844830","author":{"steamid":"76561198255889514","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":3763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1267,"last_played":1476011037},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏实在太棒了，无论是剧情还是游戏性上都很新奇，也继承了前作的优点，剧情有些烧脑，是个凄美的故事。","timestamp_created":1471019409,"timestamp_updated":1471019409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506726443767547607","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24841607","author":{"steamid":"76561198148262767","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1004,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1004,"last_played":1455133197},"language":"german","review":"Was gibt es hierzu überhaupt zu sagen?

La jugabilidad es excelente y tiene mejoras con respecto a los anteriores BioShock, introduciendo los combates en los raíles, si bien podrían haber metido más de estos. La ambientación en Columbia es excelente, logrando superar incluso a Rapture, si bien algunos jugadores se han quejado de que Columbia no daba la impresión de ser una ciudad de verdad como Rapture. Probablemente esto se deba a la falta de libertad de movimientos: una vez superada una zona, no es posible volver atrás. Esto puede parecer malo, pero la gente se queja de vicio. Hay muchos FPS que no son mundo abierto y la gente los disfruta igual. Supongo que tener una ciudad como Columbia hace querer tener la libertad de disfrutarla como uno quiera, pero por el argumento, no tiene sentido que nuestro personaje pueda moverse libremente. De hecho eso es lo mejor del juego: el argumento. Para mí es sencillamente genial. Desde el comienzo pasan una serie de cosas extrañas. Uno puede ir escuchando grabaciones para saber más, y lo considero muy necesario, porque desvelan detalles esenciales, aunque en mi opinión ni escuchando todas las grabaciones uno está preparado para el final del juego. Sí, en este caso sólo hay un final, pero tiene sentido que sólo sea uno. ¡Y vaya final! No voy a soltar spoilers, por supuesto, pero es lo mejor que he visto y ha dado para infinidad de análisis en páginas y foros de videojuegos. En cierta forma la trama nos recuerda a series como Lost (Perdidos), pero afortunadamente en este caso todo queda mejor atado y explicado, incluso si hay diversas interpretaciones.\n\nAparte de la trama principal, es esencial el contexto de ésta: el primer BioShock era una bofetada al capitalismo salvaje, el segundo BioShock era una bofetada al marxismo-leninismo, y este es una bofetada al fascismo y el fanatismo religioso: Columbia en un primer momento parece idílica, pero en pocos minutos descubrimos su verdadera naturaleza: es una dictadura ultraconservadora y racista, dirigida por el Padre Comstock, donde los negros e irlandeses son considerados ciudadanos de segunda.\n\nEn cuanto al apartado técnico, como he dicho Columbia es espectacular, pero hay que resaltar también al personaje de Elizabeth, con una animación excelente.\n\nEl juego cuenta con dos DLC: Burial at Sea, partes 1 y 2, ambientados en Rapture en vez de Columbia, aunque enlazados con la trama principal de ésta última, y son interesantes.\n\nFinalmente, decir que si eres un experto en FPS, debes ir sin duda a por el logro de completar el juego en el Modo 1999 sin comprar nada en las máquinas expendedoras Dollar Bill. La primera zona puede hacerse un infierno (tardé una tarde entera en completarla), pero una vez superada empiezas a conseguir mejoras y la dificultad ya no es desesperante. El Modo 1999 está disponible si completas primero el juego en otro nivel de dificultad o si introduces el código de Konami en la pantalla de título.","timestamp_created":1470929944,"timestamp_updated":1470930048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24827326","author":{"steamid":"76561198169597427","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":817,"last_played":1469009275},"language":"italian","review":"Pochi giochi mi hanno emozionato come questo capitolo.
