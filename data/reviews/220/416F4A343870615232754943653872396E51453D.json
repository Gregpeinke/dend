This sequel did the same thing. It is amazing how much time Valve put into this game to make it an unforgettable experience. The game keeps you immersed all the time, with a perfect introduction to the Half-Life world. We get characters that are very likable, and a story that is easy to follow. Gordon Freeman returns to save the world from an alien empire known as the Combine. This game also introduces new physics, so you can pick up things. Also, for the 4 years they kept this game in development, they improved the graphics A LOT. This game still looks good to this day! \n\nThe gameplay is similar to the first game, shoot down enemies, solve puzzles, and jump around. Though the weapons are not as cool and creative as the first game, there are some pretty new and cool weapons introduced in this one. First, we have a high accuracy assault rifle that can also shoot balls of energy that disintegrates people. And then we have the most memorable weapon - the gravity gun. A gun that lets you pick up items and launch them at anyone, a pretty badass weapon that you'll find yourself using a lot. Another complaint with the gameplay is similar to what I said about the weapons. Not many cool and creative enemies. The main enemy you fight are just Combine soldiers with different clothes and weapons. Their AI is not as great as the Soldiers from the original game. I can't take the Combine seriously in this game, as they just let me shoot them down, making this game really easy.\n\nNext, the levels. The levels in this game are my favorite part. Every level is so different from each other. One time, you are escaping a zombie infested town. And then, you are controlling creatures with an alien testacle to break out of a prison. The levels are insane, and always feels like you are playing something different each time. Though I think the \"Water Hazard\" chapter was still good, it was the most confusing chapter to navigate through in my opinion. Towards the end, something amazing and satisfying is given to you, making your journey even more cooler.\n\nOverall, Half-Life 2 is an amazing game that every gamer should experience. It is a game that has aged really well, unlike the first (sorry Half-Life 1 fans), and even modern gamers can still enjoy this game. The experience is immersive, the characters you interact with are great, every level is different. And, you have a gravity gun (and your Crowbar!!). If I were to give this game a rating out of 10, it would be 9.5/10, probably one of the best games i've ever played.\n","timestamp_created":1523847813,"timestamp_updated":1523847813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41514072","author":{"steamid":"76561198042119228","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":882,"last_played":1444562174},"language":"english","review":"3","timestamp_created":1523837819,"timestamp_updated":1523837819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57744598388671875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41513782","author":{"steamid":"76561198260330822","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":79,"playtime_forever":610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":609,"last_played":1558894530},"language":"english","review":"Decent graphics even in 2018.

Понравилась она мне в том, что в ней есть сюжет, и сюжет глубокий.  Пересказывать не буду. Рекомендую в покупке этой игры. Я сам покупал ее на СКИДКАХ за 24 рубля (0,39 USD).  Как не как это шутер.  Игра  стоит  своих денег.  Также в игре присутствует мильтиплеер, ну как мультиплеер он в виде дополнения, которое называется Synergy. ССЫЛКА на Synergy ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/17520/Synergy/ ).Так же в игре присутствуют миссии, над которыми нужно реально мыслино подумать. Half-Life 2 это мир, в котором присутствие игрока влияет на все, что его окружает — от физической среды до поведения и даже эмоций как друзей, так и врагов.  Попадая в этот мир вы будете переживать, то что переживает ваш персонаж Гордон Фримен .И главное в игре есть физика: все объекты, начиная с пущенной по воде гальки и заканчивая двухтонными грузовиками, ведут себя естественно, полностью повинуясь законам физики с учетом массы, трения, силы тяжести и плавучести. \n\n Подеведем итоги:\n 1) Интересный игровой сюжет.\n2)Есть мультиплеер (Synergy)\n3)Игра застовляет думать.\n4)Отличная графика для 2004 года !!!\n\nСпасибо за внимание !\n\n\n\nThe English version of the review:\n\n1998.

Acclaimed for its advanced physics, animation, sound, AI, graphics, and narrative, the game won 39 \"Game of the Year\" awards and the title of \"Game of the Decade\" at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards, and is considered one of the most influential, innovative and significant works in the history of vidya gaems. By December 2008, over 6.5 million copies of Half-Life 2 were sold at retail (not including Steam sales), as of February 2011, it had sold over 12 million copies.\n\n\n Gordon Freeman is awakened a few years after the events of the prequel by the enigmatic G-Man, to discover that the planet is now under control by the Combine empire, a technological superior alien race whom in seven hours achieved to impose a right-wing dictatorship based on a brutal police state, biologically assimilating any kind of species, and preventing humans to reproduce via a \"suppression field\". \nOur favorite man graduated from MIT with a PhD in Theoretical Physics has now to join the resistance in an effort to restore the democratic civilization that once was the Earth, although this one does not have a central command structure, there are main figures such as Eli Vance, Barney Calhoun, Arne Magnusson, Alyx Vance, Isaac Kleiner and, obviously, Gordon Freeman.\n\nIn brief the core of the plot is a revision of the same chronicle of an outer-space invasion that has been repeated since \"The War of the Worlds\", but simply because similar stories have been told doesn't discredit this one, proving that you don’t need a complex or intricate history to create a deep narrative. Here, were introduced into a world where we can deconstruct the reality by observing it, we do not have immense dialogues or cinematics, everything is told by the environment. At the beginning no one tells us that totalitarianism is ruling, we got off the train and some robots take pictures of us, we see police officers abusing of poor citizens, ideological propaganda in favor of the current government, and so on; the Bentham's Panopticon is displayed all around for us to create immersion.\n\nWhat Valve tried to achieve with the prequel, referring to gameplay, here evolved beautifully thanks to the so-famous Source engine, bringing to life a world (almost) totally interactive with the user, with some physics that worked in the most realistic possible ways to imagine at the moment of the release. We can grab trash, bottles, wooden pallets, break the pallets into pieces, move the pieces, throw cans, and all of THIS, precisely, is a really strong component to the immersion of the story (as I said before) that wouldn't be possible in a flat world where the objects that surround us are merely immovable things attached to the floor; AI plays a really important role here too, but I'll talk about this in a review of \"HL2: Episode 1\" because I think it suits better since the interaction with NPCs is more present.\n\nNevertheless, Source engine wasn't used only improve the narrative, through the game we have a lot of puzzles that involve physics (like grab some bricks to create a lever in order to reach a higher point), or parts where depending on how we jump, shoot or hide can be very decesive to survive against enemies. If we combine (do you get the joke, hehe, Combine) the phsycs of the moving character in a particular envirovment surrounded by a specific type of enemy reducing the decisions one can make depending on what guns you have and the ammount of ammunition you carry. So, while we are going through Ravenholm (opponents that can't shoot, but are more fast, can climb, have special abilities and work in a different way when they attack you in groups; keep in mind too that at this point of the game we only have certain type of guns) is a tottaly different gameplay than, let's say, Nova Prospekt (this ones will only shoot you, and yes, there are some different kind of Overwatch soldiers but when they're on the offensive they work as a whole in contrast to the zombies whose actions are more individual).\n\nWith all of this said, I'm certain that this game, seeing it not as a mere commodity or a simple entertainment but as an artistic expression still young, but for this does not deserve not to be analized as such. Videogames are today something without a solid structure, or at least the developpers are not totally aware of how to translate the depth of other forms of art to this one, but here we got an example on what the future creators can use as a reference to bring to life what one day may become une œuvre d’art, ou un objet d'art, with all the words.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1523514401,"timestamp_updated":1557860213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.664672315120697021","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41428879","author":{"steamid":"76561198087539604","num_games_owned":241,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":3235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":36,"playtime_at_review":1838,"last_played":1660295900},"language":"english","review":"innovative but monotonous at times","timestamp_created":1523513906,"timestamp_updated":1633082800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41428594","author":{"steamid":"76561198082372708","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2692,"last_played":1644576504},"language":"turkish","review":"Mükemmel bir oyun zamanın eskitemediği hala gideri var.","timestamp_created":1523512000,"timestamp_updated":1523512000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41428393","author":{"steamid":"76561198051227320","num_games_owned":1312,"num_reviews":1238,"playtime_forever":2501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1240,"last_played":1630840628},"language":"english","review":"In his time, this have been innovation.
