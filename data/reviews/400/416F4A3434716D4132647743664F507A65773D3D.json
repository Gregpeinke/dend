Portal [/h1]\n\n[b] A Masterpiece Of Game Design...With A Few Flaws [/b]\n\n[b] Portal [/b] is quite possibly the most innovative 3D puzzle game ever made. While its sequel pushes the boundaries of 3D puzzlers as well as stories provided within puzzle games, it all started off with a small little game made in 2007 by a newer team at Valve. By providing a perfect step-by-step learning process for the player of each of the game's core mechanics, as well as an enjoyable (albeit short) story, [b] Portal [/b] has forever cemented itself as a turning point for 3D puzzle games. However, the game has some flaws to go along with its creative genius!\n\n[b] Portal [/b] has a pretty simplistic story, but it is pretty effective and raises a lot of questions for the player. The villain, GLaDOS, is humorous and wicked, delivering a slew of passive aggressive threats and condescending remarks as the player completes each puzzle. The tension begins to ramp up upon discovering the first \"The Cake Is A Lie\" message, instantly letting the player know that something is...off. While I do think the story is neat, it doesn't have a whole lot of \"bite\" to it. Once I finished, I definitely wanted more, but I also felt that not very much happened within the game. I solved some puzzles, fought a corrupt robot AI, and...that's it. In retrospect, I think the game could have gone further in the story department, especially with the anti-authoritarian sentiments that other Valve games like [b] Half-Life 2 [/b] explored. Still, the story is solid enough, and provides some reason for the player to be invested in the game's puzzles.\n\nThe gameplay is where the game shines. Each puzzle progresses in scope and complexity, introducing new mechanics and interactions to the player throughout a playthrough. The puzzles are expertly crafted, simple enough to allow a player to understand the puzzle's goals, while challenging enough to test the player's problem solving and deduction skills. My big complaint with this game is...its too short. The puzzles slowly ramp up in difficulty, and right when the game gets rolling in terms of unique puzzles...its over! While many more ideas were later introduced in the sequel, this title lacks a bit in terms of the complexity of puzzles contained.\n\nThe visuals are pretty nice considering the Source engine was a few years old at the time, and the design of the labs is still sleek and straightforward today. The music is minimal, but provides a bit of ambiance here and there for certain levels and events.\n\nThe bonus content is a mixed bag. The Advanced Levels are fantastic, really testing the knowledge of the core mechanics that a player has acquired throughout the game, but then flipping the rules into something new. It was much more satisfying to play through these levels than any other levels in the game! However, the Challenge Mode is not my personal cup of tea. There are multiple challenges aiming for the player to minimize their portals used, steps taken, and time spent for each level. There are bronze, silver, and gold tiers to each challenge, with 6 maps to play through (the same maps as provided in the Advanced Levels, minus the changes contained in that mode). While it seems enticing at first, it is far too much trial and error for many players to want to sit through, and many will resort to a guide if they really want to achieve the gold tier for each challenge. There aren't any real twists to the levels too, its really just \"be more efficient\", which I don't find particularly enticing after just finishing some cool remixes of other maps.\n\nOverall, [b] Portal [/b] is a definite [b] Recommend [/b] for anyone looking for a great 3D puzzle game. The mechanics are solid, the design is great, and the story is enough to get a player through to the end. This game could have used a bit more length to the story and a bit more extra content, possibly some extra sets of levels besides the Advanced Levels and Challenge Mode, but it is still a solid game at the end of the day.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 7/10 (Good) [/h2]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my curator page for my thoughts on a variety of other

пожалуй стоит с её сюжета, который начинается вполне просто и невинно. Игрок просыпается в маленькой стеклянной будке со всеми удобствами, где его приветствует холодный и безэмоциональный голос GLaDOS — ИИ, который управляет неким комплексом занимающимся исследованием порталов и их свойств. Её (именно так, это девушка, если компьютер вообще может иметь пол) механический голос будет вашим спутником на протяжении всей игры и не раз заставит от души посмеяться или же передёрнуться — черноты в юморе машины хватает. Что же остальной персонал, спросите вы? А он... Впрочем, это вы узнаете сами.\n\nС самого начала испытаний, в виде которых оформлен весь Portal, игрок увидит в действии те самые порталы, на которых построен геймплей. По сути, это две дыры в пространстве, которые связаны друг с другом. Объект входит в синий портал — выходит из оранжевого, и наоборот, при этом не меняя своего направления движения и скорости (относительно портала, конечно). Когда вы примерно поймёте, как работают эти переходы, GLaDOS любезно вручит вам портальную пушку — устройство, с помощью которого вы сможете сами их создавать (одновременно может быть лишь один синий и один оранжевый), тогда же и загадки в комнатах резко набирают сложность. Затем появляется ещё ряд дополнительных правил вроде стен, на которых порталы открывать нельзя, объектов вроде турелей, которых необходимо избегать или использовать в своих целях. Всё это приводит к тому, что к финалу игры у игрока искажается мировоззрение — то, что раньше было непреодолимым препятствием, теперь вполне может оказаться подспорьем, а само пространство уровней расширяется во много раз.\n\nНадо отметить, что большинство комнат можно решить несколькими способами в зависимости от того, как быстро, оригинально и независимо от обычных правил FPS вы сможете мыслить. Специально для этого в игру добавлены соревновательные режимы — пройти комнату на скорость, используя наименьшее число порталов и наконец делая минимум шагов. Поверьте, вы сами будете удивляться тому, как можно справиться с очередной задачей!\n\nЗвуковое сопровождение в Portal приятное. Треков не так много, но они точно передают атмосферу происходящего в игре, а голоса GLaDOS и тех самых турелек (вы ещё поблагодарите их за разговорчивость, когда встретите) выполнены на высшем уровне. Песня из финальных титров — Still Alive — в первые дни после релиза игры стала хитом, который вполне заслуженно запомнят ещё надолго.\n\nЗа графику и воплощение законов физики в игре отвечает уже зарекомендовавший себя движок Source. Надо отметить, что в архитектуре тут преобладает кубизм, но даже так игра выглядит красиво. Portal — один из примеров того, что технология должна просто позволять художникам выражать себя, а те уже придадут игре сколь угодно приятный внешний вид.\n\nУвы, но не обошлось и без минусов. Главный из них — краткость. Когда вы обучитесь обращению с порталами, комнаты станут пролетать одна за другой очень быстро, и вы наверняка будете слушать упомянутую Still Alive куда скорее, чем ожидали. Впрочем, это можно записать и в плюс — из-за своей миниатюрности (19 тестовых комнат, два с половиной персонажа и т.д.) в Portal нет ничего ненужного, вымученного. По моему мнению это намного лучше, чем если бы разработчики искусственно пытались растянуть игру, что почти всегда заметно невооружённым глазом и может вызывать сильное раздражение. Ещё некоторым может не понравиться, что тут нет даже намёка на сетевую игру, хотя оно понятно — сделать так, чтобы несколько игроков могли одновременно насиловать пространство, весьма и весьма сложно.\n\nИ, конечно же, как любую другую игру от Valve, Portal можно свободно было, модифицировать бы желание. В интернете легко находятся сотни новых уровней и \"полных\" модов, которые по качеству могут посоревноваться с оригинальной игрой, тем самым в разы увеличивая время, проведённое в обнимку с портальной пушкой.\n\nИтак, вердикт: Portal — отличная игра.  Оригинальная, как глоток свежего воздуха в море похожих друг на друга клонов: шутеров про террористов и РПГ про орков.

Tu manipules une femme, tu joues avec des trous, des objets pour un truc qui, au final, est un trop cher et trop court. Et pourtant, on y met quand même le pouce......comment je vais me sortir de cette introduction ? Je m'enfonce à, non ? Ah, ben ça y est, ça continue. \n\nVous incarnez Chell, une nana cobaye avec des amortisseurs aux gambettes qui va, d'une salle d'énigmes à l'autre, répondre aux expériences d'une IA à la fois drôle et terrible. Sous couvert d'humour noir, Portal est un jeu sinistre et intelligemment monté pour l'être. Le design du jeu est assez propret et froid, sans grande fantaisie. L'IA vous suit partout au moyen de caméras, les bureaux destinés aux humains sont vides, des messages d'un cobaye précédent vous avertissent de dangers. Bref, l'univers de Portal, ça craint à mort. On va jusqu'à ne pas caractériser Chell, ce qui est une bonne idée. Là où ce serait de la fainéantise de développeurs dans d'autres jeux, incarner une fille muette, cybernétisée et condamnée à n'avoir pour compagnon qu'une sorte de mère artificielle à la bienveillance improbable, c'est bien vu et génial. Sombre, mais génial. \n\nDans ce complexe où vous mènerez votre vie de souris de laboratoire, vous aurez une série d'énigmes à résoudre avec, à la clef, un gâteau à manger, eh ouais, rien que ça. Si les ficelles scénaristiques sont assez grosses pour remorquer une bagnole et qu'on peut avoir une certaine déception quant à une certaine timidité des concepteurs à aller au fond du délire, le gameplay et l'ambiance vous offriront de bons moments et vous saluerez Valve d'avoir mis de côté Half Life et Counter Strike pour créer un jeu sans arme de tir classique, ni forme de bourrinage jouissif. C'est intellectuel ici, vous ne pouvez que créer des portails et résoudre des énigmes. \n\nQuand je dis que ça offre de bons moments, c'est vrai, mais sur les 2 à 3 heures nécessaires pour torcher l'histoire. Le reste, c'est de la salle bonus au niveau de difficulté majoré ou des défis. Ou une version commentée par les devs des salles du jeu. Si vous êtes un chasseur de trophées ou que vous n'avez pas Portal 2 pour prolonger l'expérience, vous trouverez votre bonheur là-dedans. Sinon, ben c'est vite rangé comme jeu, malheureusement. Portal ressemble même fortément à une amorce du 2, bien plus généreux et ambitieux dans l'univers qu'il offre. Si bien que le premier opus n'est véritablement intéressant que couplé à sa suite. Visez le bundle aulieu de les acheter séparément. D'autant que Portal premier du nom est trop cher à 10 boules. Bundle et promo, sinon vous vous faites entuber. \n\nPour conclure, Portal est un jeu malin, bien réalisé et original. Il ne plaira pas à tous, vu son ambiance très artificielle et son côté énigmes enchaînées, mais il mérite son statut de classique du genre et vaut le coup d'oeil. Au pire, testez le 2 d'abord et servez-vous du premier comme sorte d'extension préquel. Je recommande ce jeu, mais pas à 10 euros et pas sans sa suite. On y perdrait beaucoup trop. \n","timestamp_created":1497984230,"timestamp_updated":1497984230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":53,"votes_funny":46,"weighted_vote_score":"0.818853974342346191","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32596856","author":{"steamid":"76561198153528911","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1590191329},"language":"english","review":"Boring","timestamp_created":1497977030,"timestamp_updated":1497977031,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.320959866046905518","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32596450","author":{"steamid":"76561198174461279","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":153,"last_played":1489729102},"language":"english","review":"you won't regret buying this game, just get it on sale, that's all,,,","timestamp_created":1497976061,"timestamp_updated":1497976062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32595187","author":{"steamid":"76561198396879459","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":428,"last_played":1530456966},"language":"turkish","review":"Bulmacalar 17,18,19'a kadar basit ama ondan sonrası gayet güzel","timestamp_created":1497973059,"timestamp_updated":1524758828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32589797","author":{"steamid":"76561198380038169","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":420,"last_played":1493008327},"language":"english","review":"Portal hit the market on October 9th, 2007.

It’s one of those games that define video games as a whole, on a tier similar to Super Mario Bros. I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of people picked it up just to see what all the fuss was about. Though, even if that’s not enough for you to get this game, I can assure you that it’s definitely worth picking up on its own merits besides its popularity.\nAs the name suggests, Portal is a game about portals. You walk through one and come out the other. The concept, while somewhat hard to explain, is easy to pick up (pretty sure the store page has a neat little video showing it). However, most of the game has you creating your own two portals on most surfaces to solve puzzles. The game is actually rather direct about where to place portals (you’ll see isolated portal-able surfaces very clearly a lot of times), but finding out the sequence of events of when to place the portals there and what goes through it is where the puzzle-solving aspect comes in. The difficulty of puzzles goes up rather nicely as the game progresses, and any moment I got stuck wasn’t frustrating or too out there…I just had to plan ahead. And this game is literally about puzzles; you’re in a test chamber designed entirely around using the portal gun, which means there are no convoluted puzzles involving a changing environment or the like.\nPortal’s cool portal concept to solve puzzles could’ve carried the game alone, but on top of it all is a story. While the story about you being a lab rat and the robot putting you through all the tests (named GLaDOS) is a thing, the game got a lot of its fame from its great writing. A lot of the game’s writing is her coming up on the intercom and teasing you. I assure you, it’s hilarious. \nThe only real downside of this game is its length. It can be beaten in only a few hours even if you struggle through puzzles. While it’s short, it definitely doesn’t just feel like a tech demo for the portal gun concept; it’s a full game. Just a short one. Some might argue it’s just the right length, but I found myself at the climax and thinking, “Aw, it’s already almost over?”\nEven if the game is short, though, that doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing. No part of it feels like it’s dragged out. I’d definitely pick this up, not only just to see what all the hubbub is about, but also because the game itself is a solid package.","timestamp_created":1497713736,"timestamp_updated":1497713736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5561981201171875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32506987","author":{"steamid":"76561198318336875","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":167,"last_played":1499473573},"language":"english","review":"BEST GAME EVER\n","timestamp_created":1497711075,"timestamp_updated":1497711075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32506540","author":{"steamid":"76561198123205081","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61,"last_played":1513976480},"language":"english","review":"Is pretty fun","timestamp_created":1497710259,"timestamp_updated":1497710259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32505093","author":{"steamid":"76561198006568794","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":6688,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4546,"last_played":1620065899},"language":"english","review":"I CANT WHATE INTILL PORTAL 3 COMES OUT\n","timestamp_created":1497707303,"timestamp_updated":1497707303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32503165","author":{"steamid":"76561198372669936","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1766,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1643,"last_played":1600000256},"language":"english","review":"Portal is a very complicated game, it is brilliant in every way I can think of and still has a dark and humorous story that makes you want to play this game again and again.\n\nThe first time was very interesting, but after playing it once I still felt like I could play it again and still find new areas and make new connections to understand the story and dialoge more.\n\nOne of the best things about this game is all the achivements, I have played the story four or five times and I'm still trying to finish some of the challenge levels.\n\nAnother great thing about this game is the commentary mode, after playing the story you can play it again and listen to what the developers had to say about different parts of the game, things they had trouble developing or explaining why things are the way they are, in some levels they even revealed alternate ways to solve the puzzles.\n\nThe ending felt both like a surprise and a brilliant ending for the game, it was sad and happy at the same time.","timestamp_created":1497702771,"timestamp_updated":1511611979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32493414","author":{"steamid":"76561198124317998","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":801,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":636,"last_played":1613363264},"language":"english","review":"This is a great game.
