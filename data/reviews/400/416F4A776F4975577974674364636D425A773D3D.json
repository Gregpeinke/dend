Обожаю атмосферу этой игры, GLaDOS и её речи (и её финальную песенку, конечно же), турельки, тайники и надписи оставленные кровью... Куб-компаньон в моем сердце навеки! ОБОЖАЮ ТОРТИК!!!\nВо время игры мы видим на ногах героини странные преспособления, и в игре, на сколько я помню, ни разу не говориться что это вообще такое и зачем, и только из второй части мы узнаём, что эти преспособления нужны, чтобы с высоты безопасно падать...

And while I think that the second entry to the series is objectively better, the first entry is still a must play and provides a completely different experience than its sequel(or other \"portal-esque\" games for that matter).\n\nThe gameplay is, as you would expect, about portals and solving puzzles with them. As you progress, more and more elements are introduced one after another, making the game progressively more difficult, but it never feels overwhelming. When you get stuck for a long time and eventually figure out what you are supposed to do, it never feels like it was the games fault for not explaining its mechanics well enough or not showing you every important piece at play. There are some bugs here and there, but thats pretty much expected from a 14 year old game and none of them make the game unplayable.\n\nTalking about level design, I would say that the difficulty here is a bit higher than what you would find in Portal 2, but do not expect anything that is too complex. Also in comparison, there is a lot more moments that test your quick thinking making aperture science feel a bit more dangerous, but at times it can also lead to an unfair death. Once you finish the game, you gain access to challenges that either change layouts of some of the levels, or require you to finish the level with a limited amount of time, portals or steps taken. While the latter might not sound as exciting, it really forces you to think outside of the box, often making you come up with completely new solutions to previously solved problems.\n\nNow as for the atmosphere, this is where Portal truly shines. The old Source engine has the tendency to make people feel as if they were being watched by someone even with nobody around and this is the one game where it is narratively true. Going through the desolate yet clean test chambers and then the less clean parts of the facility always manage to make me feel that exact feeling even after dozens of hours of playtime, and I think that that is why this experience is so unforgettable for me and so many other people.\n\nWith all of that overly positive stuff said, the story is good and nothing more than that. It does its job but if not for the great writing and storytelling(including, at the time working, ARG website), it would not be that memorable. The graphics are good for its time but not that impressive nowadays, and... the only other \"negative\" thing that I can think of is that it was too short, ending after about 3-5 hours on the first playthrough.\n\nOverall Portal is still one of the best puzzle games ever made and my bias for it will probably never change. While the sequel is better in a lot of ways both objectively and subjectively, the first game still has a lot to offer and is an absolute must play.\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1479971857,"timestamp_updated":1619390873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27058075","author":{"steamid":"76561198030025632","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":88,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":88,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1479971797,"timestamp_updated":1479971797,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27057921","author":{"steamid":"76561198268000260","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":153,"last_played":1588383232},"language":"russian","review":"Круть","timestamp_created":1479971754,"timestamp_updated":1479971754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27055807","author":{"steamid":"76561198134354652","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":291,"last_played":1527360270},"language":"schinese","review":"无与伦比的创意，绝对值得拿下“时间考验”奖","timestamp_created":1479971165,"timestamp_updated":1479971165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27054995","author":{"steamid":"76561197970466143","num_games_owned":644,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":29,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Portals!","timestamp_created":1479970945,"timestamp_updated":1479970945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27054377","author":{"steamid":"76561198107904972","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":275,"last_played":1469125854},"language":"english","review":"i dont like puzzles a lot. but daaaaammm dis is fine\n\noldie but goldie","timestamp_created":1479970777,"timestamp_updated":1479970777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27052087","author":{"steamid":"76561198184503215","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":69,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":69,"last_played":1449846121},"language":"schinese","review":"that's amazing","timestamp_created":1479970154,"timestamp_updated":1479970154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27050895","author":{"steamid":"76561198161694560","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1502102271},"language":"english","review":"ITS PORTAL!!!
