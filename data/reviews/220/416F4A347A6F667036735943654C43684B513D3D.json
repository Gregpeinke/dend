And I played this game for the first time last month.\n\nHealth-pack-based health instead of regenerative-hide-behind-cover-based health, you can and will carry more than 2 guns at a time, and even though there are probably about 12 to use all at once, you get used to them as you get them, and they're all unique in an immediately recognizable way, so you know which ones are better for certain situations, and which ones are objectively terrible and should be used in case of emergency.\n\nEach area offers something new to enjoy, so the gameplay never offers a sense of monotony. \n\nEven the graphics are well done enough that you don't notive this game is a decade old. At least, I didn't.\n\nI only have two problems: The abundance of aircrafts you have to destroy with the missile launcher (it's a little much), and the confusion of the story.
