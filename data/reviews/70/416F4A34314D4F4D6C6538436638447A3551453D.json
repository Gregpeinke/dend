Level design, story, pacing, gameplay fun and variety - all of these things kept me hooked into playing it. \n\nI'm someone who has never played any Half-Life games until this one in 2019, so I had no worries about nostalgia making my playthrough of the game biased. To me, it still holds up even over 20 years later. The game gives you the perfect amount of puzzles and combat, and manages to place them in a way that feels natural. Just went through a long gunfight? You'll now have some downtime to relax and focus on solving a puzzle to progress. Just picked up a new weapon? Here are a few familiar enemies to test it out on. \n\nI'm glad that there's much more Half-Life content ready for me to enjoy.","timestamp_created":1577093723,"timestamp_updated":1577093723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":71,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.819663822650909424","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60374900","author":{"steamid":"76561198079199590","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":482,"last_played":1580883889},"language":"english","review":"I've never played the first half life game untill now in 2019, new years is soon so its almost 2020.

You are some dude who works with large amounts of those ILLEGAL drugs in an over-sized test chamber. Sadly though the drug actually had a massive wormhole in it so now aliens that are for sure not budget face huggers are out to murder everybody in the facility, as well as a squid bull chicken, a dog with 20 eyes, slaves, floating slave controllers, generic aliens who might have a hornet nest growing inside of them, and some big baby or something, Also some dude who might be stalking you for whatever reason. Luckily for you, you actually went to boot camp and got trained to use every weapon stored at the Space X ILLEGAL drugs lab AND an alien glove that might have just put a hornet nest inside of you. Halfway through your journey to the surface the AMERICAN AIR-FORCE SHOWS UP AND MURDERS EVERYBODY WHO ENTERS THE SPACE X ILLEGAL DRUGS LAB. They're very stupid though so don't worry. BUT THEN THE AMERICAN GOVERMENT HIRES MANY HITMEN TO KILL YOU BUT THEY ARE STUPID AND CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMERICAN AIR-FORCE AND YOU. Then you murder them but then some dudes are like, \"Please kill this giant baby in the border world else earth will implode.\" So you do that in the most tedious chapters of your life (aside from gonarch's lair. that chapter is good.) After destroying the giant baby the dude stalking you offers a deal and threatens to kill you if you decline.

while 4 hours may seem like a fairly short time to critique a game, here are my initial thoughts. After all, I have a feeling that I may no longer play this game or I may not even finish this game entirely. There are a lot of things that this game has done to earn my respect. The mobs you encounter in the game are creepy even for 2019. There are times that i almost shit myself looking at the mobs. The weapons are plentiful and truly in this game did i realize that player choice is plentiful as well. I could choose to speedrun the game entirely skipping out on enemies or try to not get hit at all throughout the entire game. However, I do feel that there is a flaw. That flaw is that this game; it did not age well. The character you control slides around the map like butter and many times did i die a stupid death because of it. Not to mention that some puzzles require you as the player to move quickly. Combine that with the movement of a butter melting in a pan and you'll find yourself dissatisfied at the end of the stick. Sure, if i stick through it and finish it, i might find myself actually enjoying the story it has to offer but at the end of the day I wouldn't recommend it. Unless, you whoever is actually taking the time to read this review of an old game (in which case thanks) has been gaming primarily on PC with a keyboard and mouse setup for almost your whole life, then go and buy it. I assure you, you might enjoy it. But as for me, as a person who has gamed primarily on consoles, its a hard pass for me\n\nTL;DR Buy the game if you have been gaming on PC your whole life or enjoys FPS games. \n","timestamp_created":1577034404,"timestamp_updated":1577034404,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50211644172668457","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60329658","author":{"steamid":"76561198141878483","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":465,"last_played":1595879927},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito brabo, matar coisas quadradas","timestamp_created":1577033786,"timestamp_updated":1577033786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60328900","author":{"steamid":"76561198974090648","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":248,"last_played":1646947255},"language":"spanish","review":"hermoso buena historia y alto suspenso","timestamp_created":1577033090,"timestamp_updated":1577033090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60328340","author":{"steamid":"76561198304655486","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":443,"last_played":1613552582},"language":"koreana","review":"스토리도 좋고 재밌는데 그래픽이 토나와서 못하겠음","timestamp_created":1577032562,"timestamp_updated":1577032562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60326153","author":{"steamid":"76561198954121698","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1061,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":384,"last_played":1656004073},"language":"russian","review":"kooooooool\n","timestamp_created":1577030421,"timestamp_updated":1577030421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60325874","author":{"steamid":"76561199007587974","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1730,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1628636034},"language":"english","review":"this game is a good one 10/9","timestamp_created":1577030165,"timestamp_updated":1577030165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60325617","author":{"steamid":"76561198796717921","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":216,"last_played":1578823372},"language":"russian","review":"Класика.
