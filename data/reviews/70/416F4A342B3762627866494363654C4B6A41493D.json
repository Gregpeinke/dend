不朽的神作，理应名垂青史 [/h1]\n很早以前就一直听人吹《半条命》或者说《半衰期》有多牛逼了，什么反恐精英只是它的一个mod都能这么牛逼、第一次在FPS中融入剧情、G胖怎么一直不数3之类的传言，如今终于有空体验一下这款游戏，可以说，完全不是徒有虚名。\n\nV社的这几个系列的单机游戏都有着很鲜明的特色，包括《半衰期》《传送门》《求生之路》，首先都是FPS（或者类FPS）、都没有太多的过场动画、都有着十分优秀突出的关卡地图设计和环境叙事能力[spoiler] 还有都挺晕的 [/spoiler]。V社最擅长的就是，将你置身于一个世界中，不会用一大段动画告诉你从哪来到哪去，而是让你按照制定的路线或场景自己去探索、理解这个世界，进而越来越沉迷其中。其实现在看来这跟《网络奇兵》《耻辱》这种沉浸模拟类游戏是有点相似的，都非常强调沉浸感、游戏性、关卡设计，只不过V社的游戏相比之下自由度并没有那么高，基本上是完全线性的。以前通关传送门的时候还没有这种认识，但是如今这种游戏玩的比较多了，突然就感觉到其中的独特和牛逼之处了。这种游戏无论对关卡设计师、地图设计师还是编剧、世界观构造者都是一种很大的考验，而且对所有游戏开发人员的合作程度要求很高，如果少了其中任意一环，这种游戏都是达不到理想中的效果的。20个小时通关，回想起来其实地形和人物素材并没有那么多，场景也大多在狭小的室内，谜题和敌人的种类也没有达到让人眼花缭乱的地步，但是从头玩到尾就几乎没有感觉到任何的重复感。想想也知道，这游戏本身这么容易让人晕，如果再加上给人一种重复和粗制滥造的感觉，我想几乎不会有人能坚持玩下去，更别说通关了，想必也会是无人问津、多半差评，但是它却做到了完全相反的效果，可见游戏制作者们在各种设计上花了多么大的心思，此种匠心之下游戏不火、天理难容，看到最新的《半衰期：艾莉克斯》的火爆和好评如潮，也许证明了V社仍然宝刀未老，只要他们愿意做单机游戏，一定还是能做出来更多的神作的。这里就不点名对应的反面教材了，想起来就来气，对于制作游戏这种如此值得尊重的行为搪塞应付复制粘贴了事，只想着如何利用现有资源榨干剩余价值捞金，活该财报难看、活该不得人心。\n\n话说回来，如今市场上流行的单机游戏似乎都在逐渐走向一个趋势——电影化，甚至出现了不少完全电影剧集式的选择取向类游戏，本人作为一个剧情党其实是非常喜欢的，但是玩过这类游戏之后不禁产生一个疑问：它们真的还能算是游戏吗？或许传统的只注重游戏性而没有剧情故事的游戏终将走向消亡，但是半衰期这种优秀的叙事方式也许在今天仍然值得业界学习。这就是经典称之为经典的原因吧。\n\n说回游戏本身呢，现在看来画面确实是比较过时的，再加上操作手感十分滑腻，戈登的脚底下像抹了油一样，同时游戏场景又多在室内，就导致很容易晕3D，我虽然玩过很多fps大部分都不晕，少部分刚开始晕但是习惯了就不晕，但是玩这游戏还是晕得不行，而且是从头到尾都一直有点晕，一次不能玩超过2小时否则就真的顶不住……可能这也是很多人的劝退点。还有些就是操作问题，我一直搞不懂cs或者半衰期到底怎么能保证平安爬下梯子而不是摔下梯子的，跑快一点没蹭到梯子就直接摔死。游戏本身没有字幕，但是有中文弯弯配音，可以听出来已经很努力在说普通话了，有点喜感。\n\n总结：只适合适应此类游戏的老玩家或者不容易晕3D、喜欢情怀类考古老游戏的新玩家，其他玩家还是敬而远之就好了吧233，云个剧情也是可以的。","timestamp_created":1591804463,"timestamp_updated":1591804463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":38,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.819975137710571289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70583519","author":{"steamid":"76561198941299392","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":959,"last_played":1590178726},"language":"english","review":"~

It still has legs, the puzzles are a lot harder than I remember and the levels are challenging without feeling too repetitive.  The atmosphere really draws you in, and the tension just never lets up.  No such thing as an 'easy' enemy either, even the most basic monster can be deadly if your health is under 40.  Look, it's dated in terms of graphics obviously, but don't let that deter you - you'l hardly even think about that once you're about 6 levels into the game.  It's easy to see the roots of the modern Wolfenstein in this game, as well as other shooters such as Prey.  Heck pretty much outside of Doom and Quake, HL is the most influential FPS of all time.   I never really got into Counter Strike, and I'm not a multi-player guy, so for me, I cannot comment on those aspects of the game.  But as a solo player in 2020, HL is well worth your time and money.","timestamp_created":1591773142,"timestamp_updated":1591773142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70570006","author":{"steamid":"76561198970846346","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1634,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1202,"last_played":1651925459},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая игра в мире.

With games like Dark Souls or Bloodborne where being challenging is apart of the experience, Half Life is difficult with the sole purpose of being a throne in my side. I'm currently at Surface Tension, and stuck in that room with like a million trip mines. Every step I take I blow up out of nowhere. This game autosaves at some of the most inconvenient times, it's so easy to die to the point a damn ball point pen could kill you, it has the most clunky controls I've ever seen (I acknowledge that it was made it 1998 but I've played games of the NES with tighter controls) if you fall six inches off the ground you lose half your health, ECT. I'm not even having fun playing Half Life anymore.

The mechanics are HORRIBLE. A good majority of the game requires you to jump on the tiniest of ledges and if you so much as move a centimeter you fall and have to keep repeating the steps. Since your character takes quite large steps falling is inevitable. Long jumps are even worse since you often times barely make it onto the ledge you're trying for and will probably try to correct yourself to prevent falling which causes you to fall and, you guessed it, START OVER. Because of this, the rooms you are teleported to at the end of the game are too time consuming and FRUSTRATING.

Vents which you are supposed to destroy do nothing when you wail on them with the crowbar. The signs on some of the environment (ex: \"Tram Power offline\") actively mislead you.

Creo que seria suficiente decir que es el juego que revoluciono los FPS por allá en el 98. Una joyita que aunque su historia no sea la gran cosa, si esta MUY bien ejecutada y llevada a cabo. La forma en la que te mete de lleno en las instalaciones Black Mesa, en la cascada de resonancias con todo lo que eso arrastra y, finalmente el mundo fronterizo, a base de scripts en tiempo real desarrollando un entorno y escenarios vivos... es un lujo realmente. \nHablando en nivel gráfico, lógicamente hoy ya no cumple las espectativas, pero eso no quita que la experiencia sea muy satisfactoria y sumamente divertida. \nUn punto (de los tantos) a destacar de este juego que, a mi personalmente me encanta, es la habilidad que tiene de darnos ese aire solitario que lo caracteriza tanto. Ese ambiente solitario y la ausencia de aliados en muchísimas partes abunda, haciendo que la experiencia sea mas rica y se sienta esa cosa de que estamos recorriendo lugares hostiles con el fin de escapar de ahí... algo que pocos juegos logran estos últimos años. En fin, merece la pena? COMPLETAMENTE. Un juego que amo y fue parte de mi infancia.","timestamp_created":1591515248,"timestamp_updated":1591515248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70426100","author":{"steamid":"76561199012380348","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1828,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":378,"last_played":1652597502},"language":"schinese","review":"歪瑞古德","timestamp_created":1591512324,"timestamp_updated":1591512324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70424958","author":{"steamid":"76561199058019161","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":970,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":970,"last_played":1591509880},"language":"english","review":"first game I played when I started pc.
