The irony is that the final product seems to have less content and not be of as high quality as the Deleted Scenes.\n\nCondition Zero itself is simply an ordered series of bot matches across many counter-strike maps. You can recruit bots using points won by winning matches which is pretty nice as it allows you to have some level of control over team management.\n\nWithin each match you have individual goals you must complete like 'kill a certain numbers of enemies with a particular weapon' or 'rescue a certain number of hostages'. These are presumably to try and force the player to vary their gameplay, but most of them end up just being frustrating and annoying to complete. \n\nAnother frustrating feature is that if you die, there's no 'control bot' option like in CS:GO, you are instead forced to watch the bots play out the rest of the round. As I'm sure you can imagine, watching this can be very painful indeed, and it is also very frustrating and time-consuming. \n\nThere is also a multiplayer component to Condition Zero, which is simply the same as in the original CS. There are surprisingly a significant number of populated servers, and it is very easy to simply jump onto a server and start playing. However if the multiplayer is the main component you’re after, it would be wiser to look into .6 as its playerbase is a lot, lot bigger.\n\nDespite its flaws, Condition Zero is overall still a pretty fun game though.\n\n\nDeleted Scenes however is a very different game entirely. It is a group of many call of duty style singleplayer missions. Although they are in the style of newer games call of duty, they still retain all the elements of classic counter-strike games, such as hitscan weapons with no aiming down sights and a fixed health percentage with no regeneration, as well as that classic GoldSrc ‘feel’. This in my opinion means that the game has a really interesting and unique feel to it.\n\nThe missions can be played in a pre-set order, however they aren't related in terms of context or story at all, each is its own separate unrelated 'episode' if you like. This might sound like a flaw to the game, but personally I believe it is a benefit as it means that each level can go in a different direction and is unique from the others. \n\nThe gameplay mostly consists of call of duty style missions. Although the main overall gameplay is the same in all missions, the individual nature of each mission means that are all varied in terms of settings, plots and structure. For example, some missions contain lots of stealth sections, some require you to use various tools and gadgets like snake cameras, radios and explosives to progress whereas others contain boss fights against enemy leaders or vehicles. \n\nThe levels are all of a perfect length too. You can easily complete a mission in one sitting, yet it'll still take you a reasonable amount of time to do so, allowing them to have a structure. \n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for the classic counter-strike multiplayer experience or the opportunity to play bot matches, while Condition Zero will allow you to do those, it would be wiser to look towards 1.6 or GO respectively. However if you are a fan of games like Call of Duty, Half-Life or just GoldSrc games in general, then Deleted Scenes is an underrated fun experience.\n","timestamp_created":1487324636,"timestamp_updated":1487324636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29978139","author":{"steamid":"76561197980147040","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":28,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22,"last_played":1488477300},"language":"polish","review":"Ds cc","timestamp_created":1487312490,"timestamp_updated":1487312490,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29977054","author":{"steamid":"76561197993960858","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":20,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"play it faggots","timestamp_created":1487307174,"timestamp_updated":1487307174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29975123","author":{"steamid":"76561198312946370","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1962,"last_played":1574699728},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen Juego, A Pesar De Los Años Que Tiene Todavìa Se Puede Jugar Perfectamente","timestamp_created":1487297879,"timestamp_updated":1487297879,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29959527","author":{"steamid":"76561198112409383","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":20,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1482079676},"language":"danish","review":"I love the single player mode in Counter-Strike.

Карты и выбор ботов в вашу команду на всех сложностях одинаков, но квесты разные. Вам предстоит выбрать ботов на имеющиеся у вас очки по 3 характеристикам - скилл, работа в командк и храбрость. Чем выше уровень сложности - тем больше очков будет у вас, и тем более крутые боты будут доступны вам. Однако не каждый вид ботов разблокирован изначально, даже если вам хватает на него очков. На легком и среднем уровне сложности, даже после прохождения всех миссий, не все виды ботов будут открыты. После начала миссии начинается обычная игра в кс, но для победы вам нужно выполнить квесты и оторватся на 2 победы от террористов. Вам предстоит обучится всем азам управления ботов, которое точно пригодится вам в cs go.

It's essentially CS 1.6, with updated graphics and some really fun bots thrown in. You can even edit the bots and make your own bot leagues if you are so inclined. Also, if you Google search \"Condition Zero botprofile\", there are people that have already edited botprofiles and uploaded them so you can download them. If you don't have time to edit your own bots, then these files will make the bots better without you having to do the footwork. \n\nIn summary, if you are a person who wants to play some CS, but you don't have the time to invest in becoming a 1.6 tryhard, or if you are just an old school CS player, (like me) who won't buy into all this CSGO skin annoyance, or if you simply don't want to listen to 12 year olds tell you about how many times they've slept with your mom, then pick Condition Zero up.

Just had more fun playing that game, instead of being wallbanged by a guy from the other side of the map on 1.6. A bit more realism, so it helped.\n\nYet, Valve rarely ever talks about the game.

Идет на Win 10!\n>>> Внимание! Обозревается только сингл, мультиплеер не трогал.\n\nCS: Condition Zero - один из долгостроев, процесс разработки которых можно охарактеризовать словами \"неразбериха и невезение\". За период разработки к проекту успело прикоснуться несколько легендарных команд (Turtle Rock, Ritual, Gearbox, Valve, Sierra и VU Games). Что интересно: на результат без слез не взглянешь.\n\nДля начала: эта игрушка ориентирована на одиночное прохождение, а мультиплеер - не более чем \"придаток\". Тут можно было бы и порадоваться, если бы не дурная реализация всех одиночных режимов. На выбор предоставляется два режима:\n\n- Tour of Duty - основной режим игры. По сути - обычный безсюжетный ботматч на всех основных картах по порядку. Но есть пара особенностей... во-первых: для победы необходимо выполнить три \"чалленджа\" (застрелить 5 врагов за раунд из определенного оружия, выжить 3 раунда подрят и т.д.). Во-вторых: ботов в команду набираешь по очкам (лучше взять 2 бота-профи или 5 сосунков - решать тебе!);\n\n- Deleted Scenes‎ - сюжетная компания, которая запускается с отдельного ярлыка. С Counter-Strike не имеет почти ничего общего: боты тупые, дерганные. Никакой динамики нет и в помине. Локации коридорные, маленькие и не выразительные. Баланс отсутствует, лучшая тактика: ползать на пузе, и выцеливать пятки и локти врагов. Хотя номинально все не так плохо: каждая миссия начинается с брифинга, миссий много, в одной из них мы даже получаем благодарность от спасенной Обычной Японской Школьницы (да-да, которая в школьной форме).\n\nНу и под конец держите вывод: все элементы этой игры устарели лет на 10 по состоянию на 2004 год! Т.е. на данный момент имеем игру, морально устаревшую примерно на... 20 лет!\n\nИтог: не вижу не одной причины вам тратить свое время на эту... игру. Так понимаю вся ценность данной игры в свое время сводилась к тому, что бы дать пользователям без инета слегка улучшенный C.S.1.6. в одной \"коробке\" со всеми патчами и картами. Сейчас это разумеется уже не актуально. А закончу обзор отличной цитатой: [quote=GAME.exe №5\\2004] Зрелище более жалкое, чем Condition Zero, увидеть можно. Но нечасто.
