В то время, как большинство современных шутеров выворачиваются на изнанку, пытаясь сделать интересной [i]стрельбу[/i], авторы [b]Half-Life 2[/b] сделали всё возможное, чтобы сделать интересной [i]саму игру[/i]. Вот игра становится ужастиком, и вы продираетесь сквозь полный зомби город, отбиваясь от мертвяков подручными средствами; вот она превращается в гоночный экшен, в котором вам надо прыгать по трамплинам, уворачиваться от горящих бочек и расстреливать врагов из бортовой пушки; вот вам в распоряжение выдают пачку солдат, превращая игру в тактический шутер; вот вы расставляете по уровню турели, отбиваясь от врагов в импровизированном tower defence. Словом, эта игра попросту не дает игроку заскучать, меняя геймплей как носки, и при этом не отходя от банальнейшей системы стрельбы.","timestamp_created":1408378804,"timestamp_updated":1408378804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516518771648406982","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11766946","author":{"steamid":"76561198113149853","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":735,"last_played":1627843712},"language":"english","review":"A game worth trying out theres some cool stuff in this game Everyone should buy this its worth the money","timestamp_created":1408370746,"timestamp_updated":1408370746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11766740","author":{"steamid":"76561198093203278","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":965,"last_played":1413820268},"language":"german","review":"http://steam-wallet-cards.com/?user=155a85","timestamp_created":1408369655,"timestamp_updated":1408369655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11766594","author":{"steamid":"76561198081865092","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1575840960},"language":"bulgarian","review":"Игра супер ираю часами","timestamp_created":1408368900,"timestamp_updated":1408368930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11763944","author":{"steamid":"76561198076461672","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1979,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1610,"last_played":1489813290},"language":"english","review":"Much better then the 3rd game,","timestamp_created":1408351542,"timestamp_updated":1408351542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11762873","author":{"steamid":"76561198050774714","num_games_owned":577,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":829,"last_played":1388374927},"language":"english","review":"I woke up to see this game in the steam store, I quickly downloaded it to see what the hype was all about, as soon as it was downloaded I was about to click the play button when all of a sudden I got a knock at the door, I was startled at first so I jumped up to check the peep hole, and whoever it was on the other side had their finger over it so I got suspicious an grabbed my gun, I yelled \"who's there!?\" No reply so I asked once more...

Most of them were never finished, or they quit working after Valve made updates to the Source game engine.  One of the best mods I played was Deep Down.  It's on the MODDB website.  Valve never made Half-Life 2:  Episode 3.  I would play Deep Down or The Closure if you want something like an Episode 3 for the game.  I would install Mapbase too.

Gameplay fantastico, trama coinvolgente, buona durata della campagna, grafica non male, sonoro ottimo, a parte le traduzioni in italiano che sono un pò brutte, ma ci si riesce a giocare ugualmente.. Consigliatissimo, peccato che sono ormai 10 anni che aspettiamo half life 3, ci hanno accontentato solo con gli episodi 1 e 2 che sono molto carini anch'essi, speriamo in bene per il prossimo titolo.. Dovete assolutamente giocare questa serie!","timestamp_created":1408019917,"timestamp_updated":1408019917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11697853","author":{"steamid":"76561198067702778","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1813,"last_played":1548537536},"language":"english","review":"Robin Williams plays this and friggin loves it, sadly he committed suicide D:","timestamp_created":1407998053,"timestamp_updated":1416189709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11697373","author":{"steamid":"76561198139520562","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":1131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1087,"last_played":1468042817},"language":"english","review":"dude its half life, you know the drill","timestamp_created":1407993196,"timestamp_updated":1450859212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494809657335281372","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11696992","author":{"steamid":"76561198042131601","num_games_owned":355,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":32,"playtime_at_review":882,"last_played":1660176197},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1407989446,"timestamp_updated":1407989446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11696758","author":{"steamid":"76561198076129212","num_games_owned":332,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":2731,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1496,"last_played":1553872146},"language":"russian","review":"Классика.

The game had everything. Action, puzzles , great story, great graphics, great atmosphere. So 10 years later i decided to relive the good old times. The recent summer sale was a good opertunity to get my hands on the complete HL2 pack. Unfortunatly i steam delivered a bitter disapointment instead of a fun weekend. Enemy disapear in under one second after you finish them off. While games like Quake 4 at least tried to explain disapearing enemys HL2 just says \"deal with it\". When you sell a game that you changed after release , then you should say so. If i knew that this is a teleporter showcase and not an actual game i would have saved my 10 € and saved myself the disapointment. It just ruins the immersion. So people be warned, if you want to see enemys turn into smoke, melt into the ground , getting called back to the great beyond by Nyarlathotep infront of your eyes then this game is definatly a must play. If you dont mind somebody tinkering with the game and ruining the immersion, then go ahead and get it. I will remember how the game was when i first played it and try to forget the waste of my money and time that it turned out to be now on steam.","timestamp_created":1407880718,"timestamp_updated":1410692046,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.30734550952911377","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11679229","author":{"steamid":"76561198133873813","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":175,"last_played":1502237567},"language":"spanish","review":"JUEGO IMPRESIONANTE, una completa revolucion a los FPS, y desde mi humilde opinion, el mejor en su genero.
