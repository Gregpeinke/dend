It's that simple - there are a variety of specialized roles, allowing for a lot of freedom in gameplay (something I found lacking in the L4D series bigtime, for one), it allows a lot of freedom for weapon and avatar choices, especially with the little DLCs that come with it.

I´d recommend you go try this with a friend too! Being playing it for a year or two and never regret that I´ve bought it!\n\nSo what´s so great about this instead of some other zombie shit games?\nFirst of all, its a sort of skill tree progress game where you gain xp for playing, and everytime you increase your level you gain some new features! There are also different weapons for each perk (perks are role players) and every perk has it own abilities and advantages, which will need you to think strategic different everytime. There are also a magnificent huge amount of different maps in this game! You´re even able to play thousands of custom maps and man.. It´s just getting better and better!\n\nThere are a midi selection of weapons, and if you´re in need of more fun you can always purcahse the community weapon pack which unlocks some few awesome ones too!\n\nThe game is 100% worth buying! Sure thing. At its price its totally insane good!\n\n- For a game like this it deserves 4.5 starts out of 5! That´s for sure","timestamp_created":1385753244,"timestamp_updated":1385753244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7829003","author":{"steamid":"76561198050561801","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":11757,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11144,"last_played":1390078720},"language":"french","review":"Killing Floor un jeu de survie de 2010 et pourtant il garde toute sa jeunesse.
