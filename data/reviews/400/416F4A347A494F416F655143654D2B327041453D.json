Steam cards can always be added, should they choose.\n\nI finally understand the cake jokes from an emotional level, rather than just intellectually.","timestamp_created":1530237517,"timestamp_updated":1530237517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43142504","author":{"steamid":"76561198288335113","num_games_owned":327,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":158,"last_played":1531443009},"language":"english","review":"There will be cake.","timestamp_created":1530230482,"timestamp_updated":1530230482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43142334","author":{"steamid":"76561198842973848","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":290,"last_played":1627486100},"language":"spanish","review":"Menudo juegazo!\nNo tengo palabras para describir Portal es es...\nGENIAL!!\nUn nuevo entorno en el mundo de los juegos de lógica/puzzle te espera.\nMecánicas increibles y mapas repletos de buena ambientación\nTiene su pequeña historia que no esta nada mal sobretodo si juegas tambien al 2\nRecomendadísmo tanto el portal1 como el portal2.\n","timestamp_created":1530229868,"timestamp_updated":1530229868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565481603145599365","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43142326","author":{"steamid":"76561198112442583","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1567012417},"language":"english","review":"It's Portal","timestamp_created":1530229847,"timestamp_updated":1530246075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43141308","author":{"steamid":"76561198120152118","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":131,"last_played":1529594531},"language":"french","review":"un classique qui m'a fait comprendre l'histoire du 2 ème","timestamp_created":1530226105,"timestamp_updated":1530226105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43139970","author":{"steamid":"76561198334208003","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1530168969},"language":"polish","review":"Z całego serca moge polecić każdemu tą gre.
