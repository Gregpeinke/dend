Models, especially of weapons, are masterpiece.\nThey have many visible details that please the eye and make that the weapons are nothing worse than those from current games.\n[spoiler]An animation in which Gordon tries to pet an alien in one weapon is perfect[/spoiler]\nMusic is also epic. It is very climatic and fits ideally at every moment in the plot.\nAnd the plot itself. What to say? That plot created a great and popular brand that stayed in hearts of many, many players.

While I like Deus Ex more (for the ability to complete missions in a variety of ways and via different routes, plus the characters and music [Half-Life's soundtrack is fine, but Deus Ex is a level above]), I have to admit that Half-Life doesn't have as many flaws nor as much clunkiness as Deus Ex; it's definitely a smoother experience.  \n\nI've read online that making the protagonist silent is some sort of genius act of storytelling, yadda, yadda.  I consider this akin to a player being on multiple Super Bowl-winning teams being the best at his position (Tom Brady is the ultimate example of this; people just casually call him the greatest because of his rings, ignoring the facts that 1) the title of greatest is an individual honor, 2) winning Super Bowls are team accomplishments, and 3) other players have better individual resumes).  It's not a bad character choice, mind, just a bit odd that this MIT grad never says anything to his colleagues as the world collapses around him.  I chose to interpret Freeman's character to be a serial killer who went to MIT to establish a cover for his deranged habit; now that everything is coming apart, he's taking out his anger on everyone else.  Basically, I read him as being a bit crazy.  I find this far more interesting, especially in the second game, in which Freeman is regarded in almost Messianic terms.  \n\nThe game is solid; it does what it sets out to do.
