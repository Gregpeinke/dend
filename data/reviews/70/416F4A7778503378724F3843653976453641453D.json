Сюжет линейный за исключением заключительной части, имеет две концовки, одна из них ложная. Присутствует мультиплеер.\n[b] [u] Геймплей [/u] [/b]\n     Все прохождение разделено на 19 глав. В основном игра состоит из коридоров и комнат, в которых вы будете выполнять поставленные задачи, отстреливая пришельцев из мира Зен и военное подразделение зачистки. В конце игры будет находиться босс Нихилант, напоминающий младенца переростка. Самая сложная часть в битве это понять, как с ним сражаться. Присутствует около 10 типов врагов, 2 мини-босса (Гаргантюа, Гонарч) и 14 видов оружий (такой ассортимент весьма пригодится в Зене). В особенности хочется выделить взаимодействие персонажа с окружающей средой, оно хорошо проработано (ящики можно толкать, нажимать на кнопки автомата с газировкой и т. д), а на случай с микроволновкой есть отсылка в Half-Life 2: Episode Two.\n[b] [u] Графика и звук [/u] [/b]\n     Для 1998 года графика для ПК игры, по моему мнению, весьма хорошая. Персонажи не кажутся Стивами. Текстуры лабораторий и мира Зен не режут глаза, на поверхности ж, увы, ситуация другая. Девушки-ниндзя при первом появлении умудрилось меня пугнуть, потому что структура их моделек проработана довольно плохо и вначале не разберешь, что это прыгает.\n     В игре нет русского языка, разве что в меню. Заявлено присутствие английских субтитров, но их я не нашел. Озвучка персонажей на английском звучит плохо, плюс окружающая среда иногда заглушает слова. Но хорошо сделана акустика, в просторных помещениях звук меняется. Окружение звучит естественно. В особых моментах игры начинается мелодия (одна из них играет в интро к некоторым играм Valve).\n[b] [u] Сложность [/u] [/b]\n     Не является сверхсложной игрой из-за легких сохранений, но ии, бывает, просто раздражает. Враги могут кидать в персонажа гранаты, очень точно попадая в ямку с Фрименом. Гранаты из подствольника залетают даже через щелочку между ящиками. На некоторых локациях явно не хватает лечащих устройств.\n[b] [u] Баги [/u] [/b]\n     Фримен за все прохождение застревал раза три в текстурах, и приходилось перезагружать сохранение. Вортигонты могут вдруг перестать атаковать персонажа. Звуки при переходе в трубах на секунду после загрузки не соответствуют материалу.\n[b] [u] Впечатление [/u] [/b]\n     Игры из серии Half-Life являются одни из моих любимых, поэтому я заинтересовался прохождением первой части в оригинальном виде (не Source). На удивление игра старого образца меня весьма захватила, возможно, присутствием разнообразия локаций.\nПотрачено ≈ 10 часов на первое прохождение сюжета.","timestamp_created":1577893090,"timestamp_updated":1581359850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61066174","author":{"steamid":"76561198878055810","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":23010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3109,"last_played":1639888042},"language":"english","review":"Amazing.

Игру поливали грязью за плохую графику. Но многие догадались, кто это писал, а точнее сколько этим людям лет(не более 12-14 лет)! И кто бы сомневался. Наигравшись в FarCry 5, Ведьмак 3, PUBG CS GO и так далее они присытились к такой графике и геймплею. Однако помимо малолетних идиотов, которые пишут всякую чушь, есть люди и по старше! Уж если и не расхвалят эту игру, ныне, то хотя бы каплю ностальгии поймают, о том, как они в неё играли и как им она нравилась. Я конечно в переиздание не играл, по крайней мере не до конца. Однако я её купил по скидке(90%) и не жалею об этом. Но обливать грязью игру, за графику двадцатилетней давности, будет только натуральный идиот! \nПо поводу багов.

That being said, I decided to start with the very first game in this universe Valve created. For this being Valve's first game, damn was this a great start into the series.\n\n[h1] The Good: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The graphics are not that bad at all. They make a ton of the enemies and some of the characters you meet to have a certain charm in them, the highlights being how awesome the alien designs are (Headcrab zombies in particular. I so wished that they kept their original design for the second game). \n[*]The combat is great... to an extent, but that's for the stinky list. As someone who hates shooters with the exception of DOOM, the weapons in this game feel SO satisfying to use. Running through soldiers with a machine gun, using an energy gun to disintegrate aliens, even killing the damn Headcrabs with two shots feels so intuitive and satisfying. Changing weapons with the mouse wheel is smooth, but having the extra option of using the keyboard numbers is always great for quicker weapon change. Weapon variety also gets a ten from me. Pistol, shotgun, a gun which shoots aliens that home onto the enemies, rocket launcher, small grenade aliens [spoiler] that come back and attack you [/spoiler] , and more. The amount of variety you have allows for you to deal with combat situations and enemies in multiple ways, provided said ways don't come back to shoot you in the arse.\n[*]The atmosphere/sound design. Fuck me, the sound design is great. They set up the atmosphere incredibly well and only the game only uses music at the right moments, even if barely. From the sounds each weapon makes to the way you can listen to each alien and know that they could be in the next room. It rises up the tension and always made me go \"whatever is making that sound is going to kill me, isn't it?\" You can tell how those situations turned out, right? The sounds of old machinery in the distance enhancing the constant hostile aura you feel when going through the Black Mesa facility.\n[*]The story's pretty good. I really like the world building in this game and how it doesn't hold your hand or explain shit to you twice and have to be paying attention at what characters say. When shit goes down, it really does go down. It adds some good context as to what exactly is going on.\n[*]Headcrabs. Fuck Headcrabs. They scared the shit out of me more times than I am willing to admit out of embarrassment. They're to me the best enemy in the game because they were the ones who made me take it slow and sneak around to look at the area before blasting. Still, the way they jump at you is just so nerve-racking.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] The [b] S t i n k y: [/b] [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]This game took me 16 hours to beat. It can REALLY overstay its welcome with how much combat and traversal you have to do. I did say that the combat system was very solid, however, there's a point in the game where I got exhausted from fighting so many enemies in every single area in the game. Yes, it makes sense within the context of the story. However, there were some parts where the game really wouldn't have suffered had they cut down the enemy encounters a little (the final area especially. That one big Headcrab can eat my ass).\n[*]Adding to what I said above, it felt like you never really have... a break? It's hard to describe, but it's like this game was missing having a consistent companion to talk to (or them talking to me as Freeman is a silent boy) just to not feel so alone. No, the policemen and scientists don't count. They talk more about what I need to do than anything bloody else. I'm talking about real, genuine characters which feels nice to see them again and that they are okay in spite of all the chaos happening in the story.\n[*]Again, and I can't stress this enough: Fuck. Them. Headcrabs.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, if you want to start of the Half-Life universe, I highly recommend not missing out on this first entry in the series if you wish for an old, yet solid shooting system. Great start and cannot wait to see what is in store for me next with Half-Life 2!","timestamp_created":1577784600,"timestamp_updated":1577784600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60974922","author":{"steamid":"76561198134416726","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":136,"playtime_forever":241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":134,"last_played":1585334766},"language":"english","review":"good.","timestamp_created":1577782343,"timestamp_updated":1577782343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60973573","author":{"steamid":"76561198021706647","num_games_owned":612,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":468,"last_played":1621180012},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life

I'll do a complete review when I figure out how to get past this but for now this is all I got. I haven't really done any reviews so sorry if it's clunky or missing anything you think I should have mentioned!\n\nWeapons- The guns in this game are all fun to use, (Even though I never found much ammo for the revolver, and not I never found any serious use for the remote bombs and bugs.) and managing ammo shouldn't be too difficult.\n\nLevel Design- Everything flows really well, I've never really found myself completely clueless until now. Finding friendly NPC's is pretty great since they're either functionally useless quote factories, or the best meat shields to ever shield meat. If you ever see a guard at the start of a new area make sure you bring him for every fight, they typically walk straight into danger so whatever you have to take out will most definitely be distracted.\n\nStory- You play as Gordon Freeman, you're late for work and you have to be in the testing chamber for the most raw unstable fragment they've brought to the lab. Everything is going pretty well until aliens start appearing everywhere, and the military comes to take out everyone involved in the experiment. Gordon needs to try to get out of this mess with the help of the scientists left alive, taking out everything in his way with whatever tools he finds on his journey.","timestamp_created":1577767741,"timestamp_updated":1587800558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60962855","author":{"steamid":"76561198820808106","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":112,"last_played":1582338320},"language":"english","review":"The great grandfather of all modern fps games.","timestamp_created":1577765243,"timestamp_updated":1577765243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60961982","author":{"steamid":"76561198035872547","num_games_owned":292,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1577760390},"language":"english","review":"Loving Half-Life 2 when I first played it, I was expecting to love HL1 as well. But it ended up as more of a love-hate relationship.\n\nStarts out strong, with one of the more memorable intros in any video game I've played - with a few very fun and interesting levels with breakneck pacing and good environmental storytelling, a fantastic soundtrack, as well as genuinely frightening moments - but it falls apart very quickly. Gameplay eventually becomes a slog with mind-numbing repetition, particularly in Lambda Core and Xen. Boring puzzles, infuriating platforming, sections that drag on too long, you name it. By the end I was so fed up with it that I used cheats to finish Nihilanth because I just wanted it to be over already. And that's never happened to me before in any game I've played.\n\nMaybe I'm being too hard on a game from 1998 but there are plenty of games that are older that I've enjoyed - even non-3D games. I don't know what it is about HL1 but it just isn't for me. If you like it, that's great. I can appreciate its influence on future games, too.\n\nMaybe Black Mesa would fix the frustrations I had, I'm not sure. I guess I would recommend this if you absolutely must play every Half-Life game, but you aren't really missing much by skipping it either aside from the origins of a few things. Some enemies from HL2 are introduced in HL1, like the Headcrabs, Zombies and Vortigaunts but that's really it. I think you'll have a much more enjoyable time playing HL2 and its episodes first, and then play HL1 if you really [i]really[/i] want to. HL2 has better visuals, better levels, subtitles, more character interaction, and is all around a more accessible game.\n\n[h1]TL;DR - Recommended?,[/h1] but the game hasn't aged well and Black Mesa might be a better way to experience it.","timestamp_created":1577764125,"timestamp_updated":1613153812,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505546748638153076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60958139","author":{"steamid":"76561198202184236","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1188,"last_played":1579729386},"language":"english","review":"We with the science team","timestamp_created":1577759272,"timestamp_updated":1577759272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxP3xrO8Ce9vE6AE="}
