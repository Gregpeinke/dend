The campaign is cool, the story takes unexpected turns, and it even tells you the backstory of Chell without even referring to her!\nTo really get the story, it is also suggested to play the first Portal game and to read the comic, as this gives you the complete experiene. And boy, do I love it!\n\nThe gameplay is great, the game deviates from the many CoD and WoW-clones by giving you a gun that fires two linked portals. You will learn to use these portals through the game, and how to fight with it using other elements from the test chambers.\n\nWhen the campaign is done, don't worry, there still is an unlimited amount of test chambers to complete. Thanks to the Perpetual Testing Initiative (PeTI), players can create and submit their own chambers for other players to test!\nIf you think you are ready to tackle the responsibilities of making your own chambers and releasing them into the wild, then the PeTI is something you'll love aswel. It's easy to use, and with it you can create stunning chambers from Aperture's glory time.\n\nAre you more into complex chamber designing? Don't worry, the PeTI is mod-friendly, and countless mods have been made to expand the elements to be used in the creator. My favorite mod is Ben and August's Extended Editor, where you get the full access to all Portal and Portal 2 testing elements plus custom made elements that almost all work without the player needing to install mods for themselves.\n\nOr if you are more into 3D design and making a chamber just like the developers did, Valve has made a special entry of Hammer for Portal 2, which is free to download and use when you get Portal 2. It certainly is the most difficult to work with, but it also gives you the most freedom. You can even create outside levels with it!","timestamp_created":1404000590,"timestamp_updated":1404000590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502637505531311035","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10923253","author":{"steamid":"76561198035081895","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":783,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":444,"last_played":1427978471},"language":"swedish","review":"Otroligt kul att spela med vänner","timestamp_created":1404000446,"timestamp_updated":1404000446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10923127","author":{"steamid":"76561198014980957","num_games_owned":815,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2845,"last_played":1414264696},"language":"english","review":"Do you like puzzles?
