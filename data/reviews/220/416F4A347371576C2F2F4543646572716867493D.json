The weapons are fun to use, unique, and very original. Every weapon can be used some point in the game, not a single one is underused or overused. The story is fun to learn about, I found myself continuously playing until I was much too tired. All of the characters are likable, even the antagonist! Every time you see a face you know, you smile.\n\nHowever, like any other fps, there is some bad parts. Such as the airboat section which is too long and can be not really that fun sometimes, and there is also a section near the end of the game and you have to shoot at these huge creatures (not naming anything, don't want much spoilers), they have too much health making it feel more like a chore to overcome their challenge. I did come across one bug but it was small and stopped after seconds.\n\nI 100% recommend this game if you like enriching story and fun combat.

Dios mío, toda la lucha en las calles, la gente ayudándote. El momento en que la gravity gun se mejora... Algunos juegos harían que ese tipo de cosas fuera su apuesta principal y aun así lo harían peor.\n\nDesearía haber sido una persona pensante cuando salió este juego.

Bol bol cutscene. Bazı oyunlarda cutscene olmazsa olmazdır. Çünkü hikayeyi başka türlü aktarmaktansa cutsceneler hem daha hızlı, hem daha kolay, hem de daha etkilidir. Half life'a a bakarsak cutscene den zerre kadar yok. Bazı hatta çoğu hikayeli oyunda bunu bir sıkıntı olarak görebilirsiniz. Hatta bazı oyunlar cutscene ile bile size hikayeyi yaşatamaz. Ama Half Life, bu yargıyı yıkmakla kalmıyor. (Aynı ilk oyunda olduğu gibi) oyun dünyasına yeni bir kapı aralıyor. Half Life'a Gordon Freeman olarak başlıyorsunuz. Oyun boyunca dünyayı Gordon Freeman'ın gözünden görüyor, duyuyorsunuz. Ve oyunun kırılma noktası işte tam da burada. Oyun size bir kaç anlamsız cutscene ile oyunu anlatmaya, size duyguyu vermeye çalışmak yerine bu görevi size bırakıyor. Diğer oyunlarda kendinizi ana karakter olarak düşünmeniz biraz zor olabiliyor. Bazen karakter itici geliyor. Bazen ise sadece... Alışamıyorsunuz. Ama Half Life'da alışmak gibisinden bir mevzu yok. Siz zaten ana karaktersiniz. \n\nOyunun yapısının yanı sıra, hikayesi bir fps oyunundan beklenilmeyecek düzeyde harikulade. Her şey olması gerektiği gibi. Tam \"off baydı bee\" dediğiniz anda kendinizi bambaşka bir mekanda, bambaşka bir düşmanla, bambaşka bir silahla savaşırken buluyorsunuz. Oyun bu zamanlamayı o kadar iyi uygulamış ki bazen zihnimi okuduğunu falan düşündüm oyunun. Tam \"düşmanlar baydı. Yeni biri gelse\" diyorum adamlar yolluyor yeni bir rakip. Açık dünya olmasa bile keşif hissiyatını doruklarına kadar yaşıyorsunuz. Ve daha da önemlisi. Keşfetmekten, bir sonraki koridorda ne olacağını düşünmekten zevk alıyorsunuz. Bu saydıklarım mükemmel bir olay akışı ile birleşince oynamaktan bıkmayacağınız bir oyun çıkıyor ortaya. Hikayesi hakkında pek konuşmayacağım spoiler vermemek için. Çünkü neresinden girsem, hepsini anlatacağım öyle çıkacağım. \n\nOyun mekaniklerine gelirsek, öncelikle silahlar hakkında konuşmalıyım. Oyunda yaklaşık 10-15 tane silah var. Her birinin kendine has mermisi ve özellikleri var. Her biri diğerinden farklı. Yani günümüzdeki çoğu oyun gibi aynı silahın upgrade lenmiş hali değil. Merminiz bitebiliyor, fakat ben hiçbir zaman tüm mermimin bittiğini hatırlamıyorum. Kontroller, sade ve etkili. Eliniz alışıyor hemen. Oyun motoru ayrı bir alem. Valve ne yapıyor bilmiyorum ama, oyun gerçek hayattaki fizik ile çalışıyor resmen. Her cismi kaldıramıyor, ittiremiyorsunuz. Hiçbir cismin ağırlığı insana abartı gelmiyor. Zaten bulmacaların büyük çoğunluğu fizik üstüne kurulu. Çok üşengeç ve puzzle sevmeyen ben bile çok takılmadım bulmacalarda.\n\nTeknik anlamda konuşursak, öncelikle bu oyun benle neredeyse yaşıt. O yüzden grafik anlamında değerlendirme yapmayacağım diye düşündüyseniz yanıldınız. Oyunun grafikleri hala çok iyi. Ben malum pc yüzünden en düşük ayarlarda oynadım fakat oyun bana çok yeni hissettirdi. 13 saatlik oyun boyunca hiç bir bugla karşılaşmadan bitirebildim. Zaten işlemcisi ve ekran kartı olan her pc oyunu açabilir diye düşünüyorum.\n\nSONUÇ: Oyun alınabilir. Alın abi bu oyunu. Yayın herkese. Oyun alev atıyor. Puan kırabileceğim bir nokta düşündüm. Sanırım tek kötü nokta eğer sadece bu oyunu alırsanız ve bitirirseniz hikaye yarıda kalıyor. Devamını görmek için ise 2 farklı episode daha almanız lazım. Oyunun yanında bana dlc gibi bir kısa oyun bile geldi. Eksileri bu kadarcık. Gayet alınabilir bir fiyatı var. İndirimlerde 1.80 tl oluyor. Gazoz parası yani. İndirimsiz bile alınabilir. Böyle bir hikaye sunuşu, fizik motoru, aksiyon, macera, bilim kurgu... Kısacası harika bir oyun.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1589137132,"timestamp_updated":1589838200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68917069","author":{"steamid":"76561198050415236","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":881,"last_played":1589495857},"language":"turkish","review":"Efsane ötesi oyun","timestamp_created":1589135521,"timestamp_updated":1589135521,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68916114","author":{"steamid":"76561198824176847","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":6148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2079,"last_played":1655673685},"language":"english","review":"good game with a good story, some of the puzzles are a little hard but its a lot of fun. the only thing i dont like about this game is thare is no half life 3 so if you play you wont get an ending to will just be a clif hanger","timestamp_created":1589134222,"timestamp_updated":1589134222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68914005","author":{"steamid":"76561198812757958","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":630,"last_played":1589131274},"language":"english","review":"BEST STORY GAME IVE EVER PLAYED.\nits such a great game, the enviroments, the combat, the cutscenes, all so wonderfully great, especially for its time!","timestamp_created":1589131406,"timestamp_updated":1589131406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503105580806732178","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68913958","author":{"steamid":"76561199013586622","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1027,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":591,"last_played":1614723745},"language":"english","review":"i love the game same with the whole Half Life series","timestamp_created":1589131355,"timestamp_updated":1589131355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503105580806732178","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68913716","author":{"steamid":"76561199047900645","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":29,"playtime_at_review":414,"last_played":1659664234},"language":"english","review":"Made me punch my laptop over a level.","timestamp_created":1589131069,"timestamp_updated":1652127930,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68911007","author":{"steamid":"76561198050495572","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2961,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2961,"last_played":1590530712},"language":"english","review":"One of the most iconic and best video games of all time with amazing innovative(at the time) gameplay mechanics and story.
