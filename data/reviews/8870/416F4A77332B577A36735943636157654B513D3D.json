I recommend this game to those who follow stories that have an in-depth character development, action/RPG elements, along with the buggiest games on the PC. Now I spent more time trying to get the game to function properly and once I did I just wanted nothing but more Bioshock. I played the original Bioshock and I skipped the sequel since the only thing has changed was the protagonist and not the gameplay making it feel like I was drinking the same soda from a different glass. Bioshock Infinite had both a different flavor and glass container since the engine changed; there is a lack of the bottom of the ocean, and more fast-paced action. Now the ONLY thing that I warn to those who are going to buy it, it’s buggy, like really buggy. For example, while being under suppressive fire from the enemy my shield will go down then suddenly the computer freezes. If there was one thing in the world that can make me not pick up a game for months it would be that bug. Crashing my computer for fancy particle effects makes me want to get a hammer and smash the game.  BEWARE OF THE BUG! The only way I managed it was by lowering the graphics to the lowest I can then once it autosaved then I bump it back up (since there are only certain sections of the game that did this to me). In conclusion take caution when making this purchase, other than that get it.","timestamp_created":1403766431,"timestamp_updated":1403766431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10823738","author":{"steamid":"76561198086416852","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":351,"last_played":1403793441},"language":"english","review":"great game ! after the 30 min of slow walking and talking in the breath taking scenery you enjoy great combat with fun to shoot at enemies, mixing in challenging drones and sentries allows for the combat to be difficult yet satisfying.

Sounds simple right? Bioshock infinite opens with just this simple task. This game is a clean slate for the Bioshock series. Very few ties remain of the original games as infinite creates a whole new perspective. You play as Booker Dewitt, A gun for hire, on a mission to clear his name. You are quickly whisked away to the floating world in the clouds. Columbia appars to be a perfect utopia on the outer skin. As the game progresess you begin to lear more and more as the questions begin to pile up. As far a story goes I find little to compair. The writing and characters are all very well done. The graphics on the right machine can be beautiful. The complicated backrounds and buys sets are a feast for the eyes. The gameplay is diffirent yet much of the same. Gunplay is like most shooters and the new vigor potions provide a special balance to the game without seeming too overpowered. By the time this game has ended you will be a changed person. The ending is unlike any other i've experienced in a fps. All of the elements combined make one of the best gaming experiences I have has the pleasure to play. And the 1999 hard mode and extenstve DLC will satisfy the hungry Bioshock fan. So what are you waiting for.

Lots of them, in hectic combat where you tend to get disoriented a lot and your low health and lack of carriable healing items causes you to run around from cover to cover like a headless chicken looking for that precious popcorn or abandoned soda to boost your all-too-fragile health. And when the red mist is over you are left with a pile of dead police officers and ordinary, well-intentioned people convinced you are a bad guy. Which, after having killed about twenty of them, you kind of sort of feel like. Racists they may be, but nothing in-game ever convinced me these people *needed* to die, and especially not in such crude, gore-tastic manners.\n\nBioshock Infinite has a real issue with story-and-gameplay integration: The story and presentation leaves me ill-motivated to care about the main characters or anything they do. The gameplay, even if it had been better (it is certainly the weakest of the Bioshock games to date, sacrificing the last vestiges of System Shock on the altar of Call of Duty) creates a sharp divide between the themes of caring for someone and cooperating with them and killing endless hordes of very human cannon fodder with nary a thought; apparently only the hopes and dreams of the main character are worth diving into. Booker's dismissing of practically everything about this magical cloud wonderland he finds himself in, or his refusal to engage in any form of self-reflection about himself or his actions, certainly don't help matters.\n\nIn fact, if I may be so bold I might say this game's core excellence is as a showpiece for the ideas promoted by Spec Ops: The Line.

Opravdu pěkně zpracovaný živoucí svět (živoucí v rámci lineární hry).\nJe zde spousta detailů jako hry na pouti atd. Dále vedlejší úkoly a další věci pro prohloubení příběhu jak už to u Bioshocku bývá video-logy...\nBohužel tím přednosti končí. Je to konzolová hra takže to trpí klasickou konzolovostí ale tím trpí všechny díly Bioshock, takže se s tím musí počítat.\n\n1) Ještě musím pochválit hru že není zabugovaná. Jen jednou se mi stalo že jsem propadl texturou,\n\n2) Hratelnost. Ta je vyloženě slabá. A.I. je sice agresivní ale tupá. Obtížnost i na extra 1999 mód je triviální. Pokud vás bavilo vylepšení zbraní, plazmidů atd. v předchozích dílech tak tady vás to bavit nebude. Ztratilo to svoji extravaganci a logičnost. Zbraní je dost ale jsou nemastné neslané stejně jako pocit střelby z nich. Prostě bude střílet s tím co se válí na zemi. Co se týče interaktivity s prostředím tak je to velice kontroverzní. Každopádně je to mnohem lepší než ve většině dnešních her.\nCo se týče ovládání. Je to Unreal engin takže není problém si projet configy a změnit si co chcete.\n\n3) Příběh. Jak jsem nakousl tak mě překvapil konec. Aji vás překvapí. Začátek je taky dobrý. Ale mezi tím se to trochu zadrhává. Ne že by bylo málo scénáře nebo byl vyloženě špatný. Je to spíše problém v logičnosti. Scénář je psán typicky svým stylem a mnohdy působí originálním dojmem ale zdá se mi jako by byl mnohdy vytržen z kontextu. Je zde mnoho nakousnutých věcí které končí brzo v zapomnění protože nejsou dále rozvíjeny nebo rychle končí (nemají další smysl pro příběhovou linii).\n\n4) Technická stránka grafiky. Už jsem tak dnes oťukaný od těch multiplatformních her a dnešních rádoby nex-gen her že se mi příčí to zhodnotit negativně, ale tu objektivnost a logika být musí. Je to lepší než předchozí díly bez pochyb. Ale prosím aby hra roku 2013 vypadala hůře než hry z roku 2007 není v pořádku. Dnes každá hra těží z jediného efektu a to post-processing. Bez něj by totiž vypadali mnohdy hůře než hry z roku 2005. Ok ano grafika není jak pěst na oko a je docela pěkná ale oproti tomu co se dá zvládnout technicky je to velice slabé. K tomu připočtěme neadekvátní nároky. O ano já vím i slabší dnešní mainstream to zvládna... O tom to ale není! Jinak hra netrpí mini-lagingem a ani nějakýma FPS propadama. Kdo je šikovný tak si hru dokáže zkrášlit a i dokonce snížit HW nároky. \n\n5) Herní doba je velice slušná. Myslím že kolem 15cti hodin asi.\n\n6) DLC obsah mi přejde předražený.\n\n7) Zvuky. Namluvení postav je perfektní. (i animace). Samotný zvuk (efekty) tak průměr. Soundtracku jsem si žádného taky nevšiml že bych si nějakou symfonii zapamatoval. Takže neurazí a ani nenadchne.\n\nU této hry se zabavíte ale nic extra od toho nečekejte. Zahrajete a zapomenete.
