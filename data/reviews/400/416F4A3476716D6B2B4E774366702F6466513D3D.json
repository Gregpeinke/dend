Le jeu se situe dans l'univers crée par Valve a partir du premier Half Life. Il est donc liée à l'univers de ce dernier et partage la temporalité et l'histoire de celui-ci.\n\nLe jeu est a la premiére personne. Vous y incarnez un personnage sujet a des test dans un mystérieu laboratoire controler par l'intélligence artificielle GLADOS. Vous devrez a l'aide du portal gun, vous faufiler a travers toute les énigmes du jeu. Jusqu'à affronter GLADOS elle même dans un combat mémorable.\n\nCe premier épisode de portal est clairement une mise en bouche du second volume. En effet, si à son époque le jeu devait déjà être un grand jeu. On ne peut manifestement pas dire le contraire aujourd'hui! Des énigmes aussi tordus que passionantes, une histoire et un univers riche à découvrir par vous même et une certaine touche d'humour noir qui ne vous laissera pas indiférent. L'histoire de Portal est bonne, il faut cependant être attentif au détails laisser par les dévellopeurs afin de la comprendre. Car plus que un simple jeu d'énigme Portal est aussi un jeu d'aventure et d'enquéte, dans lequel vous aurez hâte de découvrir les moindres recoins de cette univers.\n\nCependant ce premier volume n'est pas sans défauts. Comme dis précédement, il est clairement une mise en bouche pour le second volet. Notamment a cause de sa durée de vie trés courte (environ 2/3 heures). Profitez donc des soldes afin de vous munir du jeu, qui est néanmoins nécéssaire afin de comprendre portal 2 et l'univers de Valve.\n\nEn bref un trés grands jeu et un indispensable dans la suite de Half Life. Mais avant tout une mise en bouche immense avant le second volet.","timestamp_created":1498727348,"timestamp_updated":1498727348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502463042736053467","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32980813","author":{"steamid":"76561198398710191","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1498777570},"language":"turkish","review":"kral oyundaki ateş ve su gibi yapboz parçalarını birleştirip bölüm sonuna ulaşmaya çalışıyorsunuz alınabilir bi oyun","timestamp_created":1498727092,"timestamp_updated":1498727092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32980756","author":{"steamid":"76561198248133602","num_games_owned":1005,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":400,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1575361123},"language":"english","review":"[table]\n[tr]\n\t[th]Title[/th]\n\t[th]Description[/th]\n\t[th]Rating[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Overall[/td]\n\t[td]This game is the best puzzle game I have ever played.

Al principio empezaremos sin nada, y deberemos avanzar esperando a que se generen los portales solos, más adelante recogeremos la portal-gun, pero estará incompleta y solo tendremos el portal azul. Al poco recibiremos la mejora para poder disparar el portal naranja, y con esto ya tenemos nuestro set para superar todos los puzzles siguientes.\n\nNo hay mucho misterio, entras por el portal azul y sales por el naranja y a la inversa, pero gracias a que el juego tiene físicas, juega bastante con este tema, y algunos puzzles resultarán interesantes.\n\nEn sí, la historia tampoco es muy compleja, somos una especie de cobaya de un sistema informático de un centro llamado Aperture Science. Tendremos que seguir sus instrucciones a lo largo de todo el recorrido e ir resolviendo los puzzles que nos plantee. Este sistema informático, llamado GLaDOS tiene muy buenos toques de humor, y es un personaje que es considerado de los mejores en esta indústria, tiene un húmor un tanto peculiar y que te gusta pero odias a la vez, solo lo puedes entender si lo juegas.\n\nEl juego no tiene mucha duración (a mí me duró 2 horas), pero es interesante y es uno de los grandes pilares de la empresa Valve, así que no está de más darle una oportunidad.

Tive um bom gameplay, me surpreendendo muito com os puzzles que explode a mente e também com a história bem interessante e misteriosa. \n \nMeu ponto negativo para esse jogo foi o tempo estimado para ser finalizado, eu zerei em 2 horas me desapontando até... Depois que você zera não tem modo online, apenas um desafios de uns puzzles com uma dificuldade razoável para encher linguiça e dizer que tem mais coisas no jogo.\n\n\nRecomendo ser comprado em promoção, no meu caso, paguei 2 reais, valeu apenas? Até que sim, pois mesmo sendo uma história muito pequena você consegue passar mais tempo depois para pegar conquistas, etc.\n\n7/10","timestamp_created":1498692191,"timestamp_updated":1502760841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32962496","author":{"steamid":"76561198079653087","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":276,"last_played":1404318040},"language":"spanish","review":"Cojonudo, perfecto para desarrollar lógica abstracta y visión espacial.","timestamp_created":1498690129,"timestamp_updated":1498690129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32961507","author":{"steamid":"76561198197576849","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":167,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":165,"last_played":1533094978},"language":"spanish","review":"excelente juego :3","timestamp_created":1498688490,"timestamp_updated":1498688490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32961185","author":{"steamid":"76561198269672343","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":342,"last_played":1471377294},"language":"english","review":"This is probably the most perfect game ever made","timestamp_created":1498688029,"timestamp_updated":1498688029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542483627796173096","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32960805","author":{"steamid":"76561198122257801","num_games_owned":441,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1610956196},"language":"english","review":"Second favorite game ever!
