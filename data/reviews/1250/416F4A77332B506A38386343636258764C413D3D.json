It was originally released as an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod in 2005. Gameplay consists of two game types, in which the player fights waves of zombie-like specimens, with each wave becoming successively more difficult, until it concludes with a battle against a \"boss\" specimen, called the Patriarch. Players earn money for each kill, as well as for surviving to the end of a wave. In the time between each waves, players can visit a trader to buy and sell ammo, armor, and additional weapons.\n\nPlayers are encouraged to work together; they can trade items and drop money, healing is more effective on other players than on oneself, and the team can strategically weld doors shut to provide a temporary barrier from the oncoming horde while funneling the other creatures to specific areas. Players select one of seven perks at the start of a match and between rounds. The perk, similar to the idea of a character class, provides bonuses towards certain weapon types, armor, movement, and other factors.\n\n+Nice metal soundtrack.\n+Pretty strong community.\n+Realistic guns and ironsights.\n+Even humorous at times.\n\n+/- Heavily reliant on good teamwork which can be challenging in an online setting.\n\n-Low-quality player models and outdated graphics.\n-Perk level progression is very time-consuming.\n-Developers have chosen the DLC-approach to the game.\n","timestamp_created":1408883198,"timestamp_updated":1408883198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522293031215667725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11843556","author":{"steamid":"76561198013512050","num_games_owned":289,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":619,"last_played":1318402800},"language":"english","review":"I recomend this game hands down.

Hra, která mě i přes můj odpor k MP dokázala pohltit a mám tam nahráno nejvíce hodin ze všech her, co jsem kdy hrál? KF je hra, kdy musíte přežít 10 kol (nebo 7 nebo 4 - dle toho, jakou délku si zvolíte) a pak v posledním musíte zabít bosse. Za zabití nepřátel dostáváte peníze a za ty si kupujete lepší zbraně na konci každého kola. Toť vše a i když to zní strašně jednoduše, tak to tak samozřejmě vůbec není. Jde tu zejména o spolupráci a velice brzy se zjistí, kdo umí hrát s ostatními lidmi a kdo ne (především na těžší obtížnosti). Už několikrát se mi stalo, že mi lepší hráč zachránil život nebo pro změnu já někomu jinému. A o tom ta hra je. O spolupráci, o dobrém pocitu z hraní a o zabití bosse.\n\n+ systém perků a postupného získávání lepších vlastností (stejně jako slevy na určité zbraně nebo rychlejší běh, léčení atd.)\n+ zavařování dveří (není snad v žádné hře, co znám)\n+ spousta map a módů\n+ 5 druhů obtížností\n+ hodně skinů postav (pár zadarmo ve hře, některé jen v podobě DLC, jiné odemykatelné)\n+ různé druhy nepřátel\n+ spousta zbraní (většina zadarmo ve hře, některé jen v podobě DLC, jiné odemykatelné)\n+ obrovská základna hráčů (a to i CZ a SK)\n+ díky staršímu enginu jde spustit i na horších sestavách\n+ zed time - neboli zpomalení času\n+ hodně krve a useknutých končetin\n+ hra je stále udržovaná i po pěti letech, co vyšla a má každý rok akce (letní, halloween a vánoční)\n+ pocit ze střelby a sekání :D\n+ metalový soundtrack\n+ sexy stalkerky (především v tom vánočním úboru, achhhhhh... *mlask*)\n\n- občas problémy s připojením do hry\n- poslední dobou přibylo spoustu noobů a netýmových hráčů, kteří si myslí, jak hře rozumí, i když opak je pravdou\n- spousta hráčů leveluje pomocí cheatů, takže se pak připojí na vyšší obtížnost, i když nemají žádné zkušenosti a prakticky tak kvůli nim prohrajete mapu\n- také se poslední dobou o dost víc bezdůvodně kickuje, než dříve (aspoň u mě to tak je)\n- vysoká cena DLC (takže kupovat jen ve slevě)\n- DLC obsahují o dost silnější zbraně, než jaké se nachází v základní hře\n- blíží se KF2, takže se možná vyplatí koupit spíš to (a ohledně budoucí podpory prvního dílu panují nejasnosti); KF2 nakonec vyšlo a v porovnání s prvním dílem se jedná o hodně nekvalitní hru, takže doporučuji spíše sáhnout po tomhle\n\nHodnocení 10/10\n\nV zásadě se mi na KF nelíbí komunita, která šla posledního cca půl roku neuvěřitelně dolů a jen díky přátelům mám chuť stále hrát (i když stále jde narazit na skvělé lidi, se kterými si budete připadat jako dokonale sehraný tým, to nepopírám). I přes to, jak předchozí věta mohla vyznít negativně, doporučuji téhle hře dát šanci a třeba vás chytne stejně jako kdysi mě.
