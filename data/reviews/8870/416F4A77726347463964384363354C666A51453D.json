Game mechanics allow for creative solutions to battle (not as deep as Deus Ex but closer to Dishonored). It also works as a perfect closure to what remains today as one of the most interesting mysteries out there. Although it does play well as an independent game, the game does have something to do with the previous entries although most of this is explained via DLCs, which are key to closing the Rapture narrative from Bioshock 1 and 2. The story may seem a little weird or confusing at times but is worth the investment.

Stop reading this review and get it. It's cheaper than this. Or, since at the time of writing it's the Black Friday \n\nI nominated Bioshock Infinite for the \"The No Apologies\" award 2017, because of what it means to me. \n\nTo quite a few people, it's not the best Bioshock game. And fair enough. But I'm willing to look past the flaws because the good parts, to me, make it very compelling. I've got 68.2 hours in this game, and about 40 of those hours are from the DLCs. The other 28 were me playing through the game multiple times.\n\nSo, here's the thing. A lot of people list pros and cons, but in reality, this is the third (or second, if you exclude Bioshock 2 since it was made by a different team) installment of the Bioshock series. So many of the things you've come to expect are gone, which can make a \"Con\" list turn into \"This isn't in Infinite but was in the original\".\n\nSuch as: [b]Guns.[/b] You can only have two guns at a time, rather than 8. The guns are less inventive, too, if that bothers you. It's a selection of pistols, machine guns, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, and carbine-type weapons.\n\n[b]Vigors.[/b] This one actually DOES annoy me. Vigors feel superfluous in Columbia compared to Plasmids in Rapture. While you can imagine uses for Vigors, they don't really have the same feeling of necessity.\n\n[b]The location.[/b] Personally I really love how open Columbia is, though I do wish it were less linear. A more sandbox-y Columbia would be phenomenal; the current one is somewhat-linear. I have seen complaints from some people who wish we were still in Rapture, or that it was darker and more claustrophobic (I don't mean that in a bad way, either), like Bioshock or even the System Shock games of which Bioshock was a spiritual successor.\n\n[b]Gene Upgrades.[/b] You can no longer choose upgrades for different Plasmids to put into slots. Now, each Vigor has a preset number of upgrades that you can buy whenever you come across a machine that sells them. There's also no more Power to the People machines to upgrade guns, but there's upgrade machines for guns, too, and each gun has a preset number of upgrades similar to Plasmids. \n\nHOWEVER! In their place, something which is worth mentioning, we have Gear. Gear are pieces of equipment that are hats, shirts, pants, or boots, and they do different things. Things like reload faster, gain greater control over movement when riding on a Skyline, create a shockwave when jumping off a Skyline, killing enemies with melee restores HP, etc. These pieces of gear are found at preset places in the story, but the ones you find are randomized. These items are never massive bonuses, but they can at least change how you play. Are they the same as the old, more modular system? I'd say no.\n\n[b]Ammo types.[/b] Relatively-small thing, but there's no longer ammo types. Every gun only has standard ammo. If you liked being able to switch to Armor-Piercing rounds to take out Big Daddies, there's no more of that.\n\n[b]ADAM.[/b] You buy everything with money. Vigors, vigor upgrades. Gear is found, never purchased.\n\n[b]A talking protagonist.[/b] Booker DeWitt talks. You can hear his voice in the trailers, but he speaks throughout the game, though that is partly because he has a companion to talk to along with others.\n\nI think these are the main complaints levied against Infinite, but as I said above, I'm willing to look past them because the scope of the game and its story are much more compelling to me than Bioshock's. The things I listed aren't necessarily issues depending on what you liked about Bioshock. The reality is that while Infinite is by no means the game it could've been (Seriously, you can look up on YouTube \"What Bioshock Infinite could have been\" and see what they cut), what we got is still an interesting, visually-appealing experience.\n\nOne last thing I want to mention: I only mentioned things have a problem with. If you want more of a Bioshock game and none of the things I mentioned bother you, or you're willing to look past them, I obviously recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1511460834,"timestamp_updated":1511460834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521568655967712402","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrcGF9d8Cc5LfjQE="}
