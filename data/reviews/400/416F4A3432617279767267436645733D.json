This little puzzle game from Valve packs a huge punch for an experimental inclusion in the compilation set The Orange Box.\nYou are an unnamed lady test subject, #-----, and have been awakened from your stasis pod in your Relaxation Vault. The source of your awakening is an overly preppy sounding AI (GLaDOS) who sarcastically 'hopes your brief detention was a pleasant one' and you are to go through the Enrichment Centre. This is a series of test chambers, you start in 00, which contain puzzles and are to complete a total of 19 puzzle rooms which gradually increase in difficulty as more elements get added to each room. Your 'learning' is aided by a radio pumping out an upbeat version of Sill Alive, a series of cubes (including the companion cube) and the infamous Portal gun.\nEach room at the entrance contains a board with symbols giving your foresight into the puzzles which lay ahead and a customer service veiled couldn't care less style of commentary about your progress and the Enrichment Centre (the taste of blood being a perfectly normal side effect). GLaDOS clearly functions on sarcasm, lies/ manipulation and suspicious break downs in the middle of sentences.\n\nThis streamlined, linear level design is cleverly hidden behind a stark scientific cleanliness and minimalist setting. The various shades of grey are seen all over the facility, with blues and oranges peppered about the give life the bleak locations. I like the fogged windows in each of the testing chambers where you can see observation rooms full of equipment behind them and the various cameras all over, it gives the unsettling feeling of being constantly watched and judged. The rare glimpses of your character through the portals gives an interesting hint to the setting, you can see a bright orange jumpsuit and devices attached to your legs for enhanced movement around the facilities. I really like how you have to piece together the background to this game through the sparse hints you pick up during the game and how they aren't necessary to have a brilliant time.\nTo add to the spartan setting most of the sounds you hear are either GLaDOS speaking to you ore the radio, it creates a feeling of isolation and being separated from other humans.\n\nWhat I appreciate the most is the addition of bonus maps and challenge maps, which add an extra layer of difficulty to the base game. It gives both repeatability to the game and provides more for those who are seeking greater challenges. \n\nThis is a must play; you go around solving puzzles at the whim of a snarky and psychotic AI, who has a pitch black sense of humour. What more is there to love?","timestamp_created":1342804827,"timestamp_updated":1654624338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4001614","author":{"steamid":"76561198030516934","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":683,"last_played":1507411017},"language":"brazilian","review":"O bolo é uma mentira. = (","timestamp_created":1342793833,"timestamp_updated":1342793833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2102291","author":{"steamid":"76561198002343895","num_games_owned":291,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":944,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":838,"last_played":1381266129},"language":"english","review":"Bellissimo gioco di intelligenza, originale, grafica eccezionale, e strappa un sacco di risate.

Without a doubt, one of the most important games in Valve's deck of cards and it certainly has earned a spot in the hearts of many. \n\nPhysics-based puzzle-shooter that's worth gloating about. Dark humour that will make you question your own, and a story that keeps you guessing and wanting more. The only thing this game doesn't have is an iPad app tie-in offering free TF2 hates to thos whom own the titles originally on Steam*. If you don't have this game already, get it!\n\n*Copyright idea Valve.
