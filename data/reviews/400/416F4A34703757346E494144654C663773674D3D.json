Portal mechanic is unique and twist, although predictable is effective and the whole game is pretty fun. Some gripes I have is that GLaDOS's voice is pretty lifeless in this game and while you could make the argument that's the point they resigned it in Portal 2 and it's much better. Also the final fight feels pretty low stakes due to the only threats being the rockets and (here it comes) it's very short, it could use some more substance. But other than those 3 things I don'r really have any problems with it. 7/10","timestamp_created":1650333235,"timestamp_updated":1650333235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114101258","author":{"steamid":"76561199160570922","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":193,"last_played":1650771462},"language":"english","review":"Very nice .","timestamp_created":1650330298,"timestamp_updated":1650330298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114100477","author":{"steamid":"76561198416241246","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":193,"last_played":1649799714},"language":"brazilian","review":"O único defeito do jogo é que é um pouco curto.","timestamp_created":1650328801,"timestamp_updated":1650328801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114100434","author":{"steamid":"76561199267134435","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1652027233},"language":"english","review":"It is a good puzzle game","timestamp_created":1650328724,"timestamp_updated":1650328724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114100267","author":{"steamid":"76561198096109546","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":586,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":542,"last_played":1650332833},"language":"english","review":"very fun","timestamp_created":1650328461,"timestamp_updated":1650328461,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114098240","author":{"steamid":"76561198053205741","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":280,"last_played":1650745645},"language":"turkish","review":"Her zaman ki gibi yine bir harikaydı... yine siler yine yükler yine oynarım...ş Sonuçta bu bir deney...","timestamp_created":1650324666,"timestamp_updated":1650324666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114096708","author":{"steamid":"76561199195293617","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1650071453},"language":"english","review":"PORTAL","timestamp_created":1650321817,"timestamp_updated":1650321817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114084539","author":{"steamid":"76561199108782388","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1651989096},"language":"latam","review":"Un clásicaso qué tiene una continuación igual o más GOD","timestamp_created":1650318349,"timestamp_updated":1650318349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114084259","author":{"steamid":"76561199081753548","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":795,"last_played":1659997307},"language":"english","review":"EN: Portal is a really good game even after 14 years, 6 months, 1 week, and 1 day.\nFR: Portal est un excellent jeu même après 14 ans, 6 mois, 1 semaine et 1 jour.","timestamp_created":1650317871,"timestamp_updated":1650317871,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114083559","author":{"steamid":"76561198823281558","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":597,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1653685949},"language":"german","review":"Very Good Gameplay also the ambient of feeling alone hits really hard once you noticed it.

Even though I could beat this within 2 hours now, it is fun to revisit it every now and then. It takes you back in time, to a place where Valve still made games. It brings out a sense that can only be described by the words \"Why doesn't Valve make games anymore?\"\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis type of gameplay was revolutionary back in 2007. The fact that you could get one place to another without walking brought a whole new mechanic to gaming. And it only gets better when they add momentum into the game To think that it was originally just an experiment, or bonus game, for the upcoming Orange Box, which included Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2 (both of which becoming pioneers to gaming as well), is just amazing. In my Portal 2 review I mention that it's a \"Buffed Portal 1\". I wouldn't say this is exactly a \"nerfed Portal 2\", but rather a more heavy one due to the atmosphere. The fact that there is no one in the sight other than you and an AI creates a somewhat melancholy feeling.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThe story in Portal 1 is rather short, but it gets deeper the more you go into it. While I won't say everything, when you start to find the openings in the facility, it quickly escalates from a fun game with portals, into something larger. Not to mention, this game has one of the biggest plot twists in the history of gaming. I even knew about it before I played the game, mostly due to the saying [spoiler]\"The Cake is a Lie\"[/spoiler].\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\n\n There really isn't a huge soundtrack in this game compared to most games, but boy does it hit deep. When you load into the menu, you are met with this eerie drone that establishes a mysterious feeling. But when you a actually start the game, you get the famous portal radio song, which is happy and joyous compared to the menu drone. When you get more into the game, the music starts to become more ambiance than actual music. Then, you get to Test Chamber 10. The music here, \"self esteem fund', [i]really[/i] sets an atmosphere. It is one of the creepiest, yet soothing pieces of music I've heard from a video game in years. Of course, we can't forget the amazing, yet simple performance that \"Still Alive\" is at the end of the game. It uses dark humor and sarcasm, both of which GLaDOS is.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nPortal 1 really holds a place in my heart as what I like to call a \"simple, yet heavy game\".
