This accidently revives GLaDOS from the last game and you then are forced to do tests and what not same as the first. Nothing wrong with these tests, my major gripe comes from when wheatly takes over GLaDOS' body and sends you deep underground to the old aperture labs. One can quickly notice a distinct lack of portalable surfaces, which only become more and more scarce. It quickly becomes ridiculously difficult to find the one portal-able surface in an otherwise empty room in order to progress. This not only killed all game flow but made the game tedious. \n\nI'd normally have more to say, but I quit this game very early on because it was so boring that not even the briliant writing could salvage the game.\n\nBut- the actual tests are fun, introducing the new goo element to the gameplay, which give you abilities such as running faster or bouncing up in the air. This opens up an entire world of possibilities that I unfortunately can't be bothered to explore further. There is also co-op which cuts out the parts I disliked in the story and instead connects lab tests in a hub-world. These tests are fun and challenging because they utilize the 4-porta mechnic introduced with the addition of your co-op portal gun which can shoot purple and red (IIRC) portals.\n\nDisliked the story, loved the co-op puzzles, although they also suffered a bit from \"Where the hell is the one surface I can put a portal on\" -itis at times, nowhere near t the extend of the single player and it never really made the expirience unenjoyable.\n\nPlay for the co-op, not the story.\n7 /10","timestamp_created":1423506396,"timestamp_updated":1423506396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14405350","author":{"steamid":"76561197995808744","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2613,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1615,"last_played":1646437774},"language":"english","review":"<3","timestamp_created":1423503530,"timestamp_updated":1423503530,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14405295","author":{"steamid":"76561198085973570","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":729,"last_played":1487444924},"language":"brazilian","review":"S√≥ inteligentes jogam ;)\n","timestamp_created":1423503283,"timestamp_updated":1423503283,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14404921","author":{"steamid":"76561198172398877","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":576,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1474154800},"language":"english","review":"Easily one of the best games out there.","timestamp_created":1423501408,"timestamp_updated":1423501408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14404762","author":{"steamid":"76561198082728077","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":603,"last_played":1511687176},"language":"english","review":"Mind Fucked, We're Done Here.","timestamp_created":1423500620,"timestamp_updated":1423500620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519430220127105713","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14404690","author":{"steamid":"76561198046396618","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":360,"last_played":1467574725},"language":"english","review":"The single-player part of Portal 2 introduces a cast of new characters, new puzzle elements, and a much more confusing test chambers.

One of my favorite things is that my a person i know said that the portal universe is not the same as the half life universe but then when i showed him screenshots of the (easter egg spoiler) buoys that said \"borealis\" i got the best reaction. I have only two problems with this awesome game and they are #1: I kind of wish that maybe glados would tell you things about the original apeture laboratorey's (Basically more to fill in the story gaps) and #2: is i don't like the turret block mixes because there well.... awkward because they first get that vibe from glados when she is in the potato but when you see the blocks it gives you an even bigger awkward feeling and it makes glados seem normal.
