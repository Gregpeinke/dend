Fight the zombies or be a zombie. This is the first game that really makes you rely on teammates for assistance. Most players have moved on to L4D2, which certainly adds a lot of variety to the game, but L4D2 still feels incomplete and lacking in many ways. See my L4D2 review for more details. If you're trying to decide between L4D and L4D2, go with L4D.\n\n*Update: although I believe L4D1 is better than L4D2. At this point in time L4D1 is pretty much dead. Most servers are empty. Versus is almost always empty. If you can find players for L4D versus most of them brazingly cheat, act like aѕѕhоles, grief and/or crash the server via ddos or an exploit when the game doesn't go in their favor. I personally contacted Valve two times about patching vulnerbilities in their vanilla servers to prevent ddos. I believe the exploit that can cause a server to crash can also be patched. Valve has ignored my pleas. By the looks of it Valve has abondoned all support for this game.\n\nI remember when L4D versus gaming was a fun, rewarding socializing experience.

As a cooperative game - you are only as strong as your teammates. Teammates help against special zombies, some of which leave you helpless until teammates can save you. They can also share resources like pain pills, and heal you using their health pack. \n\nAlthough it offers a singleplayer experience, L4D is best played with at least one friend. Online multiplayer can be a bit hit-and-miss, due to players that will either disregard their teammates, or even join a game just to shoot everyone and leave. I recommend playing with friends you know, or befriending the good players that you meet online for future games.\n\nThere are also versus and survival modes which switch up the gameplay and allow you to play as some of the special infected (zombie) characters. In my opinion, Versus maps take too long - you have to play each level twice, once for each team, dragging a 40 minute campaign into an hour and a half. I don't think I've ever seen a Versus mode game through to the end.\n\nOn the other hand, Survival modes are great for quick and dirty (10 minute) games. If you're looking for a LAN party game where people take turns, this can be a good mode for that.\n\nThe other thing worth mentioning is the AI 'Director', a system which dynamically adjusts the gameplay based on how it thinks you are doing. If you get stuck against a horde of zombies and lose heaps of health, it may add more health packs or pills to the level. If you cakewalk through half a level with minimal damage, it might throw a large horde with a tank at you. This means that every game can be completely different depending on how things play out.\n\nOverall, I do recommend Left 4 Dead. The price is great, you can get a 4-pack of copies for your friends, it plays great at small LAN parties, and doesn't require the highest top-end PC specs either.

The atmosphere, the visuals, the pacing, the humor, the maps.\n\nValve reinvented co-operative gameplay with this title. Sure, there have been multiplayer games that let you mash bad guys as a group, but never done as thoroughly as L4D does it. Your team's survival depends on teamwork. And yet, it's never complicated. L4D rewards you for behaving exactly as you should behave if there really was a zombie apocalypse. Stay together as a group, watch each other's back. Share resources.\n\nThe Versus mode exemplifies these themes too, in that the infected team works best if the individuals cooperate and coordinate. \n\nAll of this adds up to an awesome \"beer & pretzels\" alternative to your usual hardcore fare.\n\nL4D2 one-ups L4D in many ways, but the atmosphere of the original is much darker. When Valve adapts all L4D maps for L4D2, there will be little reason left to buy this game... but still. It's on sale all the time.

Jumping into online Versus mode was tough at first, many people who were veterans of the game were really hard-assed and mouthy at times.
