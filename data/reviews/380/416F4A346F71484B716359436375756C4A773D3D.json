Ambos entram de novo na Citadel e tentam estabilizar o reator da torre antes que ele exploda. Após isso inicia-se uma jornada pela cidade que termina na extração deles e de membros da resistência pelos trens.\nA cidade está um caos completo. Além da guerra entre a resistência e os Combine, os Antlions invadiram a cidade.

You can see the Portal-like thinking in the design, especially at the beginning areas, which are a bit puzzle-based rather than combat heavy.  The difference is rather than using a portal device, you are using the gravity gun.  You don't even start with a crowbar.  \n\nOf course, this is just while the game prepares to return to form.  By the time it's over, you'll be back with crowbar in hand and a full array of weapons.  As well as the return of Gordon's followers.\n\nThe game emphasizes the follower/NPC mechanics, as not only will Gordon have NPC followers helping him through parts of the game, but Alyx follows him for most of the game.  Rather than being a burden to be protected like too many escorts, however, Alyx is an active combatant, and more than holds her own.

El juego tiene como dos mitades claramente diferenciadas, la primera es bastante repetitiva, aburrida y nada novedosa, reciclada del half life 2, ademas de que te hace tragarte largas conversaciones sin nada de contenido (no me importaria si fuesen conversaciones interesantes, pero no lo son).\nLa segunda parte del juego, es algo mas entretenida, pero tampoco muy novedosa. Trae un nuevo tipo de enemigo y alguna situacion interesante nueva a nivel jugable, pero nada importante respecto a la jugabilidad base de half-life 2. Lo que mas me gusto es una pequeña fase bastante oscura en la que depende totalmente de la linterna dandole un toquecillo survival horror.\nLa historia aporta mas bien poco, ya que es el mero camino entre los acontecimientos de half life 2 y los del episodio 2, ambos mucho mas interesantes. \nfinalmente decir   \n      ***CUIDADO POSIBLES SPOILERS****\n______________________________\n                        Que el final de este episodio nos deja con una situacion practicamente identica a la del final del half life 2. por lo que nos deja una sensacion de no haber avanzado absolutamente nada en la trama. \n______________________________\n\nMi recomendacion es: jugadlo si quereis obtener la experiencia completa de la saga half life, pero dejadlo de lado si lo que quereis es simplemente jugar un shooter. El episodio 2 le da mil vueltas a este en historia, duracion y novedades.\n\n7/10","timestamp_created":1403187908,"timestamp_updated":1530553919,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608075976371765137","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10506359","author":{"steamid":"76561198136496893","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":400,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":400,"last_played":1403110930},"language":"spanish","review":"10","timestamp_created":1403029593,"timestamp_updated":1403029593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10477839","author":{"steamid":"76561198081836079","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":158,"last_played":1417059923},"language":"brazilian","review":"TOP, é curtinho, nem dá pra gravar gameplay huehue.","timestamp_created":1402804540,"timestamp_updated":1402804540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10477163","author":{"steamid":"76561198081977752","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":282,"last_played":1577664040},"language":"english","review":"its part of the half life 2 series END OF STORY","timestamp_created":1402797834,"timestamp_updated":1402797834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10472908","author":{"steamid":"76561198069570711","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1402681557},"language":"russian","review":"Сюжет данного эпизода начинается сразу после окончания второй части.
