Half-Life was very enjoyable and had plenty of interesting parts that held my attention, plenty of hard parts that had me going, and a boss fight that was ..... interesting. The Story of half life is bonkers, especially if you read what they were going to do for Episode 3.\n\nI've never played any half life game up until the last 2 months. Highly recommend playing Co-Op as well, despite significantly more bugs in all half life games.","timestamp_created":1597007926,"timestamp_updated":1597007926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74049378","author":{"steamid":"76561197998856346","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":740,"last_played":1630435542},"language":"english","review":"The action is awsome.","timestamp_created":1597007672,"timestamp_updated":1597007672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74046264","author":{"steamid":"76561198131950021","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":72,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1660417947},"language":"spanish","review":"bueno","timestamp_created":1597002907,"timestamp_updated":1597002907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74042613","author":{"steamid":"76561198053386382","num_games_owned":620,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":732,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":732,"last_played":1596997548},"language":"german","review":"gute story mit vielen Rätseln und versteckten hinweisen bzw. hilfsmitteln.","timestamp_created":1596997691,"timestamp_updated":1596997691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74041663","author":{"steamid":"76561198301175780","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":927,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":927,"last_played":1596924798},"language":"english","review":"One of my favourite game series","timestamp_created":1596996301,"timestamp_updated":1596996301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74041644","author":{"steamid":"76561198840539990","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":409,"last_played":1653149222},"language":"english","review":"Old but fun","timestamp_created":1596996272,"timestamp_updated":1596996272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74038140","author":{"steamid":"76561198881883434","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":621,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":621,"last_played":1593371235},"language":"russian","review":"+","timestamp_created":1596991327,"timestamp_updated":1596991327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74036238","author":{"steamid":"76561198113353237","num_games_owned":337,"num_reviews":131,"playtime_forever":767,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":767,"last_played":1590098172},"language":"russian","review":"Мне сказали, что шедевр..
