Hry, která mě moc lákala atmosférou, ale odradila jejím gameplay. Na můj vkus nedodělané, moc sidequestů, malý spád, ale měl jsem v té hře strašně silné \"Bishock Vibes\". Volba tedy byla jasná, proč hrát něco nedokonalého s pocity z dokonalé hry a nezahrát si dokonalost samotnou?\nHra se zajímavým příběhem, který má spád, ale je také plný filozofických myšlenek o příběhu samotném, ale i o životě. I přes mou nechuť k roztahanosti po mapě a bočním linkám mě tato hra donutila vždy odbočit nebo vrátit se, abych posbíral vylepšení nebo  audiozáznamy k bližšímu vysvětlení příběhu. Sice jsem nezvádl z nich vše pochopit a po odehrání jsem si musel některé myšlenky ještě ověřit a doplnit, i tak to považuji za perfektně udělané. Autoři zvolil nějakou spránou míru, rovnováhu mezi linearitou a průzkumem. Zbraňový systém (= pouze 2 zbraně) mi celkem vyhovoval, nutil čas od času měnit zbraně, nebo investovat peníze do nábojů. Útoky pomocí superschopností jsou také zajímavé, nabízí i kombinace, nebo je potřeba volit rozdílné proti jiným nepřátelům.\nU této hry jsem už dříve poprvé začal uvažovat o myšlence, že počítačová hra není jen hra, ale i umělecké dílo a stojím si za tím. Po grafické i zvukové stránce poráda, navíc nějaké pop-kulturní narážky, při hraní se nenudíte. Hra i po 9 letech vypadá dobře s je dobře optimalizovaná.\nMoc děkuji tvůrcům, že ji vytesali do stavu, ve kterém je.

That's the only word I can come up with. It took me three attempts over multiple years to even make it through. The setting of Columbia, Religious Racism City in the Sky, is just so incredibly uninspired. Thinking back to Rapture in the first Bioshock, one of the intriguing parts was slowly uncovering what happened there and discovering increasingly unsettling things. In Columbia, within the first few minutes you're confronted with a horrible and by today's standards almost comically racist society. Everything bad is just on the surface, there is no depth.\n\nThe gameplay is not as fun as the previous Bioshock games, the dreadful two weapon limit taken from modern war shooters is the biggest reason for this. It encourages choosing reliability over fun and discourages experimenting with more exotic weapons.\n\nThe story has its ups and downs, but it often annoyed me, partly because I just do not like the player character, Booker DeWitt. Maybe I'm just tired of playing yet another fucking burly white guy. However, there is also Elizabeth, who was honestly the only thing that got me through the game. Her design is great and she's a sympathetic character. I also liked the ending, because it felt simplistic and sensical.\n\nOne thing I do not understand for the life of me, and this is not even a criticism necessarily, but I just... why is this a Bioshock game? The characterising features of the previous games were exploring an ideology and failing that, a really beautiful underwater city. And Bioshock Infinite has neither of these things. The only resemblence are the Vigors, which are analogous to Plasmids. But they're just kind of there, they're not tied into the story or world like Plasmids were. I honestly think I would have enjoyed this game a lot more if I did not go in expecting a Bioshock game. But like this I can't help but compare it to something it just does not live up to, perhaps because it is so different any comparison is mute.\n\n\nOne final thought about the setting: If you include horrible injustices like such overt racism in a game (or any work of art), you should have something to say about it. This game does not. It seems to be just there as a cheap way to make the bad guys the bad guys. The game also makes the incredibly questionable choice to portray the rebels rising up against this racist system as just as bad as the actual racists.","timestamp_created":1647183821,"timestamp_updated":1647375734,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49538835883140564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jM/zwf8CdfXXqwM="}
