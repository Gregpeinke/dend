Nie za bardzo wiem od czego zacząć; już dawno nie byłem tak bardzo podekscytowany z powodu gry. Gra sama w sobie stawia gracza przed wyzwaniem już na normalnym poziomie trudności (nie wspominam już o hardcore), co wcale nie jest klasyfikowane jako jej wada. Nawet z bardzo pomocnym NPC wrogowie potrafią pożądnie dopiec. Soundtrack jest niebanalny, bardzo przypomina mi chwile spędzone na radioaktywnych pustkowiach Fallouta. Grafika mnie po prostu zdmuchnęła (tak, udało mi się zagrać na ustawieniach ultra :) ). Rozgrywka jest przyjemna, walka wymagająca, możliwości na skopanie dupsk wrogom wiele. Fabuła jest bardziej zawiła niż może się zdawać na pierwszy rzut oka, po obejrzeniu zakończenia musiałem zrobić sobie porządną przerwę by wszystko w głowie poukładać. Nie wdając się w szczegóły, proponuję każdemu graczowi danie grze szansy (wycieczka po lepszy sprzęt wskazana).","timestamp_created":1387739843,"timestamp_updated":1415456531,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532232284545898438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8204575","author":{"steamid":"76561198082827391","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":651,"last_played":1578775057},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom jogo","timestamp_created":1387739816,"timestamp_updated":1387739816,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8204479","author":{"steamid":"76561198025609772","num_games_owned":791,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":2390,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2259,"last_played":1419374362},"language":"english","review":"By no means perfect, but absolutely worth your time and money.","timestamp_created":1387739587,"timestamp_updated":1387739587,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8204295","author":{"steamid":"76561198053848745","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":281,"last_played":1395483699},"language":"english","review":"This game is awesome mang. 9/11 would play again.","timestamp_created":1387739058,"timestamp_updated":1387739058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505018830299377441","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8204143","author":{"steamid":"76561198067100785","num_games_owned":351,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":822,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":818,"last_played":1400027327},"language":"english","review":"this game is amazing there is no reason why you shouldnt give it a chance usually i dont like bioshock i bought this as it was on sale and i am glad i did the visuals are stunning and the story is gripping and i had alot of fun playing it.","timestamp_created":1387738710,"timestamp_updated":1387738710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8203931","author":{"steamid":"76561197985121316","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":500,"last_played":1387561062},"language":"russian","review":"сидел прикованый к стулу 8 часов, огонь!","timestamp_created":1387738250,"timestamp_updated":1387738250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8203723","author":{"steamid":"76561198049104270","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":953,"last_played":1408750149},"language":"brazilian","review":"To adorando!","timestamp_created":1387737766,"timestamp_updated":1387737766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8203541","author":{"steamid":"76561198025120128","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":944,"last_played":1572735488},"language":"spanish","review":"Entre tanto shooter multiplayer, cooperativo y multi.. etc etc etc. llega esta bocanada de aire fresco, un FPS simple pero entretenido,  con una historia digna de un thriller de accion, y un final epico.

When I finally purchased the game and completed it, I was left with mixed feelings. While it was by far one of the best stories I've ever experienced in a video game, it feels better as a story and not as a exciting game. You are introduced by a opening cutscene familiar to the previous Bioshock Games, but within a few minutes, you enter the floating city of Columbia. For the first hour or so everything is fantastic. You can't help but smile at the incredible detail the developers put into creating the world. Acapella groups sing, children have conversations, and everyone seems to be having a great time. After you dig into the city a little, you start to understand it's dark secrets and extreme racial segregation. This is a game about politics. The entire time, the story throws a curve ball at you and you actually want to find out what happens next. The entire 7-8 hours it takes to complete the campaign is an incredible tale and is one you won't forget...but there are a few issues. \n\nThe gameplay feels a bit underdeveloped. It functions similar to anyother bioshock game so the powers your character gains are still here, but in the form of Vigors instead of plasmids. They are fun to play with, but you aren't really forced to use them in interesting ways so you can complete the entire game only using just a few, which is what I did. When the story slows down, it feels a bit awckward when Elizabeth, your companion delivers a dramatic line and goes through some tough emotions and then is fighting along side with you in battle mode the next minute. It's an amazing achievement what Irrational pulled off here, but the gameplay sections sometimes feel as if they were added just to increase the length of the game. Many times, you are forced to sit through wave after wave of enemy for no reason. The enemies are very fun, but after the first twenty waves, it gets repetitive and boring. It's a rollercoaster ride. The game is inconsistant on the game play side, but once the story picks up after every battle, it's all fine until the next group of waves show up and the whole cycle repeats.\n\n\nBioshock infinite is a joy from start to finish, and while it drags a bit in the middle, the story is no doubt one of the best ever told in a video game and if you don't mind a few stretched gameplay moments, buy this game!\n\n[b]9/10[/b]","timestamp_created":1387684815,"timestamp_updated":1387684815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8186407","author":{"steamid":"76561197961022399","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":6312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":949,"last_played":1584890133},"language":"english","review":"gets way more hate than it deserves.","timestamp_created":1387684677,"timestamp_updated":1387684677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8186169","author":{"steamid":"76561198064915098","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":533,"last_played":1408236141},"language":"english","review":"THIS GAME IS AWESOME","timestamp_created":1387683791,"timestamp_updated":1387683791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8186131","author":{"steamid":"76561198091988156","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":635,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":305,"last_played":1438644600},"language":"english","review":"this game is just amazing!
