With at least 2000 hours, I came across this game after seeing the Youtube video clip of Killing floor the resident evil map. I was speechless and who ever made the campaign and map which is downloadable just like any other map, you are in for a treat. PLEASE BUY THIS GAME if you are a zombie or survival horror fan or into action shooting. Lots of perks, meet fun cool and assholes online but hey its life. This game is possibly the closest game to reality. I made the best gaming memories with new game friends and will recommend to just about anyone! When I frist saw this in 2009 reminded me of Painkiller because of the unreal engine but hey its unique just as left 4 dead is unique in its own way. I played this game 2009 to 2011 then got back in 2013 for 3 months with thelp of friends on KF to help me earn every achievement, talk about addiction issues :P\n\nI was surprised by just about everything in the game that all fans wanted in a solid coop zeds game. I was invited to at least 3 clans and believe me you will have fun. \n\nSay you you wanna crash a Hell On Earth difficulty? Get your guns loaded, because  your team's life is on the edge of cliff !!!","timestamp_created":1475447927,"timestamp_updated":1475447927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532053112983703613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25829535","author":{"steamid":"76561198072472055","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":860,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":860,"last_played":1375796670},"language":"russian","review":"В ЭТУ ИГРУ ДОЛЖЕН ПОИГРАТЬ КАЖДЫЙ .

It's a fun wave based survival game with solid progression.\n\nKilling floor is a wave based survival game. I really enjoyed my time in the game because of the progression. There are 6 perks to choose from, and they encourage different playstyles. Leveling up perks will guns of that class do more damage, more ammo, faster move speed, etc. It's really quite enjoyable. There are also different difficulties to choose from, so that way you could replay the same level a few times on different difficulties, and get a different experience. \n\nThe story is a really simple one. A company called Horizine made some genetic monstrosities, and now they are wreaking havoc on London. The levels are set in different areas of the outbreak, but the story isn't really a story, more of just the setting. It's enough of a setting to allow you to unquestionably kill Zeds and level up your perks. \n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about. They are good, not great. Most computers won't have much of an issue running the game, because it is a fairly undemanding game. Graphics aren't really the focus of the game, and that is definitely fine. I honestly think the game was meant to kind of have an ugly or coarse style to it. What I mean by that is that no one will look over your shoulder and say, \"Wow, that's a pretty game\". \n\nThe music that is played during the waves is really enjoyable. I always enjoyed rocking out to a sick beat while murdering some Zeds. \n\nSome of the DLC for this game is really well designed. You definitely don't need all the DLC, because there are a lot of reskins of some weapons. Some of the guns you can get from DLC are really cool, like the Flare Revolvers. Those are probably my favorite firebug weapon. There was also a really cool steam punk pack. A lot of it came from the community after the first few, so they tried to involve the community.\n\nThere are plenty of custom maps for this game, so if you ever get bored with the fairly large selection of maps that came from Tripwire, then I'd recommend testing out some custom maps. The community does a good job with making maps, and it was definitely a source of added fun. \n\nTripwire put out a lot of free maps, achievements, and some items. They would do a lot of seasonal events, which could include a new map, gingerbread Zeds, and new achievements. They were always really enjoyable, because it felt like they were constantly trying to give back to the community. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game. It's a load of fun, has some really neat weapons, and it's really simple, but there are a lot of nuances learning about the different Zeds and how to handle them on different difficulties.

The whole point of this game is you work together with your team in order to beat the maps. When it comes to teamwork, it can be pretty serious. You'll have to think about your team at some point if you have to survive. In game theres cash you obtain from surviving, including killing infected known as \"ZEDs\". You also need to spend wisely on stuff such as guns, ammo, armor, etc.\n\nTheres also a VERY low time limit and normally it'll suggest you to be near at the shop so you'll have the time to think what you need to buy. But think fast or else the shop will shut down and the round will start. The shop will open every time you complete a wave.\n\nFrom my experience theres a total of 10 waves (i played a server once with only 4 waves). Difficulty varies and usually I see either normal or hard mode. In this game, you'll play a total of 11 waves (or 5, whatever server you play), which THAT wave will be a boss battle in which you have to defeat in order to win.\n\nBe sure to play smart when going against a boss, otherwise you'll be dead in seconds. You'll need to do some teamwork to take down that boss, but its possible to beat it alone if you are well aware of the boss' tactics. But can be a challenge.\n\nTheres also objective mode, where you have to complete objectives in order to go through, just like survival mode (known as simply killing floor), theres also a boss battle before you are about to beat the maps.\n\nThe servers in multiplayer has its moments where its either alive or dead. But if one look really hard at the server lists, theres some that are alive. But can be easily empty if the game ended whether you and your team beat it or failed. So which means you'll do more searching, but the gameplay is quite long so its not really a big problem.\n\nAnyways overall, this game is good. I should also point out there were some whacky moments as well (in a funny way), usually involves costumes or skins for infecteds. You'll see what I mean when you play it or see the video of it. Has some laughs too.\n\nEdit: I forgot to point out that this game has perks, where you use it for abilities to help you on your surivial, and each perks has their own weapons in the shop. However, you can chose whatever weapon you want, but know this that your ability may not help you out on the guns that is not for that perk you have.\n\nTheres also another I forgot to mention, that this game has NO crosshair from my experience. If you want to aim, you have to aim down sights. You can shoot from hip, just remember where you aim down sights. The hipfire is very accurate comparing from other games where you usually shoot everywhere. Only exception is some guns like machine guns or assault rifes tends to make you move alot when shooting, so control your movement to get better aim or shoot one or few rounds to make your aim better. Pistols can too, but not as much as the stronger weapons, although high calibur pistols can be difficult too if you go trigger happy.","timestamp_created":1472443284,"timestamp_updated":1472444127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25218788","author":{"steamid":"76561198104470720","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":254,"last_played":1466591527},"language":"russian","review":"В целом игра давольно не плохая, графика, сюжет если так можно сказать.\nУ каждого свой вкус, не буду говорить что вам понравится, но мне  понравилась и вам советую!","timestamp_created":1472431381,"timestamp_updated":1472431381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25216982","author":{"steamid":"76561198053833923","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":3118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3118,"last_played":1468994053},"language":"english","review":"This game used to be the shit when I had a low-quality laptop.\n\n>>Now this game looks like shit.","timestamp_created":1472423338,"timestamp_updated":1472423338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25211631","author":{"steamid":"76561198096547067","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":1918,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1736,"last_played":1435511253},"language":"italian","review":"Gioco strafantastico, non vedo l'ora di provare il 2! :D\n\nVoto Finale: 10/10","timestamp_created":1472406936,"timestamp_updated":1472406936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25208725","author":{"steamid":"76561198243308794","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1534655048},"language":"brazilian","review":"leglzinho","timestamp_created":1472398921,"timestamp_updated":1472398921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25205457","author":{"steamid":"76561198149614881","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":128,"last_played":1413730111},"language":"english","review":"Played it on free weekend, was fun to play.","timestamp_created":1472388949,"timestamp_updated":1472388949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25205335","author":{"steamid":"76561198059716311","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4594,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4560,"last_played":1486407597},"language":"french","review":"Super jeu du bon gros choute de zoobie comme on aime avec des classe, et un travail t'equipe possible voir obligatoire dans le ward mais la communauté et genial que demander de plus ?","timestamp_created":1472388616,"timestamp_updated":1472388616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25203616","author":{"steamid":"76561198061226888","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":930,"last_played":1560179484},"language":"russian","review":"Игра великолепная играю с самого появления.
