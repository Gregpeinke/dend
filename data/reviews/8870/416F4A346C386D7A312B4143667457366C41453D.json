This game really has a way of pulling you in and really making you feel real emotion, real sorrow, real joy and everything in between. The best part of the game was when you're launched into the air, being introduced to this new enviornment, it's just filled with colors and all these floating buildings, and zeppelins everywhere. It's so surreal. Let's go into the ending... you REALLY wanna see this ending, you build it up for so long throughout the game and you have no idea how it's gonna end. This game doesn't have that typical \"I have to kill this guy to end the game.\" feeling. Truth be told, you have no idea how it's gonna end. Everytime you think you've reached the ending, you really haven't.\n\nIt's been a few weeks and I still haven't gotten over it. I know this game is five years old now, but this was the first time I was introduced to this franchise, and I felt like a review was completely necessary. And to be honest, for a 2013 game, it beats out every single player game that's out NOW. It's just so powerful. Please do yourself a favor, buy this game. Seriously, buy it... right now.","timestamp_created":1515018183,"timestamp_updated":1515018183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39025370","author":{"steamid":"76561198136037795","num_games_owned":1321,"num_reviews":101,"playtime_forever":951,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":951,"last_played":1515010969},"language":"russian","review":"[h1][i]Сюжет разрабы замутили топовый, но он не раз сломает тебе голову.\nГрафенчик чуть-лучше, чем в Дизоноре.\nСаундтрек приятный, почти всегда играет олдскульчик)\nГеймплей разнообразен, но я бы убрал большое разнообразие зелий и оружий, т.к. ты хочешь вдруг поиграть за одно оружие, а по ситуации требуется воспользоваться другим.

The combat may seem simple, but it's really fun, especially jumping around skylining all your enimies and many of the guns aren't half bad (sniper!).

The story is thrilling, it has taken me on an immersive ride with many twists and suprises; I really enjoyed watching the secrets-the truth, unfold before my eyes. The creepy mother ghost boss may have been a hassle, however, it was still fun to go through (tip: [b] use the upgraded return to sender shield and a sniper or some other crazy gun and just go ham[/b]).

And I’ll tell you why. To say that something is wet means that the water on the surface of that something can be removed. You get caught outside in the rain, you say “Aw, my hair got wet, now I gotta get it redid.” “Aw, my shoes got wet, now I gotta let’em sit outside, and dry.” You don’t say, that the ocean gets wet, it’s just water, water is water. Fire, right? We know that it burns things right? But it’s not in and of itself burned, right? Water, it wets things but it’s not in and of itself wet. Okay? The word wet is only supposed to be used when water gets on something. For example if I were to splash water on this mirror right here and say it’s wet, but if it were somehow possible to splash water droplets onto water, well you could see the water droplets sitting on the water, you’d say “Oh that water is wet!” But the term wet is an adjective that is only conditional, that’s used to describe the surface of something that is typically dry. Ladies and gentlemen, here’s the simple proof test: This counter is dry, I pour water on it, it becomes wet. Can it be dried? Absolutely. Therefore was wet it is now dry. The water on the inside of the bottle, however. Can it be dried? Absolutely the frick not! Ending clause: The definition of wet reads “Covered or saturated with water or another liquid”. Water cannot be covered or saturated with itself.
