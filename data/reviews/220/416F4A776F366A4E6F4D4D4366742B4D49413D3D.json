The game is a classic that should be played by any fan of FPS and/or action adventure games.  I've personally have beaten this game countless times and even with this new steam account, it was the first thing I bought because I knew I would want to play it again.  This PC version is king compared to the PS3 port I own of the Orange Box.  The reason this game is a classic is because at the time of release it was easily the best FPS on the market and shaped the way FPS was created from then on.  When playing it you felt like you were starring in an action film, but then again thats still true to this day even if other modern titles take that idea to a whole new level.  Riding in a boat or dune buggy in a FPS was brilliant at the time.  But even modern games causing this great title to age in comparison, none of the modern FPS titles stand out like HL2 stood out for years when it was released.  This game will forever be seen as one of the most important points/titles in the evolution of such a popular, and some what  diluted, genre.  This is on the level of Doom, Quake, and Bioshock as one of the most important FPS ever made.","timestamp_created":1388479775,"timestamp_updated":1388479775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8449982","author":{"steamid":"76561198065838941","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1166,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":780,"last_played":1642799269},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games made by Valve, Good graphic , story and soundtracks...","timestamp_created":1388473829,"timestamp_updated":1388473829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8449114","author":{"steamid":"76561198016999497","num_games_owned":436,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2015,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1602,"last_played":1628975498},"language":"russian","review":"Классика!","timestamp_created":1388470010,"timestamp_updated":1480056093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8448974","author":{"steamid":"76561198080920953","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1053,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":134,"last_played":1429420353},"language":"english","review":"I Love This Game Sooooo Much","timestamp_created":1388469482,"timestamp_updated":1388469482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8448399","author":{"steamid":"76561198112217915","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1457178288},"language":"russian","review":"Спасибо что сделали русский язык а то я мучился так прикольная игра но серавно надо придется скачивать отсстальный главы и это печаль ((","timestamp_created":1388467248,"timestamp_updated":1388467248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8448077","author":{"steamid":"76561198067744147","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":587,"last_played":1432496449},"language":"english","review":"poop","timestamp_created":1388465945,"timestamp_updated":1388465945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8447797","author":{"steamid":"76561198025166477","num_games_owned":486,"num_reviews":105,"playtime_forever":948,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":948,"last_played":1388463790},"language":"english","review":"Clearly a product of its time. But for two amazingly fun  aspects, this would not be a game to recommend. \n\nThe plot is essentially find NPC A, rescue NPC A, then rescue NPC A again, which wouldn't be bad if there were subplots to break it up. Instead it is essentially a shooter version of the first three levels of Super Mario Brothers that runs on for an agonizingly long time. \n\nI abhor vehicle stages, so it is no surprise that I loathed about 2/5 of this game, where you are forced to drive through. Although I was nearly driven to claw my eyes out over this, these sections are most assuredly a product of the time when the game was made, as vehicle stages were the in thing. \n\nThe music, where nice, is sporadic and inconsistent. This makes it detract from the game play far more than it enhances it.\n\nOn the plus side, the overall visuals still hold up well. This isn't Mass Effect 3, but its still solid.\n\nThe thing that likely got the game the high marks that it did was the gravity gun, which, yes, was a lot of fun, especially when it finally gets supercharged. Even its lesser version is crazy good and opens possibilities for puzzles.\n\nControlling the antlions also proved amazing fun. It is minion madness at its best. This contrasts starkly to the obnoxious squad members you get later.\n\nOverall the gravity gun and antlions make this game fun when they are at their peak, but when they aren't, the levels just seem to drone on and on.","timestamp_created":1388464840,"timestamp_updated":1388464840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8447758","author":{"steamid":"76561198047367734","num_games_owned":430,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1362,"last_played":1407818211},"language":"english","review":"This game is absolutely amazing. I feel that too many people over look this games true beauty because they only want it for the amazing mods that come with it. Although the mods for this game are fantastic, the game itself is a gem. Fresh off of the train to City 17 is Gordon Freeman, a physicist and survivor of the terrible events of Black Mesa. Freeman has been absent for years and has been dropped back into a world where the Combine, the alien menace from the first Half Life, has taken control of the earth and has began opressing its people. Gordon Freeman must liberate the earth and save the day yet again. This game was truly an experiance to play and felt like more of a story. The way that characters express their emotions not only through dialogue but facial expressions is truly remarkable. Also Gordon Freeman has the best voice actor ever.","timestamp_created":1388464723,"timestamp_updated":1388464723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8447227","author":{"steamid":"76561197978258996","num_games_owned":1221,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1376,"last_played":1381247033},"language":"english","review":"A thrill a minute for the most part.

El gunplay es divertidísmo, mucho mejor que el de su antecesor, el cual aunque es un juegazo también, tiene una jugabilidad un poco anticuada (movimientos demasiado rápidos sobre todo) La ambientación es muy buena, y además variada, desde canales y carreteras hasta ciudades en guerra civil y pueblos arrasados por zombies. Esto conlleva a la gran variedad de situaciones que hay, ya que podemos conducir una lancha y un coche, luego tenemos survival horror, tenemos también shooter más táctico, donde podemos controlar escuadrones de rebeldes, etc. La banda sonora está guay, y la trama argumental bastante bien llevada a través de la narrativa visual, aunque te deja con más preguntas que respuestas.

La accion y la intensidad se la vive a todo momento. La historia la dejan super abierta y dan ganas de seguir jugando el otro, exactamente cuando termina uno. Hay un par de partes tensas en las que estar solo y el haber zombies en todas partes puede ser que te complique un poco las cosas como en el capitulo \"Nos vamos a Ravenholm...\". La aparicion de los Combine esta muy buena porque no solo tenes que luchar contra los aliens como los Vortigaunts o los Headcrab sino que hay un par de \"soldaditos\" malos que tenes que descargarle cartucho. Tambien aparecen personajes \"nuevos\" como Eli Vance y su hija Alyx.
