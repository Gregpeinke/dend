Una obra maestra en todos los aspectos y un juego muy adelantado a su tiempo, como en su época lo estuvo ''Half Life''. Soluciona todos los fallos que tuvo el primero (que por otro lado también es un juego excelente) como por ejemplo el problema de la velocidad del personaje, que en este juego se soluciona gracias a que el personaje puede esprintar o andar o el problema del ''FOV'', también solucionado.\n\nHalf Life 2 es un juego excelente que destaca en muchos aspectos. Un aspecto a destacar es su manera de narrar la trama del juego, la cual se hace sin NINGUNA cutscene, todo in-game, y además no te atosiga con tutoriales estúpidos, como enseñarte a agacharte o a saltar. Lo hace de una manera muy discreta, enseñándote aspectos del juego en pequeñas dosis pero nunca llegando a ser pesado. Otro aspecto muy destacable son los gráficos, el juego tiene prácticamente 10 años y aún y así los gráficos siguen siendo muy buenos y en muchos aspectos gana a muchos juegos de hoy en día, como el aspecto de poder jugar con las físicas, de coger objetos, la vistosidad del agua... Por otra parte la historia te sumerge en un mundo muy interesante, con una trama que te deja enganchado hasta el final y te hace ganas de querer más. Recomiendo jugar ''Half Life 1'' primero, ya que es otro juego increíble y los hechos de este juego están conectados con el suceso de Black Mesa de la primera parte (las expansiones de ''Half Life 1'' son completamente prescindibles, a no ser que quieras conocer algunos detalles de la historia).\n\nEso sí, no todo son rosas en Half Life 2. No hay ningún juego perfecto, y este no es la excepción. Este juego tiene el PEOR doblaje al español que he oído en mi vida, sin exagerar. No se cómo de bueno será el doblaje latino, ni siquiera sé si tiene doblaje latino, pero yo soy español y he de decir que el doblaje me a hecho sangrar las orejas, a excepción quizás el de Gman, cuya voz creo que es la más soportable gracias a que tiene la excusa de tener problemas respiratorios. Al final el doblaje te acaba resultando hasta gracioso, pero hasta entonces... prepárate para lo equivalente a la coprofagia auditiva. Gordon tiene que dar las gracias por ser mudo.\n\nSalvo este pequeño detalle, Half Life 2 es un juego increíble, un hito en el mundo videojugabilístico, un punto de referencia en este mundillo el cual sin ninguna duda muchos desarrolladores tendrían que girarse a mirar.\n\nHalf Life 2 es una experiencia ¿Qué esperas para vivirla?","timestamp_created":1396228042,"timestamp_updated":1479932031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.692332208156585693","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9680371","author":{"steamid":"76561198079173277","num_games_owned":835,"num_reviews":120,"playtime_forever":326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":282,"last_played":1530137717},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo bacanudo","timestamp_created":1396215546,"timestamp_updated":1503785145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":38,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.655750095844268799","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9679123","author":{"steamid":"76561198089429544","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2000,"last_played":1498273381},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game with a great storyline.

Being such a highly rated game, I was sure it wouldn't disappoint. It hasn't. I'm about done with the campaign and it has been a fun little journey. It's definitely a must play for anyone who's enjoyed a fps.\n\nThe only problem I have with it is that Gordon Freeman isn't relatable at all.. for two reasons in my opinion. 1) He is one of the classic silent video game heros. 2) He is praised by all. There's no internal issues, no doubters, nobody to prove himself to, no emotions, no struggle apart from saving everyone.\n\nThe one con I've noticed is easy to forgive though. Everything else is immersive enough..and if you don't feel a part of the story, go buy a fancy new Oculus Rift! This game has native support. \n\nAll in all, great game.
