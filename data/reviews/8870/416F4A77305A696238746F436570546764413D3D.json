Hence, it made it a really difficult task to live up to that. While a solid philosophical piece, the first game's story didn't fair well after the climactic reveal and led into a somewhat \"no-holds-barred\" standard fps game. \n\nWhat sets Infinite apart is that it doesn't try to live up to the first game, but it sets itself as a story of its own, and not trying to hold on to the roots of Rapture. Columbia is defined as a beautiful city of it's own, albeit with a sad and dark secret. Sure, there are easter eggs that indicate it's connections to Bioshock 1, but that is only because it fits with the story.\n\nThe story itself is beautifully layered, and while it lacks the atmosphere and human philosophy from the first game, it makes up for it in a beautiful narrative that can be viewed from the perspective of two sets of characters. The second perspetive is not at all obvious and makes sense only when you shut off your common sense and linear thinking, and think from the perspective of a crazy Quamtum Physicist (that's a hint). There's too much to get into from the philosophy of the Physics itself, but that would spoil the fun of discovery.\n\nElizabeth is a great character and probably one of the best AI companions in any game. The voice acting and the soundtrack in the game is phenomenal. While the art style is unique in it's own way and a bit different from the first two games, it still doesn't fail to add to the visual beauty of the game itself. Gameplay is fun, and doesn't take away from the immersion into the narrative of the game. \n\nAll in all, it's a solid 10/10 from my part.
