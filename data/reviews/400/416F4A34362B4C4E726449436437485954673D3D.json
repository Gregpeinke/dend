You can use a device to force open holes where there weren't holes before, so you can penetrate them. Penetrating the holes will take you to an entirely new place, believe me. You can even penetrate multiple holes at the same time, this is called double penetration. A great thing about Portal is that you can go in and out of a hole repeatedly. You can also force objects into the holes, this is often used to reach the game's climactic finish.

Nothing new here. I do believe it simply wasn't meant to be too long in the first place but more like a side content to The Orange Box back in the day, but still.\nAlso, soundtrack was a little disappointing in my opinion.\nAnd, before completing the main game, I've seen that there are \"challenges\" and \"advanced maps\", and imagined that they would add more content to the game, but figured out later that these are merely a revisions of the original maps from the campaign.\n\nSo, just let me confess here, that Portal didn't completely live up to my expectations. (~Hiding myself from possibly thrown objects~)\nAs this game is so positively accepted I did expect something more.\nBeing so short and the lack of additional content in the base game didn't help much.\nIt was fun but ended too soon, and the story just felt... meeeh.\nAnd the challenges started to feel too crazy for me as soon as they started depending on trial&error\\some luck, facts which I don't like!\n\nI did grow a lot fonder of Portal as I played through the developers commentary.\nHearing their thoughts and the game-making process made me appreciate everything much more, somehow.\nI even liked better that \"Still Alive\" song which at first seemed bizzare and weird to me.\n\nAnyway, I'm not going to fully review this game and describe all of it's good aspects, because you probably know them already, and if not (!?) then you should experience it yourself, even by trying the demo.\nJust wanted to share my little story of falling in love with the game.\n\nPortal is without a doubt a very extraordinary puzzle game, brilliantly original, and I doubt we'll ever see any other game of the kind. Many other games tried to follow Portal's lead and so far I didn't encounter much success among these attempts.\n\nIt goes constantly on sale, and it's actually worth the full price of 10$ as well.\nIf you didn't already, it's time to play!","timestamp_created":1453584271,"timestamp_updated":1453584271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20706978","author":{"steamid":"76561198163425348","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":67,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":67,"last_played":1453997247},"language":"english","review":"Portal is a very different game indeed.

challenging.\n\nThere isn't really that much to say about the game, since it doesn't have much replayablity, you play it once, get the achievements, and quit. And maybe play it again in a few years later.\n\nI recommend buying it on the Orange Box Bundle, but you can buy the game by itself aswell, and It will still be worth the money!","timestamp_created":1453413943,"timestamp_updated":1509564682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20667072","author":{"steamid":"76561198191448919","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2355,"last_played":1636338018},"language":"english","review":"Love this game, very unique","timestamp_created":1453409651,"timestamp_updated":1453409651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20666985","author":{"steamid":"76561198122256093","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":165,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164,"last_played":1554748698},"language":"italian","review":"Giocone, un must\n","timestamp_created":1453409330,"timestamp_updated":1453409330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20665811","author":{"steamid":"76561198160508890","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1116,"last_played":1546812604},"language":"english","review":"Very good.","timestamp_created":1453404983,"timestamp_updated":1453404983,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20665504","author":{"steamid":"76561198051694727","num_games_owned":491,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":290,"last_played":1587176345},"language":"english","review":"This game is older, but it still rocks!","timestamp_created":1453403934,"timestamp_updated":1453403934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20663287","author":{"steamid":"76561198243891124","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1646564244},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom","timestamp_created":1453396013,"timestamp_updated":1453396013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20662744","author":{"steamid":"76561198127819757","num_games_owned":647,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":86,"last_played":1654347398},"language":"english","review":"Yes Yes Yes.
