Waking up in a glass cell, we’re greeted by the voice of GLaDOS, a robotic overseer who tells us that the test is ready to begin and good luck. Throughout the game this antagonistic (but not immediately evil) artificial intelligence talks almost constantly without actually explaining any stories to the players, leaving it up to visual cues (like the makeshift dens hidden in the walls) to let us know what happened before we came along. It’s minimalist on every level, and there’s no indication until the very end of [i]Portal[/i] that our actions are in any way important to GLaDOS or the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Centre where we’ve been interned (we don’t even know if GLaDOS is an entity or a set of recordings).\n\nGLaDOS constantly belittles players with highly official comments that always have a darkly humorous undertone, a style which works largely because of the game’s length - [i] Portal[/i] only takes about an hour to finish, which seems to be the perfect amount of time for our sarcastic narrator to get her licks in without it starting to grate. As a consolation for its length, the game is structured with crazy precision. Puzzle elements are introduced, we’re forced to demonstrate our understanding almost immediately, and the game moves on. Usually this element will come back later as part of another puzzle, but only once or twice. Finishing chambers gives you the problem solving tools you need to solve the next one, which is the reason [i]Portal[/i] is never frustrating.\n\nIf I were to criticise something about [i]Portal[/i], I’d say none of it properly culminates into a climax. Everything after Chamber 19 gets samey very quickly, and the final few levels don’t make use of anything you’ve learnt or done throughout the rest of the game. This includes the final boss, which is admittedly great fun tonally and narratively (GLaDOS monologues for about 4.5 minutes non-stop and it’s the best writing in the whole game). To summarise, [i]Portal[/i] is split into two very distinctive halves, and whilst the second half isn’t nearly as solid gameplay-wise, the way the environment aids the storytelling in the whole office block area of the game is too good to hold anything against it. Comparing the two halves like this is like comparing chocolate milk with a slightly smaller quantity of chocolate milk - yes, it’s obviously brilliant the whole way through. No, it shouldn’t have a longer sequel with more characters.\n\nWhoops too late.\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/oked/recommended/620/]My review of [i]Portal 2[/i].[/url]","timestamp_created":1429124396,"timestamp_updated":1514540326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.433593034744262695","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15388021","author":{"steamid":"76561198087212405","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":90,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":90,"last_played":1422742030},"language":"french","review":"Portal ou l'art de se faire retourner le cerveau (dans tous les sens du terme) par une IA pop star manquée.","timestamp_created":1429116519,"timestamp_updated":1429116519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15369578","author":{"steamid":"76561198050653609","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1739,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1265,"last_played":1638688632},"language":"english","review":"So, you finished the story.

A lot of others complained about lack of character and story development; I can not disagree.  The characters do lack depth, and the plot is strictly linear.\n\nThe puzzles range from simple to thought-provoking, and many of them require a perspective that is not easily obtained.\n\nDespite the plot being strictly linear, a second run through is obligatory for certain reasons (in particular to collect certain awards).  Beyond this, replayability declines, as additional runs seem to offer no additional challenge beyond trying to beat best times or otherwise optimise one's performance on various tests (there are awards for that, too).\n\nI would recommend Portal to someone who finds the premise interesting, or who likes puzzle games.

Não tem como não jogar.\n\nPortal é um jogo feito pela Valve usando como base a engine Source (a mesma do HL2 e CS), e conta a história de Chell, uma cobaia de testes da Aperture Science que é acordada de um período de hibernação para testar a arma de portais (chamada no jogo de ASHPD - Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device), porém tem como inimiga a IA psicopata/maníaca/sei lá GLaDOS, que diz que no final do teste haverá \"bolo\". Bom, o resto já sabemos, só coloquei isso pra review ficar consistente.\n\nO gameplay consiste em resolver puzzles virtualmente impossíveis - seriam se você não tivesse a arma de portais - usando um dispositivo que cria portais nas superfícies, levando você de um ponto A a um ponto praticamente impossível de se alcançar por métodos normais. Sinceramente foi uma das coisas mais legais que eu vi fazerem num jogo, você poder se transportar pra qualquer lugar sem ter que caminhar quase nada (seria uma mão na roda na vida real). Para evitar quedas horrendas seguidas de morte, Chell é equipada com botas especiais que a protegem de quedas absurdamente grandes: não importa a altura, você chega no chão intacto e vivo.\n\nO ambiente todo do jogo é bem feito, faz você sentir que está mesmo sendo observado e que você é só uma cobaia servindo de testes que você não sabe o propósito de serem feitos. Apesar de ter poucas músicas, elas também ajudam na atmosfera tensa. A história do jogo é muito bem bolada, cativa você até o final.\n\nO jogo é basicamente perfeito, só peca por (como sempre nos meus reviews eu acabo notando isso mas) ser um pouco curto, o que foi até resolvido na sequela, porém os modos extras de jogo com desafios e mapas mais avançados servem de contrapeso. O jogo é tão bom que rendeu até uma versão em Flash feito por fãs e que também é muito bom. Pena que também não teve multiplayer, mas como é o primeiro jogo e o segundo teve então isso pode passar despercebido.\n\nEnfim, se você nunca jogou esse jogo, mesmo pirateado (o que eu duvido muito porque é Portal, cara), jogue. Você vai curtir. Ah, e o bolo é uma mentira. Sempre foi.\n\n\nPRÓS:\n+Jogabilidade única e inovadora até hoje, mesmo sendo um jogo antigo\n+História muito bem bolada (ponto a mais por causa da GLaDOS)\n+Uso ótimo da física e momentum graças à engine Source\n+Um clássico que todo mundo deveria jogar\n\nMAIS OU MENOS:\n~Não tem multiplayer apesar de não precisar\n\nCONTRAS:\n-Tá certo que é o primeiro jogo, mas é um pouquinho curto, apesar de ter modos extras de jogo como contrapeso\n\nNOTA FINAL: 9/10","timestamp_created":1428539847,"timestamp_updated":1428539928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15270978","author":{"steamid":"76561198027917433","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":251,"last_played":1539748503},"language":"english","review":"Love this game.

Sin embargo, ese peso del argumento confunde y hace que te sepa a poco.\n\nEs un juego de puzles, como digo, originalmente de regalo con un pack de otro juego, pero sus creadores no dejaron que fuera un simple juego de puzles y lo cubrieron de una narrativa intrigante, sorprendente y absorbente, que lleva al jugador a pasar de la sonrisa a la angustia en un giro inesperado que acaba de un plumazo con lo que parecía una simple broma de los programadores.\n\nY es precisamente por esa envolvente trama y por lo novedoso del género por lo que se llega al final dejando al jugador con la sensación de que sólo ha jugado el entrenamiento y que cuando de verdad va a empezar el juego, salen los títulos de crédito.

O jogo mistura ação com puzzles onde o jogador deve usar uma arma especial chamada \"Portal Gun\" que emite dois tipos de portais (azul e laranja) e também a cabeça calculando seus passos para chegar até a poderosa GLaDOS.\n\nO jogo consiste em vários enigmas que devem ser solucionados se teletransportando usando a \"Portal Gun\", que como o próprio nome diz é uma arma que cria portais em superfícies planas. A todo momento o jogador é desafiado pela GLaDOS onde deve completar as fases no \"Aperture Science\" usando a Portal Gun com a promessa de que se chegar ao fim ganhará um bolo. Um aspecto interessante é a física do jogo e sua jogabilidade (assim como todos os jogos da Valve), um bom exemplo disso é uma manobra muito usada onde deve-se pular de um local alto em um portal sobre o chão e emergir com alta velocidade sobre um segundo portal feito sobre uma parede, isto fará o jogador ganhar velocidade devido a gravidade representada também no jogo.\n\nO jogo possui apenas 2 personagens, Chell (protagonista)e GLaDOS (um computador de inteligência artificial). A história do jogo é contada via mensagens de áudios ditas por GLaDOS e escritas em algumas paredes. O jogo se inicia com Chell acordando e ouvindo instruções e advertências de GLaDOS sobre testes que a mesma irá sofrer. Chell procede pelo \"Enrichment Center\" vazio e calada, sim, Chell não diz uma palavra se quer durante o jogo. Conforme passa pelas Câmaras de Testes, o jogador aprende novas tecnicas muito úteis que o ajudará durante sua jornada, seguindo sempre as ordens de GLaDOS. Ao final do jogo, Chell deve derrotar GLaDOS em um curto período de seis minutos ou ela matará a protagonista com suas neurotoxinas, Chell então deve atingir GLaDOS utilizando de suas próprias artimanhas e incinerando seus componentes em uma caldeira que deve ser ativada. A cena final, após um longo e rápido zoom pelas entranhas da instalação, mostra uma mistura de prateleiras ao redor de um Bolo Floresta Negra e um Cubo. As prateleiras contêm vários núcleos, alguns deles se acendendo antes de um braço robótico aparecer e apagar a única vela do bolo.\n\nPortal ganhou vários prêmios, foi aclamado como um dos melhores e mais originais da década passada apesar de sua duração extremamente baixa. Com sua jogabilidade única e um enredo humorístico o jogo vem conquistando fãs até hoje, o jogo foi tão popular que levou a criação de merchandise oficial pela Valve, onde criam objetos de pelúcia encontrados no jogo como os vários cubos, a Portal Gun e o sonhado bolo.\n\nSão ao todo 19 fases para serem concluídas e mais algumas fases bônus encontradas no menu principal, onde o jogador é desafiado e deve passar pelas mesmas câmaras antes utilizando menos portais ou passar pela mesma no menor tempo possível. Possui também uma trilha sonora fantástica onde uma das músicas ficou famosa pelo sucesso do jogo, a \"Still Alive\", onde a mesma é tocada ao final do jogo já nos créditos. Por fim, Portal é um jogo extremamente simples em alguns quesitos, mas muito divertido e chama a atençao de quem o joga, se gostar do jogo procure jogar também sua sequência Portal 2 e quem sabe um dia Portal 3 né Dona Valve!?\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/bioooo/screenshots/?appid=400&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall] Imagens [/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/bioooo/videos/?appid=400] Vídeos [/url]\nArtes\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Prós[/th]\n        [th]Contras[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ótimos gráficos[/td]\n        [td]Pouca ação[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Físicas realistas[/td]\n        [td]Baixa duração[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Puzzles[/td]\n        [td]Enredo simples[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]Não é jogavel online, está em português de Portugal e possui sistema de conquistas.[/b]\n\n[u]4 coisas (comparado ao seu sucessor):[/u]\n\n[u]Coisa boa:[/u] Gráficos, câmaras de testes, uso de objetos e físicas super realistas.\n[u]Coisa ruim:[/u] Pouca ação, baixa duração e possui um enredo simples demais.\n[u]Coisa nova:[/u] Não há.\n[u]Coisa velha:[/u] História.\n\n[u]Metascore:[/u] 94/100\n[u]Minha nota:[/u] 90/100","timestamp_created":1428264836,"timestamp_updated":1428264908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.627612113952636719","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15223158","author":{"steamid":"76561198146515940","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":22405,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14471,"last_played":1659287655},"language":"english","review":"Very good game.
