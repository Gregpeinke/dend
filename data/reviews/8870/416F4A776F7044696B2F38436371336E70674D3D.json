Ohhh this game. I have almost nothing but good things to say about it, being one of the best games I've ever played. So I'll get the few negative things out of the way first.\n\nPersonally, my preferred kind of game is story focused to the extreme, sometimes even at the expense of the gameplay. As long as the story is great, it can offset almost any poor or simple gameplay for me. With that said, it's gameplay is definitely a step backwards from the previous entries, but it is still serviceable with enough fun elements that keep it mostly from feeling overly repetitive and boring. Also, while I adore the story, it can get a bit muddled around the middle, as it transitions from a more Columbia centric story to a character based story. That in itself isn't a bad thing, but the way it goes about it can be a bit messy. It also can have a tendency to bring up ideas it won't explore to their fullest. This game's strong suit, in my opinion, is not how it explores its ideas, but how it uses them in the service of the story. Which leads me to everything else I like: literally everything else!\n\nThe characters, the world, the visuals, the themes, and most importantly the story, are all top notch. Elizabeth is one of the best characters in gaming. Columbia is a vibrant and alive city with many layers. How it uses shot composition, lighting, and effects are all beautiful. The themes of American Exceptionalism, Imperialism, Racism, Classism, Religious Extremism, and the ideas of fate and choice are all interesting and tastefully placed and used. As for the story, I don't want to spoil anything, but it is well worth the price, on sale or otherwise. Please, if you can play this game without any fore-knowledge, do so without delay.\n\nP.S. If you can, please buy the DLC's, mainly just Burial at Sea Parts 1 & 2. They really tie the series up in a neat bow.\n\n9.5/10, Constants and Variables.

How is it? I shall begin with the positives of this game.\n\nThe world of Columbia is such a concept that flips the foundation of what the first 2 games offered, Instead of a dark and drab underwater city, it takes place in a more colour and awestruck flying city in the clouds. with the new graphics and colourful palette it is such a breath of fresh air from the underwater city we've already seen twice. This is a prequel to the 1st games and doesnt connect to them in any shape or form (until its DLC), therefore there can be things in it that can be excused. Shooting feels way more modern and upgraded compared to its predecessors as it should be but not better. The DLC was great and I'll talk about that later.\n\nWhat dont I like? the first obvious note when you get started the first 10 minutes into the game is that it feels more shooter based which is not a change I am fond of. I've known bioshock for being both a shooter and RPG, sure it focuses on being an FPS but with enhancements made with the RPG genre in mind. Making decisions, weapons choices, upgrades, tonics, etc. It's either non existent or very watered down. The gameplay feels more like a corridor shooter than a strategic shooter where you choose an ammo type or use the right weapon in your arsenal. \n\nThey changed from being able to carry every weapon in the game to a 2 weapon system, which I heavily dislike, it takes away from that strategy mindset and becomes watered down. Tonics have been replaced by \"Gear\" so instead of having up to 18 upgrades that you have to earn and progress to get, you only get to choose 4, one for each body part. In addition, they dont even tell you in game how to equip it, didnt see in the tutorial, didnt teach me so thats ashame, I preferred tonics over gear, I understand they cant do the same thing for lore purposes but make it something different. \n\nAmmo types are gone, while you can still upgrade your weapons, you will only end up upgraded 1 main weapon like a Huntsman carbine or Triple R machine gun and a powergun like the Branstormer RPG. There just feels like no point to experimenting or choosing another weapon as those guns are just better to use overall and because of the limited selection, it ruins the sandbox. Also I'll just say, the guns that you use feel very bland and generic, sure in the first 2 games, they all filled a similar role but here, its just bland, I feel this is due to having no ammo types at all along with the next issue, lack of interesting enemy types. \n\nWhat made the first 2 games good is it's variety in enemies, sure you had your basic melee and gun splicers, but then you had ones where they throw grenades, or big brutes as well as the teleporting houdinis who threw fireballs are you. In addition, the big daddies were not always the same, you had bouncers, Rumblers, rosies, alphas, big sisters and lancers. In infinite, you have generic foot soliders who would use the weapon sandbox and thats how you usually get the guns or ammo, only through that, no vendors to sell you the guns. some niche security like the Mosquito which was a balloon flying machine gun, the zepplin and Barrage Automaton which were one in a few. the harder enemies were at least a bit more interesting, Handyman are a poor version of the big daddies however. Fireman were armored fireball throwing guys, Zealot of the Lady were another version of the houdini splicer but with ravens, Motorized Patriot was ok but easy to exploit, beast was meh, siren was a decent challenge but just ok and finally the boy of silence is like a security camera but very late into the game. The levels in the game are all right however, I like the concept of the skyhook and being able to zip around certain set pieces, have elizabeth summon certain items or security to help you out.\n\nThe story is not half bad but not better, it has its share of twists and motives but near the end of the game, its gets quite confusing, while you are tracking down the big baddie of the game, you are then in leagues with the vox populi, which are a faction of lower class people who want to pull off a revolution through any means necessary and they become just another enemy to shoot at. Didn't like there motives as much, was barely interested in this portrayal of an uprising, felt tacked on. Elizabeth also has this power which allows her to make tears into whatever universe she wants to enter and it evolves overtime, while used as a game mechanic to make certain barricades, turrets, health or ammo stations, its apart of the story. the very end however is where things get very confusing, as there are around 1000 possibilities of how the game ends. You are simply told that, though I can't believe there are that many ways to end the game as choice had no impact on the story whatsoever so its just an exposition dump. Unlike the first 2 games, you only get 1 singular ending and thats it, the game is done and so is the series, despite being a prequel, its the weakest Bioshock game to date, stripping away at its rpg mechanics, no meaningful progression, lackluster enemies and ok story. \n\nDLC however is quite good, giving another universe and going back to rapture and that was fun, short but fun, using the old school weapons again, seeing splicers and getting another look at rapture before it all went to hell. Episode 1 was amazing and Episode 2 felt like a good sendoff to set up the story of the first game, as well as making it more sneak focused than heavy combat. \n\nBIoshock infinite main game is a 4/10 for me and the dlc is a 9/10. \n","timestamp_created":1645691127,"timestamp_updated":1645691127,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601821303367614746","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110871477","author":{"steamid":"76561199240753003","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":467,"last_played":1657104032},"language":"english","review":"watch the end with tears in my eyes.a really nice game.","timestamp_created":1645690587,"timestamp_updated":1645690587,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110871178","author":{"steamid":"76561199217988190","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1653096464},"language":"schinese","review":"中文怎么调啊 哥们","timestamp_created":1645690026,"timestamp_updated":1645690026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110865564","author":{"steamid":"76561198133740877","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":257,"last_played":1647404202},"language":"english","review":"first person shooter with bomb graphics\n\n","timestamp_created":1645678122,"timestamp_updated":1645678122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110863848","author":{"steamid":"76561198977348442","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":173,"last_played":1656492258},"language":"schinese","review":"盗版通关了两次，现在补票。\n伊丽莎白yyds","timestamp_created":1645674707,"timestamp_updated":1645674707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549530386924743652","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110861857","author":{"steamid":"76561198928555529","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1191,"last_played":1652404274},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情超神！！个人特别喜欢卢特斯双子的塑造，两个人每次出场好像在唱双簧一样，看似什么都没说、但实际上又有什么都说了，非常奇妙。不过无限的FOV做得比较窄，个人体感玩起来很容易头晕，如果是晕3d的朋友建议直接云剧情（？","timestamp_created":1645671010,"timestamp_updated":1645671010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110861740","author":{"steamid":"76561198306965757","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":98,"playtime_forever":371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":371,"last_played":1645341759},"language":"english","review":"Get it on sale or don't get it at all.\nIf you like mindless combat where you can do fun stuff with more emphasis on killing the bad guys than sneaking around. You'll probably like this. Very cheery environment for the most part with the high saturation and bright colors. But the story is just one of the most dogsh*t meandering nonsense I really could care less about. \nThe story doesn't drive the game at all in the slightest other than by giving you an objective. Sure you can \"ignore* people but not only does that not work most of the time but it's just better off if you do take the time to kill all of them because you can't progress in certain areas unless you do. \nI genuinely despise the cutscenes. Not because they're poorly animated. But because I don't believe anything is genuine. Maybe I needed to play the previous games, but put information and details as extra content FFS. Like overhearing a conversation or reading newspapers and books. The level design is incredibly linear despite multiple game mechanics to add the high and low ground. There isn't as much flexibility when it comes to storming a castle/fortress and overall combat. There is no difference between using bronco or electricity zapping people to stun them. They both stun. One keeps them still. The other sends them flying into the air making them harder to hit. It confuses me because in theory it's incredibly varied but in execution, I always favor one over the other. The game is incredibly repetitive. I don't find myself either getting pissed off or having fun.\nI am completely meandering. \nYou get so much almost instantly that it's kind of an overload of options when only a couple of those are practical.\n\nI like the art style. I like the resolution being small yet very detailed. I like the setting. I like the overall look of characters, props, environment, and weapons. But you have all that great-looking pazazz and then tie it all together with a flimsy and boring string and butcher paper. This isn't so much an open world as it is an arena for each section. This is an arena fighting game. Not some sort of sneaking and calculating like Dishonored. It's bright and cheery and also dull and weary like We Happy Few but isn't as open and quite restricting. \nI've seen gameplay and reviews of what made the first game good. I don't see that here. Sure you introduce the sniper rifle with enemies that spawn far away and shoot you from a distance. But those same enemies also charge at you so what's the point of the sniper rifle if they eventually come to get you? \nSure you introduce all these new powers and abilities but it isn't practical or worth it to possess a gun turret that dies to the surrounding enemies the moment it gets possessed. As much as I like the concept. I neither hated nor liked this game. If Steam ratings had more variety than \"yay\" and \"nay\" this would be around a 3/5. Middle of the bell curve. Neither good nor bad but has a lot to offer. It doesn't stand out but fills its niche role I suppose.\nWish there was a neutral rating because I genuinely can't recommend this game or turn people away from it.\nI played it. I liked most of it. What I didn't like was the center focal point of the game. Most people don't like that.","timestamp_created":1645670800,"timestamp_updated":1645670800,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110861097","author":{"steamid":"76561198810956866","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":448,"last_played":1550648700},"language":"schinese","review":"玩不出缺点的游戏  场景美 手感好 音乐美 剧情美 妥妥的艺术品 通关后还很留恋这个游戏 史低20多块钱你不买？你不买我特么给你买 伊丽莎白长的好看 会发钱 发子弹 发血瓶 敌人来了会自己躲 会开锁 会提醒东西捡 探图跑得比我还快 给我在前面带路  我真想把我的肋骨打断给她熬汤喝","timestamp_created":1645669648,"timestamp_updated":1645670150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110859075","author":{"steamid":"76561198375963446","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":658,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":658,"last_played":1645160576},"language":"english","review":"The themes tackled between the racism and vulture capitalism hit very close to home these days.

Alright, pack it up, we did it. Its the final entry of the Bioshock franchise, which i honestly think is one of the WAAY better immersive sims to come out back then. But uh.. you saw the thumb. This will be split into 5 sections instead of a really cluttered essay.\n\n\n1. THE GAMEPLAY\n\nThe gameplay is really bad. It also feels way more streamlined than bioshock. Many mechanics were added in with no rhyme or reason besides \"They were in the last two\", or \"They were in the popular games\" and if thats the choice they wanted, why change the gameplay so much? Lets address the call of duty sized elephant- There is a fucking sprint button. Now, do i think this is inherently a bad change? No, a sprint can still work. But do i think its a good change for the bioshock  franchise? No, because the last two bioshock games were designed to make you feel disempowered to some extent. You had to creep around, using your most disposable weapons no matter what so you didnt face an encounter with your worst gun. It makes the game less of a careful immersive simulator, and more like a \"get shot, shoot more back\" game. \n\n\n2. THE GAMEPLAY (PART 2)\n\nMy main problem with it is the lack of weapons. Since this released in the same year as COD: Ghosts, you have only two weapons on your person. Yet for some reason, they KEPT the upgrade system. That doesnt work since your wasting hard earned money (yes, no more adam and regular cash, you get your vigors, upgrades, everything with money.) on something that will be unuseable by the next level. This gets worse during the vox period where you get reskinned versions of the same weapons you upgraded, but they dont HAVE those upgrades. Why make a upgrade system if you arent gonna give it a weapon wheel of sorts where you hold all your weapons? In Bioshock, you  would upgrade your gear so you could use your best weapons when you needed them. You bought different types of ammo for your proximity mine launcher to take on a big daddy for adam easier. In Bioshock 2, you would upgrade your gear to become a weapon of mass destruction. In Bioshock Infinite, you would upgrade your gear just to be told off when you wanted to keep using the weapon you paid to be stronger.\n\n\n3. THE GAMEPLAY (PART 3)\n\nNow then, since this is a streamlined call of duty clone- i mean bioshock game, they had to make it so they wouldnt be sued for the game being so difficult a 7 year old would toss there xbox controller at the wall and it bounces back and breaks there skull. So, they introduced Elizabeth, a plot important character as she can open \"tears\" into different realities or points in time. But the intresting thing is that this is a game mechanic, and not JUST a plot point. Meaning that she can make tears for cover, ammo, weapons, health, freight hooks, turrets, even patriots! She can also \"scavenge\" (stand behind a piece of cover and do nothing)  for guns, weapons, and money, and even health if your low on it! She is quite litterally, just a glorified assist mode.\n\n\n4. THE STORY (light tread on it)\n\nThe story has two sides, one side of the coin is this timeline altering, marvel style quantum physics, and other random stuff. The other side is so miniscule and worthless that if you flip a coin and it lands on this, you transform into a white writer instantly. The side i wanna talk about is the racism side. It doesnt have anything deep about it because they do NOTHING WITH IT. Only thing they do with it is shove imagery down your throat and OH LOOK OH MY GOD ITS A BLACK GUY ON HIS KNEES SHINING SHOES OR CLEANING SOMETHING! WOOOOAH! Now, im not going to say that racism isnt something to cover in media, but its just distasteful to do THIS with it. Also, a large portion of the story can be described with the grandfather paradox. Basically, if you went into the past to kill your grandfather, you would be unable to exist since in the future, you killed your grandfather, but since you dont exist, how could  you kill your grandfather in the first place? Its very weird.\n\n\n5. CONCLUSION \n\nOverall, Bioshock infinite is a mediocre video game, and a terrible bioshock game. Everything about it feels copied from a different game  without any thought about what it would do to the other parts of the game. Its story is weak and forgettable (had to read the wiki to remember it), It has shallow undertones of racism, and its gameplay is thoughtless and feels less like a bioshock game, and feels like it'd fit better as a replacement to call of duty ghosts.","timestamp_created":1645653416,"timestamp_updated":1657590700,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110849116","author":{"steamid":"76561198272055111","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":470,"last_played":1645650670},"language":"english","review":"very
