The puzzles were so creatively designed! Everything was a total awesome trip! All the puzzles are solvable without a game-guide, which i love. The voice acting was incredible for this game. I loved the clever things GLADOS and the pre-recorded messages would say. Very immersive, and very fun.

It's a lie. /\n\nThis game definitely is a must-have. One of the best games I've played so far. I really enjoyed (and still enjoy) playing this. It's a game everyone could enjoy, in my opinion. \n\nThe storyline itself took me about 2 to 3 hours to complete. The additional challenges and advanced chambers are nice features, great for adding some game time and a challenge for those who like getting all achievements.\n\nThe chambers and puzzles get harder smoothly as you advance through the game.  However, it can get a tiny bit repetitive. The portal mechanism really makes this game unique. I really love the smooth physics. Good graphics. The music and sound are okay. The dialog is simply brilliant and hilarious. Through the game, there are several nice additions (random radios playing the catchy theme song, messages from other test subjects) which caused me to laugh from time to time.\n\nPortal 2, the sequel, is in my opinion even better, but you just have to play Portal before you start on the sequel. Together, they're a masterpiece.\n\nI highly recommend buying this game. It's definitely worth the money.
