Einfache Antwort: Ja. Ganz klar. Auch nur um einfach mal spielerisch zu f√ºhlen, wie sehr sich die Gamingindustrie inzwischen grundlegend ver√§ndert hat.\nIch wusste vor dem Kauf nur, dass es ein altes Spiel ist (Gott, das Spiel ist sogar √§lter als ich) und unter Gamern als Klassiker gilt. Und tats√§chlich muss man Half-Life selbst gespielt haben, um √ºberhaupt zu merken, wie wahr diese Worte wirklich sind. Half-Life ist damals wirklich ein Meilenstein gewesen!\nIch war immer wieder verbl√ºfft, zu welchen technischen Meisterleistungen das Spiel damals in der Lage war. Kakerlaken k√∂nnen zu Matsche zertreten werden, zerst√∂rbare Objekte, Eastereggs und vieles mehr!\nIch habe ja schon so einige Spiele aus dieser √Ñra gespielt. Thief, Systemshock 2, oder Deus Ex w√§ren da mal ein paar Beispiele. Und, zugegeben, fand ich Thief (vor allem den zweiten Teil) gelungener als Half-Life. Liegt aber eher daran, weil ich Stealthspiele liebe. Doch warum fand ich einige der oben aufgelisteten Titel deutlich besser?\nSie sind besser gealtert. Keine Sorge. Half-Life ist gut spielbar, aber dennoch merkt man dem Spiel sein Alter deutlich an. (auch den anderen Titeln, aber Half-Life hat mehr kleinere M√§tzchen, als beispielsweise Thief)\nIch habe Half-Life auf [i]Vanilla[/i] gespielt und im Gro√üen und Ganzen kaum technische Probleme mit dem Spiel gehabt. Keine Abst√ºrze, keine Framedrops. Dennoch hatte ich einen √§u√üerst nervigen Bug, den ich noch n√§her beschreiben m√∂chte. Ich habe einen Aufzug betreten und bin immer wieder beim Hochfahren gestorben. Pl√∂tzlich, ohne Vorwarnung. Immer, und immer wieder. Hat wirklich sehr gest√∂rt. Gott sei Dank konnte ich von dem Ding rechtzeitig rausspringen und mittels gut platzierter Speicherpunkte dieses √§rgerliche Hindernis irgendwie √ºberwinden. Ansonsten h√§tte ich es vielleicht gar nicht mehr geschafft das Spiel durchzuspielen. Ob dieser Bug Gang und G√§be ist, w√ºrde ich ganz klar verneinen. Ich habe mir diverse Walkthroughs dazu angesehen und niemand sonst hatte dieses penetrante Problem. Da habe ich wohl mal wieder Pech gehabt.\nWie gesagt. Half-Life hat so einige st√∂rende Eigenheiten, die ich nun nachfolgend auflisten werde. Nat√ºrlich werde ich auch dessen St√§rken nicht au√üer Acht lassen.\n\nKommen wir f√ºr die Schnellen unter uns einfach mal zur Pro-Contra-Liste:\n\n[u][b]Pro:[/b][/u]\n\n+ Ich war wirklich positiv √ºberrascht, als ich merkte, dass das Spiel auf Deutsch vertont ist\n+ Viele nette Details, wie zu zertretene Kakerlaken, ein explodierendes Mikrowellengericht, zerst√∂rbare Getr√§nke- und Snackautomaten, ja, sogar Charaktermodelle haben eine Animation w√§hrend sie Atmen. Auch dieses kleine Detail hat mich, aufgrund des Alters des Spiels wirklich verbl√ºfft!\n+ Man kann mit √ºberraschend vielen Dingen interagieren (auch wenn ich es stellenweise schwierig fand, zu erkennen mit was √ºberhaupt)\n+ Zerst√∂rbare Objekte\n+ Die Gegner-KI ist √ºberraschend gut. Gegner werfen clever mit Granaten, verstecken sich, wenn sie angeschossen werden, r√ºcken zusammen vor etc. Wirklich erstaunlich, wenn man das Alter des Spiels bedenkt\n+ Eine recht interessante und fesselnde Geschichte!\n+ Abwechslungsreiche Orte, die immer wieder etwas anderes verlangen k√∂nnen\n+ Man erh√§lt im Verlauf des Spiels enorm viele Waffen, die sich auch grundlegend unterscheiden. Man hat da so seinen Standardkram und auch ausgefalleneres Zeug\n+ Einige Gegner waren recht interessant. Vor allem herauszufinden welche Waffen bei welchem Gegner am effektivsten ist\n+ Die meisten NPCs k√∂nnen ohne Einschr√§nkung get√∂tet werden und deren Munition geklaut werden. Eine Freiheit der ich mir mit Freuden bedient habe!\n\n[u][b]Contra:[/b][/u]\n\n- Das Hauptmen√º ist ziemlich langweilig, liegt auch an der nicht vorhandenen Musik\n- Auch wenn das Spiel auf Deutsch vertont ist, so sind einige Synchronsprecher wirklich schlecht. Vor allem die der Wissenschaftler und des Sicherheitspersonals\n- Das Spiel hat keine einheitliche Soundpalette. Ger√§usche der Lebens- und Schildstationen sind ohrenbet√§ubend laut, Musik ist viel zu leise und Schussger√§usche wieder zu laut. Auch die Optionen sind nicht umfangreich genug dieses Problem konsequent zu l√∂sen\n- Einige Sounds hallen zudem. Das ist wirklich sehr unangenehm, vor allem mit Kopfh√∂rern...\n- Es gibt keine offiziellen FOV-Einstellungen. Zwar habe ich mich irgendwann an die Standard-FOV gew√∂hnt, aber bis es so weit war, war eine gro√üe Umstellung meiner Person n√∂tig, um das zu aktzeptieren\n- Kurze, unterbrechende Ladesequenzen, die ohne jegliche Vorwarnung auftauchen und so den Spielfluss dezent st√∂ren\n- Zwei nervige Bugs. Einmal der Aufzugbug (siehe oben) und ein immer wieder auftretender Bug, dass das Spiel denkt, dass ich, nach einer Ladesequenz immer nach links gehe. Dieses Problem trat regelm√§√üig auf! Zwar nicht bei jeder Ladesequenz, aber h√§ufig genug, dass es wirklich sehr, sehr gest√∂rt hat. Gl√ºcklicherweise lie√ü sich das Problem kurz und einfach l√∂sen, indem ich alle Tasten WASD kurz angetippt hatte (quasi im Kreis gelaufen bin) dann hat sich das Spiel gl√ºcklicherweise wieder gefangen\n- Gordon geht immer so, als w√ºrde er auf Eis laufen. Liegt wohl daran, weil Half-Life eine Quakemod ist und dennoch: Dieses ST√ÑNDIGE Gerutsche UND Jump & Run Passagen haben wirklich genervt. Im Ernst. Ich wei√ü nicht, was sich die Entwickler dabei gedacht haben.\n\n[u][b]Prontra:[/b][/u]\n\n+- Einige √úbersetzungsfehler waren bemerkbar\n+- Das Spiel sieht nicht mehr wirklich gut aus. Texturen sind recht matschig. Und dennoch mir hat diese [i]√Ñsthetik[/i] irgendwie gefallen. Schwer zu erkl√§ren. Man gew√∂hnt sich an den Look recht schnell und hat nicht immer vor Augen, wie viel schlechter es im Vergleich zu heutigen Titeln aussieht\n+- Charaktermodelle werden immer wieder verwendet\n+- Das Wechseln der Waffen mittels Mausrad muss per Linksklick best√§tigt werden, weshalb ich auch gezwungenerma√üen zu den Nummerntasten gewechselt habe, weil in einer brenzligen Kampfsituation das Wechseln der Waffen mittels Mausrad wirklich zu lange dauerte\n+- Das Aufladen von Leben und Schild an den Stationen dauert recht lange, auch das Aufladen von Leben in Regenerierungsstationen in Xen dauert zu lange. Ich vermute, dass man vermeiden wollte, dass man die Gegner dorthin lockt und sie von dort aus bek√§mpfen kann und sich w√§hrenddessen immer wieder Leben zieht, aber dergleichen habe ich nie ausgenutzt, weshalb ein Aufenthalt dort immer recht lange gedauert hatte\n+- Ein paar flackernde Texturen waren bemerkbar\n\nHalf-Life ist, obwohl recht viele Contra- und Prontrapunkte in meiner Review aufgetaucht sind, kein schlechtes Spiel. Es ist nur alt. Und deshalb bin ich vor allem gespannt auf das inoffizielle Half-Life Remake genannt [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/]Black Mesa[/url]. Hoffentlich wird dieses Spiel deutlich weniger technische Probleme, aufgrund von Alterserscheinungen haben.\nHalf-Life ist wirklich gut und hat mir, trotz der Probleme, Spa√ü gemacht. Eindeutige Kaufempfehlung, selbst zum Vollpreis!\n\nIch danke f√ºrs Lesen und w√ºnsche sehr viel Spa√ü beim Spielen! ;-)\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/","timestamp_created":1573732900,"timestamp_updated":1574684054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570366978645324707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57134129","author":{"steamid":"76561198385195543","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":82290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":60065,"last_played":1659563329},"language":"spanish","review":"compra no seas pobre","timestamp_created":1573688048,"timestamp_updated":1573688048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57133757","author":{"steamid":"76561198152374042","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":749,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":732,"last_played":1584202659},"language":"turkish","review":"ESKƒ∞ ANILARR","timestamp_created":1573687367,"timestamp_updated":1573687367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57122783","author":{"steamid":"76561198299430083","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":135,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1660497392},"language":"brazilian","review":"Sem d√∫vidas O JOGO (voc√™ perdeu) que REVOLUCIONOU os jogos fps como conhecemos hoje em dia.

Despite this, it has taken me until just recently to actually play through the game. The graphics are a little dated, due to it being a 20 year old game, but it handles just fine. For a game of this time period, it has many things that I would consider staples of modern game design, such as a variety of enemies, different game environments, and an amazing story to back it up. The main complaint that I have with it is that it feels like the game drags on for too long, ending up around 10 hours while it feels like it could have ended 3 hours before. Besides that, the final boss is an amazingly fun and climactic battle that reinforces the difficulty of the rest of the game and makes the whole journey seem worth it.\nOverall, I'd absolutely recommend this title to anyone who is a fan of the FPS genre, as well as people who are a sucker for a good story-driven game.

Because of nostalgia I must say its all good. \nSounds are amazing. Aliens all have their sounds and you can recognize them. You can head marines talking together on the radio. Sounds immerse yourself in the game and its insanely good. The sound when you hit something with the crowbar... priceless.\nThe story is insanely good and the mystery behind it is great. \nThe gameplay is awesome and has aged pretty well. Fast paced but not too much. Very nervous in gunfight. \n\nI beat this game probably 10 times when I was a kid. Beat 5 times when I was a teen and at the time I write this review, Nihilanth is no more one more time.\n\nThis game shows us what Valve was back then.

In my opinion, the two main reasons for me to always come back an play this game again is it's gameplay and story.\nThe gameplay is very solid, One of the best I've played so far. Most weapons are very fun to use, and there won't be any weapons you won't use, as each weapon focuses on precise roles, most of the time. There are some flaws, though, as the rifle is completely underwhelmed by either the pistol or the shotgun, and the late game weapons have such precious ammo that I usually end up not using them for their rarity. But that might just be myself being too much careful with ammo management.\nMovement is fast, any enemy can pack a punch if you're not careful enough and you and your enemies are usualy very mobile. Compared to Half-Life 2, Half-Life's gameplay is more flashy, more quick corner picks and you usually decide your movements faster.\nThe enemies are fair. they vary from melee, hit-scan and projectile from area to area, wich keeps you on your toes on wich tactics you should use.\nThe chapters from this game are very unique, and each feel like a refreshment from the last. The maps vary on form a lot, so it never feels stagnating fighting the same enemies, and when it starts getting repetitive, another element is added to change things. \nThat's something I praise about Half-Life. there aren't many types of enemies, but when and how you confront them is what gives the thrill of the game.\n\nNow, the story is not presented easily. There aren't any characters through the game. They are given names, but no one you care about and gets developed through the game. Given so, the story is presented to the player through dialogues from NPCs scattered on the maps and campaigns: You reach a checkpont with someone with something to say, updating you with what's happening around you.\nThe lore Half-Life and it's bonus contents (Blue Shift; Opposing Force) presents is amazing. It's a \"very near reality\" sci-fi with dark themes and scenarios and a good focus on anomalous influences on the world. Oh, and, aliens invade the planet. \nCome to think of it, at first glance, Half-Life sounds a lot like an american hollywood Alien invasion movie, given the similarities.\nI don't realise it that much, but Half-Life is pretty gory, actually. This gets percieved better with Crowbar Collective's remake of the game Black Mesa. I would not recommend only playing the ladder just because of the prettier graphics, since the gameplay of both games are very different. Play both if you can. but if you were to choose only one, play Half-Life first.\nHalf-Life is very challenging, and way harder than most recent games, but it stands it's ground as a good game even after many years because of it's solid trial, error repetition and success gameplay. Compared to other games of it's generation, Half-Life doesn't have the clunky feels old games usually have. Once you get over them, the graphics and missing asthetic features don't impact anything. Half-Life is quite the masterpiece for you to play.","timestamp_created":1573585509,"timestamp_updated":1573585509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528985500335693359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57060416","author":{"steamid":"76561198842632626","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":2198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":88,"last_played":1641372979},"language":"russian","review":"–≠—Ç–æ
