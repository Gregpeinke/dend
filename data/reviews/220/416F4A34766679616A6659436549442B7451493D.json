preface this I was not a huge fan of the original Half Life. I found a significant amount of the level design needlessly confusing. The story felt like little more than a lackluster backdrop for game play. To me Half Life has aged poorly and I would be hesitant to recommend it to someone unless they really wanted to play it before Half Life 2 (possibly to get a better understanding of the story so far). There really is a lot of embellishment and romanticised nostalgia in the hype and recommendations. It may be best for those interested in starting the Half Life series to just read a synopsis or a play-through. \n\n---\n\nHalf Life 2 fixed a lot of these issues. The levels are easier to follow and more enjoyable with a fair amount of variety between them. The story is significantly more present. \n\nThe game play is quite a lot of fun being both fluid and fast paced. The quick transitions between levels and limited amount of cutscenes make this a video game equivalent of a page-turner. \n\nIt has relatively low system requirements, runs great on Linux with Proton, and took me about 9 hours to beat (you could likely double this by chasing achievements).","timestamp_created":1606784348,"timestamp_updated":1606784348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81303702","author":{"steamid":"76561198034410496","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":554,"last_played":1606781310},"language":"english","review":"Put this as a maybe for me.  It's a good FPS, probably amazing back when it first came out.  But I'm just not enjoying it as much as HL1.  I'm not motivated to finish it.  HL1 had a certain sense and atmosphere that really pulled you in, it felt like a real alien attack, I was like \"I get it, I get why this is a classic.\"  Even playing it 20 years later.   But with HL2, it feels like the shell of HL1 with a tacked on hollywood script and scripted \"too-choreographed\" set pieces that break the immersion.  It doesn't feel cohesive and natural to me.  The driving parts aren't that fun honeslty, the driving is clunky.  I will say, there is still that cool exploration feeling, I do like that.  The gunplay is good, although the AI feels a bit easy.  But the story is too meh and predicatable, it feels like every Hollywood script ever.

2 is a near perfect sequel. It takes almost everything that worked from Half-Life and either improves on it, or keeps it much the same. But that simple summation undersells how the Valve team have approached this task. Half-Life 2 is a linear shooter with most of the refinements one would expect from years of work, but it is also a game of a higher order of magnitude than any of the previous pretenders to the throne. The polish and the stratospheric height of the production values mean that Half-Life 2 is a magnificent, dramatic experience that has few peers.It would be madness for me to spoil this game by talking about the specific turn of events, so spoilers are going to be kept to a minimum. We're going to talk about general processes and the elements of style and design that make Half-Life 2 such an energising experience. Key to this is the way in which Gordon's tale is told. Once again we never leave his perspective. There are no cutscenes, no moment in which you are anything but utterly embedded in Gordon's view of the world. Everything is told through his eyes. And what a story it is. Gordon arrives at the central station at City 17—a disruptive and chilling dystopia. And from there? Well, that would be telling. This is not the contemporary America that Gordon seemed to be living in during the original Half-Life. The events of Black Mesa have affected the whole world. The crossover with Xen has meant that things have altered radically, with hyper-technology existing alongside eastern bloc dereliction.The world is infested with head-crab zombies and the aliens that were once your enemies now co‑exist amongst the oppressed masses. This very European city is populated by frightened and desperate American immigrants, and sits under the shadow of a vast, brutalist skyscraper that is consuming the urban sprawl with crawling walls of blue steel. It's a powerful fiction. City 17 is one of the most inventive and evocative game worlds we've ever seen. The autocratic and vicious behaviour of the masked Overwatch soldiers immediately places you in a high-pressure environment. People look at you with desperate eyes, just waiting for the end to their pain, an end to the power of the mysterious Combine. Who are they? Why are you here? Who are the masterminds behind this tyranny? The questions pile up alongside the bodies.\nI could talk about how those battles with the striders almost made me cry, or about the events that Alyx guides you through so cleverly, so elegantly. I could talk about the twitchy fear instilled by your journey through an abandoned town, or the way that the skirmishes with Overwatch soldiers echoes the battles against the marines in the original Half-Life. I want to rant and exult over this and that detail or event, this reference or that joke. I want to bemoan the fact that it had to end at all (no matter the excellence of that ending). And I'm distraught that we'll have to wait so long for an expansion pack or sequel. I even had this whole paragraph about how CS Source will be joined by an army of user-fashioned mods as the multiplayer offering for this definitively singleplayer game. But we're running out of space, out of time. There's so much here to talk about, but in truth I don't want to talk, I just want to get back to it: more, more, more... You have to experience it for yourself. This is the one unmissable game. It's time to get that cutting-edge PC system. Sell your grandmother, remortgage the cat, do whatever you have to do. Just don't miss out.","timestamp_created":1606761873,"timestamp_updated":1606761873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81260715","author":{"steamid":"76561198194105126","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65,"last_played":1656791983},"language":"russian","review":"Решил я значит пройти наконец легендарный Халф Лайф, в детстве не было то ли возможности, то ли я о ней вообще не слышал, вообщем так я в нее и не поиграл.
