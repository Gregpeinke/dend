You fire it up and log onto Steam for the first time and you are greeted with thousands of choices. You ask yourself \"Where the heck should I start?\" I believe for those who are just getting into PC gaming, Portal is the perfect place to start. One, it's inexpensive. Two, and most importantly, it embodies perfectly what PC gaming is all about, an experience that is unique. Three, it's short, so you get a taste of PC gaming without sinking thousands hours of your life. But onto the traditional review:\nVisuals and Sound: Graphically, it has aged, It indeed looks like a game that came from 2007. But, Portal has a distinct style that is so aestiheticly  pleasing that I would by no means call it ugly. The sound is mostly subtle. However, the ones that are there are top-notch. The portal gun sounds satisfying and the voice acting is incredible. The music is not that noticeable, but the soundtrack does set the tone nicely,\nGameplay: Just perfect. Unique, memorable, and most importantly FUN. \nPerformance: Solid, but not perfect. Throughout my playthrough, I did experience a few frame rate drops, but nothing major to detract from the overall experience. \nOverall, Portal is fantastic. Well worth the price of admission.
