Con una subida de dificultad acorde para todo el mundo, quizá para alguien acostumbrado a este tipo de juegos sea un paseo por el jardin de su casa a las 6 de la tarde.

Cargando... Cargando. La de veces que me ha salido eso, vale que el juego es antiguo, pero no sabían poner animaciones de transición? Además que más de una vez se me quedaba pillado durante varios segundos... Y este juego debería funcionar a la perfección en cualquier ordenador actual.\n[*]En algunos puntos es poco intuitivo sobre como seguir. Yo creo que he perdido más tiempo buscando como avanzar o por donde salir, que completando los puzles. Tiene muy poca guia, y puede frustrar demasiado.\n[/list] \n\n[h1] Analisis:\t[/h1]\nMe ha gustado mucho pese a ser tan corto, y siendo sincero he sonreído cuando veía los créditos, creo que es la primera vez que un juego consigue eso.

Trzeba niestety wziac pod uwage, ze ma juz swoje lata próbując w nią grać teraz, jednak pod względem graficznym nie jest wcale tak źle, bardziej jest to kwestia archaicznych rozwiązań w menu typu zapis i wczytywanie gry. Bawiłem się przednio przez 10 godzin praktycznie. Wszystkie osiągnięcia udało się odblokować już za drugim podejściem do gry. Niestety - wyzwania trochę zepsuły frajdę, gdyż chciałem najpierw wykonać je a dopiero potem osiagnięcie z transmisją, przez co przechodząc 20-30 razy te same mapy trochę mnie odrzucało od przechodzenia jeszcze raz kampanii. Grę można przejść spokojnie w dłuższy wieczór, 6 godzin nie powinno stanowić problemu za pierwszym podejściem (takie właśnie było moje - w 2020 roku). Drugie podejście to już kwestia godziny maksymalnie. Na duży plus sposób, w jaki przedstawiona jest gra. Bardzo podoba mi się to, że jest to gra logiczna, która ma swoje tło fabularne i opowiada dosc banalną, ale wciągającą historię.

First time players are gonna average out to maybe 5 hours of gameplay until you reach the end, and old time players will average out to 2 hours till they get to the end. That is why my playtime is only 4 hours; I played it twice on this account and each playthrough lasted ~2 hours for me. In reality, I put around 12 hours into this game. The story is good for what it is, but it's main focus is the puzzles, so if you're a big puzzle fan who has little to no interest in story, this is for you! I still struggle at the final level no matter how many times I play this game though. LOL. I suck at the final level.\n\nSo get ready to think like portals and get angry about how to solve puzzles that are easy as hell!\n\n[b][u] Music: [/u][/b] 8/10\n[b][u] Storyline: [/u][/b] 7.5/10\n[b[[u] Gameplay:[/u][/b] 10/10\n[b][u] How is the Price??
