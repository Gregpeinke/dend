Как же был атмосферен мир игры. Город Троя... Наполненный этим ароматом отходов пчелиного воска. Город, в котором целые сутки совсем темно, и лишь свет фонарных столбов освещает его. Город, в котором высокий уровень преступности и отделы полиции Трои пытаются это предотвратить. За полицейского нам-то как раз и предстоит поиграть. Её зовут... Крис Лист. Девушка, пришедшая в отдел убийств по одной причине. Дело в том, что она всегда спала, открыв один глаз, потому-что в её снах было кое-что пострашнее уголовников на улицах Трои. В отделе она познакомилась с её напарником Таракушей Круттерсом. Думаю, что по его имени - понятно, что он таракан. И вот случается день, когда приходит зацепка... Внезапно какой-то газобомбист появился в Трое. Юная Крис даже не подозревает, что вышла на след её снов. Но почему её сны так беспокоят? Они начали появляться, когда пропал её отец. Он оставил лишь фотографию, на которой были изображены он... и символ. Символ как, на схеме взрывного устроиства газобомбиста. А позже следуют следующие дела, которые проясняют историю...\n\nИтак, перед вами одна из лучших детстких игр на данный момент. Разработчики превзошли сами себя. Ведь сюжет, графика, атмосфера, геймплей, музыка прекрасны. Многие меня спросят: \"А почему детская-то? Там-же убийства, преступность и т. д. и т. п.!\". Хех. Дело в том, что это все там есть, но сделано это \"по-детски\". И даже на атмосферу детям будет до лампочки. Всё это пререкрывают жучки-паучки))). Они такие прикольные и разнообразные. Даже роботы и машины сделаны \"по-жучьи\". Ну что-ж поделать. Такое у них представление о мире). Довольно спецефичное, хочу сказать.\n\nИтак, геймплей представляющий собой два режима. Экшен-режим и режим детектива. Экшен-режим - это что-то типа аркады. Бегаем, стреляем, еще раз стреляем, преодолеваем препятствия, собираем бонусы и опять стреляем. Да, стрельбы тут много. И оружия, кстати, тоже. Каждое из них мы будем находить по ходу прохождения. Востанавливать ХП нам будут банки \"Нектаролы\". Это своеобразный газированный напиток в Трое. Крис не любит нектаролу, но ей приходится её пить. А вот Таракуша... Выпивает ДЕСЯТЬ банок в день... Неудивительно, что он такой толстый. Даже сама Крис говорит: \"Мдааа, попа у него большая... Почти такая-же большая, как его сердце...\". Ну, я думаю я все рассказал о экшен-режиме. Режим детектива представляет собой квест, в котором мы ищем, разгадываем, общаемся, ищем, думаем. И думаю, что на этом моё обьяснение этого режима закончится.\n\nГрафика пытается выесть нам мозг в детско-анимационном стиле. Всё смотрится прекрасно. Сюжет будет интерестен абсолютно каждому игроку, будь это даже бабушка. Про атмосферу я уже описывал выше, а вот о музыке я еще ничего не сказал. Музыка - это как-бы опора для атмосфера. Она поддерживает её. Но у игры есть два минуса. Один - серьёзный. Другой - не особо. Начну со второго - игра коротка. В ней всего 8 миссий. И, ладно, они были бы длинными, но они короткие. А второй, то, что у игры нет обещанного продолжения. В конце игры нам обещали продолжение, которое должно было выйти еще в 2006-ом. Но оно не вышло... И это очень плохо. Ведь так от концовки мне ничего не стало понятно. Короче, продолжения у игры не будет. Но эти минусы не столь существенны и их перекрывают плюсы. Поэтому оценка следующая:\n\nПлюсы: Отличная графика, хороший сюжет, разнообразный геймплей, темная атмосфера в стиле нуар, музыка.\n\nМинусы: игра коротка, игра не имеет обещанного продолжения.","timestamp_created":1402590553,"timestamp_updated":1402590553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10438914","author":{"steamid":"76561198046351075","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":576,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":576,"last_played":1391929129},"language":"russian","review":"Игра радует не только гемплеем,но и комьюните так как это очень важно !!","timestamp_created":1402582593,"timestamp_updated":1402582593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10438353","author":{"steamid":"76561198044121357","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1433320835},"language":"english","review":"this game is mental, too mental infact","timestamp_created":1402578236,"timestamp_updated":1402578236,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458544105291366577","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10436869","author":{"steamid":"76561198047176963","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1706,"last_played":1482654974},"language":"english","review":"Money Money Money.Its raining Money.\n\n11/10","timestamp_created":1402566110,"timestamp_updated":1402566110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10436101","author":{"steamid":"76561198071673783","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1484,"last_played":1438544044},"language":"russian","review":"Мясо, всем советую)","timestamp_created":1402558596,"timestamp_updated":1402558596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10435129","author":{"steamid":"76561198110684763","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":64,"last_played":1463969477},"language":"english","review":"Great game for stress and slaughter, Love playing this game while listening to some death metal, too many great feels for this game.","timestamp_created":1402547890,"timestamp_updated":1402547890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10434835","author":{"steamid":"76561198069374985","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":1720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1098,"last_played":1464596529},"language":"english","review":"Great Game","timestamp_created":1402544416,"timestamp_updated":1402544416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10434712","author":{"steamid":"76561197989996098","num_games_owned":539,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19,"last_played":1526434522},"language":"english","review":"I got this game in a daily deal at 80% discount.

(I'll leave it to you to decide if that's a bad thing or not)\n\nSo, the zeds are scary and strong, perks are useful, but what about the guns?\nTripwire is known for realistic and great sounding and animated guns, so each shotgun feels powerful as you blast something to bits, each rifle has a high-recoil but also a high potentional damage output, but since this is a game with zombies, we have some some fictional guns as well, such as a fireball-cannon, a laser which can also slow down zeds, SMGs that can also shoot medic-darts at allies and much more. (There are 3 dlc weapon packs which unlock 4 weapons each, it's not pay-to-win DLC as the weapons are side-grades, not upgrades.)\n\nOh! almost forgot to mention that there are a lot of melee-weapons too!\n\nThe game was released in 2009, but Tripwire is still supporting it with seasonal events (Summer, Halloween and Xmas) which give the zeds themed-reskins, new maps (or Objective mode missions), new achievements and sometimes new weapons, most of it for free, but with Killing Floor 2 on it's way, I cannot guarantee that this will happen again in the coming years.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a fun and challenging survival-horror co-op game that offers you plenty of content and hours of fun, look no further, there is a wave of mutants waiting to be eradicted.. or eradicate you.","timestamp_created":1402504377,"timestamp_updated":1402504377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.669181704521179199","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10428989","author":{"steamid":"76561198099052238","num_games_owned":476,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1400380080},"language":"german","review":"Sehr Geil wenn man mal nix zu tun hat und ein paar zombies klatschen will aber sonst würd ich es mir nicht holen!","timestamp_created":1402503273,"timestamp_updated":1402503273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10427139","author":{"steamid":"76561198083164048","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1427019114},"language":"german","review":"Echt geil\n","timestamp_created":1402490632,"timestamp_updated":1402490632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10426242","author":{"steamid":"76561198035273672","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1386517897},"language":"russian","review":"Не в моем духе.

Instead the game focuses more on classes and finding a tactical location to hole up in for the duration of the round. The classes feel nice and varied and the only way you'll get anywhere is by having at least one of your friends dedicated to the medic position, and sticking together with at least one other person as you traverse the multitude of fun and dark horror levels.  There are generally ten waves of increasingly difficult enemy types to fight through. before facing off against the ultimate zombie badass, the Patriarch. Overall, an awesome game to spend a few hours on with your buds.","timestamp_created":1402372418,"timestamp_updated":1402372418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10412811","author":{"steamid":"76561198024726468","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":262,"last_played":1451807537},"language":"spanish","review":"Un gran Survival Horror, con diversos enemigos y bosses los cuales son muy entretenidos de matar y además los mapas tienen una gran temática de terror :D","timestamp_created":1402365581,"timestamp_updated":1402365581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10412761","author":{"steamid":"76561198085814410","num_games_owned":427,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3783,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2164,"last_played":1594680271},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito Bom, varias Packs, varios mapas,  einda melhor co-op.","timestamp_created":1402365119,"timestamp_updated":1402365119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10412433","author":{"steamid":"76561198042217343","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":901,"last_played":1380472195},"language":"english","review":"Very generic Zombie-Killing-Arena type game.
