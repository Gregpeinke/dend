Absolutely amazing!\n\nStoryline:\nIn the single player it's amazing. It catches your attention, twists your expectations, and resolves beautifully. The multiplayer one is sadly quite the opposite, I'm still not sure what happened.\n\nPrice:\nThe price is absolutely perfect.\n\nDifficulty:\nAs long as you have plenty of time to solve puzzles you'll be perfectly fine.\n\nAI:\nBasic, just aims at you.\n\nCutscenes:\nValve uses non-intrusive cutscenes where you can still move around while things happen - and I love it. It's both immersion and story building.\n\nFun:\nI can't really say much other than it's really fun. You will get stumped at times but you will 100% enjoy the experience.\n\nSounds/Music:\nThe music in this game is phenomenal and I'm hoping it's on Spotify.\n\nReplayability:\nI could definitely see both the singleplayer and multiplayer being replayed. It's a god tier game.\n\nControls:\nThey're perfect. Valve took complex ideas and simplified it into an understandable system that in total uses around 8 buttons.\n\nPerformance:\nIt will run perfectly on any hardware.\n\nModding:\nDue to it being a Valve game you will find mods for absolutely anything. I'm serious, search for it, you'll find it.\n\nSelling Out:\nThe only thing Valve tries to sell to you along with the game is a digital book which gives you insight on the development of the game. It's a great addition tbh.\n\nSimilar Games:\nThe best that comes to mind is Q.U.B.E. 2 (great game!)\n\nBugs:\nI experienced none","timestamp_created":1611008553,"timestamp_updated":1642314506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84934109","author":{"steamid":"76561198799537612","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":1056,"last_played":1659466107},"language":"english","review":"first player is good two player awesome as well","timestamp_created":1611008015,"timestamp_updated":1611008015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84933425","author":{"steamid":"76561198890158354","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":594,"last_played":1657349353},"language":"english","review":"Best purchase ever\n","timestamp_created":1611006974,"timestamp_updated":1611006974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84933287","author":{"steamid":"76561198368773146","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":640,"last_played":1611006713},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo é bem otimizado, boa historia, boa mecânica, bons desafios simplesmente perfeito\n","timestamp_created":1611006734,"timestamp_updated":1611006734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84933148","author":{"steamid":"76561199053834235","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":936,"last_played":1656602060},"language":"english","review":"one of the best games up there with half life 2","timestamp_created":1611006542,"timestamp_updated":1611006542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84933040","author":{"steamid":"76561198168417778","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2605,"last_played":1579321982},"language":"english","review":"This game is great.

Now there's even more interesting and creative content with four portals that you can enjoy with a friend. All of this only costing $10, its worth six times that amount. Everything here is quotable, the characters are hilarious and interesting, as is the lore you can piece together through Easter eggs and listening to the characters. If you are considering to buy this game I would wholeheartedly recommend it. Pick up Portal while your at it, also a fantastic game.","timestamp_created":1610994490,"timestamp_updated":1610994490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84923930","author":{"steamid":"76561199123053893","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":125,"last_played":1632756740},"language":"russian","review":"Игра топ нужно думать..","timestamp_created":1610994030,"timestamp_updated":1610994030,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84923780","author":{"steamid":"76561199076092041","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1635,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1486,"last_played":1635648304},"language":"english","review":"It's just so dang fun to play all day long","timestamp_created":1610993852,"timestamp_updated":1610993852,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84923136","author":{"steamid":"76561198329458174","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1250,"last_played":1611496471},"language":"polish","review":"CHUJOWfA SEXXfXX RUCHfANIE","timestamp_created":1610992983,"timestamp_updated":1610992983,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84922939","author":{"steamid":"76561199124754822","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":18,"playtime_at_review":358,"last_played":1659718523},"language":"english","review":"epic gameing","timestamp_created":1610992732,"timestamp_updated":1610992732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84922440","author":{"steamid":"76561198851188338","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":820,"last_played":1648170964},"language":"english","review":"This game is probably the best game I have ever played in my life so far.

These extra additions make the game seem like a new game but still a Portal game","timestamp_created":1610960778,"timestamp_updated":1610960778,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84899600","author":{"steamid":"76561198130062936","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":674,"last_played":1610994341},"language":"english","review":"POTATO","timestamp_created":1610960399,"timestamp_updated":1610960399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84899425","author":{"steamid":"76561198825876815","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":1573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":865,"last_played":1640944404},"language":"koreana","review":"1에 비해 2도 지지 않으삼!!\n우선 전작의 별거 없는 스토리를 강화시켰고 그외 협동 플레이(즉 코옵) 추가와 (대신 같이 하는 사람이 빡대가리라면 협동플레이는 거의 못하게 될거임) 새로운 플레이 방식 추가(전작에선 무작정 포탈건만 이용해 스테이지를 깼다하면 여기선 젤, 유도 터널, 공중 신뢰 플레이트 등으로 더 많은 추가 요소들이 생겨 이것들로 스테이지를 클리어 할 수 있음) 와 3이 나오지 않아도 되는 완벽한 엔딩(3의 저주) 글고 여전히 OST는 좋더라..","timestamp_created":1610960095,"timestamp_updated":1610960095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84899393","author":{"steamid":"76561198981514941","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":986,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":935,"last_played":1639815659},"language":"schinese","review":"好！我不是傻逼！\n\n但我朋友是","timestamp_created":1610960035,"timestamp_updated":1610960035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84898651","author":{"steamid":"76561198271161870","num_games_owned":312,"num_reviews":74,"playtime_forever":1237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1215,"last_played":1614137706},"language":"english","review":"the perfect sequel","timestamp_created":1610958753,"timestamp_updated":1610958753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84898364","author":{"steamid":"76561198403906374","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1023,"last_played":1599470299},"language":"english","review":"full of charm and wit. the puzzles will break your mind at times. the story is deep and complex and for a source game it doesn't look bad even today.","timestamp_created":1610958311,"timestamp_updated":1610958311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84898165","author":{"steamid":"76561198837890258","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":584,"last_played":1640198318},"language":"polish","review":"generalnie to baardzo dobra gierka ale czasami jestem debilem i niewiedziałem co zrobić przez 20min xDD","timestamp_created":1610957987,"timestamp_updated":1610957987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84897601","author":{"steamid":"76561199073117546","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":379,"last_played":1611061153},"language":"russian","review":"хорошая)\n","timestamp_created":1610957061,"timestamp_updated":1610957061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uL+hivcCcfTtwwI="}
