The atmosphere is pretty good, though slightly lacking in environmental sounds, especially in Xen (an alien world you visit, which often lacks sound.) Most sounds come from nearby enemies, and those are great. They provide a feeling of tension, as you are frequentl in very tightareas and don't know where an alien (or more) is hiding. There's quite a variety of alien enemies, much more than HL2's 3 types of zombies: In total, 11 very different types of aliens, 2 bosses and 3 human enemies, all very different.\n\nThe gunplay is pretty satisfying, and there is quite a lot of variety: from standard weapons like pistol, revolver, shotgun and assault rifle wih a mini-grenade launcher, to crossbows, experimental cannons, alien hornet guns and living creatures that, when set loose, may attack you instead of your enemies! The AI also seems a lot smarter than most FPS, just due to the fact that it actually knows how to fall back when wounded to call more enemies.\n\nThe story is pretty basic (at the time it was fairly complex for an FPS, not so much today), and the ending is quite strange, but the locations you explore are fantastic, from laboratories to reactor cores to canyons to Xen, an alien world. The most irritating part of Half-Life has to be certain sections which have platforming. Platforming with the Quake Engine's momentum-heavy movement? Yeah, no.\n\nIt's still a great game, and well worth the purchase.","timestamp_created":1453467227,"timestamp_updated":1453467227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20671711","author":{"steamid":"76561198013403966","num_games_owned":298,"num_reviews":180,"playtime_forever":238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":224,"last_played":1535632387},"language":"koreana","review":"구토유발겜","timestamp_created":1453430818,"timestamp_updated":1453430818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20669822","author":{"steamid":"76561198180900077","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1572,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":941,"last_played":1567475676},"language":"english","review":"just a really good classic!!! the graphics havent aged very well but the gameplay is pretty decent even by today! just...watch out for marines...","timestamp_created":1453420959,"timestamp_updated":1453420959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20667434","author":{"steamid":"76561197994196135","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":789,"last_played":1453523753},"language":"english","review":"A great game for nestalgia.

Having played the \"Portal\" games, it gave me a sense of what Valve Corp. does with it's games. But now I've played the game that started it all for Valve. It's over twenty years late for me, but does it still work to this day? Yes it does. It's an incredibly challenging experience that was way ahead of it's time. And it's still a fun game for me, even after I endured a first playthrough.\n\nThe game was very ahead of it's time in some context, and it was trying all sorts of things games of the 1990s weren't. For one, it balances what most FPSs had, action and puzzle solving. But at the same time, it was trying to avoid the gameplay mechanics that most games used heavily. Most games at the time used cutscenes and focused more on the action than it did on the experience, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but \"Half-Life\" took a chance and it paid off. \n\nIn this game, you play Gordon Freeman, a Theoretical Physicist at the Black Mesa Compound. This game made him a silent protagonist, which is a good way to get the player immersed in the role (even if you know nothing about Freeman's field.) But this game also makes sure you never once leave Gordon's point of view, even during the in-game sequences. This makes the story unfold before you, not watching what's going on in the background, so you literally have to draw your own conclusions based on what you see and hear. That makes the game very immersive and it still works in this modern age. \n\nAlso, rather than have levels, the game has chapters, and the areas of the game are interconnected, reducing the amount of loading screens and makes it feel more realistic. I like how they keep every game area connected to one another, making it feel like you're exploring this top-secret facility without letting the game show it for you, you're learning for yourself. \n\nThe gameplay is what you'd expect from an FPS, though it maintains an old-school feel, even as FPSs were beginning to aim for more realism. The weapons have a nice variety, my favorite is the Tau Cannon, cause it's the closest thing to a laser gun that you have. But of course, being an FPS of the 1990s, this game uses lots of platforming and puzzle solving, requiring you to spend a lot of time saving this game. \n\nThe enemy variety is okay, but at times, I felt that some enemies were unnecessarily tough, including the Marines. I found myself not liking to use the Assault Rifle that much, as it felt like I wasn't hitting the enemies hard enough. Also, some of the enemies were way too accurate, and their damage dealt to you was out of proportion to the amount you did (stupid Vortigaunts.) \n\nThis brings me to the complaints I have. There is an abundance of platforming in this game, and the controls are very stiff at times, you have little control when you're in freefall, and often, the drops are too high that you take damage regardless. Also, the game has a few poor level designs. Such as when you have to turn on a fan, you have to move fast or the fan will chop you up, and you can get stuck under it. Also, there's an area that's mined, and the lasers are so finely positioned that you have no room to mess up when you try to squeeze past them. It was hard to enjoy the game at times with this problem. But that's not all. It was hard to maintain power for the HEV Suit at times (given the abundance of enemies, it was lucky you even maintained it for long periods.) Also, ammo at times felt scarce. \n\nBut despite how much I despised certain points in the game, that just made me keep coming back and keep going. I still wanted to finish it. I was too immersed in the story. I wanted to see where I'd end up. And this game really was enjoyable, in the long run, it's another game I can come back to. \n\nI can see why \"Half-Life\" has (and rightfully earned) become one of the best games ever made. It was a game that took a lot of chance for a first-time effort by a new game company, and it was a gamble that paid off. The story and it's immersiveness are what kept me involved, even if the game wasn't totally perfect. It's the kind of FPS I know and love, and it's one I'm willing to play through again.","timestamp_created":1453120733,"timestamp_updated":1453120733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20602278","author":{"steamid":"76561198089421952","num_games_owned":969,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":1214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1077,"last_played":1580866526},"language":"english","review":"One of the best FPS games I have EVER played!!!\n\nAnd I've played a shit load of FPS games.","timestamp_created":1453111559,"timestamp_updated":1453111559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20601872","author":{"steamid":"76561198060151399","num_games_owned":321,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":719,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":384,"last_played":1532361722},"language":"english","review":"[i] Half-Life 1...\n\nMy favorite classic game that was released on steam in Nov 8, 1998.\n\nThe Half Life series was a great series with a very intresting setting with a amazing background and story.\nIt never gets old at all, I'm hoping more Half-Life games will be made in the future sence mods are being released on steam for Half-Life 2 I have a sence that something big may come up soon.\n\nWhat I actually loved mostly about this game was the weapons.

Junto a Doom, son los FPS que dominaron y siguen dominando este mundo de los videojuegos\nSOBRE LA JUGABILIDAD\nCiertamente, es un juego que resulta cómodo  e intuitivo de jugar. Su acción que hace que el juego no resulte repetitivo o fastidioso: cada enemigo, situación y lugar hacen un modo de juego divertido y dinámico. Las armas que empiezan por ser básicas: pistola y escopeta, a pasar a armas grandes y poderosas- que me parecen de inspiración de Doom-, sin olvidar la poderosa palanca. Si te gustan los FPS llenos de acción, te lo recomiendo profundamente\nSOBRE LA HISTORIA\nSu historia me parece excelente y su narración igual: Me encanta como empieza de una situación \"tranquila\", que se ve desde el principio que algo no esta bien, a pasar a una situación llena de problemas. La narración te lo cuentan de manera que no resulte tedioso y aburrido: mientras juegas la historia se desarrolla por sí misma, te das cuenta de lo que esta pasando en cada situación y diálogo, aunque a veces resulta misterioso. Su historia y narración son bellas y si te gusta la ciencia ficción ve a comprarlo sin dudar\nSOBRE SU SOUNDTRACK\nNo me parece que hubiera en demasía, algo que faltaba en algunos lugares, en mi opinión. Pero en los momentos en que sí, me parecieron adecuados y excelentes: sí que eran en relación a la situación \nSOBRE SU VISIBILIDAD\nRealmente bello: su arquitectura de lugares, sus paisajes y tanto personajes amigos o enemigos. Me gusta ese escenario científico lleno de tecnología, lugares secretos llenos de... (bueno, juégalo), ese escenario final, enemigos que logran dar cierto \"miedo\" por así decirlo y soldados y \"espías\" que resultan correctos en las situaciones que se les pone, aunque en un punto parecen repetitivos los modelos soldados y los espías, así como los científicos- pero es claro por su época. Te va a agradar tu vista\nSOBRE SU MULTIJUGADOR\nFue hace mucho que lo jugué y me divertí mucho, muy dinámico todo y entretenido para pasar un tiempo bueno. No estoy muy seguro como esta ahora: solo jugué unas cuantas partidas que me resultaron divertidas. Supongo que con amigos se disfrutara más, como cualquier juego por el mismo estilo. Para resumir: es divertido para pasar el rato\nSOBRE LO MALO\nRealmente, viendo otras reseñas y desde mi perspectiva, un problema, el más principal, son las pantallas de carga, pues arruinan la experiencia. Ciertamente esa razón es molesta, pero me parece que es justificado por su época; aunque me resulto molesto algo: cuando estaba saltando y llegaba a esas pantallas, me quedaba atorado, y tenía que cargar una partida que quedaba muy atrás de donde estaba o usar el noclip que es mejor que repetir todo un largo camino.\n Hay un gran spolier adelante, si ya lo has jugado o si no te importa adelante, bajo tu riesgo, pero si es el caso contrario salta a la conclusión\nEl único problema sería las pantallas de carga, por lo menos para mi, pero hay algo más: lo malo fue el enemigo final: el juego fue dinámico a lo largo de la historia, pero llegar a Nihilanth fue como solo dispararle, pasar por portales, disparar a gemas y, al final, otra vez a disparar a Nihilanth, el juego comparado con esa parte final parece que lo hicieron de manera rápida y sin pensarlo bien. Pero como me dijo un amigo Desarrollador: \"Es muy difícil seguir el ritmo en un videojuego\", pero supongo que comete el cometido de seguir con la historia. \nPara mi es el único fallo del videojuego a parte de las pantallas de carga\nCONCLUSIÓN\n¿Recomiendo el juego? Por supuesto que sí. Para mi es uno de los mejores juegos que hay. No importa cuantas veces lo juegues siempre parecerá fresco. Espero que mi reseña te haya servido para decidir si comprar o no el juego :), no te arrepentirás de comprarlo. Su calificación, de parte mía, es 9.9/10, sería 10 si no fuera por esos dos problemas...","timestamp_created":1453078680,"timestamp_updated":1657425325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20594975","author":{"steamid":"76561198125049644","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":801,"last_played":1588250233},"language":"english","review":"An excellent gem that opened a new era for FPS games.
