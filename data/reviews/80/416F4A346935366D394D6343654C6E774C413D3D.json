A very solid mod. Offers great missions, voices and sounds are great. Mission crossover with normal CS maps. Realistic accuracy and gun control, not the reatrded shit show from normal CS where it feelsl like everyone is shooting drunk. Challenging gameplay with good mechanics and a few new things added. Highly recomend to any halflife player, aspecially to CS players to get the feel how CS really should have been.\n\nFinally after the beating the stock campaign matches on all difficulties and having played some online, the game is fairly simple and similar to original CS, just more polished. Good game overall, but not for my taste. Luck in this game has a bigger role than skill, and a game mechanic like that is unappealing to selfaware FPS gamer. I can beat UT2004 on Godlike, yet this is almost impossible for me.

Condition Zero is a mainly singleplayer focused Counter Strike title oddly enough. Which its the very old unreal style campaign, not the story driven one we now see in a regualr shooter. So; is it as fun as newer Counter Strike titles? Yes, maybe even a bit more. Has it aged well? No. It a very love hate relationship between me and the campaign style here. I like the ai team mate selection gimmick, allowing you to choose better, people to be with assuming you have the right points to buy them before the match begins. The stat's on them which are skill, co-op, and bravery actually matter and can have very noticable effects on how they move around the map. Me, I personally think Travis, the riot shield weilding badass of 300 confirmed kills is someone that is a required team mate. Where as one may go with Pete someone who as balanced stats across the board, but only has a smg. There is actually a pretty good amount of tactical feel to this, as many times I was stuck on a level I could switch out team mates and DESTROY. BUt this campaign style is a little.......... frustrating? In each match there are a certain preset requirements for you to complete. These are the BAIN OF COUNTER STRIKE, as some on the expert difficulty are masochistically made. Kill and enemy with a knife and survive the round? Fuck no. Besides that, I recommend this game. Also shotguns are much better in source.","timestamp_created":1410672670,"timestamp_updated":1410672670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12092009","author":{"steamid":"76561197991503304","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":1106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1106,"last_played":1451468601},"language":"english","review":"Nice.","timestamp_created":1410659986,"timestamp_updated":1604090788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12086344","author":{"steamid":"76561198132765635","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":60,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40,"last_played":1435343886},"language":"romanian","review":"super","timestamp_created":1410625815,"timestamp_updated":1410625815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12079969","author":{"steamid":"76561198126458549","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":892,"last_played":1450369531},"language":"finnish","review":"mahtava","timestamp_created":1410586039,"timestamp_updated":1410586039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12079215","author":{"steamid":"76561198086210497","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":211,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":211,"last_played":1407556609},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego, entretiene sus misiones c:","timestamp_created":1410579140,"timestamp_updated":1410579140,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12074267","author":{"steamid":"76561197994481338","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":23,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1425343467},"language":"english","review":"80% Recommended","timestamp_created":1410544051,"timestamp_updated":1482267610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12068831","author":{"steamid":"76561198059581705","num_games_owned":451,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1524467959},"language":"english","review":"Great mode for shaping up your skills","timestamp_created":1410498931,"timestamp_updated":1410498931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12067830","author":{"steamid":"76561198019645217","num_games_owned":1130,"num_reviews":115,"playtime_forever":71622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":360,"last_played":1658402987},"language":"english","review":"Great Campaign and Great Puzzling.

Both CS 1.6 and CS:CZ are great games regardless...\n\nIf you check the Wikipedia and Wikia articles of CS:CZ, you will find out loong story of the development of the game; it was a disaster... Valve ordered the game to Rogue Entertainment in 2000, however the departure of the producer of the studio to Sony led the company defunct. After that failed startup, Valve gave the project to Gearbox Software which made a remarkable progress however failed to meet the deadline. Therefore, pissed Valve took the project from them and gave it to Ritual Entertainment. The \"clever\" people in Ritual decided to remake the game instead of developing well designed job of Gearbox. Then, ta taaaa; the gold version the game was boring, dull, unpolished and even clunky. The critiques were so bad that Valve decided to pull the game back and ask Turtle Rock Studios to complete the job. Turtle Rock restarted the work of Gearbox and completed the game that we have now as CS:CZ which is quite nice. But how about \"Deleted Scenes\"? Well, that single player game was released as a free addon to actual CS:CZ with the name of Deleted Scenes.\n\nYeah, that was the story of the development. But, is it worth to play Deleted Scenes? Not at all!\n\nAll 19 missions are totally uninspired and dull. The game shamelessly respawns enemies to the locations that you have already cleared. Worst, you killed a guy in the corner, you want to take that corner as a cover, right? Na na na na naaa; a new enemy is likely to be respawned right back of you. The developers did not even bother to respawn those enemies to a fairly distant location. If you are annoyed with the instant back spawning of Arch-Vile in Doom 3, you will be pissed in this game which is not even a fantastic horror FPS...\n\nDeleted Scenes has one of the most linear level progress ever; it can even compete nowaday's modern shooters such as COD in the case of linear level progress... I can understand the need for linearity in order to have scripted events which are pretty much the curse of nowadays' shooters. However, the game does not let you backtrack most of the times. It is not like \"hey, you fell down from that roof which is not reachable right now\" scenario; you pass a door and after a short loading, that door is now cannot be openned in the very same level! You are simply caged between the loading points. I do not play nowadays' noob shooters, thus I have few information about their level progress but that does sound even foolish for those games. Gold key seeking in the mazes of Doom 1 is way more innovative even for \"today\"...\n\nConclusion;\n\nI cannot say \"do not buy\" Deleted Scenes; it is bundles with Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. But I can easily say that do not bother to play that game. If you are too bored and looking for something to kill you time, grab one of the F2P games... The only reason that I played and even finished all the levels of this game is my current computer is so crappy that it can handle very few games; that is one of them. That is it...\n\nPeace...","timestamp_created":1409226374,"timestamp_updated":1409226374,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11888176","author":{"steamid":"76561198140933493","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":988,"last_played":1426005236},"language":"english","review":"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a first-person shooter game from Valve.

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is basically a slightly improved version of the original Counter-Strike, but with many addition to the game, it can also be considered as standalone expansion pack.\n\nCounter-Strike: Condition Zero gameplay is 100% the same with original Counter-Strike. But Counter-Strike: Condition Zero has new Tour of Duty mode, more maps and the new singleplayer campaign named Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Tour of Duty is a singleplayer mode game that is basically has the same game mode, but has some challenges objective that needs to be completed to win the map. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero also introduce offline multiplayer bots, where you can play against AI controlled player in offline game.\n\nCounter-Strike: Condition Zero graphics is also basically the same as Counter-Strike, only has some improved models, textures and maps, but older maps are still included in the game.\n\nCounter-Strike: Condition Zero is a good improvements to Counter-Strike.

So much in fact, a small studio completed it.\n\nA quick reminder, this game was designed around Half Life. Linear gameplay in a compact space should be expected. This doesn't mean its bad - plenty of single player games are linear - it just takes time to understand if you haven't played Half Life. Level layouts and item interaction are not going to be what you are used to. Is the game perfect? No, and no game is. Due to the for mentioned old game design theories, certain pathways and mechanics will seem odd. Getting players to do a 180, and come back the way they came can be confusing.\n\nI've always been a Counter-Strike fan. There's no denying that. If you are well, you will have a blast with this title (and the Deleted Scenes). This title brings you back to the roots of CS, which allows for a neat experience. Would you play it again and again because of that? Probably not, because I completed the game in 4 hours and that felt like it was enough. I can only really see someone playing this if they are using an old machine with poor internet connection.\n\nBeing an old engine, AI isn't very good either. The way around that is to place environmental hazards everywhere such as trip mines. Because of this, it feels more like Half Life then Counter-Strike.\n\nTo wrap this up, if you are a CS player, you are missing something by not playing this. If you aren't, go on in life, there's nothing demanding here for you to play.","timestamp_created":1408437988,"timestamp_updated":1408438117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11777032","author":{"steamid":"76561198019260046","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":541,"last_played":1357891200},"language":"english","review":"hostage","timestamp_created":1408436659,"timestamp_updated":1408436659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11774559","author":{"steamid":"76561198100348560","num_games_owned":272,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1411782280},"language":"spanish","review":"es la zorra!! es como half-life pero con trama de counter strike :3","timestamp_created":1408415112,"timestamp_updated":1408415112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473509907722473145","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11764632","author":{"steamid":"76561198147578437","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113,"last_played":1415180676},"language":"russian","review":"игра супер бомба","timestamp_created":1408356643,"timestamp_updated":1408356643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i56m9McCeLnwLA=="}
