По моему мнению - одна из самых лучших игр, которые когда-либо были созданы VALVe, так как невооружённым взглядом видно: ребята постарались на славу и, к счастью, своим сиквелом не загубили серию игр. Взять хотя бы тот же BIoShock, вторая часть которого была хуже первой. Ладно-ладно, я отвлёкся. Итак, что же нас ждёт в Portal 2? Начнём с сюжета.\n+ 1. Сюжет получился действительно неплохим, хоть и основной его костяк виден нам как на ладони, а именно: [spoiler]проснулась Челл => встретила Уитли => разбудили GLaDOS => Уитли позволил Челл сбежать, и так далее...[/spoiler] Хотя, возможно, я придираюсь. Забыл упомянуть, что некоторые сюжетные \"завитки\" добываются в большинстве своём из пасхалок и прочих секретов, и поэтому искать довольно интересно. Взять хотя бы картину, на которой изображены Кейв Джонсон и Кэролайн.\n+2. Много нововведений. Нет, там очень много нововведений, если сравнивать с первым Portal, разумеется. Здесь Вам и экскурсионная воронка, и воздушная панель веры, и 4 вида гелей, и множество прочего. И да, они тоже могут использоваться вместе с порталами. А что было в Portal? Два вида кубов, кнопки, энергетические шары и прочие игровые элементы.\n+3. Puzzle Creator. Теперь, даже не владея VALVe Hammer Editor'ом, можно за час-другой сделать неплохой тест и выложить его на всеобщее обозрение в Steam Workshop. Также можно создать дать тест для иультиплеера, о котором я написал ниже. Однако Puzzle Creator тоже не идеален, и поэтому мы можем использовать лишь стандартное лабораторное окружение, без создания различных скриптов, диалогов и прочих плюшек. VALVe Hammer Editor этим не страдает.\n+4. Мультиплеер. Наконец-то появилось возможность пройти головоломки со своим другом, положившись на его механическое плечо. А ещё у мультиплеера есть своя сюжетная линия, которая заключается в том, что: ГЛаДОС готовит роботов Атласа и Пи-боди (за которых мы играем) для какой-то суперважной миссии. Тренировка роботов заключается в прохождении испытаний.\n+5. Графика. Без сопливых знаю, что Portal 2 работает на десятилетнем Source Engine, но на моём далеко не самом мощном компьютере, игра идёт на максимальных параметрах и без тормозов, да и картинка радует глаз. Замечательно!\n+6. Главная героиня по имени Челл. В Portal она ходила в оранжевом костюме, в Portal 2 она сняла верхнюю часть комбинезона и завязала его вокруг талии. Жду Portal 3! \nНо, как известно, в бочке мёда есть ложка дёгтя, и...  Я эту ложку не нашёл.\n\nВердикт: КО-О-ОСМО-О-С!\nОценка: 9,7 из 10","timestamp_created":1404906537,"timestamp_updated":1405235104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589815139770507813","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11148506","author":{"steamid":"76561198056037394","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1010,"last_played":1404306934},"language":"french","review":"Très bon moment de fun , le jeu en vaux la pene.\nJe vous le recommande :p","timestamp_created":1404902459,"timestamp_updated":1404902459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11148350","author":{"steamid":"76561198056142373","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":356,"last_played":1404901481},"language":"english","review":"i cried at the end of portal 1 and i cried at the end of portal 2 \n\nthis game makes me emotional\n\n11/10","timestamp_created":1404901552,"timestamp_updated":1404901552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526678144931793213","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11148288","author":{"steamid":"76561198078835046","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":707,"last_played":1621183747},"language":"spanish","review":"el mejor juego que he jugado en mucho tiempo","timestamp_created":1404901132,"timestamp_updated":1404901132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11148205","author":{"steamid":"76561198129233876","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1076,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":728,"last_played":1527089676},"language":"german","review":"Echt geiles Spiel und mega lustig :D\nAm meisten Spaß macht es mit nem Freund im Coop ;)","timestamp_created":1404900596,"timestamp_updated":1404900596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11148037","author":{"steamid":"76561198107165666","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1718,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":837,"last_played":1453736369},"language":"finnish","review":"this game is so awesome. i finished this game today and the last cutscene were really dramatic (my mind)\n","timestamp_created":1404899639,"timestamp_updated":1404899639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11146692","author":{"steamid":"76561198074489942","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":5482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2715,"last_played":1593822020},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2","timestamp_created":1404890269,"timestamp_updated":1404890269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50267791748046875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11146003","author":{"steamid":"76561197967013175","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":389,"last_played":1594675098},"language":"english","review":"Having a ton of fun!

Shut up and give them your money!","timestamp_created":1404795504,"timestamp_updated":1404795504,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11129062","author":{"steamid":"76561198098533139","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":8664,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7423,"last_played":1527624949},"language":"english","review":"The question asked for this review was \"Do you recommend this game?\"  Can you guess the answer after reading?\n\nLet's start with the singleplayer mode.\nRemembering the first Portal, it is nearly impossible to think of this as a sequel.  It is something... greater.\nThe story starts 30 days after the events of the Portal ARG (because of the deleted scene from the console that ties it together).\nYou awaken in what looks to be a crappy motel room, with the announcer basically giving you a tutorial on how to move.  After completing the \"gymnastic portion of the exercise\", you listen to some classical music and fall back asleep.\nYou then awaken \"9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9..9...\" days later (according to the announcer) with a knocking at your door.  The one knocking is Wheatley, a personality core who ends up guiding you through the first half of the game as you try to escape the post-apocalyptic Aperture. (This is WAAAAAY after the events of Half-Life 2.)\nYou navigate through the test chambers from Portal, while immediately noticing the design and graphics quality shift from the previous game.  You discover new mechanics, such as the Thermal Discouragement Beam (laser), the Aerial Faith Plate (trampoline), and the Hard Light Bridge (explains itself).\nYou reunite with GLaDOS, who sends you off on a new series of tests with the aforementioned mechanics.\nAfter completing your tests, a new enemy emerges, and you now have to venture through a Portal unlike any before. (I mean there was only one before but still.)\nEventually, through a series of plot twists, you finally do escape, but not without a little \"history lesson\" first. ;)\nSaid \"history lesson\" is you going [spoiler]back in time[/spoiler] [spoiler](ok not back in time just down a very very long hole)[/spoiler] to the 1960s-era Aperture Science, where you are guided by the mysterious Cave Johnson (founder and CEO of Aperture) through a series of test chambers featuring 3 gels: the Repulsion Gel (bouncy gel), the Propulsion Gel (speed gel), and the Conversion Gel (makes everything \"portal-able\").\nYou go back forward in time to stop the once-deuteragonist with GLaDOS by your side, and eventually escape.\n\n[h1]Singleplayer:[/h1]\nGraphics- 10 Stars\nMechanics- 10 Stars\nGameplay- 10 Stars\nStoryline- 10 Stars\n\nIn my opinion, it has very high replayability.  That may just be because I've left about 6 months between each play-through and I'm very forgetful, but that's besides the point.\n\nNow for the Co-op mode.  Yes, I said Co-op.\nThis new idea for Portal starts out with you and a friend as the robots Atlas and P-Body, each with their own specially-colored Portal Guns.\nThe storyline continues soon after the events of the singleplayer, with you solving tests at the behest of GLaDOS and learning how to use the new cooperative mechanics as a team.\nThe co-op mode is challenging to say the least, but provides a new understanding and a new meaning to \"Thinking with Portals\".\n\n[h1]Co-op:[/h1]\nGraphics: 10 Stars\nMechanics: 9 Stars\nGameplay: 10 Stars\nStoryline: 7 Stars (It's a very linear and simple storyline, but they throw in a lot of indication of goings-on behind the scenes.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game?\nWhat do you think? :)","timestamp_created":1404794907,"timestamp_updated":1495669889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11128897","author":{"steamid":"76561198038131334","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1134,"last_played":1428782293},"language":"english","review":"I can't remember the last time I've felt so satisfied playing a game. Portal 2's writing is immaculate and hilarious, and it is a joy to solve the game's varied puzzles while listening to three of gaming's best-written characters speak. The puzzles themselves are not impossible by any means, but hard enough to make you think for a good deal.

Wheatley is hilarious, and GLADoS as well as Cave Johnson provide a few laughs.\nThe game's strongest point, though, lies in it's secondary (yet ultimately more fulfilling) devices: Co-op play (I reccommend a friend with a mic) and the level editor (exclusive to steam) which give you a TON of options for all your portaling needs. Laughing at my friend before getting my head taken away has never been so fun. The puzzles required you to work together, so pick a good reliable friend  (unless of course you want to goof around, and Valve provided plenty of that; I would often change my friend's portals to mine own just to see him fall to his doom while laughing gleefully.) Only issue with the game is that it drags during Cave Johnson's tests in the middle-end of the game. Still, I would definitely reccommend Portal 2 for 5-10 bucks. 9/10","timestamp_created":1404790160,"timestamp_updated":1404790160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11128157","author":{"steamid":"76561197967244939","num_games_owned":329,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":966,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":517,"last_played":1436493796},"language":"english","review":"Friking brilliant.
