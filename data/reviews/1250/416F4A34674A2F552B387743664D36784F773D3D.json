When I played it for the first time, it totally got me by surprise and reached beyond my expectations. The graphics are actually not that bad. The variety of weapons, enemies and characters are amazing. The gameplay is really intense and addicting. Its just satisfying to deliver a clean headshot with a shotgun. What also makes this game worth buying is the Bot Mutator Mod that gives you the online feel if you dont have any friends to play with. The only con I noticed would be the Runtime error after the game crashes and its no longer playable unless you spam click the game app on your desktop (Five clicks), then it will launch normally which doesnt make any sense.

Это сугубо моё личное мнение, я постараюсь перечислить плюсы и минусы данной игры.\n\n[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]\n\n1) [U]Действительно крутой кооператив[/U]. От каждого игрока в прямом смысле зависит судьба всей команды. \n2) [U]Эмоции[/U]. Одновременно ты можешь чувствовать радость и страх, когда за тобой гонится огромная куча зомби, пауков и сирен, а патроны как на зло, остались только в пистолете и оборачиваться назад слишком страшно :)\n3) [U]Оригинальность[/U]. Есть много игр где ты в шкуре жертвы, но потом это жертва становится слишком крутой и неуязвимой, что без особых усилий валит всех. В Killing Floor же, всё наобор, ты всегда жертва и крутым ты не станешь и именно в этом весь кайф; \n4) [U]Смешно до слёз[/U] (да я знаю что этот пункт относиться ко второму, но это настолько ржачно, что заслуживает отдельный пункт). Когда твои друзья заваривают двери перед твоей рожей, а ты уже слышишь сзади звуки бензопилы и рёв отбивальщика и где то вдали вопит несколько сирен, тебе остается лишь орать как с*ка и покрывать матом своих товарищей (это лишь одна из ситуаций и таких на самом деле много) :)\n\n[h1]Минусы:[/h1]\n\n1) [U]Рукож*пы в команде[/U]. Например: самый рукож*пый и не очень умный в команде взял снайпера, потом он убежал от команды х*й пойми куда и понятное дело его сожрали, в итоге всех убил отбивальшик (огромный заср*нец с дрелями вместо рук, когда злиться может чпокнуть всю команду), ибо снайпер это тот класс, который может завалить за считанные секунды крупных тварей;\n2) [U]Неадекватные люди[/U]. Поясняю: на многих серверах не включена такая функция как  [b]Friendly Fire[/b]. Бывает такое, что когда вы играете на паблике а не в собственной комнате, заходят люди которые намеренно сливают игру, сначала они убивают вас, потом умирают сами (не понятно зачем);\n\n[h1]Вывод:[/h1]\nИгра весёлая, страшная и требует наличие прямых рук, как и в большинствах играх похожих на Killing Floor, присутсвие неадеквата неизбежно, но колличество плюсов перекрывает данный факт.\n[b]От меня 8/10.[/b]","timestamp_created":1430659366,"timestamp_updated":1492899223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15669165","author":{"steamid":"76561198053530943","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":10097,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9502,"last_played":1426738366},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏时间最长的游戏","timestamp_created":1430658040,"timestamp_updated":1430658040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15667148","author":{"steamid":"76561198163132060","num_games_owned":441,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":718,"last_played":1485086682},"language":"english","review":"pretty sure getting vomited on by a morbidly obese man isnt good for your health 8/10 (stains are hard to get out)","timestamp_created":1430647538,"timestamp_updated":1430647538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15665995","author":{"steamid":"76561198178368711","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":4175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":680,"last_played":1657726204},"language":"thai","review":"veRY GOOD","timestamp_created":1430640984,"timestamp_updated":1430640984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15664567","author":{"steamid":"76561197970553586","num_games_owned":256,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":6619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6358,"last_played":1441071221},"language":"english","review":"want some dosh m8? ha ha ha, cheeky monkey i need to buy a better OP as hell shotgun cuz my one hitting a fleshpound isnt enough (patriarch skips through the sunset)","timestamp_created":1430631090,"timestamp_updated":1430631090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15662643","author":{"steamid":"76561198013060720","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5691,"last_played":1487133753},"language":"english","review":"Fun shooter overall.

i were to recommend a game that's wave-based, shoot-em-up with twenty-five or more guns that you use efficently against armies of failed experiments that give you bounty cash when you kill them, so you can kill that in horrifically more brutal ways with better guns, as they slowly upgrade their army with bigger baddies until you fight an all-mighty boss that could rekt you without blinking, i'd recommend Killing Floor. Seriously, this game is my TOP FAVORITE, just because of how enjoyable it is. Yes, it may be old, and yes, it's not graphically impressive, but it's a damn good game. It has me STILL playing, even after hitting rank six with every class and gaining every annoying-ass achievement. Why do i keep playing? Because it's fun, and because my friends have it. Playing by yourself on Hell on Earth, doesn't compare to the simple mayhem of playing with 6, or 64 other players (depending on what player-based mods are installed.) And, if you don't like the original ZEDS, you can re-mold them with extremely well-done mods like the Killing Floor: Dead Space mod, or the Aliens mod, to fight more horrific creatures. Hell, they even have mods to make the game ALMOST likle DOOM. Theres weapon mods, character re-skins, maps, VEHICLES, and so many other amazing things. This game gets a 10/10, no matter how people string the BS. It's a great game, and has some amazing re-play value when you're trying new things out. Multiplayer is fun, single player is fun, and PLEASE don't say that popping a ZED's head of with a M99 ISN'T satisfying. Because if you did, i'd call you a goddamn liar. \n\nRoses are Red,\nViolets are Blue,\nI got the game.\nYou should too.\n\nEnjoy!","timestamp_created":1430275403,"timestamp_updated":1430275403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15604534","author":{"steamid":"76561198066242597","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":4704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4276,"last_played":1613181566},"language":"english","review":"This game is awesome tons of gameplay options tons of hours to play coop is unbeatable great game cant wait for kf 2","timestamp_created":1430269854,"timestamp_updated":1430269854,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15604099","author":{"steamid":"76561198118488924","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":18708,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6233,"last_played":1640511869},"language":"brazilian","review":"um game muito bom para se jogar com os amigos","timestamp_created":1430267078,"timestamp_updated":1430267078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15603656","author":{"steamid":"76561198023681883","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":6476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6476,"last_played":1428688985},"language":"english","review":"Wait, I hadn't reccomended this game?\n\nOops.
