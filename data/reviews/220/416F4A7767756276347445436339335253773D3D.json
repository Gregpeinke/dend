Set in the dystopian 'City 17,' physicist gone action hero: Gordon Freeman is tasked with stopping human ambassador Dr. Wallace Breen from doing something evil probably. Who can honestly say in today's economy?\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a game that I would only really call good enough. It's clear that the form of story-telling and gameplay the game uses was pretty out of the norm at the time of it's release, but when it's played in retrospect it can feel a little cluttered and unproffesional at times.\n\nI'll be fair to Half-Life, it's not IT'S fault that it was so influential. And it's probably worth at least a little bit of limelight considering that it managed to fit so much innovation in such a bizzare sequel, but if you ignore the enemy AI, real time facial animation, half decent physics system, and that plot twist that you defintely saw coming, than all you have is a broken shooter with the plot of a semi-decent teen dystopia novel.\n\nThe combat itself isn't terrible it's the scenarios the game bats you with that are the crux of the problem. It is objectivley unsatisfying to be slowly staggering your way to a gun turret/sniper by dodging between cover. It is objectively not fun to use the rocket launcher on a helicopter that shoots you the moment you try to properly aim. It is BAD game design to distract the player with enemies when they are supposed to be focusing on something tactical instead of action based.\n\nThe level design is bland and unfocused, without a lot of setpeices that stray from the very basic visual aspect of fun. And although the actual designs of enemies and structures are interesting and dynamic, they do a poor job at guiding the player through them towards the goal. There were too many times when I simply got lost in the same couple looping rooms, not realizing there was an entire other segment hidden behind a ledge somewhere. If I can't progress in a video game, want it to be because I was too inadequate to follow it's orders, not because the video game did a poor job at ordering me in the firt place.\n\nThere are too many gimmicks that stray on for far too long. Instances where I say to myself, \"Sure it would be cool to [Traverse the mechanisms under a bridge] [Fight a helicopter that spews bombs in a motorized boat] [Command a squad of allies through dangerous terrain]\" but I ended up being sick of it by the time I met the halfway mark of that gimmick alone. And that's not including the gimmicks that DIDN'T seem like fun ideas. (I'm looking at you Ant Lions, Head-Crab Mine, and driving section!)\n\nNone of what I said is meant to imply that Half-Life 2 is a terrible game, heck it's not even a BAD game, it's a good game, maybe even a great game, but it definetly isn't a perfect game. It has it's fair share of entertaining fights, sure. And even some gripping bits of story near the end. (Heck the entirety of the climax is the most fun I've genuinely had in this game.) But that doesn't mean that praising the game with perfect scores is going to make Valve any better at video game design. And heck, it isn't going to make Half-Life 3 any better. And let's be honest, if THAT game doesn't end up being perfect...\n\n...\n...\n...\n..Naw we'll probably still love Gaben","timestamp_created":1450962980,"timestamp_updated":1450962980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500155985355377197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19906501","author":{"steamid":"76561198113697439","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":567,"last_played":1561983304},"language":"czech","review":"Výborná hra\n+Příběh\n+Grafika\n+Fyzika\n+Zbraně\n-sem tam nějaký bug \n","timestamp_created":1450962372,"timestamp_updated":1450962372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19906054","author":{"steamid":"76561198135696476","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1329,"last_played":1536672422},"language":"italian","review":"Ponte tra la vecchia e la nuova generazione videoludica, non ho mai schifato Half Life, è incredibile ciò che riesce a fare il Source Engine: grafica di qualità con hardware anche di fattura media, divertente fino in fondo, trama avvincente e d'effetto, grafica curata fino in fondo, non vedo l'ora che Black Mesa Source aggiunga il ponte tra HL1 e HL2.

The game as a whole is absolutely amazing. It has a great story, tricky puzzle elements, great action, and fun gameplay elements. Almost all of this game's main characters are likeable, you genuinely care about all of them; Alyx, Eli, Barney, Kleiner, even Father Grigori whom you only see for one chapter! The game's various gameplay mechanics are stunning, (especially if you consider it was made in 2004) segments such as controlling an antlion army in Nova Prospekt or driving through the canals on the airboat armed with a hunter chopper gun are awesome to play through and the music really assists with this. The game isn't exactly easy though, it will occasionally get difficult to keep things interesting and it doesn't always lay out the path or the way to open the path to progress right in front of you, it can either be right infront of your face or hidden somewhere nearby, it challenges you to think, similar to Portal. There is much more to this game but some of which you should find out on your own. I know I may seem like some super-fan of Valve gushing and over exaggerating it's awesomeness like I see good 'ol GabeN as God, but no I just really like the game, Valve is popular for a reason and it's not that people are suckers, they just make really good games. Which is why people are either violently upset or insanely desperate towards Valve to make a 3rd game(for any of their games mind you). Also the ending of Half Life2 ep2 is also a big reason people want a Half Life 3, (trust me you want to save that one for last so you may understand). I highly reccommend playing this game and the other episodes, specifically in order, you will not be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1450899350,"timestamp_updated":1450899487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19884010","author":{"steamid":"76561198167065483","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1593304848},"language":"latam","review":"Half life es una saga que todo aquel que se haga llamar gamer debe haber jugado por lo menos 1 vez","timestamp_created":1450899002,"timestamp_updated":1450899002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19883873","author":{"steamid":"76561198212789044","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":668,"last_played":1624847706},"language":"english","review":"bored play Half Life 2\nLike zombies play Half Life 2\nIt cost a little but it is worth it","timestamp_created":1450898698,"timestamp_updated":1450898698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19883322","author":{"steamid":"76561198196482034","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":753,"last_played":1451483040},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy bueno","timestamp_created":1450897648,"timestamp_updated":1450897648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19883299","author":{"steamid":"76561198037285888","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":64,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54,"last_played":1450897560},"language":"english","review":"Scam.

Such a powerful story with lovable characters, and very impressive graphics (for the time it came out, wow.) This game truly defines everything Valve stands for. The action of Team Fortess, the strategy of Portal, and (occasionally) the horrors of Left 4 Dead all combine (hehe combine) into one masterpiece of a video game. I am so glad that I played it, and won't be surprised if I replay it in the near future. I recommend this to ANYONE, even those not interested in FPS games.
