This game has plenty of re-playability. Just like most games this one is best to be played with people you know. It for sure requires alot of teamwork at higher difficulties, otherwise you will get surrounded very quickly with your pants down (Reloading) only frustrating thing I find is that a fair amount of the players that have Max level in a perk or all their perks are still very horrible at the game and despite having max level they constantly are dying. I find the challenge in the game comes when trying to get all 285 achievements.\n\nPros: \n1. The game is a fun alternative to alot of \"Zombie\" type cooperative games out there.\n2. It has both a Single player and Multi player options\n3. The game allows for each and every player to create their own servers, both Dedicated or Listen types which allows the game to last MUCH longer without being forced to connect to a third party server, which could potentially go down at any point. It also allows you to add mutators (Add-ons) to your own server. \n4. The game is challenging enough and is frequently updated with patches and events to keep the player base fairly strong.\n\nCons:\n1. The grind to gain perk levels can be a tad long from level 1 to level 6\n2. There are alot of glitches remaining in the map but most of them have been patched since it's first release, the remaining few that are still present are not game breakers so it's really of no large consequence\n3. Some of the Zeds are a little Overpowered upon higher difficulties.","timestamp_created":1428531509,"timestamp_updated":1460187458,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15270352","author":{"steamid":"76561198170182559","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":579,"last_played":1526424063},"language":"english","review":"super fun i have a terrible computer and it still runs just fine and the only problime that i have with it is that most of the maps are 2 dark","timestamp_created":1428531154,"timestamp_updated":1428531154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15269610","author":{"steamid":"76561197963224387","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":9241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8543,"last_played":1428528202},"language":"english","review":"The onlything better than this wonderful game is killingfloor2 most coop fun I have ever had I highly recommend this game 8/10","timestamp_created":1428527050,"timestamp_updated":1428527050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15269521","author":{"steamid":"76561197969511833","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9025,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8940,"last_played":1472057038},"language":"english","review":"i shot zed. it die.","timestamp_created":1428526591,"timestamp_updated":1428526591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15268314","author":{"steamid":"76561198049092323","num_games_owned":378,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2251,"last_played":1589257722},"language":"brazilian","review":"Dosh simulator.\n$$$/10 would dosh again.","timestamp_created":1428520811,"timestamp_updated":1428520811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474452555179595947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15267101","author":{"steamid":"76561198001478175","num_games_owned":407,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4033,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3730,"last_played":1428956359},"language":"english","review":"Really fun to play with friends but quite boring to play alone.
