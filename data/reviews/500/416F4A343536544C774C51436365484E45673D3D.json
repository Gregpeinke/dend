I can personally, wholeheartedly vouch for that.\n\nThere are many quality created custom maps I have had the pleasure of playing alone, or with a group of randoms/friends, and enjoying them immensely. Do not pass up on this gem.\n\nIf the current price or the shiny fact that Left 4 Dead 2 is side by side also priced the same, still has you reconsidering whether it's a purchase or not, then please at least consider it when it goes on sale.\n\nMany hours of fun and zombie shooting will be had when you jump into this game.\n\nHappy zombie hunting and don't forget to grab your pills. ^_^","timestamp_created":1325688394,"timestamp_updated":1575243559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5157144","author":{"steamid":"76561198045742822","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1277,"last_played":1407416818},"language":"russian","review":"Круто","timestamp_created":1325673172,"timestamp_updated":1325673172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4693190","author":{"steamid":"76561198040833343","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":977,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":977,"last_played":1327392000},"language":"spanish","review":"Si te gustan los zombies y ya que sea multijugador, coorreee por que te vas a cagar!\n","timestamp_created":1325638677,"timestamp_updated":1325638677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1780203","author":{"steamid":"76561197997881028","num_games_owned":1099,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":3149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2226,"last_played":1644893643},"language":"english","review":"Survival horror party???
