This game is absolutely fantastic not only in terms of gameplay and story, but lighting and the change of environments for its time. I can safely say this game is almost better than Half Life, if not better. The environments are much more varied, you have a sense of purpose and more of a 'clan' if you see what I mean. You can have your squad follow you (although they are relatively clumsy at times) and they are quite useful from healing you to opening doors and vents. The platforming is on touch, although the crouch-jumping is a bit awkward, but it's still a very good choice of gameplay. A perfect mix of puzzles and action. Compared to Blue Shift, this had an actual boss with weaknesses and it felt good to defeat it.\n\nAlso, I would like to add that I find the puzzles less complicated and frustrating, which may be because I've played all the other Half Life 1 parts but I see in general that they are made less complex, which is good for people like me because whilst I enjoy puzzles from time to time, I prefer shooting and puzzles should be easily solvable so you don't feel too frustrated, if you see what I mean. Still, they are perfectly challenging and it is not TOO easy to solve them, however this time I did not see myself going on the internet to find solutions. A very good game, despite a few glitches like the doors opening. The sounds are quite good for their time, but so is everything else really. A very good game that I would recommend to anyone, even those not very fond of puzzle and shooter games.","timestamp_created":1463908583,"timestamp_updated":1463908640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23110720","author":{"steamid":"76561198223213940","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":319,"last_played":1463810401},"language":"russian","review":"Весьма не дурно!Не смотря на то что гейплей игры устарел она остаёться интересной и местами жутковатой\n-Оружий добавили прилично но даже на самом сложном уровне игры пользоваться ими необязательно \n-Локации и новые монстры заставляли понервничать\n-Сюжет для дополнения средний \n-В сетевую игру мало кто играет\n","timestamp_created":1463810694,"timestamp_updated":1463810694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518072307109832764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23095868","author":{"steamid":"76561198005971335","num_games_owned":700,"num_reviews":99,"playtime_forever":540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":78,"last_played":1586234521},"language":"english","review":"Personally, I find this the weaker expansion pack, but it's still good.

Знакомьтесь – перед вами первый аддон к [b]Half – Life[/b], и называется он [b]Opposing Force[/b], что дословно означает «Противостоящая Сила». Разработанный силами Gearbox Software, аддон повествует об уже знакомых нам событиях в научно – исследовательском комплексе Black Mesa, поданных с другого ракурса. Вас зовут Адриан Шепард, и вы – боец спецподразделения HECU – специальных войск, обученных вести бой с противниками любого уровня, в т.ч. и с «нестандартными» врагами. Из комплекса поступает сигнал тревоги и наше подразделение летит выяснять природу угрозы и устанавливать контроль над комплексом. Вот только вместо десантирования у нас по плану падение с диким грохотом прямо посреди раздираемой войной между землянами и пришельцами Black Mesa. Очнувшись, мы обнаруживаем что отрезаны от основных отрядов, которые ведут бой практически по всему комплексу. Имея на руках лишь тяжеленный разводной ключ, нам предстоит одно – выжить.\n\n[h1]«ЗА»[/h1]\n- Игра является тем же [b]Half – Life[/b], только в шкуре морпеха. Соответственно все лучшее что было в оригинале – умные враги, ураганные перестрелки и кинематографичность – все это присутствует и здесь.\n- Нововведения в геймплее не портят игру – взаимодействовать с другими солдатами (раньше они были нашими врагами) или с персоналом комплекса Black Mesa придется очень часто, даже чаще чем в оригинале, новые классы союзников – медик и инженер – позволяют разработчикам создавать пусть и простенькие, но занятные многоходовые комбинации задачек\n- Так как мы играем за морпеха, в наше распоряжение передают как и типично армейские орудия убийства типа пулемета или снайперской винтовки, так и экзотику типа Оружия Перемещения, созданного в кулуарах Black Mesa.\n- Разработчики не стали халтурить и выдали геймплей, продолжительностью немногим менее оригинальной игры, что превращает [b]Opposing Force[/b] в почти самостоятельную игру.\n\n[h1]«ПРОТИВ»[/h1]\n- Основная претензия которую можно высказать этой в целом очень достойной игре – вольная интерпретация канонов оригинала. В частности пресловутая Раса «Х», которая в каком – то отношении даже превосходит обитателей мира Зен, или как минимум не уступает им, вообще не задумывалась! Это типичная «отсебятина» Gearbox, которая встречается лишь в этой игре. \n- Невзирая на то что повествование идет от лица морпеха – человека военного, а потому – серьезного, в игре в разы больше балагана чем в оригинале – мы используем в качестве оружия рыгающую ящерицу (в перерывах между стрельбой нежно поглаживая ее по спинке!) и наэлектризованного таракана. Пока в комплексе идет бойня, ученый и охранник обсуждают дроидов из «Звездных Войн» (!!!), можно увидеть Фримена со стороны (впрочем это было и в «официальном» [b]Blue Shift[/b]), но увидеть с волосами, заплетенными в конский хвост, ну и т.п. Юмор должен быть везде, я не спорю, но все же это уже некий перебор.\n- Графическая отсталость. Если для [b]Half – Life[/b] все же вышла [b]Black Mesa[/b], то для [b]Opposing Force[/b] своя [b]Operation Black Mesa[/b] еще только в разработке. Остается довольствоваться только [b]High – Definition Pack[/b] – ом.\n\n[h1]Резюме[/h1]\nКрайне неоднозначный проект. Это отличная игра, тут есть все – и эффектные сценки, и атмосфера, и дикая пальба во все стороны и даже ядерная бомба. А вот с сеттингом [b]Half – Life[/b] вышла какая – то беда, вроде и комплекс знакомый, и десятки знакомых охранников, вот только от нестыковок хочется выть. Вы бы, будучи охранником и зная что товарищи морпеха, стоящего перед вами, огнем и мечом прошли по комплексу, убивая все живое, может даже ваших друзей – стали бы ему помогать? [b]Opposing Force[/b] не задается такими мелкими вопросами, и в этом его беда. Если, положа руку на сердце, наплевать на то что это «неканоничная» игра, то в сухом остатке мы имеем отличный шутер, продолжающий традиции своего предшественника – пришельцы, научная база, дробовик и нон – стоп экшен. Смело могу рекомендовать всем, кому первая [b]Half – Life[/b] понравилась. Вот только не надо пытаться вписать эту игру в каноничный сюжет – расстроитесь.","timestamp_created":1459084370,"timestamp_updated":1459084370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.695131480693817139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22034469","author":{"steamid":"76561198251867828","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":357,"last_played":1451553852},"language":"schinese","review":"6小时必然通关，剧情大概就是你扮演一个陆战队员去黑山解救科学家。但是会被击落（开头、）。然后被派来封锁消息的特种部队（黑衣人）追杀，最后逃之夭夭。嗯。。。大概就是这些了。哦 ， 最终BOSS萌。","timestamp_created":1458873384,"timestamp_updated":1458873384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22021688","author":{"steamid":"76561198179109561","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":284,"last_played":1549816299},"language":"english","review":"this game is good its one of the best expansion packs","timestamp_created":1458822862,"timestamp_updated":1458822862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22020672","author":{"steamid":"76561198129465435","num_games_owned":497,"num_reviews":592,"playtime_forever":1632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43,"last_played":1647531831},"language":"turkish","review":"Half - Life Ek Yapım Olarak Oyun Hakketten Güzel Karakterimiz Asker Olarak Oluyor Ve Görevimiz Gordon Freemanı Yok Etmek Ama Amaç Oraya Gelmiyor Bi Sebeble Sanırım Gordon Freeman XEN Gezegene Işınlandığı Zaman","timestamp_created":1458818077,"timestamp_updated":1458818077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22018225","author":{"steamid":"76561198045169707","num_games_owned":368,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":594,"last_played":1458770347},"language":"italian","review":"Seppur con la grafica di 20 anni fa, il gioco mi è piaciuto.

Аддон получился очень убойным, интересным и захватывающим.\n\nДействие OF идёт параллельно первой Half-Life, вернее, в ней показаны события первоисточника с точки зрения бойцов HECU. Вы - Адриан Шепард, молодой спецназовец, прибывший по заданию зачистить сектор, но что-тоё пошло не так, и Вы вынуждены выбираться из кошмара, в который Вас, собственно, и завезли.\n\nДостоинств у OF несколько. Во-первых, в игру внедрили еще больше нового вооружения и приспособлений, которые преобразили геймплей. Теперь нам доступна система ночного видения, гаечный ключ, снайперская винтовка и много чего другого. Во-вторых, разрабы добавили в игровой процесс новых противников и совершенно неожиданный ход событий. OF - единственная игра, где упоминается второй параллельный мир и таинственная раса Х, которая учинила в Чёрной Мезе не менее эпичный батл. В какой-то степени, нет логики, ведь об этой расе ни в первой, ни во второй части HL она не упоминается. Но как интересный способ увлечь игроков - это очень даже неплохо. Так же стоит уделить внимание отменным и продуманным уровням и, собственно, игровому процессу. Здесь всё взрывается и буквально разрушается под ногами, повсюду перестрелки и чего только здесь не происходит, немногим даже больше, чем в самой Half-Life. Стоит отдать должное разрабам - ведь они преобразили игровое пространство, сохранив при этом атмосферу и общую концепцию оригинала.\n\nOpposing Force - это отличный способ взглянуть на события игры под другим углом. Это довольно-таки хорошая игра, которая пришлась по вкусу многим фанатам Half-Life. Быть может, она в скором времени найдёт себе достойного преемника в виде ремейка по аналогии с Black Mesa. Это было бы весьма кстати.","timestamp_created":1458723505,"timestamp_updated":1458723505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559269845485687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21988949","author":{"steamid":"76561198141042788","num_games_owned":287,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1458676107},"language":"tchinese","review":"遊戲關卡解迷部分普通，卻以設置敵人的數量和密集度提升來增加難度\n純粹是浪費子彈和強制扣血而已\n甚至最終BOSS打起來也無須任何技巧，純粹浪費時間\n遊戲除了G-Man等少數劇情之外實在雞肋\n\n夜市儀的綠色快把我眼睛搞瞎了\n還有打完BOSS的過場綠色閃光也是\n看得我眼睛痛\n\n以上這幾點來說，遊戲體驗頗糟糕的\n\n誠如遊戲介紹，此遊戲無中文字幕及語音\n但少數研究員和警衛罐頭對話是中文語音\n挺神秘的","timestamp_created":1458676590,"timestamp_updated":1459079399,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.344750493764877319","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21983864","author":{"steamid":"76561198192944738","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1037,"playtime_last_two_weeks":293,"playtime_at_review":500,"last_played":1659884389},"language":"polish","review":"Bardzo fajny dodatek do oryginalnej fabuły, jak i w half-life, tak i tutaj świetny klimat i akcja, nawet jak na swój wiek tej gry.\nPolecam przede wszystkim którzy przeszli half-life. :)","timestamp_created":1458657846,"timestamp_updated":1458657846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509345769882202148","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21941436","author":{"steamid":"76561198255461799","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":515,"last_played":1458466556},"language":"russian","review":"По-моему это одно из лучших дополнений к игре, которых я когда-либо играл, сейчас в наше время DLC проходятся за 1-3 часа, а стоят хрен знает сколько, а это дополнение к Half-Life просто кашерно, так как стоит недорого(мне пофиг, я купил Valve Complete Pack) и проходится за 8-10 часов, рекомендую тем, кто любит первый Half-Life, однозначно!","timestamp_created":1458466878,"timestamp_updated":1458466878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21938461","author":{"steamid":"76561198081928066","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":1103,"last_played":1659578735},"language":"english","review":"Great game... so far...

It IS official Valve product, though, so while it's one of the \"lighter\" - and arguably less \"essential\" - forays into the Half-Life universe, it's still a very high-quality product by the standards of not only first-person shooters, but indeed video games as a whole.  Sure it's dated more than a tad - especially graphics and sound-wise - but the gameplay is still very much there, and the story ain't half-bad neither.  The word \"solid\" definitely comes to mind...and then some.  \n \n   Maybe not the best place to start your FPS training - that'd be more like Half-Life itself, dare I say! - but obviously highly recommended to fans of the original who crave more.
