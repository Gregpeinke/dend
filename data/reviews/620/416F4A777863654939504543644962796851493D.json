for replaying but its still fun and i have beated the maingame 2-3 times and the Co-op 1 time because i liked the game so much\n\nCo-op:\nThe co-op is just as good as the normal game and the diference is that you each (2 players) have a portal gun with 2 portals in each so there can be 4 portals so it is kind of diferent but if you get the game then beat the singelplayer first and then play the co-op with a freind (it will make most sense)\n\nThe Story:\nI know that there is a story i just have not figured it out because i only own portal 2 and not the orginal portal because ther is more content in this game (im 99% percent sure)","timestamp_created":1588773987,"timestamp_updated":1588773987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509433984756469727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68676025","author":{"steamid":"76561198047566364","num_games_owned":1476,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":904,"last_played":1588773661},"language":"english","review":"Almost

2 is a worthy sequel of the original. While it naturally becomes more complex in both gameplay and story, it does not grow beyond its scope and still remains a rather tight, small story within the labs of Aperture which keeps with the spirit of the first game. The writing remains stellar, with Ellen McLain as GLaDOS starting out the game with her hilarious brand of passive-aggressive assaults on you. Her voice in this game is more expressive and emotional than in the last, which is in line with the game's attempts to humanise her as a character. Other voice talents--including Stephen Merchant as Wheatley, J.K. Simmons as Cave Johnson and Dee Bradley Baker as Atlas, P-body and the defective turrets--all provide stunning performances that are all hilarious in their own way.\n\nIf you liked Portal for its classic gags such as the cake and the companion cube will find Portal 2 to their liking, as well. You'll find your repeatable gags in the form of combustable lemons, Machiavellian morons. birds and cores. Don't think that the only draw of Portal 2 is in its humour, though. While it does not, to me, surpass the first game in offering a sense of oppressive and suffocating isolation, it instead provides many different backdrops which each have distinct atmospheres that can really stick with players if they choose to just pause and appreciate them. The overgrown test chambers as well as the ruins of old Aperture are both very atmospheric.\n\nThe music in this game is also really damn good--good enough that I bought the album to listen to when I'm out and about. I find standouts in the Friendly Faith Plate and Cara Mia Addio, which offer varying tones of violent and loud machinery to a beautiful piece that makes your heart get all fluttery listening. Of course, I couldn't mention the music in this game without mentioning Exile Vilify, the track by the National that appears on some of the radios in Rattman's dens. The song is beautiful, and also earned its place in my phone's storage. \n\nThe pacing of the game and the introduction of new gameplay mechanics seems well thought out in that I never found myself growing bored or losing attention and going into autopilot. Of course, since this is a puzzle game that isn't randomly generated, subsequent playthroughs do lose some of the magic in that you'll know the solution to all the tests and can kinda just start to coast through the game. Fear not, however, as Valve has remedied this with the introduction of the Perpetual Testing Initiative! Now you can turn to the community for more creatively made tests from fellow players like you! Of course, if you fancy getting your mad AI complex on, you can take to making some tests yourself and putting them out there for others to pit their wit against. This even comes with its own story, of sorts, in the form of audio that begins at the start of tests from a smorgasbord of alternate universe Cave Johnsons. If you thought one of these guys was mad, just wait until you're listening to him across several universes. It is choc full of hilarious stuff and really makes you excited to get to the next test.\n\nPortal 2, unlike the first game, is now also a co-op! This isn't like the common co-op fare of \"single-player campaign but now there's more of you\"; Portal 2's co-op campaign is its own beast, complete with tests designed for two and a story which takes place after the events of the single-player story with the aforementioned Atlas and P-body as the stars. The tests are well designed and the characters of Atlas and P-body are given plenty of life, whether through Dee Bradley Baker's performances or the variety of emotes you are given over the course of the campaign which really add that extra bit of fun and flavour to the gameplay. Of course, during this campaign, GLaDOS is once again presiding over the tests which means that you get to hear a lot more humorous snark from her.\n\nOverall, I'd say that Portal 2 is an exceptional sequel that takes the seed of the first game and waters it into a beautiful, blooming flower. More puzzles, more humour, more story, yet never overstepping itself and becoming too much. This game is a treat and, unlike any other franchise they've made, this sequel makes me really sad that Valve can't count to three.","timestamp_created":1588741573,"timestamp_updated":1588741573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68655065","author":{"steamid":"76561198377243433","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":684,"last_played":1587718277},"language":"english","review":"Its fun yey","timestamp_created":1588741168,"timestamp_updated":1588741168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68654842","author":{"steamid":"76561198416957079","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":583,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":527,"last_played":1601231275},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1588740705,"timestamp_updated":1588740705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68654540","author":{"steamid":"76561199049474957","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":917,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":573,"last_played":1618711622},"language":"english","review":"epic portal","timestamp_created":1588740110,"timestamp_updated":1588740110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68654230","author":{"steamid":"76561198170064983","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":25441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24242,"last_played":1649638454},"language":"english","review":"is good","timestamp_created":1588739541,"timestamp_updated":1588739541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68653584","author":{"steamid":"76561198112295655","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":4594,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4195,"last_played":1653860811},"language":"english","review":"Thinking with portals is hard ):\n10/10 with rice","timestamp_created":1588738280,"timestamp_updated":1588738280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68653530","author":{"steamid":"76561198335789791","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1756,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1658723368},"language":"english","review":"it has portal it good","timestamp_created":1588738168,"timestamp_updated":1588738168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68653246","author":{"steamid":"76561198995089672","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":970,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":429,"last_played":1655257129},"language":"english","review":"goood","timestamp_created":1588737656,"timestamp_updated":1588737656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68653156","author":{"steamid":"76561198871932474","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":257,"last_played":1643083636},"language":"english","review":"this game is awsome but i dont know what to do on the 18th lvl","timestamp_created":1588737490,"timestamp_updated":1588737490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxceI9PECdIbyhQI="}
