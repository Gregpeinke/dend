The ending level was incredibly long and I found myself getting more annoyed with it then enjoying it.  Overall, it was a fun little game, but didn't snag me.\n\nThe next day, I figured I'd beat Portal 2 just to say I finished the series before saying I didn't really enjoy it.  At first, I was expecting more of the same, and was given more of the same.  However after what I thought was the end to a fairly decent puzzle game, the suprise happened.  I don't want to go into spoilers but after the fall, it really got interesting.  I loved the lore and backstory and explaination given there, but still found the puzzles a bit easy, and at times, very tedious.  When the third gel was added, the climb back up really was the first time I got frusterated by the puzzles, as it seemed very unclear how to proceed.  Solving those final puzzles of that section were very rewarding, and that and the story got me looking forward to the final battle.  The puzzles when back in the modern factory were far more annoying than hard in some places, and challenging in others.  The final battle was interesting.\n\nOverall, as a Portal newb, I was fairly glad that I beat both games without looking anything up, reading any guides, or resorting to outside help.  That experience left me with a sense of satisfaction, and with the reasonable length of the two games, that satisfaction of time well spent, and the fun of the stroyline, left me having to say, I found these games very enjoyable.\n\nSo, for someone who went into the series knowing nothing but memes, expecting nothing but memes, and going into it already deciding it wasn't a series for me, I was pleasently suprised.  For anyone else expecting the same, I recommend you give it a try, you'll find yourself changing your mind.","timestamp_created":1451787092,"timestamp_updated":1451787092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20239598","author":{"steamid":"76561198253918687","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":535,"last_played":1580010620},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego , sobretodo jugarlo con amigos en co-op","timestamp_created":1451786250,"timestamp_updated":1451786250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20239584","author":{"steamid":"76561198046554089","num_games_owned":286,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1310,"last_played":1451790893},"language":"english","review":"Um look at the reviews, Currently 62,000 reviews and it's overwhelming positive.

Many puzzle games have the fault of being too difficult, unoriginal, and ultimately having low replayablility because puzzles you've already figured out once are no fun. This game throws all those faults in the garbage. While the game was very difficult, and I have been stuck on the same level for an hour once or twice, I never felt like the game was unbeatable, and I enjoyed it very much. The portal gun is also one of the most original game items I have ever encountered, and I never get tired of using it. Lastly, it is one of the most replayable puzzle games yet. For one, the co-op mode is very fun, and while even if you already beat it once, the experience can be completely different depending on who you play with, so it's always fun to play it with someone new. There's also the feature of community test chambers made by you, the players. Now you have to download the chambers, so depending on what computer you're playing it on, you can't just play community test chambers until you die, but it's always fun to see what other people come up with.","timestamp_created":1451768979,"timestamp_updated":1451768979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20231576","author":{"steamid":"76561197995413805","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1151,"last_played":1493932564},"language":"english","review":"Do not play with a Rift, my left eye fell out and I didn't even notice because IMMERSION MANNNN","timestamp_created":1451768945,"timestamp_updated":1451768945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20231262","author":{"steamid":"76561198043742344","num_games_owned":360,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":651,"last_played":1451165984},"language":"english","review":"Great puzzle game.","timestamp_created":1451768376,"timestamp_updated":1451768376,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20231227","author":{"steamid":"76561198112001640","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1451768176},"language":"russian","review":"Очень хорошее, не просто замечательноепродолжение игры Portal.

É um jogo que te prende de um jeito, não tem como explicar, ele vem com vários testes diferentes e sempre com o seu humor que faz você gostar demais dos personagens, tanto os mocinhos, quanto os vilões, uma história misteriosa e com surpresas inesperáveis. O gráfico bonito, jogabilidade simples e muito boa, e a trilha sonora engraçada demais combinando 100% com o jogo. Na minha opinião o único contra que eu tive em relação a ele foi que a legenda do meu jogo funcionava quando queria, as vezes aparecia, as vezes não, não sei se foi bug apenas no meu jogo ou a valve pecou nesse aspecto, mas deu para entender a história direitinho e se divertir com ela normalmente.\n\nHistória 10/10\nGráfico 8,5/10\nTrilha Sonora 10/10\nJogabilidade 9/10","timestamp_created":1451757340,"timestamp_updated":1451757340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.660633504390716553","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20224878","author":{"steamid":"76561198109597761","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":1994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":397,"last_played":1641318756},"language":"english","review":"An improvement to the first game.
