The original was more of an extended demo, which could be completed in a single sitting. The second one, while still short, is much more dense with content. The story and world are more fully realized, the puzzles perfectly build off of one another, and the humor comes back in full force. The new mechanics feel like a necessary evolution, and they all work rather well. In truth, my only complaints regarding this game are the engine and the eleventh hour pacing. The engine is starting to show its age in that loading screens are entirely too frequent, and it really breaks up the gameplay. As for the so-called pacing at the eleventh hour, I'm not referring to story. The story pacing stays on point throughout. However, the last few puzzles introduce 2 new mechanics that I feel got rushed in and out of the game. You only use them in a handful of puzzles before being whisked away to the finale. Furthermore, I don't feel as if there was any puzzle that took every mechanic I had learned so far and sythesized it into the perfect puzzle to test myself in. Oh well. The game is still VERY fun, and I think it's an experience that everyone needs to have.","timestamp_created":1418826303,"timestamp_updated":1418826303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13416382","author":{"steamid":"76561198146213170","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":532,"last_played":1418825732},"language":"spanish","review":"Segunda parte y Obra maestra\n\nPocos hitos recordará uno como éste Portal 2 que puedan estar a su mismo nivel.

But unfortunately, it suffers from the dreaded “sequel curse” and doesn’t manage to surpass its predecessor in every manner.\n\nThe puzzles, while still satisfyingly clever at times, have abandoned most of the mechanical skill required by the player to master.  So forget hard timed jumps or puzzles requiring coordination and reflexes, those have all been culled for the sake of what I can only assume to be accessibility and appeal to a greater demographic.  This is of course not necessarily a bad thing in a Portal 2—or any other entertainment product for that matter—as it manages to still retain some essential qualities, albeit maybe not emphasized in the same way as its predecessor. \n\nThe design decision of mostly permitting to place portals where necessary to solve the puzzles stifles the creativity of the player, which could otherwise have been far more interesting and thought provoking.  Not to mention how much the game would gain from not having single solutions to every puzzle but dare to give free reins to the players and treat them as the intelligent people let loose in an interactive virtual world free from constrains and full of opportunities instead of herding them through something like an amusement park.\n\nOverall, it was a fun experience and no doubt a great game, which is exactly why I think it deserves criticism; if for no other reason how much potential this time of game has.  To be honest, many of the things that the game sets out to do succeeded and the polish is impeccable.  A personal wish of mine would be that game developers were to put some more trust in gamers and their acumen, because certainly both games and gamers would have a lot to gain from a bit more of depth and just a little less handholding.  This does of course necessitate a good grasp of conveyance, something that Valve have excelled at (except with dota really) in the past—perhaps at times even in excess.\n\nA smooth learning curve is undoubtedly a great thing but too much of a good thing can turn something that could have been a great puzzle into just an obvious obstacle. It is after all nice to have to think occasionally.
