This is the top classic of the gaming, and we're talking about J.r.r Tolkien Lord of the Rings level of classism here. Everything you want from a shooter (except fancy graphics but there's a way to fix that problem), it's in here. And it runs smoothly on any kind of \"machine\", from supercomputers to toasters.\n\nHalf Life 2 brilliantly combines intense combat, constantly evolving and sensible storyline and puzzling. Sometimes these are separated, sometimes not, sometimes you really have to turn on your multitasking centers and do everything simultaneously. It's just bloody brilliant. No more hiding behind blocks just to advance. The map usually provides you many tools aside from your weapons you'll gather over time as the story progresses (how does he carry so many weapons?!), which should make your task of fighting through hordes of Combine (alien) or Civil protection units. This is needed, especially at harder difficulties. The AI is surprisingly smart at the times, whether it's enemy or an ally (Yes! you can command your own squad at certain points of the game) so sometimes, rushing in and imagining yourself as bulletproof Chuck Norris doesn't always help\n\nThe only gripe with this game is similar to what World of Warcraft suffers: Outdated graphics. But if you're looking for a good gaming experience, Half Life 2 is for you\n\nBy the way, you can install Cinematic Mod 2013 for Half  Life 2 if you're looking to VASTLY improve your graphics and replace rather cheecy and periodic music to something much more... epic. Doing this can be tricky and might take some time and nerves, especially for a new modder, like me.\n\nIf you feel you want to immerse yourself in the universe of Half Life, you should definitely buy the other episodes too and check for Half Life timelines from the internet.

Released in 2004 this game is a masterpiece that changed and shook the gaming industry and is a prominent example of a must play video game. The game was an amazing feat of video game creation at the time of it's release. The graphics were amazing and they still hold up well against the test of time, and core mechanics of this game had yet to be used on any game before this one. The game offers a seamless story telling narritive that doesn't hop you into a dull cutscene instead it puts you straight into it as part of the scene as opposed to a ghostly observer that happens to possess the protagonist when it's time to play the game, You are in the game. The game is never been interupted by a conventional loading screen, something that plagues the gaming world and makes gamers dread their gaming for a moment (I'm looking at GTA online or a bethesda RPG title) instead you'll have a very brief load box where the next area is loaded and the old one is removed from your game world (though it doesn't feel like anythings gone0 as if you just autosaved in another game. The game stays fresh with constant changes of scene and puzzles to mix up the first person shooter formula. This game doesn't feel like a mindless shooter campaign against lifeless multiplayer assets, instead its a nice enjoyable world to immerse yourself in. \n\nHalf-Life 2 needs to be in your library if you plan on having the steam platform on your computer.

Still, I've got a habit to write a couple of words about games I've played, and there's no reason for this one to be an exclusion.\n\nSo, this is half a shooter, half a puzzle. You are supposed to use not only your guns, but also your brains, and that is most probably the reason why it's been a hit. I can also see how the game defined the shape of future shooters that appeared after it. I can now understand why it's always been considered as classic.\n\nIt's tough, and it demands concentration. It's not just having fun, it's surviving (by the way, I am totally sure that a normal living person could not have possibly survived all that story). No matter how often you save the game, it's always not often enough. In some of its episodes this game can be badly annoying and irritating, making you want to catch one of those metrocops or soldiers by his throat and punch, punch, punch his face until there's nothing to punch.

Before this, the only shooter I could call best was Half-Life and only Half-Life 2 was able to out match it.  I have never seen a shooter designed around the more classical mechanics of a shooter ever out match Half Life 2.  They always have to add limitations, strategy, incorporate other genres, or add realism to compete.  They can never do as Half-Life 2 did and push that little button on the back of your head which is excited by the violence, danger, and anxiety to the point of exhaustion.  There has never been a shooter which takes the mechanics from the 90's, polishes them up for modernity, and serves them out like Half Life 2 did.  I want to see a game which can do as well as it can, I want to play a game which can take the shooter genre as far as it did.  None ever have, and I don't know if I should call myself fortunate or not for having played this game.\n\nThe concept starts as so many have, it has become trite.  You are in an alien controlled distopia and are awoken to overthrow the interdimentional overlords and free the Earth from its vast empire.  The game was designed more as a sandbox filled with set pieces to show off the Source Engine and Havoc physics.  Valve could have stopped there, but brought with it a memorable experience which I have never seen topped.  The characters are memorable and the sights are unforgettable.  No matter how simple the beginnings, the journey is one which will find a place in your head and never leave you.\n\nThe physics, none can talk about the source engine without bringing up Havoc.  Grenades bounce, boxes, toilets, refrigerators, all fly around in the middle of explosions.  The singular weapon this game has been praised for, the gravity gun was designed to show off the engine.  It's a simple weapon where you pick up static objects and can either drop them or shoot them at things.\n\nThe guns are snappy and responsive, there are no iron sights, there is no two gun limitation, it's point and shoot while sprinting through levels watching your health deplete and listening to your adversaries scream at you.  The action is intense, the violence shocks you at first and never stops drilling into your brain.  The experience can be exhausting as your brain tracks enemies, explosions, ammo, guns, armor, health, all while bullets shoot at you or anxiety scratches the back of your neck over the next encounter.  Sometimes a physics puzzle stops your path, sometimes it's a banal distraction and a relaxing break from all the gunfire, sometimes it's more stress added to an already stressful encounter.  When I say exhausting, I do mean that.  I have found myself having to take breaks from the game just to let my mind unwind after a large and difficult encounter.\n\nThis doesn't even account on the moddability of the game, the amount of user created content created for this game available online and on steam as separate and free games (even though Valve can't be bothered to add workshop support).  Behind this game is an obsessive community in love with this product willing to make it more than it already is, for good or ill.  There is also a mostly dead multiplayer component, but every now and again - you may find people who want to do nothing more than throw toilets at each other with a gravity gun.\n\nI'm rambling.  All I can say is this is the best First Person Shooter I've played.  Like it or hate it, if you have not experienced it, you can not say you are familiar with video games, and you definitely can not say you enjoy first person shooters.","timestamp_created":1383625759,"timestamp_updated":1455258259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7562675","author":{"steamid":"76561198093685591","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1289,"last_played":1383433887},"language":"english","review":"great game for anybody, lots of weapons, varied enemy type, and good plot!","timestamp_created":1383524546,"timestamp_updated":1383524546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7560824","author":{"steamid":"76561197968616420","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1085,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1085,"last_played":1383479811},"language":"english","review":"Bargin Price, Game play to die for......

O jogo foi muito bem dividido e de maneira nenhuma é enjoativo, os capítulos são bem variados entre a ação de tiroteio com muitos inimigos, clima de terror survive ambientação escura onde é necessário utilizar o cenário para enfrentar os alienígenas zumbis, pilotagem de veículos que eu achei muito divertido dentre outros, o jogo se aproveita de tudo o que essa engine pode oferecer.
