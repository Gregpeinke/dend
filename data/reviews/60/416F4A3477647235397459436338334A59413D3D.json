It's essentially a first person Tron mod for Half-Life where you run around platforms and throw discs at enemies to try and knock them off into the void.\n\nI...guess the gameplay is okay for what it is? I wouldn't exactly know, because despite its meme status very few people actually play this game - and there are no bots. You can arrange pick-up games with a couple likeminded folks on the game's community forum, but that's it.\n\nIf you do own it, it's probably because you're a Valve nerd who bought the Complete Pack, a dyed-in-the-wool retro gamer who bought the Counter-Strike 1 Anthology which has this game for some reason, or a memelord. I don't know if it's even worth it for anybody else, unless you know other people who not only own but want to play it. This is yet another game that I'd like to give a \"mixed\" rating to, and there's even a mixed icon on the Steam store's search results to display a game with middling user reviews! Come on Valve, show some initiative again.\n\nInterestingly, the \"variety of futuristic battle arenas\" touted on the store page boils down to 3 maps that look the same, although given the nature of gameplay they seem to be designed alright.

Great graphics, great gameplay, great story, memorable characters, great character, anything a that makes a game good, THIS GAME HAS IT. But, I bet you're saying \"But no game is perfect.\" AND THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG. THis game has literally nothing wrong with it. Repetitive gameplay? Nope. Badly designed and boring maps that are just a bunch of floating platforms with nothing interesting going on? NOPE. This game has literally nothing wrong with it, to the point where it ascends above being just a game, or even a work of art, for that matter. This game has ascended to a point where words cannot describe the quality of this game. And if you have the fucking audacity to disagree with me, then I hope that our god Gabe Newell will ruin your fucking life by VAC banning your steam account, reporting you to the police for Child Pornography that he placed onto your PC, and make sure that you die, a slow, terrible death in jail. While others may want a Half-Life 3, I want a Ricochet 2 & 3 to grace this planet, and revolutionize the entire planet.

Every aspect of the game, from the gameplay, to the animations, to the sound effects are of the highest quality. The gameplay is truly original and a real paradigm shifter. Ricochet's gameplay is cleverly described in the name; you throw out disks (like the kind you'd find in the hit movie Tron) and are able to \"Ricochet\" them off of your suroundings in order to fight your opponents. There are amazingly diverse and creative powerups in your arena that can augment your disks to give them a temporary new mechanic. While the game was likely meant to be played with multiple people, Ricochet has really become an experience that the developers could never have expected as a singleplayer masterpiece. The game is such a fluid and clean experience that draws you in and never lets you go, but at the same time giving you a better understanding of your own life in the world around you. This game supplies fullfilment in a way that no other game can give nor could be expected to give. There is only one question left unanswered by Ricochet.
