i mean REALLY bad.\nThe only reason i got this is that it was just 1.70 euros on sale, so why not actually ?\nThe gameplay and the mechanics are copy and pasted from TF2, servers either are full or are totally empty. Don't trust to the reviews below mine, you'll have to TRY to find playable servers (and by playable i mean that there isn't an extremely masculine voice that every 2 second shouts \"first blood headshot monster kill score whore\" and that there are 10+ players still not filling entirely the server).\nIn-game you either get killed by rats that spend their time finding a hole into the map to get some \"ez killz\" or you get godsprayed by a rushing Thompson.\nBots are even worse here, and by worse i mean THERE AREN'T ANY. Like really ? I know that every single game that Volvo did lately is multiplayer based but on a game that runs on the engine that ran the most innovative game ever i'd expect AT LEAST a pratice section where i could pawn some bots, but nevermind.\nMovement is so classic and regular that it's barely necessary to mention it. Guns and gunplay in general feels clunky as sin, you will often get oneshotted by like the least damaging gun in the world, just an example and aiming down the rifles' sights is so unnatural and mechanical, and i could keep on for hours staight.\nLet's talk about updates : each update that Volvo releases fixes things that no one cares about or even breaks the existing strenghts of the game... Yes, that's confirmed, Volvo puts a lot of effort on their most succesful and well-known titles (and with success i have to admit), but from what i experienced they give shit about less played titles, even the ones that had pretty good predecessor (just like the first DoD which is probably better than Source).\n\nTo conclude this review, i can say that this franchise had an unexpected and most importantly undeserved finish, and unless you are willing to pay money for even the lowest tier titles, for God's sake, don't buy this unless you find this on sale but take a look at the first DoD, which in my and most of people's opinion is far better, balanced and fun than THIS.\n\n\n-13492490890325/10 IGN Volvo pls fix asap","timestamp_created":1448986666,"timestamp_updated":1448986973,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.414189457893371582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19414414","author":{"steamid":"76561197967893582","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":14562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9554,"last_played":1573269342},"language":"tchinese","review":"好玩的老遊戲 從一代玩到現在","timestamp_created":1448983664,"timestamp_updated":1448983664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19406662","author":{"steamid":"76561198167979562","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":20759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6911,"last_played":1612252466},"language":"russian","review":"Игра детства , очень хорошая игра на движке source , советую","timestamp_created":1448952962,"timestamp_updated":1448952962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529780566692352295","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19391279","author":{"steamid":"76561198098384631","num_games_owned":373,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":134,"last_played":1503224972},"language":"english","review":"Because of this game , I broke my monitor. 10/10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[spoiler] I wasn't joking.

The game truly is missing something. There's a magic to Valve's multiplayer games. Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, Left 4 Dead, even Half-Life Deathmatch are all massively addictive, appealing games that satisfy as only the best games out there can do. But Day of Defeat: Source doesn't stand out like those games.\n\nUltimately it comes across feeling like a watered-down version of Battlefield. There's objectives and classes, but the maps are small and there are no vehicles to drive.\n\nSo, if you're going to buy a multiplayer shooter, I highly recommend you buy something else. There's nothing actually wrong with Day of Defeat: Source, but for 10 dollars or less you could do way better.","timestamp_created":1447390941,"timestamp_updated":1447390941,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486040979623794556","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19041600","author":{"steamid":"76561198067728231","num_games_owned":532,"num_reviews":168,"playtime_forever":118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":118,"last_played":1446956470},"language":"russian","review":"Если хотите постоянных перестрелок в атмосфере Второй мировой войны - это игра для вас.

Так же для этой игры существует множество модов, моделей игроков и оружия. Единственное что не нравится в этой игре это то, что нельзя пользоваться техников, ни танками, ни зенитками, ни даже обычными джипами. Звуковое оформление на высоте.
