Конечно же, в первую очередь изза того, что эта игра является продолжением известной своими головоломками первой части Portal.

При этом в Portal 2 присутствует очень простой в использовании редактор тестовых камер (\"Почуствуйте себя на месте Глэдос!\"). Увлекательный сюжет, новые зоны лабораторий Aperture Science! Комплекс Aperture 60-ых годов! Всё это вы можете увидеть здесь, в Portal 2! По 10-бальной шкале я бы поставил этой игре 7 из 10. Почему только 7?

So with these 'ground rules' in mind, let's begin:\n-Portal 2 has beautiful graphics. Sure, it may not compare in visuals to some other games that particularly concentrate on stunning design. But seeing how the graphics work to take you through the story, they certainly fulfill their task.\n-Like in Portal 1, the story is driven with an interesting way of narration from the all-compassing speaker system (Or so it'd seem...), and further on to the story, we get to dwell in the history of Portals, making Portal 2 both prequel and sequel to the first game of the series.\n-The beginning of the story relies on player's knowledge of Portal 1. Sure, it is perfectly playable, and enjoyable by people who haven't touched the first part. SPOILER: [spoiler]But to me, it was thrilling to hear Wheatley say that we're \"going through HER chamber\"[/spoiler]\n-It took me approximately 9 hours with my own pace to complete.
