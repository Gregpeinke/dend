When I talk to friends about the Portal games, I always compare them to games like Pac-Man or the original Sonic games. Old, yet still super popular.\n\nNow, Portal really left me, and really everyone, dry. Knowing nothing about the game, and the cryptic messages on the walls in obscure places. It left something to desire, answers mostly. Nobody really knew where to start when trying to piece together any clues that could answer anything! Portal 1 had very...empty minded characters. Not a lot of thought went into emotion or personality, leaving everyone kind of wondering what was real, or sarcastic. I am decently good at piecing together the lore and mysteries of games. But Portal 1 really stumped me, there really wasn't a good way to attack the problem and solve it. But then Portal 2 came out.\n\nPortal 2 seemed to be an opposite of Portal 1, it introduced more characters, it had more personality, and it answered questions. It still wasn't easy to solve, but it gave me something to work with. The personalities of the monologues were astoundingly great, it didn't make it seem like a robot was talking, it seemed human. Very few games can accomplish this through just script, but Portal 2 did it easy. However, Portal 2 gave me something better, answers. The background monologues seemed very cut and dry, like giving answers away for free. Portal 2 is obviously a clarification for questions for Portal 1, and with the background characters that you hear through the intercoms, you can start to figure out whats really happening in this game.\n\nThe Portal games are not only brilliant because of the gameplay, but because of the symbolism, to any young child, Portal is a game that you shoot doors that connect to each other, that you complete the puzzle, etc. But to the older, smarter audience, the game is much more sinister. I'm still not 100% sure what this game is trying to tell us. It has symbolic refrences to stuff like testing without consent, overthrowing leaders, don't trust everyone, and more. And this is probably the most brilliant part of this game.\n\nPortal 1 and 2 are quite simple gameplay wise. You have a magic gun that can shoot doors that are....linked in some way. You go through one, come out the other. Then you have to complete puzzles with this new gun, fight robots that can shoot you, and then fight in a boss battle. Quite simple, there really is no game like it. Just the game alone would be a hit, but the mystery adds to it.\n\nWheatly in Portal 2 is incredible, its round, cute appearance, British accent, and funny sarcasm makes you think he is completely innocent. The plot twist that happened so quickly was expected by me, I've watched snippets of streams, I've watched the trailers for the game, I was confident in what I thought Portal 2 was. And although I was mainly correct, some things I really didn't expect.\n\nThe end music for both games is some of the most popular game music ever. It gives a sense of accomplishment after finishing a game that isn't easy. Unlike games like Mario or Pac-Man that play music as you play, Portal gives you creepy, disturbing creaking noises that make it seem like a horror game. Alone, in a dark room, with a gun that certainly cant kill anything scary, and creepy background sounds. It seems destined for a horror game. But then you finish, and as you sit there, satisfied that you completed one of the best games ever, soothing, goofy music starts playing, it calms you, it gives a sense of completion, instead of a \"Thanks for playing!\", and it cuts the game, you get a moment of...you could say reflection, that makes the ending music in this game so popular.\n\nI honestly have no regrets playing this game, no complaints, no recommendations. The Portal games cannot be better. Portal 2 really ended any chance for a third game, I wont spoil it for any newcomers, but a third game cant really be possible, Portal 2 ended on a really good note, and it totally deserves it! Portal 1 made people want a second game, and this is it. But with this game being out for almost 10 years, I finally wanted to give this game an honest review. I have had both the Portal games for about 5 years now, playing on Xbox for most of it. And I honestly don't have anything more to say about it.\n\nAbsolutely incredible game, 11/10","timestamp_created":1610397885,"timestamp_updated":1610397885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84513167","author":{"steamid":"76561198281483731","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1094,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":761,"last_played":1640618027},"language":"russian","review":"щкрущнонщвонрпропрн деньги дааааа, деньги дентьги иххихихиих","timestamp_created":1610397589,"timestamp_updated":1610397589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84512581","author":{"steamid":"76561198300680099","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":15104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13791,"last_played":1652738427},"language":"english","review":"This game, even after 10 years now, still holds up amazingly well.

The setting is so good and interesting and you get to a bit in the middle of the game where a lot of mysteries are unravelled and the atmosphere is brilliant. You can never get bored with people talking to you while doing your puzzles and when your not doing the puzzles you're either running from something or looking around at all the detail and grandness of Aperture Science. Then you get to the co-op which is the best co-op in any game. Everything has been designed for both played to work together at once and know what each other want to do. Perfect game.\n\n9.9/10","timestamp_created":1610387900,"timestamp_updated":1651613276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84504442","author":{"steamid":"76561199019222218","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":592,"last_played":1611860836},"language":"brazilian","review":"Eu amei esse jogo, quando eu acabei deu aquele gosto de eu quero mais.","timestamp_created":1610387378,"timestamp_updated":1610387378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84504080","author":{"steamid":"76561198128538087","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":692,"last_played":1593190397},"language":"turkish","review":"Valve ın bana göre en güzel oyunu.","timestamp_created":1610386964,"timestamp_updated":1610386964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4t+i+fYCcOGtwgI="}
