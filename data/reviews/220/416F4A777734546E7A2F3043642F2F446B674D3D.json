It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society. Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the totalitarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated.\n\nThe story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of the totalitarian superstate Oceania, ruled by the Party, who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking.[5] Big Brother, the dictatorial leader of Oceania, enjoys an intense cult of personality, manufactured by the party's excessive brainwashing techniques. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with his colleague Julia and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four has become a classic literary example of political and dystopian fiction. It also popularised the term \"Orwellian\" as an adjective, with many terms used in the novel entering common usage, including \"Big Brother\", \"doublethink\", \"Thought Police\", \"thoughtcrime\", \"Newspeak\", and \"2 + 2 = 5\". Parallels have been drawn between the novel's subject matter and real life instances of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and violations of freedom of expression among other themes. Time included the novel on its list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005, and it was placed on the Modern Library's 100 Best Novels list, reaching number 13 on the editors' list and number 6 on the readers' list. In 2003, it was listed at number eight on The Big Read survey by the BBC.\n\n","timestamp_created":1639189821,"timestamp_updated":1639189821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105609328","author":{"steamid":"76561198114478883","num_games_owned":435,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":648,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1643864090},"language":"english","review":"Gordon Freeman is unstoppable and yet the Combine's strategy remains as \"throw enough soldiers until Freeman dies\"","timestamp_created":1639189343,"timestamp_updated":1639189343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.432432413101196289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105609071","author":{"steamid":"76561198110564363","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":736,"last_played":1656994599},"language":"english","review":"pp","timestamp_created":1639188983,"timestamp_updated":1639188983,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105608658","author":{"steamid":"76561199038045540","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":1097,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":128,"last_played":1657498831},"language":"spanish","review":"Simplemente una obra de arte adelantada a su epoca.","timestamp_created":1639188373,"timestamp_updated":1643750493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105607719","author":{"steamid":"76561199160752066","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":634,"last_played":1647776792},"language":"schinese","review":"经典永不过时","timestamp_created":1639186923,"timestamp_updated":1639186923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105607122","author":{"steamid":"76561199054802096","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1445,"last_played":1638453267},"language":"english","review":"This game took me far longer than it should have mainly cuz i was deadshit afraid of ravenholw´m and this area alone tool me hours, the other reason was even in that area I wanted to explore as much as possible and i spent hours doing stuff.

great title from Valve!\nThe Story revolves around (once again) Gordon Freeman, but this time the g man places him in a situation where he must fight against the alien forces of the Combine. The characters in the game are pretty good with personalities that you can easily enjoy, however it can feel repetitive with them repeatedly basking in Gordon's presence but apart from that, the writing and the voice acting hold up really well. The story itself is simple enough to follow and does a good job at both progressing the game and introducing the player to different sernarios, enemies, gamplay mechanics etc. \nThe setting of white forest is really diverse and interesting to look at and explore. From the main city to the beaches, each area that you encounter is rich in detail and gives the player enough room to explore and find secrets within it. \nVisually, due to when it was released, this game really holds up. Graphically, textures, lighting and character models are really impressive and look pretty realistic for how old it is. The visual direction that they went for really enhances what players had experienced in the previous game being its own thing this time around which can be hard to pull off but valve do it gracefully. \nSound and audio are great as the soundtrack really adds to the tension and atmosphere that the player will come to encounter through the entire run time of the game. The audio is also really fitting as it takes what was in the first game and   makes it so that while it may sound familiar, it manages to have its own feel to it rather than copying the identity of Half Life 1 which is really impressing. \nIn terms of gameplay, it manages to both hold that solid structure that the first game achieved while trying new things here and there. Combat is just as good as you remember it from the 1st game with it being a lot smoother. The guns in this game feel great with them all having their unique use and being introduced naturally through progression of the narrative. The enemies are also varied with new additions to the roster and each one of them having their own unique attacks and movement. There are many new things that half life 2 introduces such as driving, both buggies and boats, using enemies against other enemies, and friendly allies that aide you in combat such as attacking enemies and healing you. For the most part, these new additions are execute exceptionally well, however the allies and friendly enemies can be frustrating as they can block you from moving around in tight areas. \nOverall, Half Life 2 is a worthy successor for Half life one and i would recommend it to those who enjoyed the original experience or those looking for some fun, story driven action.","timestamp_created":1639162559,"timestamp_updated":1639162559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105588908","author":{"steamid":"76561198841316583","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":888,"last_played":1638217940},"language":"turkish","review":"MÜKEMMEL

I must've been like, 6 or 7 years old. At that time, my idea of videogames was vague. The first game I played was Donkey Kong Country on the SNES and GBA. I was pretty much focused on platformers. And then my uncle showed me Half-Life and Half-Life 2. While I fell in love with the first game, this was revolutionary for me. Everything felt real. Fast forward, a lot of years later. I'm now 19 years old. Decided to buy the game because it's dead cheap and I'm getting bored of these new titles that have nothing to boast except graphics and hundreds hours of content that only consist of copy+paste formulaic missions scattered around the boring ass open world. This game is so short, but I'd choose this over games nowadays that will surely take you hundreds of hours to beat, but tire you and burn you out in the process. At first, I was hesitant to play this game, as I am frightened to try out the things I loved as a kid. What if they aren't as good as they used to be? In this case tho, I only just appreciated Half-Life 2 more. The visuals are still stunning today that a guy who has no clue about videogames would guess it's released some time on 2010. Sike, it's a 2004 game. The gameplay is still decent. The only bad thing about it is that I've been spoiled by shooters nowadays that give you the basic ability to aim down sights. But overall, it doesn't feel clunky at all, and most especially the gravity gun makes me feel like a badass. What makes it so special as well is the way it tells the story. It's not like games nowadays that force you to watch long ass cutscenes. Overall, a 9/10 game. I rarely give games a 10, so yeah. As if my opinion really matters, lol. I loved Half-Life 2 as a kid, but I love it more now that I'm old enough to understand how this game revolutionized the FPS genre, videogame physics, and videogame as a whole. Solid appreciation too for the numerous community-made mods, a huge chunk of them are free if you own this game. I'm about to play Entropy Zero because I heard great stuff about it. \nThanks, Valve, for the good ol' days. I'm not expecting you to become the company I used to admire back then. I still love you guys tho because your Steam discounts are just amazing. I know it's far-fetched, but I can only hope that you'd be back as the developer that made these amazing games with compelling stories and characters and very immersive and revolutionary gameplays like Half-Life, Portal, and Left 4 Dead. Please come back. \nBut still, thank you for the good ol' days.","timestamp_created":1639158365,"timestamp_updated":1639158365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105585918","author":{"steamid":"76561199033056475","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1154,"last_played":1639154417},"language":"english","review":"its

Tutto ciò ovviamente ci aiuta a mantenere vivo l'interesse e stimola la curiosità nell'andare avanti con la campagna.\n\nLa trama a mio avviso non è così sorprendente e dunque non la considererei affatto il suo punto forte come poteva essere per il primo.

   优点：第一人称射击，画质优秀，支持4k分辨率，色彩、亮度都不错，贴图质量还可以，npc建模和面部变轻做的不错，04年的游戏这做工比仙剑7还自然，挺无奈的~优化很好，读盘速度稍慢，自动存档，bgm和音效中规中矩，全程中文配音比1代那种60年代译制片好很多，进化到80年代了，还是有很多地方不自然~物理引擎可见Alex的雏形，大部分东西都可以拿起和扔出，载具操控性不错，碰撞感很好，与其他npc或者友军相撞会自动后退，避免卡死好评~小谜题做的不错，比较自然不生硬~备用电源的设计不错，可以水下供氧和提供照明和冲刺跑~重力枪、信息素好评，丰富了作战方式~从第六章开始弹药真缺，主要是携带量太低，总体难度不低~\n    缺点：载具的视角有点低，枪械没有多倍瞄准，但是可以用望远镜，和现在的操作习惯不太一样，但都没太大影响~整体单线剧情，没有支线任务，而且重复性高，两个需要载具的章节就是拖时长~环境和建筑塑造上缺乏未来科技感~\n    总体来说虽然是04年的游戏，但是给了很多其他同类作品很好的指向性，功能性和技术性大于游戏性，没有杀敌的快感，也没有丰富剧情的体验，不推荐~","timestamp_created":1639061839,"timestamp_updated":1639061839,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.435399740934371948","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105521468","author":{"steamid":"76561199072872399","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":201,"last_played":1646313702},"language":"turkish","review":"mükemmel","timestamp_created":1639060770,"timestamp_updated":1639060770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105521393","author":{"steamid":"76561199099716084","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":813,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":771,"last_played":1658078925},"language":"english","review":"amazing
