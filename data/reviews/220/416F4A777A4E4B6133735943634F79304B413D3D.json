I noticed in gamestop half life 2 multiple times, and I thought it looked ridiculous, and then i purchased COD: Black Ops 1.  I found out about Steam through one of my friends back in 2011.  A year later, I decided to give Half Life 2 a try.  I was stunned before the intro ended.  This game gave off such a good vibe to myself that I have never felt in any COD.  The source engine was amazing for its time, and it still is today.  This game seems to include an early version of battlefield's \"levolution\", an example being where you can destroy a whole bridge with some explosives.  This game, along with its predecessor, set the rules and benchmarks for all games following.  I felt many different emotions during this game, such as being excited when in CQB with the combine, and being scared or creeped by the ambient sounds when driving across the coast.  Each level is completely different from the last and the next, but still maintains that strong feel to it.  The weapons are pretty interesting, especially the Gravity Gun.  However, I wish there were more weapons included.  The AI felt real, I felt like I was there with most of the rebels as we fought alongside each other in the street.  If you do not buy this game, you should be ashamed.  This is a true blockbuster, and I am anxious for a sequel.  14/10\n\nSide Note:\nI was interested in making a mod for this game.  I was interested in making a bigger focus on the rebel storyline and commanding squads part of the game, but still having a solo story like Gordon.  However, my Hammer editor for mapping isn't working.  When I click new project, it doesn't show a grid, even though the option for one is selected.  If anyone could help me with mapping, that would be appreciated.

Even today, the game oozes a rich atmosphere that immediately draws you in during the opening sequence and compels you to play to completion.\n\nThe gameplay is engaging throughout, with a variety of weapons that gradually become available to the player, ranging from the series' iconic crowbar to powerful energy-based weaponry. Combat is not all there is to do, however, as the game is littered with puzzles to solve and a treasure trove of secrets to discover.\n\nThe level-design is also unwaveringly immersive. It is difficult to put into words, but each and every \"level\" feels detailed and well thought-out. The relatively horror-oriented Ravenholm stage roughly halfway through the game is a particularly good example of this.\n\nFurthermore, the story is told effectively though both details in the environment and with a small but interesting cast of characters (Dr. Kleiner is my personal favorite). The characters feel particularly \"alive\" thanks to excellent animation for the time along with great writing and voice-acting. A few other reviews on Steam do not recommend Half Life 2 based on the fact that the long-awaited third installment has yet to be released and thus the series lacks a conclusion, but I say it is absolutely worth experiencing Half Life 2's story despite that.\n\nDue to it being revolutionary for its time and a classic that holds up exceptionally well today, Half Life 2 gets my highest possible recommendation.","timestamp_created":1403351110,"timestamp_updated":1532178538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10610106","author":{"steamid":"76561198007211351","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":532,"last_played":1413876662},"language":"english","review":"very fun","timestamp_created":1403350667,"timestamp_updated":1403350667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10608524","author":{"steamid":"76561198117679094","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":784,"last_played":1457545192},"language":"french","review":"juste hate que steam sorte le troisieme volet si il est prévu","timestamp_created":1403348104,"timestamp_updated":1403348104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560000002384185791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10607667","author":{"steamid":"76561198050281603","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15,"last_played":1401449586},"language":"russian","review":"mega","timestamp_created":1403346705,"timestamp_updated":1403346705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10607634","author":{"steamid":"76561198009323068","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1403480010},"language":"russian","review":"This is classic/","timestamp_created":1403346638,"timestamp_updated":1403346638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10605995","author":{"steamid":"76561198015202331","num_games_owned":470,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":400,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":319,"last_played":1412520743},"language":"russian","review":"Игра от Бога)","timestamp_created":1403344246,"timestamp_updated":1403344246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10605678","author":{"steamid":"76561198104116715","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":555,"last_played":1501430904},"language":"russian","review":"zbs","timestamp_created":1403343849,"timestamp_updated":1403343849,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10604340","author":{"steamid":"76561198077708123","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":334,"last_played":1468673221},"language":"spanish","review":"Historia 10/10.
