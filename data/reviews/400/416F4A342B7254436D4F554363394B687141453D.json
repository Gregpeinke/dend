Anyway on with the tests because we get cake as a reward, And who doesn't like cake? You will meet your only friend in the game, A companion cube, which is a meme among the gaming community, I can not tell much more without giving too much spoilers, But it certainly is a great experience.\n\nPortal is a single player game, No offline or online multiplayer capabilities. It is a fairly short game, my first play took a few hours, but when you know the puzzles you can zip through the game in under an hour. There are only 20 levels, and an escape, The first few are hardly puzzles but the later levels are quite challenging for the first time, so it is a bit short but all levels also have extra objectives, Like doing it fast, with the fewest steps and the least amount of shots. \n\nThe graphics hold up pretty nice, For a 2009 game it looks amazing, GLADOS is a pretty funny AI and the stuff it says makes me laugh from time to time, It is certainly is a must play for anyone with a Steam account. It is short but very entertaining.\n\nThe gameplay is very unique, Not much games like it, The whole concept is based on the portals you can fire with your portal gun, 1 portal leads to the other and you conserve momentum going through it. You can build up crazy speeds, then change the exit portal location and fire yourself anywhere actually. It is a very cool concept and it creates very tricky puzzles.\n\nYou can use these Portals however you want, use it for Items, Use it for Enemies, Or use it for yourself, All is pretty much needed, but there is a degree of freedom in how you complete the levels, if you even want to complete the levels, Messing with portals is pretty cool.\n\nI i have to name some negatives, The game feels like a tutorial, you do it in no time. and when you beat the first boss the game has ended, More levels should have been included, but further i can not name any real downsides, It was a great idea, and it is a good challenging fun game, And i would recommend it to everyone. I have to give it a 9 for lack of content.\n\nFollow my Curator Page: \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/35216846/\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Steam Cloud Save[/td]\n\t[td]Working fine[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Controller Support[/td]\n\t[td]Yes, Xbox One Bluetooth Working[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Achievements[/td]\n\t[td]Challenging but doable[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]FPS on Ultra[/td]\n\t[td]Locked to 300[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Launch Command[/td]\n\t[td]gamemoderun %command%[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Issues[/td]\n\t[td]None[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]OS[/td]\n\t[td]Arch Linux[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Kernel[/td]\n\t[td]5.3.1[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]DE[/td]\n\t[td]Gnome 3.34[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]CPU[/td]\n\t[td]Intel I7-6800K @ 4.20Ghz[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]GPU[/td]\n\t[td]Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 (Nvidia 435.21 Drivers)[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]","timestamp_created":1534759415,"timestamp_updated":1570326797,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.680058121681213379","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44266541","author":{"steamid":"76561197970729956","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":878,"last_played":1643299530},"language":"english","review":"The Perect Prequel to an Amazingly Perfect Sequel.\nANyways It's Kinda SHort but the Puzzles will get your brain working.

It follows the story of test subject, Chell has she proceeds through maple tests provided by a AI called GlaDOS. The main gimmick this that Chell has a Portal Gun, a Cannon looking weapon that shoot 2 colors of Portals, Blue and Onnb nb range, to help solve the tests.\n\nEach room gives you a increasing more challenging puzzle the further you progress, making to experiment on the game's physics. Chell's controls pretty well, similar to Gordon Freeman of the Half-Life series, however, unlike Freeman, she cannot sprint, making working on puzzle somewhat slow unless the area has portal surfaces. While Chell's can't sprint, she doesn't take fall damage with her Fall Boots, which is VERY helpful for these types of puzzles\n\nOverall, Portal is a fairly solid puzzle game, with challenging puzzles, fun gameplay, and with some comedy. the only issue I have is that its fairly short. my playthtough only took about 2 hours to complete. I'm not sure if this is because of the game's creative concept of Portals. Lastly, I would recommend this to anyone as its easy to understand and to get hooked, hopefully Valve will make a 3 game as a sequel came out in 2011.","timestamp_created":1534690018,"timestamp_updated":1534690018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44250457","author":{"steamid":"76561198292623452","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":966,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":322,"last_played":1589224585},"language":"english","review":"Its Portal you already know what the frick is going on.

Das Spiel bietet zudem viel Humor und einen tollen Soundtrack.  \nFür Leute den die 8,19€ zu viel sind, sollten auf einen Sale warten. Dann kann man Portal für unter einen Euro schießen.
