This is one of those games where playing with friends can be so fun. Even with randoms there is a good sense of comradery as you battle wave after wave of zeds. Having a break inbetween waves to buy guns and ammo is great - if you can get there in time. Some of the maps are very decent and there is a great deal of modded maps and servers.\n\nA huge amount of dlc available too - my advice would be to grab a huge bundle when on special.
