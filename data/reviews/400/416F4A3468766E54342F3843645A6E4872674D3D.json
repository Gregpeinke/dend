I played it before the release of Portal 2 in 2011, and before I got a Steam account, merely playing it standalone, I can say that much, but the details beyond that are hazy as to when, exactly, I played it. I remember this much, at least: I loved it.\n\nNear 15 years ago now, Valve made a game that still looks decent and feels good that wouldn't feel out of place being made today. Given, it's pretty well on the short side- old hand as I am, and having played through it before, it only took a little over two hours to complete the main story. I think my initial run was more in the 4-6 hour range, as I was so much more curious about all the background bits and hidden story trailed around the levels. There's a lot of it I just outright skipped this time around. I leapt straight past all the strange details, and my memories, vague as they are, solved a few puzzles for me along the way.\n\nBut I can certainly say this: I still enjoyed it. Every bit the brilliant puzzle platformer it was on release in 2007, Portal is a true legend of gaming and one of the highest-rated games on Steam with extremely good reason. Short, but intensely sweet, rich with details, rich with fascinating and- at the time- unique gameplay... Honestly, not much even today can adequately replicate the full range and function of the Portal Gun, a tool made truly legendary, which has been incorporated as a secret item in so many games it would take a week to list them. \n\nYou may only get a less than ten hour experience out of this, even after sampling bonus maps, time trials, and more, but you're more likely to be absolutely delighted by every second of this game than almost any other on the market, even after all this time. I'd recommend this game to almost anyone with at least a little gaming skill, as some of the trickier jump chains can cause difficulty for the inexperienced.","timestamp_created":1648437360,"timestamp_updated":1648437360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112949471","author":{"steamid":"76561198073032446","num_games_owned":310,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1253,"last_played":1613172666},"language":"english","review":"Portal 3 when","timestamp_created":1648434124,"timestamp_updated":1648434124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112947689","author":{"steamid":"76561199070423860","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":140,"last_played":1648487102},"language":"english","review":"Overall: 8/10 [Great]\n\nThis is a fun casual game that is really influential, creative, and funny.

Alzo il volume e capisco come mai sentivo mancasse qualcosa al gioco: la storia. Questa viene raccontata tramite dei dialoghi, che come idea ci può stare, ma non erano sottotitolati. A parte ciò, consiglio questo gioco a tutti gli amanti dei giochi puzzle, e io sono comunque riuscito ad apprezzare il gioco senza conoscere la trama. Inoltre lo mettono quasi sempre in sconto insieme al suo successore che non vedo l'ora di provare.","timestamp_created":1648316369,"timestamp_updated":1648316369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hvnT4/8CdZnHrgM="}
