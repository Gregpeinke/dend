2 — игра на один раз. Зато какой! Отточив перья и логику на первой части, Valve выпустила образцовый сиквел, к которому почти не придраться. Локации масштабнее и разнообразнее, графика — техничнее, повествование — глубже. Основа основ — по-прежнему пушка, создающая два взаимосвязанных портала, правда, механика стала гораздо сложнее.\n\nРаньше мы просто дырявили поверхности, дабы миновать зону обстрела или притащить ящик в нужную точку. Теперь в уравнение добавлена целая охапка параметров. Лазерные лучи и кубические линзы, их преломляющие. Световые мостики для перемещения по воздуху или, если поставить их «ребром», защиты от охранных турелей. Пластина, подбрасывающая объекты. Гравитационные тоннели, которые подхватывают и медленно уносят все, что в них попадает. Три типа гелевой краски: синяя усиливает прыжок, оранжевая здорово ускоряет разбег, белая делает любую плоскость пригодной для открытия портала. (В раннем прототипе был четвертый оттенок, позволявший ходить по стенам и потолкам; его списали в утиль, когда тестеров начало подташнивать.)\n\nИзменений — куча, только Valve не спешит вываливать их разом. Из главы в главу дизайнеры потихоньку переписывают правила, приучая мыслить новыми категориями. Уровни рассчитаны идеально: в меру хитрые, чтобы бросить вызов и растормошить серые клеточки, но без уклона в садизм. В худшем случае вы потратите 15-20 минут на поиски решения, стукнете кулаком о стол и почувствуете себя дураком — ибо ответ лежал перед глазами. В лучшем — порадуетесь, как быстро вы разгрызли еще один кусочек гранита. Portal 2 вообще благосклонна — для каждого многоходового пазла предусмотрены невидимые «чекпойнты»; если допустите фатальную ошибку в миллиметре от победы, вам не придется повторять все с нуля.\n\nОтполирован до блеска и режим совместной игры, чьи звезды — закадычные друзья-роботы P-body и Atlas — заимствовали интерфейсные наработки Left 4 DeadКраткая информация об игре. Радиальное меню команд предлагает на выбор не только веселые жесты, но и полезные функции. Например, целеуказатель, значок «открой мне здесь портал» и таймер (отличная штука, когда нас просят синхронно потянуть два рубильника). Ближе к развязке пригодится клавиша Tab, показывающая в маленьком окошке вид из глаз товарища.","timestamp_created":1425325731,"timestamp_updated":1425325731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499314665794372559","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14727063","author":{"steamid":"76561198049274260","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":875,"last_played":1618609448},"language":"english","review":"recommended - yes\nPrice - one time buy\nContent - 2 hours, x2 friends, x10 speedruns, x10 custom maps\nBest game of it's kind\nQuality - 10/10\nmy rating - 9/10\n\nThis game really makes you think outside the box as well as outside the room that the box is in.","timestamp_created":1425319573,"timestamp_updated":1617018834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14726791","author":{"steamid":"76561198116142184","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3327,"last_played":1525034757},"language":"russian","review":"ty VALVE!","timestamp_created":1425318082,"timestamp_updated":1557750753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14725872","author":{"steamid":"76561198123040185","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2485,"last_played":1638370632},"language":"german","review":"guter zeitvertreib","timestamp_created":1425313743,"timestamp_updated":1425313743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14725208","author":{"steamid":"76561198048901537","num_games_owned":465,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":439,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":439,"last_played":1424209658},"language":"english","review":"I have played through Portal 2 twice now, once on the PS3 and once on the PC, the latter a playthrough occuring a few years later.

Although it has a few years under its belt, the graphics hold up even to the most cutting-edge of 2015 as well and most games would be lucky to run so smoothly while looking so good. Alone the singleplayer experience is worth the pricetag, but the multiplaye co-op nearly doubles the length of the game, makes for even more intense puzzling, and is just as good.
