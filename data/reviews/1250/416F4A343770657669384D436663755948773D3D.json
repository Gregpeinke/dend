И, хотя, полезность их в домашнем хозяйстве довольно сомнительна - это та самая отдушина, через которую многие  и многие люди могут проявить свои самые тёплые чувства к братьям и сёстрам по [strike]разуму[/strike] мозгам. В наш век генетически-модифицированной туалетной бумаги и воды из крана, от которой ломается даже счётчик Гейгера людям не следует забывать о том, к чему приводят подобные эксперименты.\n\nВ этой игре есть сюжет. О нём даже можно почитать. Из описаний карт. Забавный чёрный юмор, слегка подпорченный локаоизацией от 1C . Которая наверное абсолютно всё и всегда делает криво. (Когда будете изучать достижения - поймете. Там увидите и ободранного, и невменяемые названия карт, которые вообще не стоило переводить.) Но в игровом процессе сюжета немного...\n\nKilling Floor - игра, созданная на Unreal Engine 2.5. И по нынешним меркам любителей графодротства может считаться весьма и весьма графически отсталой. Некоторые анимации сделаны весьма коряво, замедление интересно - но не в тот момент, когда перед глазами игрока разлетающиеся ошмётки очередного убитого монстра. Дизайн меню взят один в один из более раннего продукта студии - Red Orchestra и разве что немного подправлен под тематику живых мертвецов. Что же. Это не мешает нажать пунктики \"Сетевая игра\" или \"Одиночная игра\" и двинутся дальше.\n\nЕсть вы, ваша команда - и сотни монстров, которые волна за волной пытаются закусить вашими кишками. Чем больше игроков на карте - тем больше монстров. Но и каждый убитый мутант положит на [strike] аккаунт Steam [/strike] счёт немного денюшек, на которые вы сможете купить себе пушку помощнее. В следующем коротком перекуре между волнами.  А на десерт - дядя Босс. Или попросту - Патриарх. Вместо цепей и тату на пару с жалким пестиком среднестатистического мафиози - у него есть вертолётная пушка и ракетница. А также ножичек для разделки динозавров. Он умеет исчезать в самый неподходящий момент и обладает поистине потрясающим показателем здоровья, который воодушевлённо растёт в зависимости от числа игроков на карте и уровня сложности игры.\n\nЕсть и ролевая система. Около десятка классов, которые сильны в собственных типах оружия и уровень класса - повышая который можно постепенно-постепенно, по мере роста собственного скилла - начинать играть на более сложных и интересных уровнях сложности.\n\nКарт довольно много. И каждый год выходит четыре-пять официальных, приуроченных к праздникам (Рождество, Хэллоуин и летняя распродажа Steam) . Они интересные, разнообразные, но порой однообразные серые и скучные. Хотя праздничные - нет. Но все карты созданы по определённому общему неписанному закону. Вы не сможете нигде почувствовать себя в безопасности.\n\nНу а в целом - зачем столько слов? Добавь виски в свой чай, чтобы было чем заняться по пути в магазин после волны, проверь, исправен ли спусковой механизм, и достаточно ли патронов в пороховицах, и - вперёд.

The only difference is the pace of the player is toned down for fighting off zombies. There are many well-modded servers, a couple gun-games, and hundreds of vanilla servers many with custom map lists (at the time of this posting).  The community made maps are what keep this game fresh. Even so, there are many map-favorites I still come back to. I would only buy this on a sale of 50% off or more. You can live without the DLCs, though the 1st and 3rd weapon packs are neat (though severely overpriced). Overall it is a 7/10. For a game of it's niche: 9/10.","timestamp_created":1387656795,"timestamp_updated":1387656795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8177229","author":{"steamid":"76561198104526129","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2881,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1621648920},"language":"english","review":"This game is Damn and Wow territory","timestamp_created":1387656780,"timestamp_updated":1387656780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501915693283081055","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8176829","author":{"steamid":"76561197999021048","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2109,"last_played":1388273522},"language":"russian","review":"Действительно годная зомбо-мочилово!
