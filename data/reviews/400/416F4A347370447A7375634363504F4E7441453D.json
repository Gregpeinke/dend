Valve's Portal did exceed our expectations back then, when it was released in The Orange Box. It proved itself as a small game but with great potential and held the right to be crowned as the shimmering sapphire of the package. Portal is a game that's about puzzle-solving with an idiosyncratic style; it's simple yet innovative. You have to solve puzzles with a gun, but make no mistake, it isn't an ordinary gun; it's the Portal gun. It creates dual portals that are linked by a speculative structure that alters the physical laws of space and time.\n\nIf you place 2 portals in a room, you can enter one of them and leave through the other portal to find yourself entering the same room, or you could shoot 2 portals one over the other and jump through them to fall infinitely; eventually, you will tap-into terminal velocity. Using the portal gun, you have to solve your way out of the test chambers made by GlaDOS. GlaDOS is the main antagonist of the journey. If I have to define her more, she is the character that makes the entire game a lot more fun and intriguing. She will seduce you with her lively, brilliant, and pretty much attractive speech, even though she is a robot.\n\nPortal's tale is character-driven; this means that Glados, who is narrating the entire game, is the main driving force of the story. The story is simple and enjoyable, but it ensnares our solicitude without giving us more of it. I enjoyed every single moment of the 3.5–hour long campaign the game offers. As short as it is, it provides a memorable experience rather than being lengthy and tedious. If you seek a rough voyage, I recommend giving Portal's advanced chambers a try; you will find what you need there. From a visual perspective, Portal looks good, and its art style matches its atmosphere quite well.\n\n[b]> Verdict:[/b]\n\nI love Portal's idea and the way it was executed. Its gameplay style, sharp-witted humor, and GlaDOS truly are the glistening stars of the game. Portal is a must-own title. It's original, inspiring, and underlines the fact that it only takes a genuine idea to make any product prosperous.\n\n[h1][b][u]Aspects Rating[/u][/b][/h1]\n\n[b]General Quality (60% Overall Score):[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Technical Optimization: 10\n[*]Controls: 10\n[*]Graphics: 7\n[*]Audio: 10\n[*]Soundtrack: 8\n[/list]\n\n[b]Single-player (40% Overall Score):[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Gameplay Satisfaction: 10\n[*]Level Design: 10\n[*]Story: 7\n[*]Narration: 10\n[*]Character Design: 10\n[*]Replay Value: 6\n[/list]\n\n[h1][b][u]Overall Score[/u][/b][/h1]\n\n[quote][b]9[/b][/quote]","timestamp_created":1544124431,"timestamp_updated":1628192913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.723277032375335693","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47329557","author":{"steamid":"76561198411130396","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1576165112},"language":"spanish","review":"hola, recientemente compre el juego portal por un pack que se llamaba the orange box, era un pack de juegos de valve por 4.000 pesos colombianos, yo lo compre por el half-life 2, pero el primer juego que descargue fue portal al ser famoso, yo no sabia nada de el incluso siendo un juego viejo, y me sorprendio, en dos dias logre terminarlo y me gusto mucho, lograban dar la sensasion de estar siendo vigilado y de desconfiansa con la maquina, ubieron niveles que se me complicaron, y otros que no, pero mi parte favorita fue el final, el cual no dire por spoiler, pero me encanto el juego, desde ese dia es mi juego favorito, y estoy listo para comprar portal 2, en mi opinion es un juego muy bien echo, es casi perfecto.","timestamp_created":1544122398,"timestamp_updated":1544122398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47327379","author":{"steamid":"76561198119850787","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":75,"playtime_forever":224,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1565876665},"language":"koreana","review":"1+2합본 추천","timestamp_created":1544113796,"timestamp_updated":1544113796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47325292","author":{"steamid":"76561198194398171","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":267,"last_played":1587161548},"language":"turkish","review":"Güzel oyun.

Так как, в оригинали она уже сразу же говорит и портал открывается в нужный момент. Не много затинул.\n-Сюжет и продолжительность игры довольно таки маленькая когда я в первый раз проходил игру я потратил на нёё 2 дня. На второй раз я прошёл её за 1-2 часа. Да за токое же, время я и Postal 2, смогу пройти только вот, это будет интереснее (С этим я решил долго не затягивать)\n+Графика я не графодрочер но, всё равно графика в игре тоже важна. В Portal 2, она изумительна даже лучшее чем в Left 4 Dead 2,  а она, вышла в 2008 году видны мелкие проработки и т.д\n+Сама идея, головоломки потрясающяя Valve, смогли докозать то, что головоломки можно сделать интересными главное найти правильный подхот и тогда всё получится.\nИтог: игра годная хоть в неё и есть пара минусов но, всё равно я люблю эту игру.

All you need is a portal gun, a little bit of physics, and (if you’re me) a nice helping of luck.\n\n• There are a lot of tricks to learn and the game does a great job of teaching you the techniques and controls without feeling like you’re being handheld through a tutorial.\n\n• The levels get more complicated in a very intuitive way, and they continue to be more difficult without being impossible. I only had to reference a walk-through once, and it turned out I was doing the right thing just not at exactly the right time. Any other time I got frustrated I would turn the game off and come back, and with a clear head managed to solve things quickly.\n\n• It is both funny and incredibly creepy.\n\n• The setting is really well done and very dynamic, and there are probably multiple ways to get through the levels which lets you get creative.\n\nCONS\n\n• There was one point where the game auto-saved in the middle of me doing something really stupid so I got into a cycle of dying over and over again. I’d suggest doing a manual save in one of the other save slots periodically in case the auto-save gets weird. But to be fair, that is probably true for most games with an auto-save feature.\n\nThis is a must play for anyone who likes puzzle and/or escape room games and is looking for something with a bit of an overall plot, unique gameplay, and challenges that really make you think.\n\nI bought this game and Portal 2 for about $4 in the black Friday sale and it's worth paying full price.","timestamp_created":1543633081,"timestamp_updated":1543633161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47221936","author":{"steamid":"76561198093297413","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":143,"last_played":1650511561},"language":"english","review":"Great game and story !!!","timestamp_created":1543629063,"timestamp_updated":1543629063,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47221512","author":{"steamid":"76561198224039716","num_games_owned":788,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":345,"last_played":1545572645},"language":"latam","review":"Magnifico Juego !
