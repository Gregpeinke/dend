Neither game has any kind of learning curve and either one can be picked up by any gamer at a moment's notice.\n\nPortal 2 features a sarcastically humorous story facilitated by a series of increasingly challenging puzzles intermixed with guided exploration. The sceneric and musical artwork of the game is immersive and engaging while the soundtrack is highly adapted to the various moods evoked by the plot. The music alone is worth half the price of the game, is available separately, and is a fine addition to any library.\n\nDespite the games magnificence, it has minimal replay value. Though highly immersive, the story is concise and the puzzles are predefined. Aside from perfecting one's performance in a singular set of puzzles and hunting for easter eggs, one can expect a non-varied experience between playthroughs.\n\nBecause of the length and overall quality of the game, Portal 2 is well worth its price. Playing Portal, this game's predecessor, is recommended but not at all necessary for a complete experience.\n\nDue to the sarcastic and cynical nature of the game's humor, this game is not ideally suited for the youngest of audiences. Despite this, both Portal games manage the delicate feat of being tremendously friendly to players who have never held a controller before while remaining challenging to those who have been gaming their entire lives.","timestamp_created":1315286481,"timestamp_updated":1470189796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2802193","author":{"steamid":"76561198012837523","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":3549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2798,"last_played":1598731941},"language":"english","review":"horrible","timestamp_created":1315280703,"timestamp_updated":1315280703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17181","author":{"steamid":"76561197960377915","num_games_owned":443,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":510,"last_played":1313478000},"language":"english","review":"Worthy successor to the first Portal.","timestamp_created":1315275857,"timestamp_updated":1315275857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1022242","author":{"steamid":"76561197984629010","num_games_owned":336,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":2823,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2823,"last_played":1339398000},"language":"english","review":"Very good game.

Einige Zeit nach Release kamen dann von Fans erstellte Testkammern (noch weit vor der Einführungs des Workshops), welche Valve mit einem ins Spiel gepatchten Tool unterstützte und die Erstellung solcher Custom Maps vereinfachte.

Also almost any age. \n\nTo truly understand the stoy line I also recommend you play the first Portal, you wont regret playing that game either, and it is a great warm up for Portal 2! \n\nDo it get it NOW!

It's all been said. Every criticism, every praise, every moment has been dissected, disseminated, upheld, and lambasted. There's no point in discussing media which was overmined, overhyped, overdismissed, and underwhelming months before its release. The game was doomed from the get go as a conversational piece. They tried to make it less quotable, less driven by one-liners, less meme-able, less reduced to a single out-of-context t-shirt exclamation but it was futile. You cannot stop viral marketing. You cannot stop fanbases. You cannot stop, period. We've entered an era where it's better to toil in obscurity, better for yourself to never know the joy of people enjoying your work, never to know the horror of people taking your work and wearing it like a signifier of some vague, consumption-driven cultural identity. Every fan, every kind word, every compliment portends the downfall of your creative drive.\n\nThe puzzles were too easy 7/10","timestamp_created":1313456775,"timestamp_updated":1313456775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49fuH6LECdL7fBQ=="}
