Visuals are really pretty and the lighting is pleasing to look at. The story is can be confusing and convoluted at times since talking a lot about alternate universes and timelines (try not to overthink it) but nonetheless I had a blast playing through it and once again like typical BioShock fashion it has a very nice plot twist. It can feel clunky or rather stiff while playing but nothing game breaking in my experience. One of the best parts of the game is definitely the character interactions and voice acting, and can sometimes even feel pretty cinematic. Depending on the difficulty you choose the enemies in the game can feel like bullet sponges and requires good use of your plasmids.. I mean vigors. Some weapons like the sniper rifle take more time to get used to because of how non-fluid it feels while other weapons are just overpowered. All said, BioShock Infinite is a great addition to this franchise and I would absolutely recommend playing it if you are a fan of the series to get the full experience.","timestamp_created":1599495708,"timestamp_updated":1599495708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75603638","author":{"steamid":"76561198097856891","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":819,"last_played":1612546172},"language":"english","review":"Amazing level design and character building.

My only regret is coming to this game so late.\nSome of the \"levels\" can be a little bit tricky to wrap your head around, due to the nature of traversing Colombia, but those moments are few and never game-breaking. Only really an issue for those of us compelled to explore every nook and cranny.\nThe Vigors that replace the Plasmids of the first two games don't feel as... crucial. I barely used them for most of my playthrough, often forgetting I had them. The pace of this game is quicker and, as such, firearms tend to get you further.\nThe story is where this game really shines, it's truly incredible. It never felt like it was dragging, like I said the pace is pretty quick and it keeps your attention throughout. This is not the kind of game where you often find yourself forgetting your objective, your overall purpose. Instead it drives you consistently and keeps you invested.\nThis is greatly aided by the superb voice acting and animations of the important characters. Unlike previous Bioshock games, whose cutscenes tended to feel a little wooden and relied more upon the various audio diaries scattered throughout the world, the NPCs feel alive and the frequent \"quiet drama sections\" tend to be the more enjoyable parts, as more of this narrative gets pieced together.\nAll in all, great game. 10/10, if you love narrative single player experiences you can't go wrong here.","timestamp_created":1599486632,"timestamp_updated":1599486632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75595736","author":{"steamid":"76561198403638250","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":794,"last_played":1599485373},"language":"schinese","review":"亏欠你的，以命相还吧，伊莉莎白[spoiler]我的安娜[spoiler]","timestamp_created":1599485513,"timestamp_updated":1599485578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75593826","author":{"steamid":"76561199087260419","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":294,"last_played":1632112258},"language":"schinese","review":"很不错","timestamp_created":1599482558,"timestamp_updated":1599482558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75593822","author":{"steamid":"76561198968747297","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":462,"last_played":1599880711},"language":"schinese","review":"神队友啊真的，太喜欢伊丽莎白了","timestamp_created":1599482548,"timestamp_updated":1599482548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75592097","author":{"steamid":"76561198037398077","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":115,"playtime_forever":640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":640,"last_played":1599479609},"language":"schinese","review":"玩久了以后会让人严重不适，头晕反胃","timestamp_created":1599479636,"timestamp_updated":1599479636,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75591841","author":{"steamid":"76561198318311358","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1096,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1009,"last_played":1612727258},"language":"spanish","review":"el mejor jueguito que jugué","timestamp_created":1599479145,"timestamp_updated":1599479145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4otyYtPQCcYquoAI="}
