It’s an extension to the story so if you played Half-Life 2 you need to get this to continue the plot with that it’s pretty much the same game with some new enemies and locations. Definitely has some scary vibes at times and intense in several other occasions as well pretty fun and short. \n\n+Not even $10 and is practically free on sale\n+Kinda short about 1-2 hours long much shorter than Half-Life 2 and Episode 2\n+Lots of intense moments having to kill endless waves of zombies waiting for an elevator in the dark, lead civilians through combine infested warehouses, infinite antlion spawns, etc. just a lot of intense moments and fun gameplay.\n+2 new enemies\n+Main menu gives a nice recap and explanation of the current situation\n+Get to used the upgraded gravity gun again\n+Lots of zombies, lots of darkness and scary moments definitely has a bit of a creepy/horror vibe to the portion after the citadel. Which is even better when you’re in pitch black corridors with no lights and your flashlight is limited.\n+Cool ending and final boss\n+Alyx has limited health making you have to protect her yet again making the gameplay more intense at times, also her AI pathing is nice as she’ll always seem to catch up to you if you run ahead unlike most NPCs who walk like a legless grandma. Also she kills enemies really fast which is always awesome.\n+Steam cloud\n\n\n-Although Dr.Kleiner's explanation on the main menu is nice it would also be nice if you could mute or pause him as he never shuts up and is on loop\n-Remote Play doesn’t work there is no multiplayer aspect to this game not even local multiplayer\n-Buying this game gives you Half-Life 2 Deathmatch for free which is a separate game bundled along with this. The multiplayer for that is completely dead as you can expect for a pointless multiplayer released over a decade ago. It’s just not worth playing whatsoever because it’s completely dead. Would be nice if you could opt out of getting it bundled and only buy the episode. \n\nI really liked this Half-Life. Just the dark and creepy zombie infested areas with Alyx was really cool and the game has a lot of intense moments. Not very long which is nice but kinda wish it was a bit longer. The combine section near the end gets somewhat tiresome but the ending makes up for it and is pretty cool. A nice conutionation a stupid game bundled along with it yes mate.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1372983076,"timestamp_updated":1623817254,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"352397","author":{"steamid":"76561197969401692","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1652825746},"language":"french","review":"Excellente suite de Half Life 2 qui n'a pas pris une ride","timestamp_created":1372886797,"timestamp_updated":1372886797,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1322892","author":{"steamid":"76561197991392340","num_games_owned":333,"num_reviews":113,"playtime_forever":261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1389260270},"language":"english","review":"one of the greatest games of all time","timestamp_created":1372278569,"timestamp_updated":1372278569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4412714","author":{"steamid":"76561198036736878","num_games_owned":483,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":23,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1365058800},"language":"koreana","review":"말이 필요없지 이건..","timestamp_created":1372170983,"timestamp_updated":1372170983,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1791215","author":{"steamid":"76561197998046529","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":100,"playtime_forever":1147,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":625,"last_played":1561905192},"language":"english","review":"Made by God: 2 Episode One.","timestamp_created":1372051261,"timestamp_updated":1372051261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5549728","author":{"steamid":"76561198051748594","num_games_owned":379,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":337,"last_played":1375096804},"language":"german","review":"Half-Life 2 Episode One ist eine gut Ergänzung die die Handlung weiterführt\nIch werde hier nicht unbedingt viel schreiben weil ich das Hauptspiel bereits empfohlen habe.\nSTORY:\nDie Handlung fängt etwas iritierend an, was abr später erklärt wird.

The problem is that this game took only 3 hours for me to finish and achievements are pretty poor too. Still it succeeded in its most important goal and that is continuation of epic Half-Life story.","timestamp_created":1367672444,"timestamp_updated":1385405671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4683023","author":{"steamid":"76561198040727226","num_games_owned":677,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":465,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":233,"last_played":1390608980},"language":"english","review":"A short but great game that follows up nicely on the story Valve wove in Half-Life 2.","timestamp_created":1366765538,"timestamp_updated":1366765538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6902116","author":{"steamid":"76561198078941339","num_games_owned":574,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":323,"last_played":1405439862},"language":"english","review":"Episode One is a direct sequel to Half life 2 , you start trying to escape City 17 which is your goal, but what I feel it is meant to develop your relationship with Alyx  as you don't fully see her personality in the original and what suprises me is although it is still technicially Half Life 2 but it isn't the same gameplay as the original its more of a horror focused and Alyx along as a sidekick the battles are larger , puzzles harder and the A.I. smarter. Although I wanted too play more its just 3 hours long but doesn't lack in story or gamplay...","timestamp_created":1366300714,"timestamp_updated":1366300714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4900942","author":{"steamid":"76561198043056317","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":316,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1401994175},"language":"german","review":"Eins der besten spiele","timestamp_created":1366294065,"timestamp_updated":1366294065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2156939","author":{"steamid":"76561198003181815","num_games_owned":264,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1365663600},"language":"english","review":"Even more of one of the best games ever\n","timestamp_created":1365656357,"timestamp_updated":1365656357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iMnd+70Ce5idCA=="}
