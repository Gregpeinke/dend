Well, to be honest, I forgot I had even bought this game, and it sat in my library for the longest time. Then I played it, and it is a game that I cannot put down.\n\nIndividually, the game seems absurdly simply. Graphics are okay, nothing special, controls are simple, weapon choices, while fun at times, are rather linear, but this game takes individual factors that work okay in other games, and mashes them together, making them even better.\n\nImagine if you will a co-op style horde mode, similar to Left 4 Dead, complete with your basic and advanced hordes, add in class mechanics that improve the usage of certain weapons, but do not limit you in any way (A Sharpshooter is not limited to pistols and rifles, a Commando is not limited to assault rifles), plus some added strategy (Where you make your stand in each wave and where you fortify your defenses can often mean the difference between victory and defeat) and a pretty decent difficulty curve.\n\nThe only downside I can think of is that the game is explicitly made to be played multiplayer co-op. I'm no ace, but I'm rather good at FPSs, and I have trouble playing on Normal difficulty alone. I personally don't do matchmaking, because I dislike the idea of having to rely upon a bunch of strangers who I don't know to have some modicum of intelligence and as I don't have a headset, communication would be a problem, but I suspect if I'm able to play this game with some friends, it could be some of the most fun I've had in a while.\n\nSummary Rating: 8/10\n\nThere's a lot here, and it's a really fun game, with a lot of different ways to play. You can even switch between roles mid game if you feel a flamethrower might do the job better than an assault rifle, or something like that. My only real problem doesn't have to do with the graphics or anything like that, but a few other gripes, primarily the linearity of gin upgrades in each category, and the multiplayer focused design. Having good multiplayer is outstanding, but making it near impossible to play alone on higher difficulties is kind of a low blow. Anyway, good game, definitely recommend, hope to play with other people in the future.","timestamp_created":1403160523,"timestamp_updated":1403160523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10522430","author":{"steamid":"76561198051769112","num_games_owned":311,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6779,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6123,"last_played":1428459059},"language":"english","review":"One of the few games with fluidity; easy to pick up and learn in one match.","timestamp_created":1403158104,"timestamp_updated":1403158104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10522378","author":{"steamid":"76561197976954970","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":158,"last_played":1401102524},"language":"german","review":"Wenn man mit Freunden spielen will, dann steht man (oder zumindest ich...und ich bin nicht gerade blöd was diese Sachen betrifft) vor der unlösbaren Aufgabe sich zu vernetzen.

But even with its lack of plot, I find Killing Floor to be a fun and challenging game.\n\n   In Killing Floor you play in first person, possibly with friends, fighting nine different kinds of specimens that roam the map looking for people to kill, becoming more numerous and releasing different specimens as the waves go by until waves 10 (if you are playing a full game) you encounter the boss, the Patriarch, who has the combined abilities of all the other specimens. Most of the regular specimen are easy to kill, with either a head shot or a shot close up with a shot gun blast to one shot them, but if someone yells Flesh Pound (FP), get some ground and prepare for a grinder.\n\n   There are seven different classes (called Perks), Field medic, Support specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Berserker, Firebug and Demolition which all specialize in different weapons and abilities. Also, The game has a leveling system, which varies between the different perks, mostly based off the weapons use. Such as the Sharpshooter building levels on head shots with pistols, rifles and crossbows. Having a higher level brings down the cost of weapons and increase their efficiency, which makes you start at the lower difficulties to work your way through the level to beat the harder difficulties.\n\n   Over all I love playing Killing Floor with friends and will keep playing for years to come.","timestamp_created":1402886610,"timestamp_updated":1402886610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558823525905609131","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10488768","author":{"steamid":"76561198095209402","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":36,"playtime_at_review":4412,"last_played":1660342712},"language":"english","review":"This
