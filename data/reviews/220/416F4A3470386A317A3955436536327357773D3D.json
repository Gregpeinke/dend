Klasse.\nBeim Storytelling wird komplett auf Zwischensequenzen oder ähnliches verzichtet. Das sorgt dafür dass man sich besser mit der Spielfigur (Gordon Freeman) identifizieren kann, nervig wird diese Erzählweise erst wenn man das Spiel ein zweites mal durchspielt, da man Gespräche nicht überspringen kann.\n\nDie Grafik setzte damals neue Maßstäbe und ist auch heute noch sehr ansehnlich. \nWer das Spiel mit einer etwas aufgehübschten Grafik spielen möchte, sucht im Shop am besten nach \"Half-Life 2 Update\".\nDie Update Version kann man sich nach dem Kauf von Half-Life 2 komplett kostenlos runterladen.\n\n[b]Fazit: Half-Life 2 sollte man gespielt haben - das Spiel hat immerhin ein komplettes Genre geprägt! - Meisterwerk[/b]","timestamp_created":1467565092,"timestamp_updated":1480777104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.636230051517486572","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24052918","author":{"steamid":"76561198115611191","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":726,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":726,"last_played":1467561955},"language":"polish","review":"Bardzo zarąbista gierka.

Featuring exhilarating action, dynamic and interactive environments/levels, great writing and characters, and good music (although some music is the same from the first Half-Life, but that can be forgiven.).\n\n20 years after the events of the first Half-Life, Gordon Freeman, your character, is awoken from his stasis, only to find a world that is ruled by an alien species, the Combine. After having a few run-ins with the Combine and meeting a great cast of characters, some of whom are returning characters, Gordon is given a crowbar and this is really where the game begins.\n\nAlong the way, you'll find non-stop action, jumpscares and extremely unexpected moments, great dialogue and character development. I'll say it now that the action keeps me on the edge of my seat and I also appreciate the dialogue. I still remember the first time I wandered into Ravenholm. Scariest video game experience up until that point in my life.\n\nOverall, Half-Life 2 is quite possibly one of the best video game sequels of all time. Everything from the first game was improved. However, the ending is bittersweet and leaves you wishing for a little more. In that case, you're in luck because there are 2 episodes of Half-Life 2 that take place after this. Half-Life 2 is a 10/10 and a glowing recommendation from me.","timestamp_created":1467482634,"timestamp_updated":1564179005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24022162","author":{"steamid":"76561198288190181","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":714,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":714,"last_played":1467479683},"language":"russian","review":"11/10","timestamp_created":1467479728,"timestamp_updated":1467479728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24016774","author":{"steamid":"76561198246122870","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1612538867},"language":"turkish","review":"EFSANE bu oyun efsane cidden şimdi alın beyler gecikmeyin","timestamp_created":1467467929,"timestamp_updated":1467467929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24016500","author":{"steamid":"76561198067427903","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1637924925},"language":"english","review":"Wake up, Mr. Freeman.","timestamp_created":1467467228,"timestamp_updated":1619699523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516152858734130859","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24015687","author":{"steamid":"76561198130038370","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":98,"playtime_forever":2108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1168,"last_played":1629068393},"language":"brazilian","review":"Lindo, fenomenal, jogabilidade ótima, cenários e ambientação perfeitos, armas legais e diversificadas, inimigos bem feitos e amedrintadores, diálogos lindos, história fantástica.

The gameplay, movement and shooting feels solid and great and I can see why games today were based off this, the enviroment looks great but progessing through the story is interupted by stupid physics based puzzles and long drawn out areas.\n \nGordon freeman I find as a protagonist in gaming is stupid. first of all him being a silent protagonist is dumb considering the amount of NPC's that talk to him. it was ok for the first game because it was a survival horror and him being a silent protagonist makes sense because you can project yourself onto him but in this game it doesn't work as this story has a little more happening with NPC's and gordon being silent takes you out of the game, especially when NPC's are furthing the plot and you're in the backgroud throwing shit around and standing on things like an idiot being a weirdo and that's completely up to you lol but still though in the context of this game gordon is just strange.\nnext is gordon being this jesus/super soilder. G-man put gordon in stasis after the events of HL1 and during the start of half life 2 10 years later G-man pulls him out as he has gordon do other things. gordon is not this trained mercenary in fact from gordons point of view he is still fresh from the black masa incident and that is why I call BS.\n\nI would not reccomend this game myself but I would say try it out and see what you think as a piece of gaming history.","timestamp_created":1467384128,"timestamp_updated":1467904478,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.346648305654525757","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23986177","author":{"steamid":"76561198081814867","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":355,"last_played":1492420715},"language":"schinese","review":"经典游戏\n不过我害怕猎头蟹和剧毒蜘蛛","timestamp_created":1467383441,"timestamp_updated":1467383441,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23985925","author":{"steamid":"76561198135118331","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":611,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":586,"last_played":1486243110},"language":"english","review":"Best story game there is....","timestamp_created":1467382801,"timestamp_updated":1467382801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23985277","author":{"steamid":"76561198193987181","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":4941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1590,"last_played":1657639993},"language":"russian","review":"тупая эгра. мне понравилосб","timestamp_created":1467381224,"timestamp_updated":1467381224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23983979","author":{"steamid":"76561198287158019","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":727,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":85,"last_played":1469127203},"language":"english","review":"A fun game","timestamp_created":1467377857,"timestamp_updated":1603224027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23981526","author":{"steamid":"76561197971921575","num_games_owned":452,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":514,"last_played":1578191932},"language":"english","review":"The game that revolutionised the FPS genre with its amazing physics engine and it's amazing gameplay.

Also, don't worry about whether or not your computer can run it, as it rarely crashes, and runs on most PCs quite well. (Take it from me, my PC can't even run CS:GO properly!)

It had great physics and along with that fun and yet challenging physics puzzles, cool and unique weapons, good mix of horror and gore, last but not least it had a VERY intriguing story line that i cant seem to understand but yet it still only draws me in more.  \n\nCON\nif i had to nitpick at the game that i just said i'd recommend, it would only be a few things. one being more physics objects to mess around with, not that there were not plenty but more never hurt. Also the ingame loading screens did break the flow even if it was only for a second or two, however i did find it usefull to know i just had an autosave and i could be a little more risky.\n The main complaint i have with this game and some how hypocritically it was one of my favorite parts is the story line.
