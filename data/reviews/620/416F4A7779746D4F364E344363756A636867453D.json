Нет. Но и посредственно получиться, разумеется не может. Ведь как и прежде работали настоящие профи. Существенно расширенный сюжет, большее количество действующих персонажей, усиленный упор на юмор, дополнительные геймплейные возможности и гвоздь номера - кооператив. Всего этого хватает с головой. \n\n\"Portal\" прежде всего поражал своей реализацией одной единственной идеи - портала. Как это было сделано, как умно и интересно игралось, твердо держится в памяти до сих пор. Вторая часть в этом плане больше похожа на надстройку капитального сооружения. Надстройку огромную, дорогую, но не более. Масштабность всех событий лишь кажется гигантской. Все, что происходит вокруг вас только декорации, а главное действие всегда развивается в рамках тех же старых добрых условий и правил, камерных комнатах для испытаний с проверенной и заученной логикой. Выйти за границу самой себя у \"Portal 2\" не получается. Играть потрясающе интересно, но отсутствует эффект новизны, что сильно сказывается на итоговом и окончательном впечатлении.\nВсе переворачивается с ног на голову, когда вы зовете на помощь друга. Продолжение гениальной головоломки предстает в новом образе, кооперативном. Решать сложные пазлы вдвоем крайне интересно. \nГлавная ошибка при прохождение второй части - проглотить ее за один раз. Растяните удовольствие на несколько вечеров, понемногу проваливаясь в это приключение с изменяемой гравитацией, синими и оранжевыми жидкостями, Glados-картошкой и веселым долговязым напарником в роли экспериментального робота.
