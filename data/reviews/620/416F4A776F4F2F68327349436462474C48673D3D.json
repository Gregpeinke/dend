Используя портал-ган, игрок «выстреливает» по двум пригодным для создания портала поверхностям, создавая квантовую аномалию, позволяющую ему мгновенно перемещаться между двумя точками пространства или, если быть точным, связывать эти две точки пространства.\n\n\nВсё предельно просто\nСюжет чем-то напоминает сюжет серии Кубиниады и Пилы, где главный герой (тян по имени Челл) непонятно зачем, под чутким руководством немного садистского суперкомпьютера GLaDOS (AI женского пола, на которую персонал лаборатории добровольно-принудительно переложил обязанности испытания порталганов, за что GLaDOS отблагодарила своих создателей) рискует своим здоровьем и жизнью ради науки и на благо всего прогрессивного человечества (или той части, что ещё живы). Слава Роботам!\nСама игра, как и всё семейство Халфы, часто ставится в противовес бездушным YOBA-подобным шутерам, вроде Крузиса, как эталон хорошей, годной бегалки. Хотя она и не идеальна. У первой части есть один существенный недостаток: игра короткая. Нет, игра ПИЗДЕЦ какая короткая. Она настолько короткая, что это даже вызывает когнитивный диссонанс. Главный ограбитель считает, что такой же недостаток есть и у второй части.\nЧелл, как и Аликс, катастрофически отличается от стереотипной героини, которые обычно непонятно для чего больше предназначены — для игры или для фапа. Напротив, столь дешёвой популярности наша героиня и её создатели не ищут, в силу чего выглядит она так, как и положено при её сюжетном положении — страшненькая, растрёпанная и с окаменевшим от ахуя и сосредоточенности щячлом.
