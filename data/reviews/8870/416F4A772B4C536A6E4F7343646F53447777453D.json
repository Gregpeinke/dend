The main game being around nine hours felt far too short for me, because I enjoyed every moment of it. I quite like the combat, felt pretty nice and the story is exceptional. It's a massive brain-fuck to say the least, but I love stories like that. The characters are great, and it's a great follow-up to the previous games.

(Adem√°s se aprecia mucho gracias a la buena optimizaci√≥n de las texturas)\nLos diarios de voz me parecen mucho menos interesantes que en anteriores entregas, ya que no me parecen tan necesarios para contar la historia en la cual el personaje que manejamos tiene voz y decisi√≥n propia. Antes era el √∫nico m√©todo de enterarnos sobre la trama.\nElizabeth a diferencia de muchas basuras (Ashley de RE) es una gran acompa√±ante que me salv√≥ en muchas oportunidades, y ya al terminar la aventura se siente parte del equipo.\nNo use ning√∫n binocular en todo el juego, otra mec√°nica que parece solo para decorar los escenarios que quedaron vac√≠os.\nPD: las armas VOX son

Infinite[/h1]\n\n[h1]\"Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt.\"[/h1]\n\n[h1]Introduction:[/h1]\nAhh, Bioshock Infinite. Don't really know where to begin with this game. I'll begin with the fact and yes I know that this may be an unpopular opinion but I don't care. I play games and I review them accordingly to how I enjoyed them. I first played Bioshock Infinite when it came out in 2013, those were the days when I was still a console gamer and not a PC gamer. I was excited to play Bioshock Infinite because reason number one. A new setting and reason number two. New Bioshock game. I was and still am a huge Bioshock fan but in my personal opinion. Infinite is not a good game. Not bad in terms of I would never recommend you to play it but bad in terms because it starts out great but then it takes a downfall which I will explain later down the line.\n\nThe setting you're in this time isn't an underwater metropolis set in the late 1950s but instead, you're sent to a flying city set in the 1912s. The city of Columbia was once apart of the United States, it was commissioned by the United States government and founded by Zachary Hale Comstock as a symbol of American political and religious ideals. but later secluded itself from the United States, becoming an independent country like state and flying off to into the clouds to never be seen again. The city of Columbia is a heavily political and religious city where Science and Religion work together in harmony. It's a symbol of American history, religious ideals, and marvelous scientific wonders.\n\n[h1]The Story:[/h1]\nThe game is set in the year 1912. You play as Booker Dewitt, a former U.S Soldier who served in the 7th Cavalry Regiment and participated in the Battle of Wounded Knee. Although Booker was seen as a hero to his fellow soldiers, Booker felt shame and regret for his part in the massacre. After the battle, Booker, fraught with guilt, attended a river baptism led by a Preacher to be reborn as a new man and be absolved of his past actions. At the last second, Booker rejected his baptism, thinking that his sins could not be washed away by a \"dunk in the river.\" Booker later became a Pinkerton agent. In 1912, due to heavy gambling and drinking. Booker fell into debt. Given a chance to pay off his debts and to be a free man yet again he was given an offer by a mysterious figure. He was to travel to a mysterious city in the clouds and to rescue a girl trapped in the tower and bring her to New York City unharmed in order to clear his debts. Your story starts off on a rickety boat just off the coast of Maine. \n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n‚óè Beautiful setting\n‚óè Intriguing city build-up history\n‚óè Enjoyable combat\n‚óè Tons of different vigors  [b](Return To Sender is my favorite. Vigors are the Plasmids of Bioshock Infinite.)[/b]\n\n‚óè Unique and very stylish enemy design\n‚óè Stunning graphics [b](Even in 2019 the graphics are still amazing looking.)[/b]\n‚óè Steam Achievements\n‚óè Steam trading cards\n‚óè Steampunk like weapons [b](This game takes place in 1912 but the technology in Columbia is a lot more advanced for the time, you have machine guns that resemble the MP18, you have semi-automatic rifles that resemble an early M1 Carbine or even a handheld Gatling gun. There is a lot of interesting weapons in the flying city of Columbia to be found.)[/b]\n\n‚óè Very well optimized\n‚óè Soundtrack\n‚óè Level design\n‚óè Gameplay [b](The gameplay is really good. In most areas, you are given basically a giant playground in which you can use many of the stationed equipment or even open up flanking routes by using the skyline. You can use the skyline to strike enemies and then run off and do it again, you can just go full guns blazing and vigor blazing. There is a lot of options when it comes to the gameplay in Infinite.)[/b]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n‚óè Story [b](A lot of people might tell you just how amazing this story is but to me personally. It was never good, this isn't an opinion I formed just now this has been my opinion since the game came out and I played it. The story throughout the first third of the game is incredibly interesting and intriguing, and then as soon as you need to free a weaponsmith (ANYONE who has played the game knows what I'm talking about) it just starts its descent into a convoluted mess. The game's story tries to confuse the gamer with unnecessary plot complexity in order to seem more grandiose than it really was. As soon as you start a story involving dimensions beyond the fourth dimension it becomes really difficult to keep a story focused and poignant. They should have had just stuck with the main setting and not involve any kind of dimension traveling. It would of have been a much more compelling and intriguing story than the mess that it is. Stories that mess around with time travel are at risk of plot holes. A story that messes around with the multiverse theory is doomed to have an infinite number of plot holes which Infinite has plenty off.)[/b]\n\n‚óè 2 Weapon limit [b](In the previous games you were allowed to carry all of your weapons, Bioshock Infinite drops all pretense of a survival game by giving you a two weapon limit, (like Halo), this small decision turned the game from the survival shooter into an action shooter. It personally didn't bother me as much but there were some instances where I was a bit annoyed. Why they changed the weapon limit is a good question.)[/b]\n\n‚óè No visible weapons upgrades [b](In the previous Bioshock games, whenever you upgraded your weapons in the power station, you would get a visible upgrade on your weapons. A very nice little feature that I sincerely very much appreciated. This feature is non-existent in Infinite. There is still weapon upgrading but they are simply stat boosts and very boring ones at that. No more unique and fun weapon upgrades.)[/b]\n\n‚óè Ending [b](Now I could have had included this segment in the story con but this deserves its own con. The ending just like the story is convoluted as f**k. I will be using this word a lot in this review because it is the best word to describe this story and ending. Sometimes when I finish a game I will watch a video that explains the ending fully 100% in case I might have missed some stuff or so that I can get a better understanding of the ending. With Infinite, I had to watch a 10+ minute video just to understand the ending because the ending is so damn convoluted and complex to the point where your brain will shut down because it won't be able to comprehend the information the game is trying to tell you. Yea it's like that.)[/b]\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nBioshock Infinite is a mixed bag for me. I really liked the gameplay and the setting. The story starts out very interesting and intriguing but slowly spirals into a muddled complex mess and because of the story. The ending gets affected really badly. Ken Levine thought he was making a good engaging story but in the end. He made a puzzling bag of s**t that will require you to have an IQ of 1000 to understand. I have played games and watched movies that used the alternate dimension as a plot point and made it a much better and compelling as well as easy to understand plot than Bioshock Infinite did. To Bioshock fans I would give this a go, you might like it or you might not like it. For anyone who is looking for an engaging story then I advise you to skip this as the story sets out really well but as I said earlier spirals down into a puzzling mess. You will have a hard time understanding the story unless you study at Harvard University. But even with the terrible story, the game is still a good play if you're looking to explore a beautiful city with a fascinating history. \n\n[h1]Overall rating 6/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1560123823,"timestamp_updated":1603043276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614479959011077881","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51143373","author":{"steamid":"76561198072398496","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":2428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2428,"last_played":1450475024},"language":"english","review":"I really do not know how I feel about [i]Bioshock: Infinite[/i]. I am a huge fan of the first game, and kind of like the second one, but the third one is really a mystery to me. Let me elaborate.\n\nFor the most part, [i]Bioshock: Infinite[/i] is a good game. The game mechanics are solid and I think that the plasmids (vigors in this game) are the most creative and best they have been. The game is also gorgeous, with its huge cities floating above the clouds and the detail that was put into almost every aspect of this game. But then I look to what I don't like about the game. I really think it was a bad choice to limit the player to only two weapons. Because of this choice, most of the time I am stuck with an assault rifle or shotgun because they are the most versatile weapons. If there are big groups of enemies or an enemy with a large health bar then I would usually pull out a rocket launcher, but because of the weapon limit and how few rockets I could carry most of the time I wouldn't bother carrying one around with me. Also, this game has weapon upgrades which only allow you to upgrade one weapon (much like the first two games), but because of the weapon limit, why would I want to upgrade more than one or two weapons? All of these factors severely limit player choice and make every encounter with an enemy feel the same. Instead of looking forward to fighting my next big daddy, like in the first two games, I loathe fighting the big daddy equivalents in this game. Their large health pools and the limited amount of ammunition that I have means that I have to resort to hiding behind cover and waiting for their attack animation to end.\n\nNext, I have to talk about the story. I will not spoil anything major and will be very vague with most things. The story in this game is actually pretty good on first glance. The first time I played through the game I thought to myself, \"Ken Levine, you've done it again,\" but on repeat playthroughs I though to myself, \"Wait, how does that work?\" The story can be very muddled and confused at times and the main theme of the game is not super interesting. \n\nWith all this said, I do not recommend this to fans of the first game, but some value may be found for people who like fps games.","timestamp_created":1560107906,"timestamp_updated":1584707999,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51142131","author":{"steamid":"76561198067005331","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":743,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":743,"last_played":1560102207},"language":"english","review":"lulw","timestamp_created":1560103544,"timestamp_updated":1643027404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51142127","author":{"steamid":"76561197999946602","num_games_owned":811,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":3844,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3844,"last_played":1570064622},"language":"english","review":"This game is absolutely amazing.

Columbia is beautiful- from the top of the tower to the bottom of the Pinkerton slums, new massive array of weapons which can be freely upgraded, the plasmids are BACK and absolutely devastating (Devil's Kiss #1) and a main character that actually has a conscious and is a hero. We can't forget about Elizabeth, your partner. Best A/I ever! Cortana can get the f out. Elizabeth provides you with weapons, eve, health, can lockpick doors and open tears (new mechanic) which provide allies or resources. Combat is great, varying enemies and abilities. The story is just mmmmm so good, typical bioshock but better, not gonna say anything else. Also, don't want to sound elitist or anything but 1999 mode wasn't as hard as people said it would be-just another challenge.\nThe burial at sea dlc's also amazing, great stories with an omage to the first game which honestly made me shed a tear. More new mechanics, new weapons and plasmids. Just so much good.\nFinally, Clash in the Clouds- defeating waves of enemies, unlocking upgrades through money and progression and if you want the achieve's trying to complete the blue ribbon challenges too. This wasn't as good as the other content due to repetiveness but I still enjoyed it.\nNo crashes, no bugs- awesome. Achievements are mostly kill grinding and collectibles. Two playthroughs, one on hard and one on 1999 mode will get you all. Rest are DLC related with Blue Ribbon Challenges in CitC being the most troublesome.\nI say it again, Bioshock Infinite IS a masterpiece.\n\n10/10 Bring us the Girl and Wipe Away the Debt","timestamp_created":1560091138,"timestamp_updated":1560091138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51138508","author":{"steamid":"76561198160783080","num_games_owned":249,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1300,"last_played":1560084118},"language":"schinese","review":"Ê∏∏ÊàèÂâßÊÉÖÁúüÁöÑ‰∏çÈîôÔºåÈùûÂ∏∏Â∑ßÂ¶ôÔºåÈùûÂ∏∏ÁÉßËÑëÔºå‰πüÈùûÂ∏∏ÊÑü‰∫∫Ôºå9.5ÂàÜÂêß„ÄÇ‰∏çËøáÊ∏∏ÊàèÊÄßÁ®çÂæÆ‰∏çÂ¶ÇÂâßÊÉÖÔºåÁªô8ÂàÜ„ÄÇ","timestamp_created":1560090777,"timestamp_updated":1560090777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51138007","author":{"steamid":"76561198237399208","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":109,"last_played":1577986528},"language":"schinese","review":"ÂºÄÂ±ÄÂçäÂ∞èÊó∂ÊòØÂ¶ÇÊ≠§ÁæéÂ¶ôÔºåÁõ¥Âà∞ÊäΩÂ•ñÔºåÂÆåÂÖ®Âèò‰∫Ü‰∏™Ê∏∏Êàè„ÄÇ","timestamp_created":1560089050,"timestamp_updated":1560089050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51136992","author":{"steamid":"76561198960294003","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":2543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1630,"last_played":1560339944},"language":"koreana","review":"ÏµúÏÜå 2Î≤àÏùÄ Ìï¥Ïïº Ïä§ÌÜ†Î¶¨ Ïù¥Ìï¥Í∞ê.\n\n6ÎÖÑÏ†Ñ Í≤åÏûÑÏù¥ÏßÄÎßå Ï¥ùÏèòÎäî Ïû¨ÎØ∏Îäî Í∏∞Î≥∏ Ïù¥ÏÉÅÏùÄ ÌïúÎã§Í≥† ÏÉùÍ∞ÅÌï®.\n\nÏ†ïÍ∞Ä Íµ¨ÏûÖÏùÄ ÎπÑÏ∂î, ÏÑ∏ÏùºÎïå Î≥∏Ìé∏Îßå Íµ¨ÏûÖ Ï∂îÏ≤ú.","timestamp_created":1560085197,"timestamp_updated":1560085197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51136115","author":{"steamid":"76561198844949263","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1840,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":891,"last_played":1601492938},"language":"turkish","review":".","timestamp_created":1560081772,"timestamp_updated":1560081772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51135685","author":{"steamid":"76561198119448770","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":880,"last_played":1560079323},"language":"english","review":"Good game","timestamp_created":1560080120,"timestamp_updated":1560080120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51134366","author":{"steamid":"76561198285980924","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1560074221},"language":"russian","review":"-–ë—É–∫–µ—Ä,—Ç—ã –±–æ–∏—à—å—Å—è –±–æ–≥–∞?\n\n-–ù–µ—Ç,–Ω–æ —Ç–µ–±—è-–±–æ—é—Å—å.","timestamp_created":1560074331,"timestamp_updated":1560074331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51134332","author":{"steamid":"76561198058905053","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":126,"playtime_forever":587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":242,"last_played":1562908339},"language":"english","review":"The action is as solid as my erection whenever Elizabeth fetches me a sandwich. \n\nThe most original part of this game is that when you kill someone, the game plays an instrument, usually stringed, which adds to the music.

Apart from the usual shooter gunplay the game allows you to use: vigors, tears, melee, crowd control techniques, sky hooks and environment. Your approach should be situational. On the other hand there is nothing special about any of those mechanics when considered separately.\n\n+ Setting and art design. The overall art direction is unique, solid and consistent throughout the entire game.\n\nCons:\n\n- Terrible characters. I belive this to be the game's main problem. You spend most of the time with your protagonist and his female companion... unfortunately there is absolutely nothing likeable about this duo. Their motives are very thin and unclear, they act dumb and unrealistic, their chemistry is rather weak. You are supposed to care because the game tells you to, it doesn't show you anything worth caring about.\n\n- Cringy dialogues. The artificial banter between the main duo is pretentious at it's best and torture at worst. Everything is hinted and ambiguous, even the simplest of issues are obscured. On top of that the characters often talk over each other or the audiologs. There are some good, honest moments but they make only a small portion of the game.\n\n- World execution. Bioshock Infinite's dystopian world offers some interesting social commentary, unfortunately our characters never pick up on it or address it in any meaningful way.\n\n- Convoluted story. Fan fiction-level writing, odd pacing, riddled with plot holes, no satisfying resolutions, pure shock value ending, characters are not able to sell the story, writers don't seem to undertand the difference between time travel and multiverse theories, vital details are hidden in the audiologs instead of being presented throughout your actions. Characters and world serve the plot while the plot itself serves no purpose.\n\n- Linear. It's fine to have a linear shooter but this game teases you about making a couple of seemingly plot changing choices that don't affect the final outcome at all.\n\n- Disappointing boss fight. The ending sequence feels a bit underwhelming and uninspired.\n\n- DLCs. Burial At Sea offers a lot of content but it also sabotages the main story and characters.\n\nIn conclusion: I wish I lived in an universe where this game doesn't exist.","timestamp_created":1560065398,"timestamp_updated":1560099225,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.444944292306900024","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51131476","author":{"steamid":"76561198027199288","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":614,"last_played":1658141573},"language":"english","review":"better than hentai 10/10","timestamp_created":1560060369,"timestamp_updated":1623171932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51130480","author":{"steamid":"76561198885564727","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":956,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":362,"last_played":1570306900},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen juego no me arrepiento de haberlo comprado, los gr√°ficos son bastante customizables y los escenarios ni hablar, incre√≠ble toda columbia","timestamp_created":1560054829,"timestamp_updated":1560054829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51130157","author":{"steamid":"76561198226193240","num_games_owned":327,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":509,"last_played":1559914447},"language":"english","review":"I don't know what is wrong with me and why i didn't pick this up years ago but this is an incredible story that i quiet happily enjoyed along with the combat that reminded me a lot of Far Cry which gave a good vibe.
