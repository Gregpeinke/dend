Altho its not so much an achievement of gameplay but more of setting and story. Sure the shooting of dudes is good enough, all the weapons have great design and are fun to use (even the usually dinky starter pistol is satisfyingly murderours) and you get to zap shit and such as in every Bioshock and the battles the game sets up are all good stuff but the main draw is the well crafted world and the dense atmosphere. From that follows i never felt like my time was wasted with filler shit (despite some minor backtracking) since theres always something cool to gawk at. The ~20 hours it took me is already good time for an FPS but these where some packed hours to boot.

While the actual game doesn't have all the story elements that we saw in the trailers, the game is still a perfect addition to the BioShock franchise, and it more than lives up to all the hype. And even though the actual storyline only gives you maybe 20 hours or gameplay, the fact that the devlopers left the game open for future DLCs is a serious bonus in my mind, and the fact that buying the Season Pass gives you some immediate in-game bonuses, all of which are VERY helpful to the player, is a great feature, making it well worth the extra $20 that it costs.\n\nNow let's also get something straight right off the bat. This game is *not* BioShock 1 or 2. Some of the elements present are out of sorts with the rest of the game; searching through trashcans still nets you stuff, but ubnlike BioShock, there isn't a real point to it, story-wise. Same goes for Vigors. Yes, it would seem odd to have a BioShock without Plasmids or something like them, but aside from a small handfull of enemies, only Booker seems to use them. So there are issues, but the overall story is so complex and deep that if you take the time to look around, pick up the recordings, notice the little things (all be it amidst the carnage wrought by Booker) you'll see just how well crafted a world is being presented here, within a story that has implications not just for Columbia but for all possible BioShock games, both past and future.","timestamp_created":1366481250,"timestamp_updated":1387355100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1205721","author":{"steamid":"76561197989195482","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1319,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":589,"last_played":1472664954},"language":"english","review":"Metacritic rating says it all","timestamp_created":1366471013,"timestamp_updated":1366471013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"610734","author":{"steamid":"76561197972960828","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":840,"last_played":1415131099},"language":"english","review":"Loved every minute of it.","timestamp_created":1366465444,"timestamp_updated":1366465444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5696815","author":{"steamid":"76561198054275381","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2892,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1994,"last_played":1428402865},"language":"german","review":"Meiner Meinung nach eindeutiger Anwärter für das GotY.","timestamp_created":1366452013,"timestamp_updated":1366452013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"795940","author":{"steamid":"76561197978592703","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2083,"last_played":1445337307},"language":"english","review":"Visually Stunning!\nEngaging Gameplay!\nBest of the Bioshock Series!\nSo Much Fun!\nRequires 20GB of Disk Space!","timestamp_created":1366440413,"timestamp_updated":1366440413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3390237","author":{"steamid":"76561198021915537","num_games_owned":455,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":6443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4593,"last_played":1650150914},"language":"english","review":"play this shit.","timestamp_created":1366431108,"timestamp_updated":1366431108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1861221","author":{"steamid":"76561197998981243","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2908,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1542,"last_played":1418836895},"language":"english","review":"Ken Levine and his team do it again!

The campaign is basically on rails (lel), compared to the open explorable areas of Bioshock and System Shock. Skyrails don't do shit, they just make it harder to hit enemies, unless your playing on hard or lower (like some sort of casual), which they then become the vehicle for instakills. There are literally 4 different enemies (footy, spliced footy, Turrets, Patriot) that you fight for 9 HOURS STRAIGHT. The two bosses are fucking retarded. The Ghost literally cheats. It leaves no openings for the player to attack, in addition to constantly resureccting the dead with no limits. Its basically attrition. The game devs saw how broken one encounter was so they put a vending machine in the corner just so it would be fair. The fight then turns into you constantly buying health and ammo, the only source of supplies in the entire encouner, while the ghost beats the shit out of you until you finally win. Handymen are butt-frustrating because they take so many hits, and can kill you in one hit, but are basically turned into retarded bullet sponges if you are lucky enough to get the invincibilty gear early on (this gear is literally game breaking). It basically plays like a 12 hour Call of Duty with better graphics. None of the inventiveness of Bioshock is found in this game. \n\nStory was pretty good though.","timestamp_created":1366236647,"timestamp_updated":1397122614,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"427829","author":{"steamid":"76561197970552707","num_games_owned":1704,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":1753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":956,"last_played":1400138019},"language":"english","review":"This was a pretty excellent game.

That decision could turn out to be the best gaming related decision that I will make all year as this game is outstanding. I found myself actually caring for Elizabeth and that's something that is hard for me to do: care for a digital character. The setting is vast and deep. The characters are interesting.

Bioshock 1 war für mich ein Meilenstein meiner Computerspielzeit. Die Atmosphäre und die Story des Spieles waren für mich nahezu unbeschreiblich gut.\n\nIch hätte nie gedachz, dass Bioshock 3 dies nochmal schafft.\n\nZugegeben: Der Gamscomtrailer aus 2010 sah meiner Meinung nach, nach einem besseren Spiel aus (Düster und Verrückt wie Rapture), doch dieses Spiel ist auch mit seiner intakten Stadt sehr verzaubernd.\n\n50Euro sind in diesem Fall gerechtfertigt! Das sehe ich selten ein zu zahlen.\n\nMeine persönliche Bewertung:\n\nAtmosphäre 8/10\n(Sehr viel Liebe zum Detail und gute deutsche Synchronisation)\nKI 8/10\n(Gegner KI etwas eintönig, aber Elizabeth ist ein großartiger niemals störender Mitspieler)\nStory 10/10\n(Ich denke seit 1,5 Wochen über das Ende nach. Reiht sich locker in Spiele wie Bioshock 1 / Mafia 1 / Fahrenheit / Max Payne 1&2 und Portal 2 ein)\nGameplay 6/10\n(Eigentlich hielt mich nur Elizabeth und ihre Geschichte am Spielen und die liebevolle Welt. Die Kämpfe waren leicht und fast schon störend. Was die Kämpfe anging bin ich nie wirklich mit dem Spiel warm geworden)\nSoundtrack 9/10\n(Sehr stimmige Musik. Ich wüsste nicht wie es besser ginge.
