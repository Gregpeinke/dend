BioShock Infinite - стала игрой с которой я начал знакомство с серией BioShock (Подход специфичный, но на вкус и цвет, как говорится). Ознакомившись за свою непродолжительную жизнь с играми, как новинками \nэтой индустрии, так и классикой видеоигр, для себя отметил, что BioShock Infinite затрагивает не детские темы (Хоть и у графики есть своя особенность), ко всему прочему - ещё и грамотно и популярно их раскрывает. (Не хочу спойлерить, вам, дорогие игроки, которые решились приобщится к творчеству Irrational Games и 2K)\n   Отмечу, на мой взгляд, единственный  минус - непривычность стандартного управления (Мне не хотелось ломать голову - куда и какую клавишу поставить, потому проходил на оригинальной раскладке управления)\n   Теперь плюсы - Хорошая оптимизация (На моем не самом лучшем железе шла без фризов и лагов), Атмосферу (Освещение, звуковое сопровождение, как уже отмечал ранее - особенность графики), Элизабет (Хороший компаньон, не раз выручала в бою и её внешность - потрясающая).
