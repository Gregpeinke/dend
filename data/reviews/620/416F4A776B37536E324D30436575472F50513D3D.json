Con la opción de jugar un jugador o cooperativo, tanto online como local. A parte de ser divertido y entretenido está acompañado de una buena trama.\n\n\tVamos a ver distintos puntos:\n\n\t[b]Jugabilidad[/b]\n\n\tLas dinámicas del juego en principio son muy sencillas. Tienes una pistola de portales, con clic izquierdo lanzas un portal azul y con del derecho uno naranja. Una vez puestos los portales en una superficie, puedes pasar de uno al otro. A partir de este concepto se desarrolla el juego y lo que en un principio parece fácil se convierte en ocasiones en grandes retos a superar.\n\n\n\t[b]Historia[/b]\n\n\tVoy a hacer un análisis de la historia sin [i]spoilers[/i], así, si alguien no se ha pasado el juego, podrá leer esto sin miedo a que se desvele nada de la trama.  \n\n\tTras los eventos del primer Portal (no es necesario habérselo pasado, pero sí recomendable) , Chell, nuestra protagonista, despierta en una habitación que está seriamente deteriorada, con el contador de tiempo fallando tras aparentemente más de un siglo de fallos. De fondo suena una voz al otro lado de la puerta, tras abrirla aparece el carismático personaje Wheatley, el módulo de personalidad que despertó a Chell de su estado de criogenia. \n\n\tTras localizar la pistola de portales, Chell se rencontrará con Wheatley quien la ayudará a escapar en una cápsula cerca del lugar donde se encuentra el cuerpo inanimado de GLaDOS. Lamentablemente, debido a la torpeza de Wheatley, lo único que logran es reactivar a GlaDOS. Después de esto empieza nuestra aventura para escapar de Aperture Laboratories.\n\n\tLos personajes de la historia son simplemente geniales. Wheatley es muy carismático y el personaje de GlaDOS es genial. Además, su personalidad e ingenio son maravillosos. Siempre tiene un comentario irónico para todas las situaciones que hacen que durante el trascurso de la historia esté repleta de humor.\n\n\tLa duración de la historia es de aproximadamente siete horas (si es la primera vez que te lo pasas). Aun así, este juego tiene el encanto suficiente como para que tengas ganas de volver a pasártelo de vez en cuando y por si esto fuese poco para proporcionar su rejugabilidad, ofrece una serie de logros que si los quieres conseguir todos te obliga a echarle más horas.\n\n\n\t[b]Co-op[/b]\n\n\tEn el modo de juego cooperativo tú y un amigo tuyo tomaréis el papel de Atlas y P-body, dos robots con pistolas de portales. Se introducen nuevas dinámicas de juego y acompañado a una sencilla historia el juego nos ofrece muchísimas cámaras de prueba nuevas.\n\tEsta parte puede durar igual o más que la historia principal (la de un jugador) y se hace muy divertida, porque la juegas en compañía de un amigo.\n\n\n\t[b]Comunidad[/b]\n\t\n\tComo último punto para analizar tengo la comunidad. Gracias a que somos parte de The Glorious PC Gaming Master Race tenemos el “poder” de la comunidad. Ésta tiene la posibilidad de crear mapas para el juego y MODs. Gracias a esto la duración del juego puede ser elevada al infinito.\n\n\n\t\n\tEn conclusión, Portal 2 es un JUEGAZO y merece la pena comprarlo y pasárselo. Pese a que salió en 2011 sigue siendo estéticamente precioso, visualmente y auditivamente está muy bien y las canciones del juego suenan muy bien. Ahora mismo el juego en Steam está por 15€. Merece la pena pagar cada uno de ellos y más. Aun así, si no quieres invertir todo ese dinero, siempre puedes esperarte a las ofertas de Steam. Reitero, es un juego muy recomendable y que merece la pena jugarlo.\n\n\t[b][u]PTX[/u][/b]","timestamp_created":1433515765,"timestamp_updated":1606334384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16203831","author":{"steamid":"76561198100563778","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1039,"last_played":1419591613},"language":"schinese","review":"除了单人模式，双人合作模式也一定要和小伙伴一起去玩","timestamp_created":1433509104,"timestamp_updated":1433509104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16202148","author":{"steamid":"76561198178055102","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":98,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":96,"last_played":1433540205},"language":"english","review":"OMG this game is amazing i always make a map thanks valve for making Portal & Portal 2 these are great game ;D","timestamp_created":1433501346,"timestamp_updated":1433501346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16201409","author":{"steamid":"76561198092048677","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":514,"last_played":1590142974},"language":"english","review":"\nStory 10/10\n\nGameplay 10/10\n\ncontent :\nPotato\nPotaDOS\nA very good potato with a British accent\n\n11/10 Because I'm A Potato.\n\n","timestamp_created":1433497344,"timestamp_updated":1433497344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16200789","author":{"steamid":"76561197971414937","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":6809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1281,"last_played":1656777729},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 is just epic.
