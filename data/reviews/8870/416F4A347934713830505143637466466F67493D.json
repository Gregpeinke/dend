There is a science-fiction story that also contains elements of horror. This story resolves in and around Columbia; a fictional city state, oddly enough floating high above the United States of America. This Columbia is governed through unusual civics, resulting in extreme cases of beauty and atrocity.\nThe stories' protagonist, Booker DeWitt, is contracted to find Elizabeth in Columbia. Elizabeth is a young woman, who plays an integral role in this extraordinary place, where the impossible is possible.\n\nThe perspective on this world is displayed from the protagonist's own eyes. His mission starts off peaceful, but he must soon fend off hostilities to stay alive. This action-oriented play is comprised out of overcoming adversaries, searching the environment for supplies, and finding a way to a next area, which progresses the story.\nIf the protagonist dies, he looses some of his collected money, or he may restart from an earlier point in the story.\nTo stay alive, the protagonist may obtain a recharging shield that absorbs damage. The protagonist may also stay healthy by finding consumables, and by using weapons, such as firearms. Eventually the protagonist obtains powers beyond the natural laws of physics and reality.\nTo win, the protagonist must finish the story by completing it, and by finding a way through the world, and by defeating adversaries. The protagonist travels mostly on foot, and may sometimes latch onto a magnetic rails, that runs through the air, connecting different parts of an area. Soaring through the air via this rails, reminds of a roller-coaster ride.\n\nVisually, BioShock Infinate looks artistic; featuring soft visuals, and colours and world objects gradient blend together, without becoming simplified or cartoonish. Lighting effects often cast a soothing glow or reflection on the environment, and rays of light gracefully shine through the environment. The setting is an unlikely place, which positively draws attention, in regard to how the environments are designed. Voice recordings may be found during play, that contain background stories, that offer a deeper understanding about the place. BioShock Infinate has a lengthy and expansive story, with lots of ideas, in an interactive world.\nWeapons and powers have different effects on adversaries, and combat may show gruesome violence. Additional powers and weapons may be found later.\nFollowing the story offers a cinematic experience, that alternates between action-oriented play, and periods of relative peace.\nAnother highlight worth mentioning, is the artificial intelligence of a companion character. This companion does not need protection, but points out points of interest in the world. The companion uses convincing facial expressions, and changes appearance the longer she accompanies the protagonist, and keeps conversation with the protagonist as well. This companion walks around on her own, but also follows the protagonist. This companion takes cover, and sometimes leads the way onward, or may run away, and also interacts with other characters, depending on what the protagonist does, or interacts with the world, and comments on the actions of the protagonist, or ongoing events. The companion may help the protagonist when the protagonist falls, and offers supplies during combat. The companion's stance towards the protagonist will change along the story.\nLastly, there is an expansion available, which offers a story in a different scenery, and connects this story, to the story of the original BioShock.\n\n\nThis sunlit image shows a surreal environment, and is an example of BioShock Infinate's many artfully crafted locales:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2232554395\nThis spoiler video shows play, where there is a high degree of cinematic craftsmanship, delivering an emotional experience:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2228948330","timestamp_created":1600466843,"timestamp_updated":1624393039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76192139","author":{"steamid":"76561198074305337","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":657,"last_played":1600466186},"language":"english","review":"Now i don't think the game is inherently bad. The gameplay is fun. Pretty decent for a fps \n\nBut it's the story where it get's a big complicated, it really feels like midway through the game they switched direction and it feels like you're hoping from one thing to the next. \n\nAlso the story is in Colombia a white supremacist religious city so at one point you imagine you're gonna side with the rebels,  But when the rebels ( people of color) actually fight back it ends up telling you  ' they were both the same' and it's like fighting facism you become a fascist yourself narrative and i dunno ut felt a bit   isssh for me especially what's going on nowadays. \n\nSTILL the gameplay and graphics are nice good action games gameplay wise took me 10-11 hours to complete and got it on sale for 9 bucks so i don't regret it but i don't feel

Not the same atmosphere as the first two but it is still an interesting environment to explore.
