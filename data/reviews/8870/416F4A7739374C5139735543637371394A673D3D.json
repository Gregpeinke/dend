Меня всегда раздражали скриптовые сцены от первого лица. В серии BioShock они встречаются довольно часто, но в большинстве случаев оправданы сюжетом. Но ПОЧЕМУ, предварительно уничтожив несколько десятков разнообразно вооруженных бандитов, Элизабет падает, получив по голове от точно такого же бандита, даже не пытаясь сопротивляться???\n2. Нелогичная завязка сюжета - почти всемогущая Элизабет умирает от рук Большого Папочки. Она не боец? Но дальнейшие события это отрицают. Она не могла справиться? С Соловьем справилась.\n3. Салли в качестве заложницы. Понятно, что маленкую сестричку можно убить. Но для этого нужно извлеч симбионта. Это дело не мнгновенное. То есть в качестве заложницы Салли подходит, только когда она далеко. Если ребенок радом, даже с приставленным к голове пистолетом, ее можно отбить, она от одной пули не умрет. Отговорки, что Элизабет слабая девушка - глупость, даже на высокой сложности можно устраивать вполне эффективные перестрелки против толпы.","timestamp_created":1399908488,"timestamp_updated":1399908488,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.419048190116882324","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10093190","author":{"steamid":"76561198114249468","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":657,"last_played":1400335134},"language":"english","review":"I totally recommend this game to you guys, it got action.. marvelous adventure and almost every where u go u still get's amazed by all the lovely buildings and views there is to see.. and the story is quite good so i hope you gives this game a shot..","timestamp_created":1399908349,"timestamp_updated":1399908349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10092317","author":{"steamid":"76561198022072249","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1636,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1218,"last_played":1430835242},"language":"thai","review":"เนื้อเรื่อง Infinite จริงๆครับ ยืนยันเลย","timestamp_created":1399900965,"timestamp_updated":1399900965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10092266","author":{"steamid":"76561198087718604","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":2912,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":73,"last_played":1425227189},"language":"russian","review":"Самая прекрасная графика,которую я видел!","timestamp_created":1399900470,"timestamp_updated":1399900470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474999994039535522","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10092025","author":{"steamid":"76561198097241022","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":599,"last_played":1615767735},"language":"english","review":"Only took me 10hrs to finish the game, but the story was amazing, artwork was amazing, everything was amazing about BioShock Infinite. 10/10 Would recommend.","timestamp_created":1399898078,"timestamp_updated":1399898078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10092019","author":{"steamid":"76561198017204871","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1408645962},"language":"spanish","review":"Gran juego.

I think the problem here is they tried to make it too grand, and it comes off as unfocused, but still enjoyable until you reach the climax, finish the game, then realize \"hey wait, this doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nThis is certainly not a perfect game, and certainly not \"the\" perfect game to end the series in my opinion, but all these are thoughts that arose after I completed it. I would recommend a playthrough for anyone who liked the series so far.\n\nThe game also turns the idea of an \"escort mission\" on its head, as your companion is not only invincible, but helps you out with pickups and ammo. Turns it from a frustrating mechanic to a rewarding one.\n\nAnd besides, I'm a sucker for corsets.\n\nA few sticking points for me:\n\nThe ending is weak. Of course, this might be intentional. I have not finished Burial at Sea yet.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, towards the beginning of the game you have some choices, which are fun. However, \"choices\" only appear in the first act of the game. It feels like a mechanic they tested but never fully realized.\n\nI feel like enemies move around too much here, either that or I've gotten even worse at aiming.\n\nVigors are still all over the place in terms of effectiveness, many are useless.\n\nAgain without spoiling anything, there are way too many \"variants\" of weapons, that you have to upgrade separately.
