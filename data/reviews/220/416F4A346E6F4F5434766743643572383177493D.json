I mean, honestly, how many of such games can you remember? Sure, the old farts would instantly remember B.A.T., DreamWeb and Neuromancer. Generation Y will think of games like Deus Ex, Anachronox and, maybe, extremely underrated Nightlong: Union City Conspiracy. And, of course, there are always Shadowrun adaptations that stay with us since fourth generation of video game consoles. But even if you're a die-hard cyberpunk fan who played some screwed up stuff like Paradise Cracked, COPS 2170: The Power of Law and Restricted Area, even you won't argue with the fact that there's serious lack of neon in gaming industry. And when you compare the amount of cyberpunk games with all those endless fantasy titles... I dunno, it's just sad.\n\nAnd no, today I won't talk about that certain cyberpunk title that's currently releasing new patches just to fix previous ones. Today, I want to talk about the game that both Generation X and Generation Y should remember very well. Just because it was one of the brightest things ever happened with cyberpunk on both personal computers an video game consoles. I'm talking, of course, about good ol' Syndicate and its sequel Syndicate Wars. The real-time tactical games from legendary Bullfrog Productions, creators of such legendary titles as Magic Carpet, Populous, Theme Park and, of course, Dungeon Keeper. Before Electronic Arts killed the guys and before Peter Molyneux turned into a complete joke of a man, Bullfrog used to be one of my most favorite developers out there. They had both unique vision and enough talent to turn that vision into reality. And Syndicate? It was one of such projects. Like I already said, Syndicate was a real-time tactical game. Your goal was to control a small group of cybernetic agents and finish the series of missions that used to include infiltration, elimination and stuff like that. But, of course, it wasn't that simple. After all, it's Bullfrog we're talking about here. So, the game allowed us to modify our agents, research the new tools, conquer the territories, put taxes on them and do a lot of other fantastic stuff that heavily inspired another underrated cyberpunk title – an RTS called War Inc. (not to be confused with Russian MMOTPS). In other words, it was an awesome game. And even though its sequel was not nearly as well received as the original, I actually consider it to be heavily underrated.\n\nUnfortunately, after Bullfrog was done (let's just take a minute and curse the name of the company that killed people like Origin Systems, Westwood Studios and DreamWorks Interactive) it was like the entire thing... kinda died with them, really. And you know what? It's weird. Seriously, even though most of Bullfrog's games are still well-remembered and considered to be iconic, we rarely get people trying to clone them. I mean, how many Syndicate clones do you know? I think I can remember that weird thingy called Gender Wars, but... that's pretty much it. And even EA didn't care much. They've just rebooted the series as FPS and then killed it because, naturally, nobody wanted a FPS version of Syndicate. Seriously, who, besides me, even remember that it was a thing not so long ago? Nobody? Thought so. Now, why am I telling you all that? Well, that's because... that's exactly what we've got here. Ladies and gentlemen, the waiting is over. Please, welcome! A Syndicate clone.\n\nSure, you may call this game a “spiritual successor”, but let's be honest. It's a bloody clone. The game just took the old Bullfrog's formula and, well, here we are. And you know what? I don't have problem with that. Heck, I welcome it! Like I welcome everybody who try to make their own version of Dungeon Keeper (the world needs more of such people). The problem is... the guys from 5 Lives Studios decided to give their game a modern touch. And that's where everything went down the drain. See, instead of our usual mission-by-mission formula from Syndicate (which does feel kinda archaic nowadays), they've decided to make Satellite Reign... an open world game. Long story short, in this title we have four districts and we're free to explore them in any way we want. All to make our agents strong enough to enter the enemy tower, kill a certain guy and trigger the ending. That's pretty much it. Unfortunately, that just... doesn't work. For two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is, of course, the fact that... well, let's just say that “you can go straight to the final boss” formula rarely works. Heck, I don't even think it worked that well in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. And here? It just makes you feel like you're wasting your time. There's no story progression (you want story – you pay more for a prequel novella), all missions feel exactly the same, etc. It's just extremely... unsatisfying experience. And that's the second problem. Seriously, this game? It screams about lack of variety. You activate teleports for easier navigation, you hack stuff for income and you do two kinds of missions (infiltrating the buildings and killing people that were there since the day the very first Syndicate was made, which was in 1993). That's pretty much it. That's the entire variety you'll get here.\n\nSure, Satellite Reign has its own share of interesting features. For example, you'll be able to clone people and use them as agents. Which is... way less satisfying than you may expect, but still, it's an interesting feature. But all in all, all those cute little touches don't really change the fact that this game is extremely repetitive. It's also painfully confusing. The UI here? It's a disaster. One of the worst things I've ever seen in modern games. One of those that only make things harder for player. And combined with terribly explained missions, bugs and messed up markers? Let's just say it's really, really hard to enjoy this game. The worst thing, though, is the fact that the core mechanics here feels clunky as heck. This game relies quite a lot on stealth, but it's so terribly made that you'll want to scream. Seriously, guys, just use the force instead. Especially since balance here is broken and there are many ways to take advantage of it and finish the game in just a couple of hours.\n\nIt's not like I didn't want to enjoy this game, though. Quite the opposite. I wanted for it to be good. With all of my heart. Seriously, I've waited for something like this for ages! Unfortunately, instead of investing more time into a single player experience, 5 Lives Studios decided to add multiplayer. So, in the end not only we didn't get ourselves good multiplayer, we also didn't get a good single player campaign. What we did get is a clunky, empty, limited and extremely annoying something that, despite all the cool features, just can't compete with the good ol' Syndicate. In other words, it is not the cyberpunk title you're looking for.","timestamp_created":1618381756,"timestamp_updated":1618381756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496240615844726563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90280751","author":{"steamid":"76561199067177976","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":4309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2303,"last_played":1636679266},"language":"english","review":"HALF LIFE 3","timestamp_created":1618380583,"timestamp_updated":1618380583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90279195","author":{"steamid":"76561199078462178","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":704,"last_played":1618599540},"language":"english","review":"Yes.","timestamp_created":1618377027,"timestamp_updated":1618377027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90277894","author":{"steamid":"76561199084758652","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":876,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":876,"last_played":1617918206},"language":"spanish","review":"Ta wenísimo.","timestamp_created":1618374088,"timestamp_updated":1635777912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90275157","author":{"steamid":"76561198298497228","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1651200539},"language":"english","review":"Overall I think Half Life 2 is one of my favorite video game of all time.

I explained to them how I'm dreamgender and dreamsexual but they didnt even know who dream is, boomers. I had to explain to them its a sexy minecraft youtuber and how Im connected to him emotionally and sexually. They didnt get mad at all (yay!) they just stared at me with a blank expression. I think theyre proud of me but just dont know what to think of it yet since it came as such as shock to them. I tried to show them a video of dream but they werent really interested and told me to go to school.\n\nin school the first class was english so I told the teacher that I had an important announcement that I would like to tell to the entire class. Yesterday I prepared a short powerpoint presentation on dreamgenders and dreamsexuals to make them better understand. I explained how dream is really hot and how I feel a deep connection to dream and how he is my soulmate and my identity. The teacher was so amazed I guess she didnt know what to say haha she looked like she was smiling.\n\nWhen I finished explaining why dream is hot and awesome, I started clapping expecting everyone else to do the same, but they didnt. My best friend didnt clap either which was really weird but maybe he was also surprised since I hadnt told him either. my teacher ended up being the only one clapping, so Im really thankful to her. I thought they didnt get it so I tried to explain in simpler terms that I love dream and how I am dream.\n\nSome girls were giggling the entire time so I called them out on it saying they shouldnt be laughing when I have prepared for this moment for so long. Then they started saying really dreamphobic things like saying its stupid and makes no sense. I explained to them why its homophobic and close minded but they didnt listen. Then some guy called me a stupid fucking nerd which made my blood boil. I challenged him to a duel in minecraft which he didnt even respond to and his friends were just laughing. Everyone else was silent I thought that they secretly supported me but just didnt want to face the same oppression dreamgenders and dreamsexuals have to face every day.\n\nThen the teacher told me to get back to my seat and started the lesson like nothing happened. I told her I wanted to show the class a compilation of minecraft manhunt best moments but she didnt let me do it. After the class a bunch of my classmates came to me and asked if I was joking or what and I tried to explain it to them but they were just making fun of me and saying Im weird and a creep. it was awful. I was bullied a bit before but now nobody wanted to talk to me the entire day even when I tried to show my ''friends'' (not friends anymore, theyre nazis apparently) some dream videos and discussed minecraft speedrunning they didnt respond at all.\n\nI've been crying the entire day because I cant believe the people I thought were cool were dreamphobes/racists/nazis as well. 😭😭😭😭😭 its honestly really crushing how people are still like this in 2021. now Im starting to realize I dont need those kinds of toxic people in my life and the only person I truly need is Dream.
