Levine ce l’ha fatta! Ha creato qualcosa di unico e prezioso che pochi se ne sono visti e giocati. La storia di DeWitt, Elizabeth, Comstock e Columbia è qualcosa di assolutamente sublime e che è un piacere da dipanare e scoprire, colpo di scena su colpo di scena, dialogo su dialogo fino a giungere al climax sul finale. Un capolavoro in ogni senso, con un comparto artistico impressionante e una qualità sonora davvero eccelsa e (forse) senza eguali; ottimo lavoro anche per quanto riguarda il doppiaggio in italiano che è uno dei più validi di questa generazione (se non di sempre). Elizabeth e DeWitt sono pura dinamite, una delle coppie più carismatiche mai apparse in un videogames, vi affezionerete immediatamente ai personaggi, alle loro battute sarcastiche e alle loro vicende, immergendovi completamente in una delle storie più contorte, coinvolgenti e profonde che la storia ricordi (inoltre vi suggeriamo di non perderne nemmeno il più insignificante dei frammenti, poiché altrimenti tirare le fila sarà cosa ardua).

They were the same graphics on both PS3 and PC. The story line in this bioshock game really impacted me, it was very much entertaining than the previous Bioshock games. It has although lost some of the touch I found interesting in the previous game; from a more dark and mysterious atmosphere to a more sunny and birght one, honestly I prefered the previous atmospheres. The game may be linear but unlike other games that are like that, this one keeps you entertained for a much longer period, with not many repetitive missions and objectives though some objectives in the game can be frustrating and tedious. One of the things that really impacted me from this Bioshock game was the similar yet different gameplay from other Bioshock games. Now you use vigors, you have a metal grappling hook, and you have the beautiful and intellegent Elizabeth (who's player model was somewhat drawn badly into the game, not really noticeable unless you try to see it) who helps you in battle when you need it and gets you into secret places with lockpicks. \n\nOne downside that I see in the game was how it could've been even greater than it was, many things could have been added in-game such as more choices to choose from that would've affect the ending, afterall, this game is about choices and decisions made in life.\n\n9.5/10\n\nBuy it and repay the debt.","timestamp_created":1388637101,"timestamp_updated":1390428882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8499547","author":{"steamid":"76561198064691863","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":658,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":318,"last_played":1388636632},"language":"english","review":"Blew my mind into another universe.

Dafür ist die Story am Ende für einen Shooter schon eine kleine Sensation, kommt aber anfangs eher langsam in Fahrt. Optisch überdurchschnittlich, Musik passend und Synchronisation sehr gut.\n\nDer Hit ist hier aber ganz klar die Atmosphäre, hier stimmt fast alles.\n\nFazit: Bei dem heutigen Schrott der angeblichen AAAAAAAA-Titel muss man dieses hier wirklich gespielt haben und bitte bis zum Ende durchhalten! Die ersten beiden Teile werden für das Verständnis nicht benötigt.","timestamp_created":1388622933,"timestamp_updated":1388622933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8495512","author":{"steamid":"76561198025765611","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1225,"last_played":1487221561},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic!","timestamp_created":1388622266,"timestamp_updated":1388622266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6ceVqMMCeJm0IA=="}
