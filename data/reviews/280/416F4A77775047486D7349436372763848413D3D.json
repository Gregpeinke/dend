Half-Life is a classic that should be played by anyone who appreciates FPS's. In fact, it's your obligation to play this game, because it was the first to do so many things in video games. There are many games that have heavily leaned on the format, gameplay and story telling strategies of this game. The game is very dated, and it shows, but Valve did implement the Source engine which gives it a more polished, free-flowing look. I was able to disregard the dated graphics, because I knew that this was such an original and classic game. \n\nThe first half hour of the game is brilliant, because nothing is really happening, but there is an ere tone and feeling that lets you know that something's not right. Some subtle foreshadowing occurs when some of the computers break, and a scientist says the power is going to be switched on to 105%. It's show-not-tell things like this that make the game so gripping and immersive. It's something we don't seem to see in many games anymore. \n\nAnyway, during the first three quarters of the game, you're running around, collecting new weapons, killing aliens, and soldiers sent there to kill you, (a perfectly executed plot twist) solving puzzles, picking up more of the story, riding on rails, launching rockets, blowing up helicopters, storming military bases, navigating mine fields, annihilating green, bangy, tentacle thingies, electrocuting, and blowing up giant, blue flamethrower monsters; the list can go on and on. Basically, you're just having a lot of fun. The constant change of objectives really keeps the player immersed in the game. You never feel like you're repeating the same things over and over again. This is a staple in the Half-Life franchise. Once you start getting bored of something, it changes it up so that you're doing something different and more exciting. The pacing in this game is also phenomenal. It usually goes in the order of: Action event, slow puzzle event, action event slow puzzle event, with some events that feature action and puzzle at the same time, and story exposition sprinkled around and mixed in through everything you do. It's constant fun that never frustrates you or makes you feel cheated.\n\n The subtle rise in difficulty is more subtle than, you know, just changing the color of the monster. It's realistic, and makes you feel the tension rising around the Black Mesa facility. The first three quarters of the game are nearly flawless.\n\nIn my opinion, the only downside to this game is the last quarter where you play in the alien world, Xen. This segment of the game really breaks up the immersion. The gravity is toned down, so everything you've gotten used to in the first part of the game is scrapped for a floaty, hard to manoeuvre, way of moving. It's also very slow. From a story telling perspective, it's mind blowing, but from a gameplay perspective, it's quite dull and frustrating. During the chapter Xen, you're just platforming, trying to figure out where to go. Gonarch's Lair was just an annoying, frustrating, slow paced boss fight, But the REAL kicker was interloper. \n\nI hated this level. It was way too long, way too difficult, way to confusing, and way too frustrating. If there was an enemy I could have removed from this game it would be those flying baby thingies, but they were everywhere here and they would respawn all the time! There's never enough health, energy, or ammo for you, so you have too eek by in this extremely hard level. In most levels, if it was hard, it was because you needed to change your strategy. It was your fault if you died. But in this level, there are just way too many overpowered enemies. You're trying to save your health and running out of ammo, and BOOM! You're hit with ten million, flying babies, and bee shooting giants, while being hit with vortigaunt lightning from every corner. The only way to get through this level is to set the difficulty to easy, and die a million times before you memorise where each enemy will be and when he will attack. That's no fun. That's just drudgery. \n\nNihilanth was just a giant version of those annoying flying babies. Great. To be honest, he was just mediocre. Okay, I do hate how all the Zelda bosses, for example, have huge shiny targets on them that show you exactly where to place a bomb or shoot an arrow, but at least they help you figure out how to defeat it. In Nihilanth, I had no idea how to defeat the monster. shooting it did nothing, and it kept sending me away to these weird caves by throwing portals at me. I was completely lost. I had to go on youtube and see how it was done before I even knew how to kill it. It was still too hard too kill it though. If you play it the way it was intended and jump up onto those cliff things, it's really hard, and he will keep sending portals at you. If you're cheap like me and just hid behind the spiky rocks, then it's easier, but it's painfully repeditive and tedious.\n\nBoss fights in this game were not good with the exception of the green tentacle thing. I will cut it some slack though, because it was kind of a 90's thing to have bosses in your games, and this was a very hard game to put bosses into.\n\nIn the last chapter, you're given a monologue from the mysterious G-man, who you may have noticed stalking you throughout the game. He makes you go through a portal, and then the credits hit, reminding you how good the soundtrack in this game was.\n\nAll in all, Half-Life was a classic, and should be played by anyone who likes video games. If you like steam you should play this game to show your respects to Valve. It was the first game they made. Half-Life rose to my personal favorite video game franchise after the Metroid Franchise was ruined by Other M. Anyway, just play this game. You have no excuse not to.

По сути, тот же Half-Life, но с более обновлённой графикой, физикой, изменённым интерфейсом и улучшенной системой поведения ботов. \n\nСюжет был не тронут, всё таже история про молодого учёного, физика Гордона Фримена, попавшего в самый эпицентр неудачного эксперимента и пытающегося спастись и выбраться из этого хаоса. Проходя тяжелый путь по запутанным помещениям лаборатории исследования порталов (Black Mesa), главный герой встречает агрессивных существ, телепортирующийся с другого мира. Прибывшие военные, казалось бы, для спасательной операции, преследуют совсем иную цель... \n\nГеймплей, звуковое сопровождения, все карты и локации были сохранены в том виде, в каком мы, могли наблюдать их при прохождении HL, образца 98го года. \n\nОтличия заключаться в следующем: \n\n- обновлённый интерфейс, который можно сказать перекочевал с новых игр на движке Source. Мы можем выбирать любую главу, на заднем фоне есть заставка с разными эпизодами, в которых происходят различные действия. Смотрится эффектно. \n\n- теперь вода выглядит куда более реалистичной, с отражениями, созданная с использованием шейдеров. Появились динамические тени объектов и моделей. Увеличена дальность прорисовки несмотря на то, что текстуры и не были изменены, за счёт движка Source они выглядят более детализированными. \n\n- предметы и модели теперь управляются более обновлённым физическим движком, улучшен искусственный интеллект. Противники стали более умными, при ранениях ищут укрытие, замечают вас при приближении со спины, больше не заметны баги c застреваниями союзников. \n\nВ игре не хватает новых более детализированных текстур и высокополигональных моделей, при том, что такие уже были в Blue Shift тремя годами ранее. Это в свою очередь несколько портит сам смысл переиздания, направленный на улучшение технологичного аспекта игры, так как в 2004 модели из оригинальной Half-Life уже выглядели устаревшими. \n\n[h1] Спорное переиздание, в котором не были использованы все ресурсы обновленного движка Source.
