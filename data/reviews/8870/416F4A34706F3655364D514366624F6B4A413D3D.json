Quand bien même on y retrouve de nombreux éléments, l'expérience globale est tellement différente qu'on comprend pourquoi cet opus s'appelle Infinite et pas 3. \n\nÉcrire un pavé de 20 pages pour dire à quel point ce jeu est bon ne serait pas spécialement utile, alors je vais être le plus concis possible. La narration, le gameplay, la direction artistique, la musique, le doublage français et les dialogues sont autant de points sur lesquels le jeu s'en sort avec brio. Du côté négatif, on se retrouve avec des graphismes loin d'être aussi réaliste qu'un Crysis 3 mais d'un autre côté quand le travail en amont sur la DA est aussi bon, je peux vous dire qu'on s'en fout.\n\nReste l'histoire qui divise. Les intellos trouvent la ficelle énorme et pas constructive. Personnellement, je préfère une ficelle un peu trop grosse mais bien amenée qu'un retournement de situation transcendant dans un final que je ne verrais jamais parce que le reste du jeu est indigeste.\n\nSi je devais résumer mon sentiment sur Bioshock Infinite en une ligne, c'est qu'il s'agit certainement d'un des meilleurs jeux de ces dernières années.

As such, it kind of makes you wish you just hadn't bothered in the first place or that all your effort has been for naught. \n\nMy opinion may be scared by the fact that i had played the other two Bioshock games (which i loved) and Bioshock Infinite just doesn't live up to the high standard that had been previously set.\n\nThe plasmids are pretty pointless and pathetic compared to those displayed earlier in the Bioshock series.\n\nThe ridiculous 'two guns only' policy was just irksome. \nAs for the choice of weaponry available, none of it seemed particularly better than any other piece and ultimately it seemed that you could score a head shot kill with enough ease with all of the bullet type weaponry, that the AOE type weapons seemed totally redundant.\n\nThe 'Gear' that you could equip was again pretty usless since gaining a head shot with a weapon was, as mentioned already, very easy. Assuming one even bothered to shoot most of the enemies in the first  place and not just melee them.\n\nWould i recommend...?\n\nWell it depends if you are new to the Bioshock series and have no intention of playing the two previous games... if that's your approach, then yes; i would recommend Bioshock Infinite.\n\nHowever; If you've previously played the first two games, i would urge you to not bother with this one as it doesn't stand well against the comparison and you'll undoubtedly feel disappointed.","timestamp_created":1395280128,"timestamp_updated":1395280478,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9567817","author":{"steamid":"76561198091839148","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1465,"last_played":1489056923},"language":"english","review":"AMAZING GAME!

This was not creepy or spooky like BioShock 1, but rather felt like something they should have listed in the bullet points next to the \"'M' for Mature.\" Thankfully, that feeling disappears when Elizabeth shows up.This is kind of a double-edged sword, though, since it disappears too much (so to speak); intense racism gets replaced by typical classism (classism based on racism, but the racism just feels tacked like the writers forgot that's how the conflict started).\n\nIt doesn't help that the main antagonist spouts nonsensical, circular logic. I get that people at one point in time actually believed what he's saying, but the ideas are so outdated that they're impossible to follow; Andrew Ryan had some crazy ideas, but you could at least follow his train of thought.\n\nGame-play-wise, the game is decent enough, though it gets kind of same-y after a while. After a few upgrades, standard enemies are cake (especially with my vigor/weapon load-out); however the tougher enemies are most always a pain (though maybe that's to do with my load-out?). I say it gets \"same-y\" because while there is the occasional gimmick enemy, most of the time you're fighting jobbers in a cover-based fire fight (yes there's also the sky-rail things, but to me, they hardly seemed worth using considering how exposed you are). Also, the final level is an annoying tower-defense battle that felt kind of lazy and/or rushed.\n\nOver-all, I will say that the story was pretty good; however, the ending (and the bit leading up to it) just made me mad. I mean, it worked in the context of the story, I just didn't like it. That, combined with the fact that none of the \"moral\" choices you make actually matter (they effect unimportant bits, but that's all) as well as what I've said above, lead me to not being able to recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1395241520,"timestamp_updated":1395241520,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9559940","author":{"steamid":"76561198105985851","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":786,"last_played":1501349087},"language":"brazilian","review":"O que dizer deste game?\nTrouxe o que tinha de melhor dos anteriores e deu sua propria maneira de nos prender a historia que por sinal é magnifica, ambientação semelhante a uma pintura dos artistas mais renomados da historia, trilha sonora que lhe arrepia, personagens envolventes principalmente a Elizaveth que roubou a cena no game inteiro,\nperfeito, perfeito.","timestamp_created":1395236827,"timestamp_updated":1395236827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9558921","author":{"steamid":"76561197977111034","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1037,"last_played":1437067660},"language":"english","review":"It's kind of different to Bioshock 1 and 2, but it's amazing!!\n\nThis game is made by the team that made Bioshock one, so the story is AMAZING!! - It's way more action in this game than in BS 1 and 2. :)\n\nThis game will inspire you by the graphics and by the end of the story.\n\nYou have maybe to play it twice to understand this abstract story!\n\nJUST WOW.

The gameplay takes a cue from Bioshock 2 and doesn't turn power use into a chore. The writing is more consistent without an entire act of the game being filler.\n\n[i]Infinite's[/i] own worst enemy is itself. Elizabeth is an extremely compelling character but anyone who saw the previews was waiting for her to start helping directly in battle, only to be disappointed. It's a shame that so much effort went into her and the end result is little more than item retrieval and scripted environmental effects. Having her actually tag along with Booker so she can progress as naturally through the story as he does is amazing in its own right, but in gameplay she falls flat. As simpler as it was, calling Eleanor to my side in [i]Bioshock 2,[/i] basically summoning the game'srecurring miniboss flagged as friendly, felt far more satisfying. Also, why have we gone to a two-weapon system? I find it hard to believe Ken Levine looked at the last two games' inventories and said \"Needs more [i]Halo,[/i]\" yet here we are.\n\nElizabeth may fall flat in gameplay, but it's a joy to have her around for the entire game simply because she's a brilliantly realized character. Her interaction with Booker feels natural. The Lutece twins also steal the show whenever they show up.\n\nWhile the writing doesn't have the first game's pacing problems, it has an entirely [i]different[/i] pacing problem; the ending is incredibly rushed. The vague nuances of it that have seen so much discussion is really the result of this, not the result of actual depth. The ending is obtuse for the sake of being obtuse. At a certain point, the ending stops being about the characters and starts being about how long the characters can talk about quantum mechanics. Additionally, the setting and the conflict set up is very quickly thrown into the background, given only cursory relevance as an obstacle preventing Elizabeth and Booker from leaving Columbia. American exceptionalism is never explored beyond the fact that Comstock is absolutely crazypants nanners. The KKK substitute that one will spend all of ten minutes seeing seems shoehorned in. This isn't just dissapointing for players who kept up with the game's development, it's just sloppy storytelling. The game thinks that by simply bringing up a topic it's providing some sort of deep insight into that topic, but that's not how things work. Unfortunately, [i]Infinite[/i] thinks it's a lot smarter than it actually is.\n\nDespite some problems, Infinite is much better than the first game, but, while this opinion may not be popular, it's not as good as [i]Bioshock 2.[/i]","timestamp_created":1395195809,"timestamp_updated":1395195809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9556383","author":{"steamid":"76561198081543987","num_games_owned":610,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":844,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":350,"last_played":1536031029},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego historia asombrosa y muy viciante.","timestamp_created":1395193678,"timestamp_updated":1395193678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9556202","author":{"steamid":"76561198109625449","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":979,"last_played":1521772342},"language":"english","review":"a rather entertaining game, but a little short given the limited replayability.\nover all still good though.\n","timestamp_created":1395191949,"timestamp_updated":1395191949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9556100","author":{"steamid":"76561198122147298","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1717,"last_played":1498253347},"language":"english","review":"One of the best written games I've played in a long time, this game whilst being very different from the previous in the series, it still keep's a familiar UI and combat style that feel familiar yet totally new.

Однако, через некоторое время, в городе произошло восстание, Колумбия вышла из под контроля и исчезла из поля зрения. Протагонистом игры является бывший сотрудник «Детективного агентства Пинкертона» — Букер ДеВитт. В 1912 году к нему обращается некий человек, знающий местоположение Колумбии, и за высокий гонорар просит его освободить оттуда девушку по имени Элизабет, обладающую сверхъестественными способностями. Запер её туда некий человек по имени Захари Комсток, который верил, что за девушкой стоит огромное будущее и именно она займет место правителя Колумбии. Но вытащить Элизабет оказалось не так легко: на страже у девушки была огромная механическая птица — «Соловей». Чудом, Букеру удалось освободить Элизабет из крепости и теперь они должны выбираться из города, вместе противостоя разнообразным врагам. В ходе путешествия ДеВитту открывается правда о происхождении Элизабет — именно та правда, которую он пытался забыть много лет назад.","timestamp_created":1395155926,"timestamp_updated":1395155926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9541862","author":{"steamid":"76561198047912119","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1460271628},"language":"russian","review":"Игра с захватывающим сюжетом и тяжелыми сражениями.

If you don't edit that, textures will mostly be low quality, until you shove the object in question into your face, at which point, the HQ textures will pop up.  It becomes glaring for things like safes, cash registers and area signs, at least those are immediately noticeable without you even trying.  And that's with everything maxed on a 7970 card. \n\n-No, absolutely NO, meaningful choices whatsoever.  Ok, scratch that, it's more like : TOTALLY MEANINGLESS choices all around, not affecting the story or the outcome in ANY way (yes, that's right), except probably the very first important choice which can yield an outfit part.  And that's it.  I mean, what's the point of discussing religion, slavery, racism, etc, if your character doesn't take a stance on that, besides one minor choice in the beginning which has no impact whatsoever.  They took the roleplaying element of the previous 2 games and put it down in agony.\n\n-No alternate endings whatsoever.  None, nothing, not even a slight variation.  Bioshock, are we even serious? It all boiled down to \"Oh, there are millions of different endings, you just won't see ANY of them because we're lazy, but we'll throw some Elizabeth outfits in there so we can say we gave you alternative endings and you're dumb if you don't get it\".  You don't say...  If you're curious about the ending, better watch it on Youtube and save yourself the trouble.  It's just one ending by the way, the rest is pretentious fanboy-gasm about why it's so awesome...\n\n-Story is based more on the notion of science-is-really-magic mumbojumbo than Rapture's level science fiction (that was a bit questionable, too, but not nearly as ludicrous as Infinite's quantum mumblings.)\n\n-Bugs.  Yes, even after all this time, there are still enough of them.  Elizabeth glitching at random points, a door that leads into the void at Fink Factory, game-breaking bugs like a sequence not playing, resulting in a door not opening, thus locking you out and forcing you to restart the checkpoint.  Bugged texture settings (already mentioned above).\n\n-The Bioshock atmosphere.  It just wasn't there for me.  If you've played the previous 2, you might get it.  Remember how it felt exploring Rapture? Nope, it's not there.  Also, the game feels way too crowded, be it NPCs or enemies, which probably deducts from the usual Bioshock experience.\n\n-No saves, just one checkpoint.  Really... No saves?  I'm pretty sure even last gen's consoles could have multiple saves, and so did the previous Bioshock games, so what the hell happened here?\n\n-Restricted to 2 weapons, cannot carry healing/salt kits.  Sure there's Elizabeth substituting for kits and ammo sometimes but she's not that reliable.  And 2 weapons restriction felt lame compared to the previous 2 games.\n\n-Adding insult to injury, an actual Disney-like song scene.  You know, like when a woman starts singing for no apparent reason, giving apples to kids and all that, something like that.  Are we even serious?  It was so cringe-worthy, I can't find the words.\n\nOnly positive thing I could say about it is Elizabeth(?) I suppose.   She was fun at times, although she can't beat a Rapture Little Sister.  She was still good enough, but let's face it.  You just can't buy this for Elizabeth alone.  \n\nIf you're a fan of the other 2 Bioshock games, you're not missing anything at all and may as well save your money for something else.\nIf you're not, well, it's a run-of-the-mill FPS now, with decent graphics, so you could try it I suppose, although I'm not sure why you'd want to.\nBut it's a 6/10 at best.

Um dos melhores jogos que já joguei na vida.\n\nA História é ótima. Para mim é um tanto difícil contar sendo que o começo pode já ser um spoiler por si só, recomendo vocês terem a experiência cega como eu tive.\n\nA jogabilidade é muito divertida, um pouco datada hoje em dia, mas tem combate rápido e fluido, inimigos moderadamente inteligentes e variedade boa de armas e poderes. Na minha opinião, não envelheceu tão mal nesse aspecto quanto seus antecessores.\n\nConsidero um jogo fácil pois sou péssimo em FPS e consegui zerar o jogo no modo 1999 sem muitos problemas. Platinar o jogo demanda um empenho, tanto para jogar todos os modos de wave quanto pra atirar num inimigo rápido em só uma área.\n\nRecomendo o jogo para todos que puderem jogar, tanto ele quanto as DLCs.

Os cenários do jogo são belissímos, Columbia foi feita nos mínimos detalhes e retrata um estilo americano no início do século passado, impecável!

The weapons did not change visually after upgrading them, the story was confusing, and the ending was a complete mind-****. However, after looking online and reading what people though of the game, I couldn't believe it was recieve such great reviews. In the end, I decided to go back and play the game on hard with an open-mind. Not comparing it to the original like I did the first time around. On my second playthrough I realized what made the game so special and I must say Bioshock Infinite is one of the best gaming experiences that I have had.\n\nStory\nThe story is one of a kind. On my first playthrough, I was not that interested in the story, because I did not pay close enough attention to it. On my second playthrough I collected all of the voxophones and really took my time to take in and admire the scenery/environment. DO NOT RUSH IN THIS GAME - IF YOU DO YOU WILL MISS OUT ON ONE OF THE MOST CREAVTIVE GAMING ENVIRONMENTS EVER CREATED (Adam Sessier stated this and I could not agree with him more). The story is fansinating and makes you think even after you have stopped playing. Story - 9.5 out of 10\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics in Bioshock Infinite are absolutely stunning. The first time I arrived in Columbia, my jaw hit the floor. The setting seems to be so pure and beautiful, until you start to learn Columbia's background. Race, religion, and social themes are all brought to the table in this game. Lighting effects, character models, and structures all look amazing and really create a living breathing world. Graphics - 9 out of 10\n\nAudio\nThe audio in Bioshock Infinite really immerses you in the world of Columbia. Guns sound meaty (especially the shotgun and heater), the screams of enemies sound crisp, and the sky-line sound effect is just down-right cool. I could not ask for anything better. Audio - 9.5 out of 10\n\nGameplay\nThe AI in Bioshock Infinite is decent, but the intelligence of Elizabeth really steals the show. Elizabeth does not get in your way, she helps you during combat, and is constantly pointing out supplies needed by Booker. Vigors are a lot of fun to use and experiment with - my favorite being Undertow. You can draw enemies closer to you, or blow them off of Columbia with a blast of water. All of the guns are fun to use especially the various guns supplied by the Vox Populi. All of the game systems come together to create combat that is exhilarating, fast, and most importantly fun. The tears that Elizabeth can open as well as the sky-lines spaning around the environment also add extra depth to the combat. Gameplay - 9 out of 10\n\nConslusion:\nOverall, Bioshock Infinite is an amazing game that should not be missed by any gamer. It is an experience that I have not had before in any FPS. All aspects of the game come together to create something truly brilliant, and it shows. It dissappoints me that Irrational Games has shut down, and even though 2K Games now has ownership of the Bioshock title, I believe the trilogy is over. Bioshock Infinite is a MUST OWN. Buy it, sit down, and just get lost in story of the man, the girl, and Columbia.\n\nBioshock Infinite = 9.25 out of 10\n\nNow for the DLC portion of the review. Again, this will be SPOILER-FREE and compressed.\n\nClash in the Clouds\nThis DLC provides combat trials across four different maps, however this pack had a lot more content than I expected. You collect money as you go, upgrade your weapons, and purchase items/extras for a showroom. This pack is a lot fun, and if you enjoyed the gameplay aspect of Infinite (like myself) you will love this DLC.\n\n9.0 out of 10\n\nBurial At Sea Episodes 1 & 2\nAlthough both DLCs play very differently, I like to look at both DLCs as a continued story. If you are a Bioshock fan and have played the original Bioshock, these two DLCs are a MUST BUY. Set before the collapse of Rapture, you play as both Booker and Elizabeth in the search for a girl named Sally. I really don't want to get into too much detail regarding these DLCs in fear of spoiling something. I will say that Irrational Games wraps up the Bioshock series nicely. Simply put, you MUST PLAY THESE DLCS. The gameplay is great, and the storytelling is expertly done here. It feels great to be back in Rapture.\n\n9.5 out of 10","timestamp_created":1395082491,"timestamp_updated":1396222731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9514116","author":{"steamid":"76561198073001802","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":414,"last_played":1525641593},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock is the most repeatative game in the world.
