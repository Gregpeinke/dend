Солдаты храбро сражались за Родину, до последней капли крови. Сейчас, у игроков есть шанс побывать на полях сражений Второй Мировой абсолютно ничем не рискуя. Скорее, хватай винтовку (мышку) и вперед (нажимай кнопку W) солдат, на амбразуру! \n\nЭто Вам не Half-Life, и даже не Call of Duty. Тут все по-настоящему (нет). Отдохните от бесконечного Counter-Strike, попробуйте проявить себя в Day of Defeat! :)\nСтавлю 6/10","timestamp_created":1325017750,"timestamp_updated":1491916914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550245344638824463","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2779172","author":{"steamid":"76561198012497804","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":937,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":910,"last_played":1505613210},"language":"english","review":"Orgasmic","timestamp_created":1325017007,"timestamp_updated":1325017007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4271616","author":{"steamid":"76561198034841931","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1732,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1552,"last_played":1532378095},"language":"english","review":"\"I really like the game, but I couldn’t find the stupid cake.\"","timestamp_created":1325014917,"timestamp_updated":1325014917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4240231","author":{"steamid":"76561198034339158","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8703,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6533,"last_played":1572313351},"language":"english","review":"This game is pretty sweet.","timestamp_created":1325014615,"timestamp_updated":1325014615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4339321","author":{"steamid":"76561198035710840","num_games_owned":419,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":214824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":193473,"last_played":1654909328},"language":"english","review":"Didn't play it much, but it was fun.","timestamp_created":1325014521,"timestamp_updated":1417388017,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2461809","author":{"steamid":"76561198007702542","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":2805,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2546,"last_played":1617925231},"language":"english","review":"This game is an excellent class based team shooter with a heavy emphasis on clunky weapons with a lot of recoil. It rewards team play and often times most classes are limited to 2 or even 1 player on a team while the rest play a standard rifleman class. The game still has a dedicated player base even after all this time. Sadly, the players aged with the game and you'll find American servers moderated by literal baby boomers who's sole purpose in life is to tell people not to make political jokes or shoot in spawn. The unfortunate part is you're forced to play on these types of servers because they're the only populated servers most of the time.\n\nTL:DR If you'd like a source team shooter based in WW2, but also don't mind dealing with grumpy old people/playing on russian servers go for it.","timestamp_created":1325013844,"timestamp_updated":1559632996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496183186769485474","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2197877","author":{"steamid":"76561198003887062","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":34806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26082,"last_played":1650223647},"language":"english","review":"You have to play it.
