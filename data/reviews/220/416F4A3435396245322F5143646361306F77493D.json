The player is back as Gordon Freeman, awoken from a long stasis. You discover the creatures from the dimension you ripped into at Black Mesa have now taken over the world and a blended human-alien government called the Combine (appropriately) is in charge. Of course, you're there to wreck all that.\n\nHL2 uses the standard WASD/mouse control scheme, with left mouse to fire your equipped weapons and right mouse for secondary use. You can interact with certain objects and personnel, much like in the first game. You'll get companions at various points, some of whom you can control and order to move with you or fall back.\n\nOne new feature was the inclusion of the gravity gun, a special weapon which will let you pick up mobile objects and hurl them at great force, and that's not all. Grenades can be grabbed from midair and hurled back at your foe, or sawblades shot at zombies (with satisfying results). You can pick up and throw mines and explosive barrels at enemies. You can use it to stack boxes to climb to certain places. If you blast an enemy soldier and he falls out of reach, you can sometimes pull his weapon to yourself for a reload. There's a lot of things you can do with it and overall, I found it to be one of the best components to the game.\n\nI found the combat flowed a little better than the first game, though dealing with the wasp-like gunships was irritating. I did like that compared to the first game, it felt like there were less puzzles to solve--you know, having to make running leaps onto a platform the size of a paperback book to advance. The ones here felt organic and (in general) didn't slow things down too much. Some of the fights allowed experimentation with different strategies, like ones where you have to place turrets to help fend off incoming soldiers.\n\nThe level design is decent and varied. The city blocks of worker quarters and shops evoke a very \"Eastern Europe in the Cold War\" feeling. Ravenholm was creepy and moody, putting off a gothic horror survival vibe. I liked the ambiance of the different zones; like HL1, no two felt exactly alike.\n\nThe story is adequate, though borderline cliched. Voice acting is far better than the first game. The graphics ... well, I admit it looks cleaner and better than HL1, with much more diverse character models and smoother textures but it's still got some rough edges.\n\nNow that I've said all that, I will say that I went through large sections of the game where I did not enjoy myself. A number of enemies (gunships, striders, snipers, certain floor turrets) do an insane amount of damage and are (in the case of the gunship and striders) ridiculously durable, taking numerous RPG rockets to knock out (the only saving grace is these enemies are usually located near an infinite RPG ammo crate). You'll have times when you are under fire and trying to do something that takes timing or precision (specifically in the stupid boat) and it just got annoying. The poison head crabs that basically make you vulnerable to being one-shotted are fast and sometimes hard to hit, and just feel like they're present to be frustrating and slow you down. All of this combined made me realize in places that I just wasn't having fun. I don't play to be frustrated. That's me, not the game, and I get other players may look at it as a challenge and enjoy it, and that's cool.\n\nYou will go through two lengthy vehicle sequences in the first half of the game--the first on an air boat, the second on a dune buggy. I did not enjoy either of these segments. Vehicle controls are clunky and awkward. You have zero protection from enemies in the vehicles and sometimes simply getting them turned the correct direction was a Herculean task. Both went on for a full segment of the game, which means you'll spend about 20% of your playtime in them. Too long. (I admit, with my second partial run, both went better.)\n\nHL2 is stable and runs with minimal hiccups, though sometimes the game would \"go dark\" when I Alt-Tab'bed. I'd come back and have sound but no video, just a blank screen. That might have just been my system.\n\nThe Steam Achievements are relatively simple to get (though you might need a guide to find a few of them) and are independent of game difficulty, so if you are really having trouble with some--like fighting through Ravenholm on just the gravity gun (which is probably the hardest achievement)--dial it down to easy. I finally got it on Medium but doing so probably caused more swearing than it was worth.\n\nIn the end I still have to give this a thumbs up, because I think a lot of it is my own personal taste and I suspect others may enjoy it more than me. There is enough fun to be had, especially if you were a fan of the first one.I suspect I would have enjoyed this much more playing it when it released but having spent the last fifteen years playing more modern shooters, it just wasn't as much fun as I hoped it would be. Your mileage may vary.\n\nPros\n- Enjoyable combat & gravity gun!\n- Interesting level design\n\nCons\n- Vehicle sequences went on far too long\n- Just didn't enjoy myself for wide swaths of the game\n\nFinal Score: 6.5/10","timestamp_created":1600862761,"timestamp_updated":1612054630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76423452","author":{"steamid":"76561198259441019","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2416,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1677,"last_played":1654269508},"language":"english","review":"Its Half-Life2, why wouldnt you want it you freak","timestamp_created":1600862559,"timestamp_updated":1600862559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525696516036987305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76422043","author":{"steamid":"76561198179486503","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5402,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":4036,"last_played":1659710843},"language":"english","review":"yes.","timestamp_created":1600859703,"timestamp_updated":1600859703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76421151","author":{"steamid":"76561198929911859","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2212,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":824,"last_played":1654502748},"language":"russian","review":"Одна из самых моих любимых игр, если не самая любимая.

It is a companion game to Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative survival game with construction elements. It was initially released in early access on September 26, 2017, for Microsoft Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, followed by ports for iOS,[b] Android,[b] and Nintendo Switch the following year. Epic dropped the early access label for the game on June 29, 2020. Versions for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are planned for when they launch in late 2020.\n\nThe concept of the game is similar to previous games of the genre: 100 players skydive onto an island and scavenge for gear to defend themselves from other players. Players can fight alone (Solo), with one additional player (Duos), or with a group of up to three others (Squads). As the match progresses, the playable area within the island gradually constricts, giving the players less and less room to work with. The last player or team alive wins the match. The main distinction from others in the genre is the game's construction elements, letting players build walls, obstacles, and other structures from collected resources to take cover from incoming fire or give one a strategic view advantage. Battle Royale uses a seasonal approach with battle passes to introduce new character customization content in the game, as well as limited time events, some of which correspond with changes to the game map. Since its initial release, several other game modes have been introduced, including \"Battle Lab\" and \"Party Royale\".\n\nThe idea for Battle Royale arose following the release of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds in 2017, a similar battle royale game that was highly successful but noted for its technical flaws. Originally released as part of the early access version of Save the World, Epic later transitioned the game to a free-to-play model funded by microtransactions. Following its rise in popularity, Epic split the development team, with one focusing on Battle Royale and the other on Save the World.\n\nBattle Royale received positive reviews from critics, who praised its learning curve, gameplay, art style, multiplayer and progression system, but noted its similarity to previous games in the genre.
