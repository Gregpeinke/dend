Pour y avoir joué en le \"rushant\", il doit faire un peu plus d'une heure, montre en main. Lorsque vous le découvrez pour la première fois -et/ou que vous prenez le temps pour savourer les dialogues de GLaDOS-, environ 1h45 - 2h15. C'est dire qu'il est court. Heureusement, des salles de test avancées sont présentes et vous permettront de poursuivre le plaisir.\n\nQuant aux points positifs ils sont légions (gameplay, histoire, \"the cake is a lie\" etc...) mais j'aimerais pointer du doigt l'Element qui fait de Portal un bon jeu: GLaDOS. \n\nAmusante, cynique, machiavélique... Il y a beaucoup d'adjectif qui permettraient de décrire GLaDOS. Pour ma part, je n'en citerais qu'un: essentielle. GLaDOS est essentiel à Portal. C'est ce personnage qui fait que ce jeu est génial. Et, quand on sait qu'Hitchcock disait qu'un bon film = un bon méchant, il n'avait sans doute pas tort.\n\nBref, Portal est un excellent jeu, que je ne peux que vous recommander!

No other words. Get this and the sequel; portal 2, and have hours of an amazing storyline, in a simple but extremely effective FPS style game. It is unique in many ways, and this is one of the reasons why i like it so much. Definately play portal 1 before 2 though. 8/8 M8.","timestamp_created":1439632593,"timestamp_updated":1439632593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517921745777130127","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17544387","author":{"steamid":"76561198127925305","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":762,"last_played":1529040700},"language":"english","review":"i have played this game so many times so much that i started to speedrun the game if you are thinking about getting this game i highly recommend this game even if you already have played portal 2.","timestamp_created":1439605469,"timestamp_updated":1439605469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17543618","author":{"steamid":"76561198109278214","num_games_owned":396,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":301,"last_played":1512834753},"language":"schinese","review":"流程虽短 但创意不错 结尾主题曲也很带感 玩了部分评论音轨才了解到了每个细节原来都是精心设计的 高级地图还待挑战","timestamp_created":1439600543,"timestamp_updated":1439600543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17542851","author":{"steamid":"76561198018243013","num_games_owned":1340,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":54,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54,"last_played":1342162800},"language":"english","review":"","timestamp_created":1439595955,"timestamp_updated":1439595955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17541770","author":{"steamid":"76561198084553516","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1618112693},"language":"english","review":"the game that inspired portal 2 (2011)","timestamp_created":1439590302,"timestamp_updated":1640281769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17540679","author":{"steamid":"76561198131619287","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":608,"last_played":1459041455},"language":"english","review":"\"WWWWWWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\"","timestamp_created":1439585305,"timestamp_updated":1440460757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17540374","author":{"steamid":"76561198154276483","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":383,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":1591693808},"language":"english","review":"Stop looking for un-reccomended comments and press purchase.
