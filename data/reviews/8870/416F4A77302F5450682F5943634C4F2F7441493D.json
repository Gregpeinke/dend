Mas o que é tudo isso ? \nA saga BioShock em si não é super popular no mundo dos games, mas que jogou recomenda, por causa da construção de história e do desenvolvimento de personagens, nesse vemos o ápice de tudo isso. Você controla Booker na missão de salvar Elizabeth, até aqui você sabe(Ta na sinopse), mas o que não fala é que Elizabeth é o jogo, tudo acontece por causa dela e 95% do carisma do jogo também é por causa dela. Não tem como não apaixonar pela Elizabeth, ao menos você quer ajudar ela, por que se vê o desenvolvimento tremendo da personagem conforme o tempo passa e você fica na pele do Booker se perguntando as mesmas coisas que ele, então você ta em sintonia com o seu personagem, que feito da Irrational em fazer a Elizabeth. \nMas e o resto do jogo? Se você quiser nem ligar pra História(oq é muito difícil), vai encontrar um jogo muito divertido e frenético, basicamente o jogo todo é você pulando de um lado pro outro atirando em um monte de inimigos variados, que exigem tratamento diferente. É muito divertido, a capacidade de usar poderes(Marca da Saga BioShock) e de controlar o cenário, dá pra preparar tudo antes de sair atirando por ai, claro que tudo precisa de estratégia se não você vai morrer muitas vezes.

Since, we were dealing with large number of enemies we were also consuming resources very fast. But game dealt with this issue very well by placing at least required amount of resources around and even letting Elizabeth to supply player automatically. This feature really connects players who do not like looting much to game. \nVariety of guns and plasmids makes player able to choose own playing style but if player does not stick with a few of them their variety might become overwhelming after mid-game.\nZip-line mechanic is geniously placed into game, adds variation into combat and makes player able to fully experiance atmosphere.\n\nThere is nothing much to say for story telling and atmosphere of the Bioshock Infinite. Its one of the best examples of its kind. Every corner of this game is designed diligently. This game is not teliing you story with only dialogues, characters.

Díky bohu můžu říct že se 3 díl této série opravdu povedl. Nebudu vypisovat celý děj protože je velmi složitý a nejspíše až hru dohrajete budete velmi zmatení, nebojte se. Na první průchod jsem celý děj také nepochopil, avšak to zas tak nevadí protože děj je briliatní a to jak se postavy v průběhu hry vyvíjejí je neuvěřitelné. Záporáci a zvraty ve hře jsou moc hezky udělané a na konci hry skončíte s otevřenou pusou. Bojový systém je zábavný, je zde velká škála zbraní, ADAMA a i jiných způsobů jak vaše nepřátele zabít a celkově je bojový systém velmi zábavný. Hratelnost byla v předešlých dílech trochu jednotvárná což u Infinite neplatí. Celkově Infinite zlepšuje mínusy minulých dílů, avšak atmosféra Rapture zde lehce chybí chybí. 9.5/10.","timestamp_created":1606582805,"timestamp_updated":1615548295,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80896611","author":{"steamid":"76561198038329548","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1349,"last_played":1606621927},"language":"koreana","review":"긴말 필요없고 사서 해라.","timestamp_created":1606582233,"timestamp_updated":1606582233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80894016","author":{"steamid":"76561199003192718","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":653,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":653,"last_played":1606581273},"language":"schinese","review":"出人意料的故事","timestamp_created":1606581367,"timestamp_updated":1606581367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80893395","author":{"steamid":"76561198179052879","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":161,"last_played":1587292270},"language":"schinese","review":"1111","timestamp_created":1606581139,"timestamp_updated":1606581139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80887897","author":{"steamid":"76561198343239502","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":651,"last_played":1606579164},"language":"english","review":"Mindblowing","timestamp_created":1606579316,"timestamp_updated":1606579316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80878569","author":{"steamid":"76561198110968627","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3589,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2826,"last_played":1651023466},"language":"english","review":"This is actually masterpiece.
