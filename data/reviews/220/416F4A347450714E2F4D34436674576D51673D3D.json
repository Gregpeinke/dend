Everything checks out and the levels never seem to become dull, repetitive or boring. The storyline may make no sense if you simply breeze through the game and don't pay attention to the dialogue, though if you take the time to listen, it becomes a lot more gripping and really emerses you, making you feel like you are Gordon Freeman. The voice acting is some of the best I have seen in games, and to be honest, I don't like giving games perfect judgements, though I cannot find criticism with the game(except the fact that that Half Life 2 Episode 3 is taking so long due to Gabe Newell's inability to do simple maths. Hint for Gabe: ABC is not as easy as 12, there's another number after the two, and it isn't 2.1 or 2.2).  \n\nIn conclusion, this game is still great and will continue to be.

O inicio é bem parecido com o primeiro jogo, mostrando os elementos a serem usados durante o mesmo, uma espécie de tutorial, mas sem as idiotices de serem chamadas de tutorial. É nesta hora que você vai perceber se sabe ou não jogar um FPS. Passando por esta parte inicial, a jogabilidade do mesmo demostra que se faz necessário ter certas habilidades para avançar no jogo, mais por conta da Engine física Havok que permite manipular, agora, os objetos caídos ao chão.\n\nCom vários inimigos com capacidades ofensivas e defensivas bastante diferenciadas, o jogador tem de saber quando usar o pé-de-quebra, a metralhadora, uma granada ou a escopeta, use a arma errada e perca dezenas de pontos de energia.\n\nO que mais impressiona, no entanto, é a forma que a história foi contada, tudo entre as sombras, e que esperamos que haja a continuação devida, pois queremos ver qual será o final de Gordon Freeman.\n\nHalf-Life 2 é uma obra de arte gamer e, merecidamente, recebeu o prêmio de O JOGO DA DÉCADA ano passado...\n\nBem que a
