wish I could have a neutral option for reviews but since there isn't I'm leaning more towards telling you it's not that great. Let's get the good out of the way, for starters the environments are awesome and very well put together. The graphical style of the game is also great and compliments the environment a lot. Lastly for the good the guns themselves are really nice with good modeling, sound, and animation. Now for all the negatives. First a more minor complaint, Vigor is just not as effective as Plasmids. The only ones I found myself using consistently were Bucking Bronco, Undertow, and Return To Sender. The rest were just crappier versions of Plasmids from the previous game. Next point is the biggest gripe I have with the title, difficulty and AI. You know how FEAR has some of the best AI on the market, picture the exact opposite. Enemies are completely braindead and the only way the game likes to compensate for this is by making them bullet spongy as hell. Granted there were some spongier enemies in Bioshock 1 and 2 but they were much more enjoyable to fight and had a much wider range of attack options. Going even further we have the gear and weapon limit. These just make the game so dreadful to get through considering in 1 and 2 there was no weapon limit and the amount of gear you could have on hand was exceptional. In Infinite you have a 2 weapon limit that can only be upgraded to 3 weapons total and you can only have 4 gear items equipped. You could say that in 1 and 2 that's overpowered but that's simply not true because the game progressed in a way where that didn't happen. In conclusion this game has an awesome narrative. great voice acting, and lovely environments but simply lacks the sheer amount of gameplay depth that 1 and 2 had and is just an absolute disappointment for me.","timestamp_created":1603130437,"timestamp_updated":1603130437,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77823082","author":{"steamid":"76561198200598287","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":900,"last_played":1603081943},"language":"spanish","review":"si","timestamp_created":1603130400,"timestamp_updated":1603130400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77822650","author":{"steamid":"76561198351815255","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2935,"last_played":1603127735},"language":"english","review":"Whoa..","timestamp_created":1603129804,"timestamp_updated":1603129804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77821865","author":{"steamid":"76561198262958473","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":841,"last_played":1632870075},"language":"turkish","review":"Müthiş atmosferi, harika savaş sistemi, müthiş hikayesi resmen aşık oldum oyunu kesinlikle göz atın (Not: Bioshock 1 ve 2 nin hikayesinden tamamen bağımsız bir yapım direk bu oyunu oynuyabilirsiniz)","timestamp_created":1603128741,"timestamp_updated":1603128741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77821363","author":{"steamid":"76561198849946100","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":4523,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4211,"last_played":1603864983},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente juego!

It's okay\nAs a Bioshock game? Horrendously disappointing.\n  Now let me preface a few things, i was VERY excited to play this game, i knew going in that it was not like the past two games, and i was read and open to have a new experience and story.\n  Now the problem is.... i called the story HOURS before i actually got to the reveal, by accident. I was just thinking to myself and laughing \"wouldn't it be stupid if....?\"\nThe stupid things happened. The things i was laughing about because they were trope-filled and done to death were actual events. There's even these G-Man characters that pop up throughout the story and just be... annoying. That's all i really have to say about them.\nI'm really trying to not spoil anything but i will say this... The reality is not linear, things branch. (unlike the story)\n\n  Keep in mind, i went into this game blind, on a short binge of the bioshock games 1 through infinite.\n\n  Gameplay-wise, i actually had a lot of fun. The game has a health system where you have shields that regen and health that doesn't. With this, the combat is much more action heavy, with large arenas and cover points here and there. All the guns felt unique, powers were fun to use....\nThis did not last long for me.\nCombat became a chore around the middle of the game. Especially in the areas where the ziplines were a core mechanic, making battles a big confusing mess where EVERYBODY was zipping around and nobody, me included, was hitting anything. Plus, i never really needed any other power other than the fire one.\nI played this game on normal, expecting it to be more fast and brutal like the old games, so it's not that i was on easy or anything....\n\n  And yes i have to address Elizabeth. I didn't like her, at ALL. She's another done-to-death innocent damsel pretty girl with super powers, and one who seems to not understand the stakes of escaping??? There's a whole scene where she argues with Booker over killing people. Leading to something I am so tired of hearing \"Nooooo killing bad!!!\" \"I'm sorry sweetheart, but as tough male protag, it is my way, we must do this if we want to live.\"\n\n  I think i would have so much more forgiveness for this game if it didn't have BIOSHOCK slapped on the title like it has anything to do with the first two games (and don't get me started on the burial at sea DLC, i won't have any of that)\n\n  I wanna say a few things in this game's favor though, it's not all bad, there was a LOT of work put into this game.\nPresentation = Amazing\nVoice acting = Great\nWorld design = Breathtaking\n\n  So my advice is this, if you LOVE Bioshock 1 and 2, do not play this. It is not Bioshock.\nIf you're going to play this as it's own game.... maybe? Maybe you'll have more fun than i did. Maybe the story will catch you by surprise. I think it's just because i've watched SO MANY movies and read so many books as a kid that i have this much experience with similar story beats. I'm a little jaded, to be fair. The set-pieces and story-heavy moments were actually very good (except for the ending, which made no kerflippin' sense at all, and happens so abruptly that i had to ask myself \"Is that it?\").\n\n  Ugh.... the more I look at this game the more mixed i feel, and the more i want to rip into it. Just please make an informed decision before you buy this game. Maybe watch some spoiler-free gameplay videos and see if it looks fun to you.","timestamp_created":1603120487,"timestamp_updated":1626587306,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77815261","author":{"steamid":"76561198844088247","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1572,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":812,"last_played":1615639431},"language":"turkish","review":"Öncelikle ilk 2 seriyi oynamadım ve  ona göre yazıyorum bu incelemeyi hikayeden başlayalım hikaye temel olarak iyi ama işleyiş kötü hikaye pek iyi anlatılmıyor ve karakterlerden ise elizabeth ve booker iyi karakterler\ngerçekten birlikte yolculuk yapmak güzel aralarındaki baba kız ilişkisi güzel gelişiyor ve sonucuda yani oyunun sonu gerçekten şaşırıyorsunuz ama oyunun maskotu uçan dev robot kuş pek gözükmüyor ve hikayede sonlara doğru anca tam anlamda kullanılıyor yan karakterlerden  ilgimi çeken bir karakter olmadı grafikler güzel yeterli oynanışa gelelim özel güçler farklı elementler içersede birkaç özel güç dışında hepsinin görevi ya öldürme ya sersemletme pek kullanmaya ihtiyaç duymadım daha detaylı olsaymış iyi olurmuş silahlar ne çok az ne çok çeşitli yeterli denebilir oyunun dünyası güzel şehir güzel tasarlanmış ve gittiğimiz yerler güzel sesler güzel müzikler iyi vuruş hissiyatı iyi oyun genel olarak iyi fakat erken çıkmak zorunda kalmayıp oyundan da \nçoğu materyali çıkarmasalardı daha iyi bir oyun olabilirdi ama fps türünü seviyorsanız indirime girince alabilirsiniz puanım 70 \n","timestamp_created":1603119563,"timestamp_updated":1603119563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77814670","author":{"steamid":"76561198146616609","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":2485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":1608215861},"language":"schinese","review":"666","timestamp_created":1603118706,"timestamp_updated":1603118706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77812670","author":{"steamid":"76561199088140750","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1041,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1603890241},"language":"english","review":"Heard a lot about this game for years and finally had the energy to play it, let me tell you one thing...

Also most magical powers you have feel very similar to each other, they stun your enemy and do some damage, you don't feel like you have a variety of powers.

Gerçekten çok bayıldım... Ben BioShock serisine hep başlamak istiyordum ve almayı planlıyordum ve 1-2 ay önce şansıma BioShock Collection paketi indirime girdi sadece 24 liraya. Bende aldım ve ilk BioShock 1 den başladım sonuçta serinin ilk oyunuydu. Ancak ben BioShock 1 den çok tatmin olamadım zaten oyunu sadece 2 saat oynadım ve oyunda takılı kaldım. Sonra da öyle kaldı oyunu hiç açamaz hale geldim. Diğer başka oyunlara yöneldim ben o günler de. BioShock 2 yi ise hiç açmadım zaten ama BioShock Infinite i çok oynamak istiyordum. Serinin en iyi oyunu diyenler var Infinite'e, en iyi FPS oyunlarından birisi olarak gösteriliyordu. Tabi birinci oyunu da öyle gösteriyordu ve ben ondan hiç tatmin olamadım ve bu yüzden bir şüpheye düştüm, acaba BioShock Infinite'e demi aynısı olurdu diye, Ben Infinite'i ilk iki oyunun sonrasını anlatıyor diye düşündüğüm için hala birinci oyununu oynamam gerekiyordu. Ancak sonra dan öğrendim ki BioShock Infinite devam oyunu değilmiş. Bu iki oyunun dışında kalıyor. Bende fırsatımı burada kullanarak Infinite'e başladım, eğer bundan da tatmin olamasaydım oyunu direk silecektim zaten öyle duracaktı kütüphanem de.\n\nAma yanıldım...\n\nBioShock Infinite beni baya etkiledi. Beni bir oyun etkileyince benim için özel oyunlardan birisi olabiliyor. Hayır, burada oyuna başyapıt demiyorum, hiç bir oyun başyapıt değildir. Nereden başlasam övmeye bilemiyorum... Hikaye den başlıyorum. Oyunun hikayesi mükemmel, gerçekten mükemmel... Benim uzun zamandır böyle bir oyuna ihtiyacım varmış gibi hissediyorum... Hikayeyi hiç özetlememe gerek yok zaten popüler incelemelerde güzelce özetlenmiş. Kendime bile inanamıyorum ama ben bir oyunu gün de genelde bitirecek isem 1-2 saat oynarım bu yüzden bitirmem zaman alır. Ama BioShock Infinite'e 2 gün önce başladım, o gün 1 saat oynadım, dün 4 saat oynadım ve bugün de 4 saat oynayarak oyunu bitirdim, 9 saat de bitti ve 9 saat buna değdi, Aslında 10-11 saate bitiririm diye düşünüyordum ama 9 saat beni şaşırttı. Gerçekten oyunu oynadığım her zaman beni başından kaldıramadı, gerçekten çok eğlendim ya. Aynı Portal 2'yi ilk kez oynadığım zamanları hatırlattı, onun başından hiç kalkamıyordum zamanın da. BioShock Infinite'in başı zaten beni oyunda tutmayı başardı. \n\nOyunun oynanışı baya güzel, hikayesi ve senaryosu zaten çok çok iyi, oyunda ki atmosfer bir oyunda gördüğüm en iyi atmosterlerden birisi. Oyunun başını oynarken Columbia'ya geldiğim de şu sözleri söylemiştim \"Oha anasının amı\" ekran görüntüsü bile aldım, oyunun öyle manzaraları var ki ekran görüntüsü almak istiyorsunuz birden. Oyunun vuruş hissi çok iyi, bir çok silah çeşidi var oyun da ve bunların her biri çok iyi, ayrıca yetenek sistemi var aynı ilk oyunda ki gibi, 8 tane yeteneğiniz oluyor oyun da ilerledikçe. Bunları hatta geliştirebiliyoruz bir makine ile ama para lazım, Etrafta 3 tane farklı makine var, birisinden mermi, can, salt (yetenekleri kullanabilmek için gerekli bir bar şeysi) alabiliyorsunuz, diğer birinden yeteneklerinizi geliştiriyorsunuz ve diğer birinden ise silah kullanma yeteneklerinizi geliştirebiliyorsunuz, paranızı tabi iyi harcayın, ve aklınız da olsun her öldüğünüzde para kaybediyorsunuz, ölmemeye çalışın. Oyunda ki ana karakterler gerçekten çok iyi, Booker DeWitt ve Elizabeth benim aklımda kalanlardan oldu ki Booker DeWitt'i şuan da Discord profil fotoğrafım olarak kullanıyorum. \n\nKesinlikle alın ve oynayın, indirim de bu oyun 12 liraya düşüyor hatta direk BioShock Collection 24 liraya düşüyor onu da alabilirsiniz.

Bioshock Infinite takes a whole lot of steps forward and a handful back from its predecessors. Overall I'll say it's the best one in the series and entirely separated from the previous two Bioshocks(take 1 throwback).\n\nIn terms of gameplay Bioshock Infinite streamlines the old \"quickswap\" gameplay Bioshock 1 and 2 had in favor of a much simpler system with better gunplay. Consequently the game loses a lot of depth to make it more appealing to a wider crowd. I personally dislike this choice, but I can understand that is what newer times demand. You can now equip up to 2 weapons and 2 \"Vigors\"(the equivalent of \"Plasmids\"). As is presumably a throwback to the original Bioshock you should probably just stick with lightning and some complementary ability. Due to the limited choice in concurrent weapons/abilities you can now conveniently swap them with a single button press. It's easy to pilot but does feel a little bland after a while.\n\nInfinity's worst enemy is visual clarity and a lack of consistency(gameplay wise); you will very frequently be shooting at enemies you can barely see or get shot in the back because enemies spawn from absolutely everywhere. There are also a lot of \"suckerpunch\"-like encounters where the situation gives you no real time to adapt to what is going on. The \"Handyman\"(obvious equivalent of and throwback to the Big daddies) are a big offender in this. As a result combat floats between piss easy and really chaotic. The game was never truly challenging for me on \"normal\". The reason I opted for \"normal\"(from three options) is what brings me to an important difference between Infinite and it's predecessors; resource management. In Bioshock 1 and 2 resource management was a huge deal as in System shock tradition. This has been pruned almost entirely much to my liking. I feared Infinite would be as stingy in giving out ammunition as the previous games were.\n\nThe sound design is very good. The graphics are very good. The environmental art is lovely. The world building is a little bit... too obvious. The voice acting is top shelf throughout the entire game. The characters, if not a little bit too obvious, are generally well written. Some encounters will come off as a little cliche/forced whereas others are genuinely witty and surprising. The story twists and turns like we're used to from Bioshock, but in a much, much more shocking way. I don't think it'll be easy to outdo Infinite in that regard. They depict the protagonist as rather boorish, which allows you as player to catch up with things much faster than he does - but the game still manages to make a fool of you after the arrogance firmly kicked in. I don't think any game has ever achieved this for me outside of Bioshock Infinite.\n\nBooker is the crude, dogged and rather boorish protagonist. You'll go from liking, to disliking, to liking to hating him if you're anything like me. Elizabeth is a little more subtle in terms of character writing. You'll really grow attached to the latter through how the game integrated her in the core gameplay loop and occasional dialogue interactions. Even though I found some of the mechanics associated with her very jarring and somewhat obnoxious I did not mind the repeated \"here Booker I found X!\"(which has spawned a bit of a meme). Having Elizabeth throw a rifle at you while you're firing at hostiles is an action movie come true.\n\nThe story arcs from cliche and outlandish to \"a little too slow\" before hitting you with a hammer in the end.
