I noticed it received good reviews and I really enjoyed the original so I thought it was a no-brainer. This game does not attempt to create the amazing atmosphere from BioShock. The moral dilemma of harvesting children is gone. Instead, Infinite is an extremely linear shooter void of any character development that relies on a \"twist\" at the end to redeem itself. I fails in my opinion. The gameplay was a big downer for me. The Elizabeth character is AWFUL. I wanted to kill her myself. The developers built in a system where she randomly finds money and ammo and gives it to the player. It is done through a cut scene and cannot be avoided if you accept the item. This is so incredibly annoying. I the middle of a fire fight, you accept ammo from Elizabeth and end up getting shot all to hell while the cut scene plays out. Her dialogue is also grating. Every time you direct her to pick a lock she gives one of a few smart ass replies. \"No problem\" or \"Give me a real challenge\" are examples. Having to hear the same trite dialogue with every lock pick made me not want to use her at all.

Many times I wanted to decide to just watch a playthrough of it on YouTube, because I wanted to experience the story without having to deal with the gameplay. But I held off on that as well. I made up my mind during the Steam summer sale and finished it within about 10 hours.\n\nIt goes without saying at this point that the story of this game is masterfully crafted and really throws your mind for a loop. I wasn't smart enough to understand everything right away, but after some deep digging on the interwebz, and some help from a good friend of mine who's played the game multiple times, I started to make sense of things and was completely in awe. I also like how the game pulled an Inception TWICE at the end, before and after the credits, leaving things open-ended. Really gets you thinking.\n\nThe gameplay was the one thing that made me iffy with this game in the first place. I like first person games, but not traditional shooters. Give me a game like Mirror's Edge, Skyrim and Dishonored and I would have no qualms with it. But if it's a full-on SHOOTER, that'll give me some doubts. However, I did find myself having SOME fun with it, surprisingly. Although I will say that the gameplay does get in the way of the story most of the time. The combat and battles were just...there, for no particular reason other than to remind me that I'm playing a video game.\n\nAt the end of the day, the story outshines the gameplay by a longshot. If you were in a discussion where everyone was pumped up and discussing the game, they would only talk about the story. If someone said \"How about that gameplay, though?\", there would be awkward silence and shrugs before they continue discussing the plot again.\n\nI suppose I'm just not very happy with how this game seemed split about wanting to be a narrative-focused shooter or a shooter than happens to have an amazing plot. I wish they had made this game an RPG perhaps, and allowed us to interact more with the environment, and also minimized the combat elements which felt very phoned-in to me and definitely immersion-breaking.\n\nI have nothing bad to say about the story whatsoever, but the gameplay does feel lackluster to me. Regardless, I still enjoyed myself for the most part. But a huge chunk of that enjoyment mostly came from simply exploring around and finding the various audio recordings and secrets in the game that give some interesting insight to the world of it. I felt pretty indifferent about the combat, and I played on the easiest difficulty since the biggest reason I avoid shooters is that I can't play them worth sh*t.\n\nI may dislike FPS games but I don't HATE them, so I was still able to push through. However, if you're someone who DOES hate FPS games, then I would suggest watching a playthrough of it so you can experience the story without having to deal with the gameplay.","timestamp_created":1434719937,"timestamp_updated":1434720296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16523071","author":{"steamid":"76561198013601116","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1791,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1423,"last_played":1443977098},"language":"portuguese","review":"11/10 would blow my mind again","timestamp_created":1434717443,"timestamp_updated":1434717443,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576539874076843262","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16522942","author":{"steamid":"76561198005921844","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":484,"last_played":1417728193},"language":"italian","review":"Stile e dettaglio grafico notevoli ma per il resto questo gioco è una cocente delusione: giocabilità debolissima e sporadica, storia inizialmente interessante ma con risvolti e temi già ampiamenti abusati (narratore inaffidabile, relatività) totalmente prevedibile, impossibile consigliarlo.","timestamp_created":1434717030,"timestamp_updated":1434717030,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16522259","author":{"steamid":"76561197970323468","num_games_owned":691,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":137,"last_played":1428804161},"language":"english","review":"This was an amazing game.
