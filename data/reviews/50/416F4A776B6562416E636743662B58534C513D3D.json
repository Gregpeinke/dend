So wäre da etwa Corporal Shepard, der zur gleichen Zeit wie Freeman in Black Mesa unterwegs war. In Opposing Force, dem erste AddOn zu Half-Life, wird seine Geschichte erzählt.\n\nWer bereits das Hauptspiel gespielt hat, wird sich von der Spielmechanik her sofort zuhause fühlen, jedoch einige interessante Ergänzungen bemerken, die das Spiel sehr bereichern. So werden etwa neben neuen, konventionellen Waffen auch organische Alienwaffen und anspruchsvollere Gegner eingeführt oder auch die Möglichkeit geboten, mit anderen Soldaten in den Kampf zu ziehen.\n\nWas die Handlung angeht, ist Opposing Force insofern von Interesse, als dass man einige Hintergründe zu den Abläufen in Black Mesa erfährt und erleben kann, was sich während der Handlung von Half-Life sonst noch abgespielt hat. Zudem werden aufmerksame Spieler mit einigen Anspielungen und netten Easter Eggs belohnt.\n\nInsgesamt ist Opposing Force ein gutes Spiel mit einem guten Tempo, das auf jeden Fall mehr Aufmerksamkeit verdient hat. Einziger Wehrmutstropfen: Die deutsche Fassung ist geschnitten.","timestamp_created":1416157591,"timestamp_updated":1416157591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12956587","author":{"steamid":"76561198021137678","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":103,"playtime_forever":328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":328,"last_played":1374335646},"language":"english","review":"Too easy, still fun though.","timestamp_created":1416080922,"timestamp_updated":1416080922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12939468","author":{"steamid":"76561198076151054","num_games_owned":941,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":172,"last_played":1418837581},"language":"english","review":"A pretty good expansion to the classic half life anthology.

The gameplay in Opposing Force was generally improved over the original Half-Life. However, I was not a big fan of the platforming (in either game). The hookshot mechanics in Opposing Force were particularly poor. The game has three difficulties.

If you enjoyed Half-Life... you may find Opposing Force a little disappointing. In brief; Opposing Force puts you in the shoes of Adrian Shepard... one of the Soldiers sent in to 'clean up' Black Mesa.  Of course things go horribly wrong and you wind up fighting for your survuival and the fate of the world.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* Most of the good things about Half-Life carry over.\n* New and interesting Enemies\n* New and interesting Weapons to kill New and Interesting Enemies with.\n* Explore New Areas of Black Mesa\n\nAll in all a solid expansion and the idea of having a squad of specialize d soldiers to help you with is always great and leads to some interesting challenges. The Alien X Race also makes for tough antagonists. THe new black ops are also a joy.\n\nThe Bad\n\n\n* Mundane Area Design.\n* Bad Lighting\n* Disjointed STory\n* Gimmicky\n\nYeah, the biggest problem here is the lighting. I know Gearbox thought their Light Amp thingie was cool and it admittedly better than the flash light but... it's not practically to have the areas so dark you have to leave it on half the txchuffin time. You will be seeing alot of green in this game.\n\nAlso the level design ... is dodgey. As in you don't quite feel the interconnection between the areas. In short they feel more like levels and less like actual parts pof a facility in some cases. A minor quibble. Also there are a timed few trial and error sections that will annoy you.\n\nLastly it does feel Gimmickjy. SInce you spend most of your time fighting the allien X creatures... it's actually easy to forget that you're in the same Black Mesa as Gordon freeman and Barney Calhoun. It Might as well have been a different facility all together.\n\nOut of the two expansions this feels like the most tangental of them, and the least polished. There's also not much of the story being woven into the background, and it simply lacks the pacing of either Half-Life or Blue Shift.\n\nNot that it is a bad game.. it's still quite good but it is a step down rather than hup. Thankffully Half Life raised the bar enough that even a step down is still a high mark.","timestamp_created":1413804363,"timestamp_updated":1413804363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.423102855682373047","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12575591","author":{"steamid":"76561198104361190","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1187,"last_played":1615610161},"language":"english","review":"In the first expansion to Half-Life, you play as Adrian Shephard, a soldier who was part of the special forces military unit that was meant to wipe out pretty much anything that moves during the first game.

Unlike Blue Shift, Opposing Force adds in many new character models, enemies, weapons, and even game mechanics. The storyline itself is very much reflective of Half-Life, following a similar pattern and progression, even the same themes.\n\nThe game is difficult, arguably unfairly at times. It's thankfully mitigated my Half-Life's lovely quicksave/quickload system, which I found myself relying more and more on as the game progressed, to the point of literally save-scumming certain battles repeatedly just to ensure I had enough health to move on effectively. I would not recommend normal/hard difficulties to those not already very comfortable with Half-Life mechanics.\n\nFollower/squad AI is abysmal. No really, it's not even functional, but I feel like this is an engine limitation. AI companions are certainly not underpowered, but their ability to actually follow you at all is shoddy at best. Additionally there's apparently nothing in their scripting to tell them, \"don't shoot if the player character is between you and the target,\" because at one point I found myself killed by an overenthusiastic squadmate who was directly behind me. Thankfully, sections of the game incorporating AI companions are very short, rarely going beyond a couple rooms.\n\nThose couple gripes aside, the game is phenomenal and a must-play for fans of the original Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1412410235,"timestamp_updated":1412410235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12342962","author":{"steamid":"76561198077090888","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":461,"last_played":1655080986},"language":"english","review":"Extremely fun, I especially LOVED the alien weapons such as the Barnacle and the Shock Roach.

By the time I was old enough to truly appreciate the games I grew up seeing my father and brother playing, Half-Life wasn't quite at the cutting edge, but still I loved it to bits.\n\nSo to expand upon what was already for me an iconic game was very appealing. I picked up the Half-Life Anothology (which also included Blue-Shift) and started Opposing Force. The atmosphere is very much similar to the original Half-Life, but the expanded themes, puzzles, weapons and 'monsters' made the experience much deeper. The fights are harder, ammunition can get pretty scarce and managing the skillsets of your fleeting (and somewhat disposable) squadmates makes for more thought-provoking tactics and gameplay. \n\nI liked the classes of friendly grunts, each having their own particular value. Keeping the Medics alive in the later stages is a must as medkits dry up and the Xen alien forces become stronger and more diverse. The heavys and engineers too have their own role (although the latter only have certain points at which they are useful). The AI is somewhat improved over the original (or at least I thought so), and the aliens aren't simply using the rush tactic all the time. Some will take time to think about flanking and flushing you out of fixed positions with ranged explosives.\n\nGraphically, the story is the same as the original (and Blue Shift, with the HD pack installed) and you will meet many familair allies and enemies, though both have variances that seem merely cosmetic. The design of the new enemies is very much in keeping with the original, and overall they make a very much positive impact. The locales too are what you'd expect from Black Mesa architecture, with some overlap with HL levels (which I suppose are justified).\n\nIf you are a fan of the Half-Life series, have enjoyed the original Half-Life and want to expand the gameplay, this expansion is worth every penny (I imagine that most Half-Life fans by now have, like me, played this and Blue Shift to death).
