In turn, I'd like to give a review to the original, just to be fair.\nHalf-Life came out at a time where I had yet to exist. The benefit of Steam and the internet existing is that I don't have to miss out on all these old phenomena that were around when I wasn't alive yet.\nHalf-Life is one of those experiences that I was very happy to finally play for myself.\nI do want to be clear - this game still has flaws. While I feel it isn't always right to judge a game by the standards of a different time, I do also believe that the ability of a game to age over time is important nonetheless. Graphically, Half-Life aged... not so well. Unfortunately, as I stated in my Half-Life: Source review, the official Valve \"remaster\" wasn't really so much of a \"remaster\" as it was an over-glorified port. That being said, nostalgia can come into play here. Some may not vibe with looking at every triangle on a model when they play a game. You may not like how pointy the G-Man's chin is. But to be honest, while the game's visuals haven't aged great, they aren't bad. \nGraphics aside, the gameplay is very nice. The running is a bit fast for comfort at times, but the physics engine and combat are very nice, especially considering the time that the game released. Some puzzles can be finicky sometimes, and while game-breaking glitches are something more common in Half-Life: Source, I still occasionally got soft-locked behind blast doors (which is intentional game design, to be fair to Valve here), and there was one point where I needed to supply power to a tram, and it still did not function even after enabling all sources of power (I reset my game save several times and it eventually worked out of nowhere). But this was one minor flaw in an otherwise stellar experience.\nThe story is simple. It's not overplayed, and it doesn't take the forefront. It gets the player invested while giving the gameplay the reigns and letting it do the talking. It sets up an amazing universe that the remainder of the games take place in, and I cannot recommend it more.\nPlay Half-Life.\nAnd when you do, make sure it's this version and not the Source port.\nP.S., while I praised the physics engine, the platforming is kind of bad. Get used to dying from a long fall. It's a good thing this is a first-person shooter.","timestamp_created":1611624639,"timestamp_updated":1611624767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85356250","author":{"steamid":"76561199049864873","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2889,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1635647271},"language":"english","review":"idk i was paid to do this","timestamp_created":1611623287,"timestamp_updated":1611623287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85353347","author":{"steamid":"76561199087859267","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61,"last_played":1624666228},"language":"english","review":"Its good, 10/10","timestamp_created":1611618165,"timestamp_updated":1636068204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85350713","author":{"steamid":"76561199085195460","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1068,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":852,"last_played":1639700337},"language":"english","review":"a grat game","timestamp_created":1611613835,"timestamp_updated":1611613835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85350145","author":{"steamid":"76561199003502821","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1651264487},"language":"english","review":"lol gamee funny","timestamp_created":1611612945,"timestamp_updated":1614547376,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498154997825622559","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85349999","author":{"steamid":"76561199121964875","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":4321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4261,"last_played":1644011948},"language":"english","review":"One of my all time fav story line games","timestamp_created":1611612738,"timestamp_updated":1611612738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85349968","author":{"steamid":"76561199026925274","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13936,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10933,"last_played":1658156698},"language":"spanish","review":"xd","timestamp_created":1611612695,"timestamp_updated":1611612695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85348507","author":{"steamid":"76561198201054958","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1650165596},"language":"english","review":"It's half life, what do you expect??","timestamp_created":1611610480,"timestamp_updated":1611610480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85343258","author":{"steamid":"76561198165269632","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1876,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1876,"last_played":1577309989},"language":"english","review":"10/10 would use my crowbar again","timestamp_created":1611603209,"timestamp_updated":1611603209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85342928","author":{"steamid":"76561198918638458","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1226,"last_played":1653571990},"language":"english","review":"[b]I absolutely love this game.[/b] \nIt is great, even to this day.
