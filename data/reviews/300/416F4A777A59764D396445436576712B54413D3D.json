It is fast-paced for a quick game. The maps are complex and give opportunities to different tactics. While the game is old, the graphics are good but also clean and neat. It doesn't get carried away with peripheral special effects nonsense that oversaturates so many other FPS's. Also, and most importantly, it is still supported by its producer Valve. It uses the anti-cheat software VAC, which has never given me an issue and which is also still supported.","timestamp_created":1452904486,"timestamp_updated":1452904486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20547345","author":{"steamid":"76561198060620497","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":360,"last_played":1493178532},"language":"english","review":"Hits you right in the childhood.","timestamp_created":1452892543,"timestamp_updated":1452892543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20538393","author":{"steamid":"76561198184753977","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1813,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1511,"last_played":1468265119},"language":"english","review":"cool game took a little wile to get useto it but it is cool\n","timestamp_created":1452859333,"timestamp_updated":1452859333,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.463917523622512817","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20533542","author":{"steamid":"76561197998493760","num_games_owned":433,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":944,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":944,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"8/10 I haven't played this game in forever but I think I had fun.","timestamp_created":1452827830,"timestamp_updated":1452827830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492390334606170654","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20532843","author":{"steamid":"76561198089389582","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":596,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":510,"last_played":1453999672},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores da steam!","timestamp_created":1452824413,"timestamp_updated":1452824413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20527414","author":{"steamid":"76561198159494042","num_games_owned":235,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":2434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":488,"last_played":1503075465},"language":"german","review":"DAS spiel ist eigentlich nur dafür gedacht um zu testen wie weit deine pc maus fliegen kann!","timestamp_created":1452800196,"timestamp_updated":1452800196,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.449503779411315918","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20525796","author":{"steamid":"76561198153420400","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":104,"last_played":1452427950},"language":"finnish","review":"5/5","timestamp_created":1452794257,"timestamp_updated":1452794257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20512302","author":{"steamid":"76561198153881361","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":613,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":176,"last_played":1549841309},"language":"english","review":"Ok has like no community","timestamp_created":1452720825,"timestamp_updated":1452720825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20507174","author":{"steamid":"76561198274347974","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":1599991660},"language":"german","review":"Hallo Steam-Community,\n\nich kann nur sagen ein Geiles Spiel.\nLeider muss ich betonen es wird nicht mehr soviel gespielt, \ndie server sind recht lerr.\nLasst euch von meinen paar Stunden nicht abschrecken,\ndass ist mein 2.

На выбор нам дается две стороны: вермахт и союзники. Каждая сторона разделена на 6 классов, каждый из которых имеет свою экипировку, достоинства и недостатки. Задачи перед вами будут стоять разные, в зависимости от карты. Это либо типичный захват точек, либо уничтожение/защита объектов. Так чем меня зацепила на столько простая игра? Так простотой и зацепила! Любителям Battlefield 3 и отличного графона тут не место! DoD - это просто хороший тактичный шутер, простой в освоении, а главное - с адекватными игроками! Наиграл я в неё 70 часов и не припомню, чтобы за это время встречал в игре неадекватов и вопящих школьников.
