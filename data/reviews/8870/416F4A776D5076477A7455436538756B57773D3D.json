Öyle bir oyun düşünün ki acaba sonra ne olacak diye düşünmeden edemeyip oyunu bıraktırmayan bir oyun. Bitirseniz dahi Infinite'yi özleyip bir kaç kez daha bitireceksiniz. Oynanışı rahat. İnsanın canını hiçbir türlü sıkmayan bir oyun Infinite. Özellikle beni bağlayan senaryonun zenginliği ve şok ediciliği. Oyun bittikten sonra ekrana boş boş bakıp düşünmeye başlıyorsunuz. Oyunun yapımcıları gerçekten başarılı bir iş çıkarmış. Müzikler olsun, giyinişler olsun hepsi sizi eskilere götürüyor. Oyun bittikten sonra benim gibi boşluğa düşen oyuncular için iki tane dlc var. Burial At Sea eps 1 ve eps2 olarak ikiye ayrılan dlcleri de alıp boşluğu doldurabiliyorsunuz. Tam anlamıyla mükemmel bir iş çıkartılmış bu oyunda. Kesinlikle tavsiye ediyorum.

Logistically, the balancing of story and gameplay is amazing. The pacing is excellent -- gameplay flows into and serves the story. The game has a complete story without feeling dragged out.\n\nThe story itself is captivating and keeps you engaged the entire time. I always wanted to know what would happen next. The events that happen in the game are meaningful and contribute to the overall narrative. Your companion, Elizabeth, is a character that definitely grows on you as the game progresses. While the details of the story may be complex and sometimes hard to get, it is ultimately fulfilling once you grasp it.\n\nHowever, the DETAILED setting of this alternate-early-20th-century-steam-punk-sci-fi-fantasy game is what sets this game apart. Enter a world in which political, economic, social, and religious satire is rolled into one imaginative world. Everything from the dialogue between NPCs to the propaganda on the walls-- to the statues and architecture, gives the player a deep sense of immersion. The game is bold enough to delve into sensitive social questions. If you are interested in this kind of alternative setting, then this game is a must have. \n\nJust a couple of notes: \n-The gameplay is linear, as it is a story-driven game. However there are different side areas to go into, and things to see and collect.\n-There is no save button, but each chapter is saved and there are checkpoints. \n-Check out the Burial at Sea DLCs. It continues the story of Elizabeth after the events of this game. (Highly recommended that you play Bioshock 1 first, as the story is connected to both games.)

I'm writing an intensive review for this game because I firmly believe it deserves every ounce of glory.\n\nMy (vague) thoughts (without spoilers):\n- The graphics were beautiful (even though I'm on a macbook that can hardly run 60 fps for this game). I found myself getting tons of screenshots just to memorialize the experience of playing the game.\n- The gameplay exceeded my standards for what I thought would be an average game. I thought the overall balance between forcing players to constantly think, strategize, and execute objectives with such little resources was thoroughly constructed very well. For example, I ended up dying multiple times in one area because I wasn't evaluating everything relevant to the task at hand.\n- The plot was absolutely astounding for a game that jam-packed lots of complicated narratives in eight hours of gameplay. A lot of the symbols and metaphors felt convoluted at first, but as time progressed, the clarity of each became more sound. Also, the lack of a lot of exposition felt great because (in my opinion) games with a lot of exposition are deeply rooted in the assumption that the players are either moronic, immature, and/or adolescent. \n- The characters were my absolute favorite part of the game. Although the trope of \"rescue dansel in distress, have x happen\" felt theatre-esque/cliche, it didn't detract from their true personalities. The character development of the protagonists felt very real to the point that I felt as if I were in the story and they were alive. The emotions displayed by the characters (and myself) felt very genuine and very well-composed.\n\nI could not think of anything negative about this game because I really, really enjoyed playing it (so much to the point that I would play the whole story again from the beginning). If you want a fun, immersive game that will intrigue, entertain, and satisfy you, I'm absolutely positive you will also enjoy this experience of a game.","timestamp_created":1467320932,"timestamp_updated":1468224871,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23965704","author":{"steamid":"76561198096920838","num_games_owned":886,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":1201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1046,"last_played":1539382830},"language":"schinese","review":"请容许我极其概括性的介绍一下 生化奇兵 无限\n（不准确之处还请指正）：\n\n+ 非常漂亮的，充满艺术性的，令人流连忘返的蒸汽朋克风格游戏画面；\n+ 优美的音乐；（游戏刚开始时可能会出现情节bgm与场景bgm音效重叠）\n+ 大量的场景细节及可收集物品/影像/人物对话；\n+ 源自现实而超越现实，引人深思的世界观及剧情；\n+ 人见人爱的女主；\n\n- 线性剧情，没有实质性的分支选项；\n- 并不是很有趣的战斗流程；（射击手感并不差）\n- 控制器右摇杆灵敏度略高；\n- 部分繁中汉化翻译不准确，可能会影响理解剧情。\n\n其他注意事项：\n\n* 本作不是开放世界游戏，但是场景自由度高。相比于典型的FPS，本作的RPG成分更高；（参考 杀出重围：人类革命）。\n\n* 游戏本体占存储空间 26.9GB，DLC文件体积总计24.4GB，具体如下：\n  - DLC 云端激战： 5.64 GB ( 如非季票，强烈不建议购买 )\n  - DLC 海葬1： 7.28 GB\n  - DLC 海葬2： 11.4 GB\n  总计：41.3 GB。 请按需下载（可以先下载本体进行游戏，稍后再下载DLC）。\n\n* 建议打折时直接买无限大包（无限本体+季票，不是三代合集）。","timestamp_created":1467319107,"timestamp_updated":1467786239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23965698","author":{"steamid":"76561198053240929","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":929,"last_played":1575739930},"language":"czech","review":"Jedna z najlepších hier, jedna z mojich najmilovanejších ^^ Určite odporúčam zahrať si, pokiaľ niekto ešte vôbec pochybuje :)","timestamp_created":1467319088,"timestamp_updated":1467319088,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504587173461914063","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23963104","author":{"steamid":"76561198174590403","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1425,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1261,"last_played":1452964639},"language":"brazilian","review":"Simplesmente incrível!

Они мне казались лучшими играми за всю историю создания игр. В них было всё, хоррор, экшн, интересный геймплей, качественная графика и многое другое. И когда я увидел первый трейлер к этой игре, то сразу подумал \" О, нужно всего лишь срубить побольше денег, поэтому отклонимся от первых двух частей и создадим что-то модное, с красивым графоном, няшной девушкой в главной роли и т.д. и т.п\", одним словом - продались, подумал я. Я никогда еще так не ошибался...\n\nКакие бы негативные мысли не лезли мне при просмотре трейлера, как фанат серии я решил пройти её во чтобы то ни стало. Скачал, запустил....и пропал. Конечно же, я по-быстрому прошел ее просто ради сюжета буквально за полдня. Но я НИХ@Я не понял и поэтому решил пройти еще раз не жалея времени. Я не мог оторваться от этой игры просто потому что я читал каждое название магазинчика, слушал каждый голсофон, смотрел каждый кинескоп и т.д. и т.п. Я влюбился в эту игру потому что в ней было абсолютно всё, что я люблю. А после того как вышли два дополнение Burial at Sea, я окончательно \"потёк\" от этой игры. \n\nПлюсы:\n[list]\n[*]Сюжет - Я прошел игру в первый раз иии...них@я не понял. Я прошел игру во второй раз...иии них@я не понял. Я почитал статьи в интернете...иии что-то понял. После четырех прохождений и прочтения множества статей я смог всё связать. Итог, сюжет потрясающий. Сложно понять, но бл@ть как же интересно!\n[*]Геймплей - Просто 10 из 10 отлетающих трупов от аэрокрюка, суицидальных врагов от \"Поцелую дьявола\" и многого другого.\n[*]Звуки - Мелодии, песни, звуки...Всё это заставляет вас перенестись в этот летающий город.\n[*]Графика - Нет, я не графодрочер да и на моем компе далеко не уедешь. Графика действительно красивая, благодаря цветам Колумбии. P.S. Графика последнее на что я обращаю внимание.\n[*]Элизабет...\n[*]Лютэс...\n[/list]\n\nИтог: 10 из 10 Элизабет кидающих тебе всякую херню в лицо в самый неподходящий момент. Однозначно стоит покупать.
