В BioShock Infinite изумительный и детально проработанный мир, в котором без труда узнаются элементы стимпанка . Этот мир затягивает и побуждает медленно прогуливаться по уровням, заглядывая в каждый угол.\n\nКроме того, третья часть BioShock обладает захватывающим сюжетом, с развитием которого вы увидите, как и почему пало утопическое общество Колумбии. Узнать мир лучше помогут многочисленные NPC и голософоны, рассказывающие об истории чудесного летучего города. В сюжете нашлось место множеству твистов, а финал и вовсе наносит сокрушительный удар — такой концовки вы точно не ожидаете.\n\nДа и с игровым процессом у Infinite все отлично. Создатели предусмотрели различные способы разнообразить геймплей: разрывы, аэрокрюки, энергетики, а в одном из дополнений можно сыграть за другого персонажа с иными способностями.\n\nНо главное достоинство игры — это, конечно, очаровательная Элизабет, спутница главного героя. От нее очень сложно оторвать взгляд — настолько она прекрасна. Ее хочется слушать, с ней хочется говорить и следить за всем, что она делает. Элизабет — один из самых живых героев в истории видеоигр.\n\nДа и игра было пройдена на 100% по основному сюжету со всеми побочными(дополнительными заданиями).
