Everything feels so unknown, considering theres so many places that look like you can explore them. Also the industrial feel is so nice, and the plotline is amazing. To me, Portal 2 is one of the best games ever made, it's a masterpiece, and every time I play it, I get such warm feelings. Valve, Portal 3 please.

The graphics are good, the characters have depth and character, and the story is interesting. My only compalint is that its very similiar to the first game. The first game goes like this; you wake up in a room and are greeted by a voice (GLados). This voice you learn is your friend and you go off and do some testing. Then at the end of the game you learn that this \"friend\" wanted you dead the whole time. Finally you defeat said friend and then you escape. The second game goes just like this time there is a person (GLados) who is the enemy and you have the friend (Wheatley). Another difference is that instead of wanting you dead the whole time, the friend went power crazy. And when you escape you actually escape. Overall though this game is pretty good. 7/10 would recommend.","timestamp_created":1531623334,"timestamp_updated":1531624125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43537143","author":{"steamid":"76561198419997112","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1064,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":817,"last_played":1585365852},"language":"english","review":"Masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1531622477,"timestamp_updated":1531622477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43536971","author":{"steamid":"76561198435951146","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":663,"last_played":1552165622},"language":"brazilian","review":"===Para quem esse jogo foi desenvolvido?\n( ) Espermatozóides.\n( ) Crianças.\n( ) Tudo e todos.\n( ) Adolescentes.\n( ) Adultos.\n( ) Dementes.\n(x) Players Casuais \n\n===Texturas, Gráficos, Lindeza?\n( ) 220 x 120p.\n( ) Meia boca, tem piores.\n( ) Dentro da média atual.\n(x) Bonito e agradável.\n( ) Nem meu olho não aguenta essa qualidade incrivel.\n\n===Bugs.\n( ) O jogo em si é uma falha.\n( ) Bug pra todo lado, tipo tiro em favela no Rio.\n( ) Muitos bugs mas dá pra jogar.\n( ) Bugs que não atrapalham.\n(x) Sem bugs notáveis.\n( )Bugs de textura nos mods \n\n===É difícil?\n( ) Basta assisitr o jogo.\n( ) Da pra zerar jogando num Volante..\n( ) Padrão, bem de boa.\n(x) Bem desafiador, as vezes difícil.\n( ) Muito Dificil.\n( ) Dark Souls\n\n===Duração do jogo base.\n( ) Piscou, acabou.\n( ) 2 horinhas.\n( ) Entre 6-12 Horas\n(x) Muito tempo, no minimo umas 30 horas\n( ) 300 horas porque o jogo é mt difícil.\n\n===História.\n( ) Minecraft(sem historia)\n( ) tem história só pra não dizer que não tem.\n( ) Dá pra gostar da história, se esforçando .\n( ) Cuidado pra não se apaixonar.\n(x) Dava pra fazer um livro!\n\n===Músicas.\n( ) Joga sem som\n( ) Da pra escutar, no baixo...\n( ) Boa.\n( ) Os caras capricharam no áudio.\n( ) Baixe a Playlist pra escutar no uber.\n(x) sem musica\n\n===Hardware Necessário. 60fps\n( ) Computador da minha vó.\n(x) Tendo uma GPU ja ta rodando.\n( ) Nada que uma 1030 não resolva.\n( ) Uns 4k em um PC é muito pra você?\n( ) Nem pc da nasa aguenta.\n\n===Para melhor Experiência.\n( ) Desinstala pra recuperar a dignidade.\n( ) O jogo é Offline.\n( ) SinglePlayer.\n( ) Coop.\n(x) Multiplayer.\n\n===Vale a pena o investimento?\n( ) Era melhor eu ter comprado um lanche.\n( ) Melhor esperar uma promoção.\n( ) Se pagou.\n(x) Pagaria o dobro.\n( ) Vale mais que 1/4 do meu rim","timestamp_created":1531621681,"timestamp_updated":1531621681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43536822","author":{"steamid":"76561198077796231","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2047,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1812,"last_played":1584326447},"language":"english","review":"best game 10/10","timestamp_created":1531620916,"timestamp_updated":1531620916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43536438","author":{"steamid":"76561198169616592","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":524,"last_played":1531618002},"language":"portuguese","review":"Damn","timestamp_created":1531619110,"timestamp_updated":1610334687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx53nzeQCdoOKpgE="}
