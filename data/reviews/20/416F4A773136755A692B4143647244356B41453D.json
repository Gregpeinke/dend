game is not meant for the new players, as they will be isolated against the swarm of frag grenades and bunnyhoppers. However, if you get to play this over and over again, you will eventually learn new tricks and the things you can do will be amazingly fun, even if you're absolute garbage.\nTFC is comprised of nine classes, all of whom have their own specific niche. Sure, the weapons aren't diverse like in its successor, but the skill required to use all of them effectively is high.\nThe graphics are as you would expect from old Valve games. They haven't aged well, and some of the different classes can look alike in combat.\nThe grenades offer a new way to practice your skill, as the mobility they offer outperforms TF2 in that regard. For example, the Scout's concussion grenades, though wavering the player's aim, can propel him far distances or launch him to immeasurable altitudes.\nDespite the high skill cap and the veterans of the game which can be daunting, the game never really feels that way to me. Even by having over 200 ping connecting to servers, I still feel like I'm making an impact on the match and killing others seems satisfying.\n\nIf you can mind the grenades and the long-time players, and you believe you're good at learning new mechanics fairly quickly, I suggest you get this game. The only downside is a lack of players.","timestamp_created":1516587159,"timestamp_updated":1516587177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57906264066696167","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39521613","author":{"steamid":"76561198262206937","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":11,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1448907916},"language":"schinese","review":"《军团要塞》（简称TFC）的出现预示着团队合作在《半条命》游戏中开始成为主流。《军团要塞》不过在原有的《半条命》游戏版本上增加了团队作战模式。在这种游戏模式下，玩家被分为彼此敌对的两组，在不同的地图上战斗以达成某一特定的目标，比如说夺取时方的旗帜、占领某片区域、暗杀或保护队伍-员等。在《军团要塞》中，玩家可以扮演战士，侦察兵，狙击手等9种职业。每个兵种都有自己的属性，他们在速度、装甲和武器上都截然不同，自然用处也就不同。当然，各个兵种都有自己的弱点和长处，这也是在《军团要塞》里个人英雄主义无法发挥作用的原因。","timestamp_created":1516570317,"timestamp_updated":1516570317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559050261974334717","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39515820","author":{"steamid":"76561198261265924","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":28,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1577553538},"language":"koreana","review":"플레이

Vinha como brinde para os jogadores que comprassem o título da Valve, mas fez tanto sucesso que começou a ser vendido separado também.\n\nOs jogadores basicamente escolhem entre duas equipes iguais, que tentam defender sua base ao mesmo tempo em que precisam atacar a inimiga e roubar sua bandeira. O modo como cada jogador deve se comportar é diretamente influenciado pela classe que escolheu, e pela função que está exercendo na equipe, sendo, portanto, um jogo que requer trabalho de todos os jogadores em conjunto.\n\nO jogo já é bem datado, mas, apesar disso, ainda é possível encontrar partidas com facilidade, muito embora os servidores estejam já repletos de jogadores veteranos, o que torna o ambiente muito difícil para aqueles que resolvam ingressar agora.\n\nDesta forma, apesar de ser um jogo bom, não há motivos para alguém resolver jogá-lo agora, salvo se for por um fator nostalgia, ou se não tiver uma máquina que possa rodar títulos mais novos, vez que já existem jogos com a mesma proposta, que são bem mais intuitivos e bonitos graficamente, como o próprio Team Fortress 2, ou o Paladins, por exemplo, que, além de tudo, ainda são gratuitos.\n\nCaso você tenha o jogo, ele é divertido e vale a pena instalar para recordar, mas certamente eu não o compraria de novo caso não tivesse, pois o seu tempo já passou, e agora é hora de aproveitar as coisas boas que temos atualmente.

Выбираем один из девяти классов, выбираем сервер и понеслась войнушка со стрельбой и взрывами. Классика.\nВ игре до сих пор присутствуют игроки. Вечером в субботу поймал около 80 человек на серверах. И если честно я познакомился с игрой как раз в 99 году, в компьютерном клубе. Никто из пацанов не играл в нее, все бегали в цс, халфу, а я как дурак запускал и бегал в одиночестве представляя как всех порву. Прошло много лет и вот я запустил игру... Эффект уже не тот, даже ностальгии никакой нет. Полчаса зевая побегал и выключил, омрачив приятные воспоминания.\nДля 2017 года игра морально и графически слишком сильно устарела, чего нельзя сказать о некоторых других модах халфы. Благо, что разработчики уже давно выпустили вторую часть TF и если и запускать данную версию то только для сравнения или если у вас совсем древний комп, а без TF вы не можете жить. Знаю, что получу помидором в лицо, но не рекомендую! Оценку ставить не буду. Это классика и она не нуждается в оценках.\n\n[h1]Послесловие:[/h1]\nЕсли вам понравился этот обзор добро пожаловать в группу\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/uojer - тут вы сможете увидеть рекомендованные мною игры, другие обзоры, а также просто пообщаться в хорошей компании.","timestamp_created":1512934057,"timestamp_updated":1512936169,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":89,"votes_funny":12,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566606879234313965","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38201487","author":{"steamid":"76561198288448958","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":7305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7305,"last_played":1512308717},"language":"turkish","review":"knight online nin yerini tutmadı","timestamp_created":1512886907,"timestamp_updated":1512886907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38199572","author":{"steamid":"76561198322914303","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":18,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1555375882},"language":"english","review":"This game takes you too the roots of TF2 (I recommend this to people who like playing the old Gold Source Engine games....)","timestamp_created":1512880317,"timestamp_updated":1512880317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38194987","author":{"steamid":"76561198200752867","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":1554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1118,"last_played":1631679180},"language":"english","review":"This game has the best fanfiction ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1512863316,"timestamp_updated":1512863316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38169909","author":{"steamid":"76561198155765003","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40,"last_played":1560808822},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego de mi niñes :,v","timestamp_created":1512794481,"timestamp_updated":1512794481,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38089053","author":{"steamid":"76561198133086581","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":98,"playtime_forever":25987,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1496000678},"language":"english","review":"Team Fortress Classic\n\nTeam Fortress Classic is really good olf fps game, it is one of the best at the time it was released.
