The 30 minute or so coffin ride through the citadel being a point that was cool when it came out but now the very obviously blocky graphics and annoying clanging noise stands out against the test of time.\n\n8/10 for what the game respresented at the time it was released.\n4/10 for the engine (This engine has too many niggles for me to enjoy the gameplay, movement and getting caught on stupid props being the worst) and 3/10 for the Gordon Freeman worship in the game. Seriously the first was an average joe scientist going to work and all hell breaking lose and you help the science team who most of get wiped out after the 7 hour war when you get put into stasis by the G-man. Half-Life 2 doesn't explain anything, who is Gordon Freeman, (just a guy on rails shooting stuff), who is Gman (dunno), will we defeat the combine (don't know), how? dunno. What happened to Xen, what did killing the Nihilanth accomplish? Gordon paved the way for the combine and the world became full of impotent people scared about everything while the combine has this vague goal of world domination or whatever.\n\nWhen you really sit down and look at Half Life 2 it's just an average story line in a time where games like this didn't really exist. It took over the market and rabid fan boys attacked anything that wasn't half life 2 hindering other developers from even trying to compete. Now the plot will never be finished (even though a trip to the arctic sounds like a visual borefest for what the Source engine would have been able to do) and what do we do now?? So much time and effort fanboying over an average game with average graphics and average gameplay. It really is a shame. Hopefully some developer in the future will be able to make a spiritual successor to the original Half-Life on the VR which will recapture that flame that was lost.

While dated in most regards, the actual art style and atmosphere certainly holds up even today, and upon release it was unanimously praised for its attention to detail and overall graphics quality. In fact, Valve's facial animation system has been used, to great effect, in all of their future games to bring life and emotion to characters.\n\nIt's great in the sound department, too. Voice acting is certainly on point. While most, if not all gun sounds are rather underwhelming, Half Life 2 employs an otherwise impressive library of environmental and entity sound effects. The music is very sparse, only playing at appropriate moments throughout the game, but whether it's mournful, haunting or blood pumping, it's 100% awesome.\n\nFor a first person shooter, its conventional shooting mechanics are unremarkable at best. All enemies seem to take more punishment than would be expected, especially from headshots, and while ragdoll physics were used to better effect by the game's setpieces and gimmicks, they don't usually enhance the experience when just clobbering or shooting them in the face. I'm more inclined to label it a first person [i]action[/i] game, because it does several things throughout its length: airboat and offroad buggy sections, rudimentary but refreshing physics puzzles, an entire level of survival horror, several tower defense setpieces, and squad tactics (which are so basic as to be pointless, really). Against all odds, it integrates these gameplay changes very elegantly. It honestly felt like natural transitions, which could be because you're given breathers to prepare or to be given more exposition.\n\nIts brilliant gimmick is with the Gravity Gun, turning what would be a neat but novelty physics engine into a powerful tool and toy. Objects of reasonable size and mass can be grabbed from a distance, and then punted with great force. Heavier objects can still be pushed. [spoiler]The final level has the Gravity Gun supercharged and let you pick up and punt enemies directly.[/spoiler] It's an awesome tool with abundant, even reusable ammunition, and great effectiveness on enemies up to medium ranges. This can really go into the pantheon of \"Best Video Game Weapons\", for its unique design and functionality.\n\nThe game's biggest sin, by far, is being [b]so revolutionary[/b] that, playing it for the first time today, after experiencing dozens of other shooters and action games released since 2004, makes it feel cliche and unremarkable outside of the Gravity Gun. It's set the standards for storytelling, atmosphere and visuals, sound design and engaging gameplay - standards that, even today, aren't reached sometimes. It's a testament to the longevity of Half Life 2 when games continue to build upon its singular aspects. \n\nThe storyline for Half Life 2 is great for about 8 to 12 hours, depending on how much you hunt for secrets and achievements.

Несмотря на то, что игра уже далеко не из \"нового поколения\", но своей атмосферой,сюжетом она доставляет одно удовольствие.  Со вселенной Half-life я познакомился в далеком 2002 году, На то время первой части из этой вселенной не было равных, а спустя 2 года вышла 2 часть, которая произвела некую революцию в гейм-индустрии- первая игра на,тогда новом, движке соурс.... Нереальная атмосфера, сюжетная линия, классный выбор оружия, отличная на тот момент Графика- Все это передала мне вторая часть этой игры.  Затем подряд вышли half-life 2:episode one и half-assed life 2:episode two,  которые продолжили рассказ о Гордон Фримене и о его приключениях.....И вот, прошло уже 10 лет с момента последнего эпизода, но по сей день вселенная Half-life не выходит из головы....Огромное спасибо разработчикам за то, что создали такой шедевр) \n\nP.

comienzo mi critica al half-life 2, diciendo que es el mejor juego de la historia, si quieres saber el origen de los juegos de disparos-juegos violentos, este juego es imprescindible tenerlo en tu biblioteca de steam, ya que fue el boceto para los juegos de este tipo que salieron despues me ha encantado re-jugarlo, sobre todo la mejor parte de half-life que combina un poco el tema de las peliculas de terror que es la parte de \"no vamos a ravenholm\", esta parte es la mejor del mundo y os recomiendo que lo compreis y lo jugueis, en cuanto al apartado grafico, una pasada en su epoca ademas de que la trama argumental es excelente, entran ganas de jugar una media hora para saber que pasa despues, os recomiendo la compra, solo un inconveniente, la cantidad de armas ha disminuido, pero esto no es un inconveniente para disfrutar este juego.\n\npienso que valve tendria que hacer un esfuerzo y continuar half-life como sea y si es necesario que vuelva el guionista original de half-life que vuelva, este juego jamas debe de morir ya que es uno de los juegos legendarios despues de la saga DOOM, lastima que el episodio 3 vaya a acabar siendo al final un mod (hay rumores de gente que quiere hacer un mod de half-life 2 episodio 3 siguiendo el guion del guionista original del half-life), pero bueno, si valve ha decidido que este juego no continue, habra que respetar el temario, pero seria un profundo error por parte de valve no continuar uno de los mejores juegos del
