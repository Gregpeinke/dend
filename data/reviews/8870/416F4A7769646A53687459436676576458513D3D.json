Bioshock Infinite можно смело ставить на одну полку с Half-Life. В игре все продумано до мелочей. Нет ни одного ненужного или неуместного NPC. Нет ни одного неиспользуемого ствола, ни одного неактуального плазмида. В историю можно углубиться настолько, насколько это покажется необходимым. Можно вообще пробежать всю игру, не прослушав ни одного аудиодневника, экшн составляющая выше всяких похвал. А можно зайти в каждый закоулок, изучить каждый плакат и каждую газету, мир проработан до мелочей. Графика для своего времени не блещет фотореалистичностью, но на самом деле, о какой вообще реалистичности может идти речь? Герой в компании с девушкой, открывающей межпространственные дыры силой мысли продвигается по утопичному городу, стреляя из руки воронами... Графика ровно настолько хороша, насколько это необходимо. \n\nВ общем всячески рекомендую.

Columbia is a beautiful city in the clouds that has a very twisted and dark side to it. Nothing in this game is as it seems. Just when you think you know what's happening, it turns another twist on you. Now on to the characters, this game has a lot of memorable characters.

This freaking game.\n\nWell I finished BioShock Infinite a few minutes ago, and I'm still....shocked. It's just...okay, let's put it in topics. (Also pardon my english)\n\n[b] Story: 10/10 [/b] A complete mindf*ck, that leaves you frightened from top to bottom and makes you want to hug your newborn child and cry in the corner. I honestly can't compliment the script enough. Loved the concept of American exceptionalism, perfectly executed. I won't talk much about the lore itself, since I recommend you to actually buy the game and have your own experience from a blank sight.\n\n[b] Characters: 9.5/10 [/b] I actually managed to laugh with Booker DeWitt, who's extremely charismatic, and a bit of an assh*le. But the spark of the lightbulb here is Elizabeth. Oh boy, Elizabeth. You will fall in love with her, I assure you. She's one of the most charismatic characters I've ever encountered in a videogame. Elizabeth also helps you in-combat, providing Ammunition, Healthpacks and Salts. She can also unlock a few doors and throw you a random coin. It might sound silly, but you'll never get tired from seeing those animations. Speaking of combat...\n\n[b] Combat: 7/10 [/b] I hope you don't hate me for this, but I've never truly been a fan of the usual \"BioShock combat style\". Yet, if you love it go ahead! The combat itself doesn't change much, but the addition of different guns and different Vigors can and will make you enjoy it. The Vigors are great, and the amount of combos you can do is huge. The enemies are also diversified, and some will even make you wet your pants and die a little on the inside. Adding ziplines, the help of Elizabeth (I'll avoid mentioning that much because of spoilers) [spoiler] and a fucking bird [/spoiler] contributes to make the combat extremely fun. But then again, I'm not a huge fan of such combat.\n\n[b] Map Design as a whole: 10/10 [/b] Simply astonishing. As an amateur Concept Designer, you wouldn't believe the amount of Screenshots I took. The artstyle is, as always, nice and smooth. I'm not gonna lie, I managed to get lost a few times, exploring stuff and finding random collectibles. I recommend you to...\"enter\" the game, and feel the whole atmosphere. But oh boy the scenarios.... I mean, it's a f*cking city in the middle of the clouds, if you don't like that, you're weird, yo.\n\n[b] Final note: 9.5/10 [/b] BioShock Infinite is one of the most well-written and well-executed games I've ever played so far, yet the Combat felt a bit boring for me. The game can be very challenging, specially on 1999 Mode (Don't ask). It's a must-have for players who aren't into BioShock that much, such as myself, and a treasure for BioShock fans.\n\n[spoiler] I know a few BioShock millenials didn't like Inifinite because \"it doesn't look like BioShock\", but come on, dudes.

(quote from “Predestination” ,thanks Robert A. Heinlein)\n\nThe develop team brings out sparks in this game, amazing game screen and wonderful music, exciting action part like fighting in the air though sky-line, numerous guns to choose from, special vigors which are different and did not meet before...worth it to be in our library collection.\n\nOnly two weapons can be carried on at one time, tough when dealing with a bunch of enemies, though one would carefully focus what his major weapon should be, (mine is the carbine) and it is more realistic comparing with other action games. The vigors (magic power) are special but not over powered, they can act as assistance and make player chance and fun to kill the enemies.  \n\nAbove all, the story delights me deeply and to be the brightest star among all its features. Bare introduction in beginning of the main character, Booker, lead out surprisingly change after the cross with Elizabeth. One will be sad when Elizabeth being caught in the tower with finger cut; one will be touched when Elizabeth dancing in the beach freely, one will be puzzled when seeing Booker in the debt chasing scene again and again. All these build up the game that every one of us should not miss.\n\nIt will be a pity that if not buying the whole game with season pass, (pity happens on me...), I will try the DLC after passing the masterpiece once more, the story seems not yet end for main set.  \n\nIf you go to sea of doors and meet infinite light views during the game, please, please, please, adjourn to stay with Elizabeth there until bored, the stars of the sky is one of the greatest views I see throughout the game and make me enjoy the moment. There may be spoil of the story so I put my feels and suggestion below. Read if you do not mind. \n\n\n\n\n\n“There is always a lighthouse, there’s always a man, there’s always a city.” Elizabeth whispered after the door opened, I wish Elizabeth never had the key. The loop end starting there, I think bad ending make us unforgettable, and it is the success of a story. If there is still a choice, I hope Booker stopped his curious and brought Elizabeth to anywhere but there (Paris may be?), I may not get through the whole story, perhaps Elizabeth already turn down the suggestion to Paris before.","timestamp_created":1469283086,"timestamp_updated":1480254750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24479821","author":{"steamid":"76561198006704387","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":543,"last_played":1469308273},"language":"english","review":"This sexy girl mmmmm yeah","timestamp_created":1469282128,"timestamp_updated":1469282128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24479644","author":{"steamid":"76561198086814575","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1704,"last_played":1633190264},"language":"english","review":"Nice game and Nice story. 10/10 If you play it you should play 1-3 times to understand all of the story and all of the timeline","timestamp_created":1469281438,"timestamp_updated":1469281438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24479536","author":{"steamid":"76561198066058304","num_games_owned":353,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":1388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1386,"last_played":1578653480},"language":"italian","review":"Nel complesso è una giusta evoluzione della serie, che migliora su tutti i punti più importanti, anche se breve lascia molto al giocatore per la sua storia curata, il gun-play non è il top, ma riesce cmq a stupire anche perchè la sua vera particolarità è la storia.","timestamp_created":1469280978,"timestamp_updated":1558082360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471417248249053955","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24477771","author":{"steamid":"76561198109368805","num_games_owned":432,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2743,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1326,"last_played":1628811922},"language":"english","review":"This game is, to put it simply, a masterpiece. \n\nThe storyline is beautful and complex; deep and immersive, and by the end I felt like I had experienced the game as opposed to merely playing it. The Burial At Sea DLCs* are a must - at first they might seem too expensive but they are well worth it. \n\nElizabeth, your companion, is the best part of the game by far. She doesn't just assist you in a tight scrape or in open combat but she also serves as, well, a companion. By the end of the game, you get the impression that this Elizabeth was the main character, not you.\n\nThe combat is intuitive and enjoyable. Despite this game being an FPS the combat is not the strong point of this game, but it is still enjoyable, with the main game 'going' for a more open combat, traditional approach and the BaS DLCs 'going' for stealth based gameplay. The gameplay is enjoyable and effective and doesn't let down the game at all, but don't buy and play BioShock Infinite simply because it's an FPS. You might not get as much enjoyment if you do. \n\nI did have a technical issue when playing this game initially (my second 'load' of the game), but I believe this was down to the fact that I'm using Windows 10, and BioShock Infinite isn't officially supported on Windows 10. I'm not the only one, by far, to have had issues running BioShock Infinite with Windows 10, but all it required was to reinstall the game. I didn't have any issues for the next 19 hours + of gameplay. I personally wouldn't let this put you off, but having played the game, I suppose I'm bias.\n\nOverall, BioShock Infinite is one of the best games I've every played. It has an incredible storyline and very good gameplay, and Elizabeth is just amazing. Arguably the best AI in any game, ever. \n9.5/10, and I'd give it 10/10 if it wasn't for the fact I had to reinstall it once. At the time I'm writing this review, 95% of the 54,511 reviews are positive. That really does say it all. Just buy this game and experience it. You won't regret it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Word of warning though, the BaS DLCs are noticably darker than the main game, and there is a particular scene within Episode Two that some may find disturbing - it's rating is what it is for a reason. \n[spoiler]The scene in question is, essentially, a torture scene that you cannot skip.
