Although it does a poorer job of mixing story with gameplay, both the former and the latter are better than they were in the first game; Portal 2 sports more characters, although our old friend GLaDOS makes a return as a main character and is still the most likable in the game. There's a host of new gameplay mechanics, such as propulsion, repulsion, and conversion gel, all substances that either propel the player into the air, speed up the player's movements, or makes a surface portal-a-ble. This game also provides to us what I consider to be one of the best endings in gaming history, at least for the single player campaign, which leads me to my next point: there's more than one campaign! Portal 2's cooperative campaign thrusts you and another player into the position of Atlas and P-Body, GLaDOS' personal testing androids. You'll solve very complex test chambers with a friend, and it proves to be a true meeting of the minds as you combine your intellect to complete these puzzles and achieve a strong sense of satisfaction afterwards. Aside from this, it is also worth noting that thanks to the Perpetual Testing Initiative, a free map editor fully equipped with workshop support, this game's replay ability is now as infinite as its community's imagination.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBetter than the original, definitely worth your money.","timestamp_created":1326250112,"timestamp_updated":1385685989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4562990","author":{"steamid":"76561198039070771","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":683,"last_played":1424279682},"language":"english","review":"Хороший сингл, интересное совместное прохождение","timestamp_created":1326215235,"timestamp_updated":1326215235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2268372","author":{"steamid":"76561198004882049","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":345,"last_played":1424905985},"language":"english","review":"I had heard about this game a long time ago, but I disbelieved that it could be fun.

Portal 1 was universally praised and this...\n\nQuite simply, it improves on every single element of the original. The story is more intriguing. It starts out in similar fashion to the original, with test subject Chell forced into a battle of wits against malevolent, cold calculating GLaDOS, but grows so much more. It's difficult to explain without spoiling it but it features a number of characters with famous voice actors whilst maintaining the lonely atmosphere of a rat trapped in a cage. It's funnier than the original too. GLaDOS remains the star but characters such as Wheatley and Cave Johnson will leave a lasting impression.\n\nThe puzzles are great, leaving you completely stumped one moment and feeling like a genius the next. There's few highs in video games and this won my heart and placed it as my top game of 2011.","timestamp_created":1326154965,"timestamp_updated":1326154965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3518791","author":{"steamid":"76561198024088293","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":40625,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40469,"last_played":1449377137},"language":"english","review":"I guess it's good.","timestamp_created":1326125065,"timestamp_updated":1445454296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2570196","author":{"steamid":"76561198009408813","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1891,"last_played":1536590661},"language":"schinese","review":"再也找不到另一个联机这么有意思的游戏了，对于喜欢动脑子的玩家来说绝对不容错过！！！","timestamp_created":1326107146,"timestamp_updated":1403192806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"211437","author":{"steamid":"76561197965368218","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":1369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":626,"last_played":1534276809},"language":"english","review":"First Person shooter !\nif i gonna get marry one day, i'll make sure she play this with me first !!","timestamp_created":1326101651,"timestamp_updated":1326101651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2279418","author":{"steamid":"76561198005061118","num_games_owned":353,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":11413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10255,"last_played":1643865778},"language":"english","review":"Its f*cking Portal 2. Its better than the first in every way. EVERY SINGLE WAY. It introduces like 6-7 new gameplay mechanics that get worked into and around the concept of portals. The story/plot is approximately 3 times longer than the first game, AND theres a co-op mode which has its own side-plot (and DLC now). Theres plenty of humor, and youll want to play it about 2 full times to catch everything in the game. Also leaderboards give you the added challenge of beating certain time/portal usage levels (although it would be nice to have a Bronze/Silver/Gold rating or something of the like).
