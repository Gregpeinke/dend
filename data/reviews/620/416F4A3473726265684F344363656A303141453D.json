If you're playing this game for the first time, it is best played BLIND, meaning you do not know any prior knowledge to major plot points. \n\nHands down, Portal 2 is one of the best games I have EVER played. This puzzle/platformer game is better in every way compared to it's predecessor, Portal. The models and graphics are astounding for a game made in 2011, the music and ambient sounds are played at just the right times to make you feel a certain emotion, whether it be scared, triumphant, excited, hopeless, you name it. The story in this game is surprisingly good, considering what little the devs had to work with. The voice acting and writing is top-notch and the personalities and conversations between characters are so lifelike and believable. The sets found throughout the game are INSANELY detailed. But, most importantly, the game is FUN. Nothing beats solving a tough test in Portal 2 for the first time. Unfortunately, good graphics and huge, detailed sets take time to load, so be prepared for a 30 second loading screen every time you finish a test or die. AND, you can't forget that this game ALSO has a co-op mode!\n\nOverall, this game gets a 10/10. Almost everything about this game is perfect. This game has many shocking twists and turns you'll never see coming. I recommend this game 100%. If you haven't played this game before, you should probably think about it.\n\n","timestamp_created":1572322434,"timestamp_updated":1572322434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55870089","author":{"steamid":"76561198283786047","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":8429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":16,"playtime_at_review":6070,"last_played":1659738066},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 is an incredible game.

Это очень приятно. Редактор карт - Мы можем создать СВОЮ карту с нуля, это будет ваше творение. Вы можете залить это в мастерскую и ваши друзья, а также любые пользователи могут этим насладиться. Также у нас есть возможность поиграть и на чужих \"комнатах\". Кооперативное прохождение - очень хороший бонус, пусть и очень простой, но увлекательный. Графика - она по сей день выглядит превосходно. Да, это не новинки нашего рынка, но согласитесь, картинка смотрится по своему красиво. Собственный инвентарь - небольшой заработок для разработчиков, ваш личный инвентарь. Вы можете покупать за настоящие деньги вещи, надевать их на своего робота, и он будет выглядеть красиво.

This game has you dive into the role of Chell, who was also the protagonist of the first Portal. You explore the ruins of the underground Aperture Science facility with the aim of escaping to the outside world. \nThe story keeps twisting and turning and you get to meet new and recurring characters from the first Portal and learn more about them. To really appreciate the game's story I recommend you play the first Portal game before playing this one as key story moments lose some of their weight without the added context from Portal 1. The story is relatively easy to understand and straightforward, but the humorous dialogue and the rivalry between the few characters make it very compelling and enjoyable.\nLike the first game, you possess the Aperture Science handheld portal device, more well known as the Portal gun. You can shoot two portals: a blue and an orange one. These portals allow you and other objects to go through them and end up in different places. This very easy to grasp mechanic combined with different elements of the world are used to create unique and tricky puzzles that will challenge your perception of the space you're playing in.\nGraphically speaking, Portal 2 is a great looking game (by Source Engine standard). It has a very simple and clean look (even in the messier areas), but never looks boring or dull. The simple art style creates a memorable looking world, but doesn't distract from the gameplay at all.\nThe sound design and music of Portal 2 is excellent as well. From the different sounds for placing an orange and a blue portal to the different ambience soundtracks that fit each area like a glove, this game not only playing and looks great, but sounds great, too!\nAnd when you're done playing the story, you can not only challenge yourself by completing certain parts of the story as fast and with as few portals as possible via challenge mode, but you can also play other people's test chambers and create some by yourself right within the game!\nAnother neat feature is the co-op campaign (and community-created co-op chambers), but as of the writing of this review, I haven't finished co-op mode, so I can't fully judge this campaign. What I have played of it so far has been of the same quality as the other aspects of the game, though, so my hopes are high!\n\nThank you for reading this extensive and spoiler-free review (as if anyone would be worried about spoilers of an 8-year-old game...)!","timestamp_created":1572188976,"timestamp_updated":1572188976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55836467","author":{"steamid":"76561198950471189","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":588,"last_played":1656114781},"language":"turkish","review":"Bulmacalarla iyi öyle çok kolay değil güzel bir kısa süreli oyun","timestamp_created":1572188257,"timestamp_updated":1572188257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55836409","author":{"steamid":"76561198799727220","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1059,"last_played":1572048732},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo tem potencial mas falto o modo battle royale","timestamp_created":1572188104,"timestamp_updated":1572188104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55836334","author":{"steamid":"76561198165434930","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":2774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1811,"last_played":1610307326},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1572187944,"timestamp_updated":1572187944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55836182","author":{"steamid":"76561198882504534","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":35,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35,"last_played":1574075594},"language":"english","review":"Выучил физику, желаю автору закончить 9 класс","timestamp_created":1572187609,"timestamp_updated":1572187609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55835762","author":{"steamid":"76561198059174783","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2071,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1614398263},"language":"english","review":"fun game","timestamp_created":1572186798,"timestamp_updated":1572186798,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55835340","author":{"steamid":"76561198388369700","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1115,"last_played":1650605389},"language":"english","review":"very good game","timestamp_created":1572185779,"timestamp_updated":1572185779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55833125","author":{"steamid":"76561198841902535","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1319,"last_played":1645913469},"language":"czech","review":"Tato hra má super příběh, některé levely jsou lehké a některé dají zabrat.
