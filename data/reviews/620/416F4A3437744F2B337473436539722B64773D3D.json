I wanted to smash that \"not recommended\" button on this one just to be a butt and because it doesn't have the same spontaneous fun feeling as [i]Portal[/i] but, on its own merits, [i]Portal 2[/i] is just too good. You should play this. \n\n2. [i]Portal[/i] had this very immediate feel to it. It is hard to describe but it feels like you are just having a bit of a laugh w/ the developers as you play it. It feels special, the kind of shared experience you can only really get from gaming. [i]Portal 2[/i] feels like it was made to capitalize on the success of [i]Portal[/i]. \n\n3. [i]Portal[/i] is a bit rough around the edges, [i]Portal 2[/i] is not. It's a cash in but a respectful one. I appreciate that.\n\n4. At this point, we all know the deal as far as gameplay.  You get a portal gun. You shoot portals at two surfaces and you can traverse between those two points instantly. You use this and a few other mechanics that are introduced along the way to solve 3D environmental puzzles. Huzzah!\n\n5. The puzzles here are not too tough. I suspect most relatively patient gamers will be able to plow through w/o looking up solutions in a walkthrough. I did! And I am dumb enough to spend like a hundred hours a year writing game reviews on Steam for zero compensation and zero recognition. \n\n6. The reason they are not too tough, I think, is because they add new mechanics rather than burn the same few to the ground. I have mixed feelings about this since I do like hard puzzles but it avoids the trap of repetitiveness that many puzzle games fall into. \n\n7. This games plot is you wake up in a secret science facility and try not to die until you win.\n\n8. There is more to it than 7 though. There is storytelling here but it's not really tied so much to what you are doing. This is more about world building and this is just fine. [i]Star Wars[/i] is more about world building than storytelling. You learn about the history of this secret science facility as you go through it. The picture you are given is imperfect but compelling. At the end of the game, you will inevitably want to know more about it than what you were given. This makes for a memorable experience. \n\n9. J.K. Simmons's performance as Cave Johnson really makes this aspect of the game. If you want a complete Portal experience for as little time possible. Play the first game and then listen to the Cave Johnson parts on YouTube.\n\n10. The music is also fantastic. You can download the whole thing from the game's website as MP3s for free. Thanks Valve! I mean it!\n\n11. There is a co-op mode here which I really want to play but just makes the fact that I have no friends painfully unavoidable in my case. \n\n12. I found the ending here just a touch disappointing. Story-wise, it was fine. It just wasn't very hard. I will take this over a super-frustrating final boss for sure but I think it could have been done better. \n\n13. To save the answer the $64,000 question for last: yeah, you should play the first [i]Portal[/i] first. There is nothing stopping you from playing this first, really. The plot is not that important and it's well hashed out here anyway. It's just... well... not to keep harping on this but there is really an unmistakably special quality to that first game that this does not quite have. In the long run, play both, play them in order. That's my advice.

Portal 1 n'est qu'une mise en bouche de Portal 2 : Un gentil didacticiel de plusieurs heures afin qu'on ait les réflexes nécessaires et la fougue adéquate pour dévorer l'épisode suivant, encore et encore et encore !\nQue dire de plus ? Une musique tout bonnement excellente, un humour juste à point : Le tout dans un dosage qui fait oublier qu'on aurait dû aller dormir depuis déjà plusieurs heures.\nPortal 1 est une jolie table dressée,\nPortal 2 une belle coupe de champagne,\nNe reste plus qu'à espérer que Portal 3 ne soit pas un gâteau.
