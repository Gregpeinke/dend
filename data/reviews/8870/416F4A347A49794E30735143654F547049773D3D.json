Do it now!\nBioShock: Infinite is slightly less of a game, and slightly more of a critique on early-20th-century American culture and values. It plays like an interactive novel, and doesn't fail to deliver an excellent story, engaging characters, and pathos (ability to inspire emotion). Though the \"choices\" the developers offer are more-or-less meaningless to gameplay (choose one design of necklace over the other), if you as a player read into those choices, they can become extremely poignant and meaningful. BioShock: Infinite, like its predecessors BioShock and BioShock 2, is an excellent game to analyze.\nIt's also fun to play, though combat does get a bit repetitive, and you are restricted to only two main weapons and your Vigors (supernatural powers). Some enemies do not properly scale (you will wipe the floor with Vox Populi cannon fodder, but as soon as a Handyman shows up, you will be shooting him for the next ten minutes), and the game DOES get pretty preachy at some parts (because you are playing a character with a history, instead of your own customized hero) - and the entire ending of the game makes absolutely no sense unless you accept the possibility of the multiverse - but these are things you can ignore and focus on the good gameplay and storyline. In my first full playthrough, I didn't use Vigors nearly enough, so I'm looking forward to getting the Burial At Sea DLC and working on that.","timestamp_created":1394644841,"timestamp_updated":1403442438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475113123655319214","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9438886","author":{"steamid":"76561198072026478","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":999,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":828,"last_played":1403185526},"language":"english","review":"Fun shooty happy Fun time","timestamp_created":1394636374,"timestamp_updated":1394636374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9438881","author":{"steamid":"76561197991948665","num_games_owned":720,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1129,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":916,"last_played":1628598996},"language":"koreana","review":"이 게임을 아직도 안해보셨나요?\n빚이라도 만들어서라도 플레이하세요!","timestamp_created":1394636318,"timestamp_updated":1394636318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9438560","author":{"steamid":"76561197968399174","num_games_owned":680,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1268,"last_played":1408486249},"language":"english","review":"I was one of those people that wasn't a huge fan of the under-the-sea setting of the original two Bioshock games. That is to say, I still played them, but I wished for a more interesting, interactive setting for a Bioshock game. My prayers were answered with Bioshock Infinite. The ambience in this game, the voice acting, the great themes that are tackled with this game make it easily one of my favorite games of all time, and that's saying a lot. I am NOT, by ANY means, an easy man to please, and there was not a single problem I had with this game.\n\nIt's properly paced, the story isn't particularly confusing - and, when it is, the game is often quick to clear it up and, when it doesn't, ensures it does so eventually before you forget completely about it - at least until the end; the game doesn't have a huge difficulty curve, but still offers up a healthy challenge even on some of the easier difficulty levels. Obtaining some of the achievements requires diligence or strategy guides.\n\nI haven't tried any of the DLC yet - and, until I see a sale, I doubt I will - but that's largely 'cause of the setting it takes place in.

Все они были положительные. Решил, наконец, поиграть сам. Честно говоря, немного разочарован. Да, сюжет и его подача хороши, но не более того: про параллельные миры и временные петли сюжетов не мало, и в играх тоже. Картинка качественная и красочная. Оттого, вероятно, и притормаживает регулярно на ноутбучной видюхе NVidia GTX 560M. Стилизация по 50-60-е годы, по-моему, в Америке. Прокачка оружия, умений имеется. Играл с удовольствием первые 1,5 часа. А дальше как то не цепляло: прошел просто для того, чтобы узнать чем дело кончится. Уже без удовольствия. Немного странно реализован мир: он не открыт и не закрыт. Вроде бы, внутри уровня ходи где хочешь, но затем возвращаешься на хоженую часть уровня в связи с каким то заданием - половина врагов есть, а другой нет. Аналогично и с вещами. Как шутер игра, показалось, не дотягивает по получаемым ощущениям до \"отлично\": стрельбы какая то слишком плавная. AI иногда тупит, особенно на близких дистанциях. Не знает что сделать: то ли отбежать и пострелять в тебя из далека, то ли в ближнем бою отличиться. Что сделано хорошо, так это напарник: интенсивно не мешает и даже в нужные моменты помогает, хотя сам и не стреляет. Еще один приятный момент - поездки на крюке. Но серьезной частью геймплея это не является, так, для разнообразия прокатиться иногда заставляют. В общем не впечатлился. Честно говорят, ждал чего то большего. А может, стилистика не зацепила.

I failed. Dammit, it's easily the most entertaining of the Bioshock family!\n\nThis one doesn't even pretend to be a clunky consolified RPG anymore but instead it's a dumbed-down linear FPS, and it's all the better because of it. The flow is just so much better, the action feels more meaty and the guns and powers pack more punch. It's pretty, the plot and characters are interesting from the get-go (the first three hours of this game already surpassed like everything BS1 and 2 offered) and the setting and setpieces are more impressive as well. Your character is no longer a silent protagonist and most of the game happens as a kind of escort quest made right (your escort can't die).\n\nSome things are annoying like being able to carry only two guns but I wouldn't recommend this just as a shooter game anyway, it's not really challenging and the best bits are the visuals and the setting and the story. I expected it to be about the previous libertarian utopian themes but instead it goes into... wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff. Playing never felt like a horrible chore and I was constantly intrigued enough to advance to the next chapter. As a Bioshock game it's no longer trying to be the retarded descendant of System Shock.\n\nWith the previous games I was like \"yes it's finally over, uninstall\", here I was like \"wow this game was actually damn fine\".

Based on what I've read from other people's reviews and my hours logged onto this game, here's my take.\n\n1) Gameplay: Gameply wise, there is nothing new to offer. It gets a little monotonous towards the end, with the regular aim, shoot, vigor, etc. so don't expect something revolutionary with the gameplay. I did enjoy the various vigor combinations though, and fighting Handymen is always a blast. Other than that, despite the various upgrades for weapons, it gets a little tedious (AI also gets quite dreadful, since they just run at you and even neglect to fight you if you loop around their \"Pokemon I see you\" vision. You have ears come on!).\n\n2) Graphic and Art Design (Environment/Atmosphere): Again, graphics wise, nothing too impressive. People argue that the art design is also unimpressive due to the typical \"blue on orange\" color scheme. In my opinion, I loved the art design. I've always been a sucker for this time period (1910s) and I find the city of Columbia to be quite extraordinary. Compared to Rapture, I'd like to say Rapture is a bit better looking, but it's still phenomenal. The atmosphere is also great (but still liked Rapture's more) since it mainly involves religious coverups and deceit all blanketed by smiles. So pretty good job there.\n\n3) Story: This part I thought to be the best. After watching The Twilight Zone, Star Trek, Matrix (conceptual movies/TV shows) I found the story to be awesome. I won't give anything away, but the story requires some thought and honestly, I thought that alone makes it worth playing through the whole game alone (also, don't deny falling in love with Elizabeth. Everyone knows you're lying). So awesome part there.\n\nIn all, I would set this game equal to that of the first BioShock (blasphemy!) and definitely better than the second. Whether you've played the older games or not, I'd figure this would be a great segment in any gamer's library.

(SPOILER-FREE)\n\nBioshock Infinite is at its core an average single-player shooter game. However, this is not what compelled me to pick it up. I picked this game up for around 10 bucks during the Steam Black Friday sale, hearing that the story was excellent, and far better than what you'd see in an everyday shooter. After about a month of letting it sit in my library, I gave it a try. Damn, were my friends right. The story is what MADE the game. The world of Colombia is sprawling and full of life, which is surprising due to the subject matter. The character of Elizabeth gave the game heart and a way to convey its story through someone else's eyes, rather than the focused and violent sight of Mr. Booker Dewitt. The ending left me speechless, and I talked to my friends about it for hours. I tried the other Bioshocks, but they were not even close to the fun I had with Infinite. They were far too dark and overall lacked the polish of Infinite. Infinite's choice of a lighter atmosphere and a gripping story reeled me in and gave me an overall great experience. It was worth every penny.","timestamp_created":1394450836,"timestamp_updated":1394450836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9407452","author":{"steamid":"76561198059537363","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":450,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":433,"last_played":1419761604},"language":"english","review":"BEAUTIFUL GAME","timestamp_created":1394434830,"timestamp_updated":1394434830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9406903","author":{"steamid":"76561198055415879","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1976,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1310,"last_played":1500001575},"language":"english","review":"Probably the best game i've ever played.","timestamp_created":1394428933,"timestamp_updated":1394428933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9405989","author":{"steamid":"76561198113437108","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2905,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":688,"last_played":1641779587},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores jogos de tiro q ja joguei...otimo em tudo,muito foda mesmo. \"Sou fã da franquia\" ^^","timestamp_created":1394418901,"timestamp_updated":1394418901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9405841","author":{"steamid":"76561197961698052","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1035,"last_played":1394397235},"language":"english","review":"This is a good game","timestamp_created":1394417322,"timestamp_updated":1394417322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9405312","author":{"steamid":"76561197972508683","num_games_owned":523,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":1827,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1413,"last_played":1402886273},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite, a FPS genre game in which you embark on a fantastical journey into the heavens to rescue a chick locked in a tower in the early 1900's.

Having played Dishonoured before this sorta ruins it in someway as I'm constantly remined how similar they are, almost like a infinite being a mod except without the blink ability or any of the great powers that featured in its predecessors.

Il level design e' qualcosa di pazzesco..davvero..siamo quasi allo stato dell'arte...a volte stavo minuti col naso all'insu a prendere screenshot come un turista giapponese. Per il resto i Vigor sono per la maggior parte una figata da usare anche se certe combinazioni portano alla semi onnipotenza. Le pistole sono solo ok e davvero troppe! c'era davvero' la necessita' di replicare per ciascuna fazione di gioco le stesse armi con relativi upgrade? davvero troppo confusionario. Altro lato negativo dal punto di vista del gameplay sono le troppo limitate sezioni su rotaie (figata! quando ci sono..), troppe zone vuote dove non si vede l'ombra di un nemico, e troppo pochi Handyman! nel primo bioshock combattere un big daddy era uno dei momenti piu' epici e nel corso del gioco giustamente c'era almeno una dozzina di incontri...com'e' possibile che nel corso di Infinite si combattano solo 4 handyman? bah..\nComunque anche il primo bioshock aveva i suoi difetti e nonostante tutto e' uno dei piu' grandi giochi di sempre.
