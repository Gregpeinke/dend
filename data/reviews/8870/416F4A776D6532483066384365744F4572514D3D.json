If I were to rank the Bioshock trilogy I would rank Infinite as the second best game in the franchise. I'm glad that after Bioshock 2 they took us to a new location in Columbia and away from Rapture. The new setting felt fresh even though a lot of the mechanics felt the same just dressed up differently (vigors instead of plasmids for example) and the skyline movement and combat also added a new feature to the game that was fun to learn and get good at. The story is great in my opinion and gets deep with all the multiversal tear stuff, however, it could never beat the end-reveal of the original Bioshock.

game, I loved it. Familiar Bioshock tone/themes in a beautiful new setting with strong characters, I had a blast in Columbia (10/10 would take down airships with a giant bird again). It was great fun using the different Vigors and tears, along with the usual vibe of scavenging for supplies while exploring the city. Great soundtrack - the random anachronistic versions of songs like 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' were a great touch. My family sang 'Will The Circle Be Unbroken' at my grandfather's funeral last year, so hearing it through the game had me a bit emotional.\n\nBurial at Sea was a good final chapter tying the games together (so great to get back to Rapture). I liked the shorter story-driven length and different challenges (greater need for rationing ammo/health, and playing as Elizabeth requires more stealth). It felt like a good conclusion to a truly brilliant series. Sad my first experience of Bioshock Infinite is over but I'll definitely play it again.","timestamp_created":1647693198,"timestamp_updated":1647693198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112469306","author":{"steamid":"76561197987149614","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1062,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1062,"last_played":1647179428},"language":"english","review":"Simply amazing","timestamp_created":1647692442,"timestamp_updated":1647692442,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwme2H0f8CetOErQM="}
