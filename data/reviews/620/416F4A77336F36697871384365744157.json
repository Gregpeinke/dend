Portal 2 also features a fantastic, engaging, hillarious plot (and soundtrack) with many twists and turns. Ironically, this game forces you to think with portals as many levels will leave you shaking your head is disbelief when a puzzle that should theoretically only take 5 minutes to complete takes you more than 15. It certainly is a satisfying feeling when completing a complex puzzle. \n\nThis game easily gets a 5/5, just make sure you have a friend to enjoy co-op with.","timestamp_created":1303822658,"timestamp_updated":1303822658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1068311","author":{"steamid":"76561197985810157","num_games_owned":468,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1306,"last_played":1580567570},"language":"english","review":"loop da loop shoop da woop","timestamp_created":1303819618,"timestamp_updated":1303819618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"651027","author":{"steamid":"76561197974279423","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1066,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1066,"last_played":1318662000},"language":"english","review":"soooooooooooooooooooooo fun","timestamp_created":1303818775,"timestamp_updated":1303818775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"515520","author":{"steamid":"76561197971403166","num_games_owned":642,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1714,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1199,"last_played":1401658345},"language":"english","review":"The best humoristic puzzle type fps i've ever played since Portal 1.","timestamp_created":1303814973,"timestamp_updated":1303814973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"956217","author":{"steamid":"76561197983000745","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2022,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1082,"last_played":1580499394},"language":"english","review":"Fun fun fun :)","timestamp_created":1303813756,"timestamp_updated":1303813756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3328927","author":{"steamid":"76561198020898916","num_games_owned":672,"num_reviews":79,"playtime_forever":3543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2760,"last_played":1449237368},"language":"english","review":"Best game I'v ever played in my life!

The multi-player really puts it over the top and makes it completely worth the price.
