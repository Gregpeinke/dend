Though that can be easily fixed with noclip you get further on in the game to the chapter surface tension, and the helicopter can't be killed because my missles go through it, then when I use the toa cannon It also goes through it, but thats not all when you make it to the point after you fight the second tank, and then go into the facility with all the trip mines the elevator button gets stuck flashing between red and green, and the elevator is unusable. Though the problems listed sound like a one off situation I have tried booting up diffrent saves, and  using the new game button, and not even that fixed the issues, so if you want to experience Half life I would recommend Half life not Half life source or even Black Mesa","timestamp_created":1587407952,"timestamp_updated":1587407952,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67655680","author":{"steamid":"76561198099604499","num_games_owned":345,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":106,"last_played":1587359419},"language":"latam","review":"Puedes pasarte el capitulo On The Rail mas rápido sin usar el tren","timestamp_created":1587340334,"timestamp_updated":1587340334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67647373","author":{"steamid":"76561198367752780","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":3284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":26,"playtime_at_review":3267,"last_played":1660189066},"language":"english","review":"average half life source enjoyer","timestamp_created":1587328348,"timestamp_updated":1660124286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67593366","author":{"steamid":"76561199046313689","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1208,"last_played":1587241668},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite games of all time!","timestamp_created":1587255002,"timestamp_updated":1587255002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67538504","author":{"steamid":"76561198815992492","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":314,"last_played":1612926523},"language":"english","review":"it good","timestamp_created":1587186708,"timestamp_updated":1587186708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507042229175567627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67529258","author":{"steamid":"76561199042351330","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":694,"last_played":1657673107},"language":"english","review":"completed game","timestamp_created":1587172100,"timestamp_updated":1587172100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507042229175567627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67519379","author":{"steamid":"76561198058244077","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1390,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1079,"last_played":1587412916},"language":"english","review":"gun go bap bap","timestamp_created":1587157754,"timestamp_updated":1587157754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67497113","author":{"steamid":"76561198089410787","num_games_owned":742,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1016,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1016,"last_played":1587129616},"language":"spanish","review":"Acabo de terminar uno de los grandes de todos los tiempos.

И это не удивительно, ведь даже сегодня она превосходит множество шутеров (не по части графики). Игра знакомит нас с Гордоном Фрименом,учёным работавшим в Научно-исследовательском комплексе «Чёрная Меза». По сюжету происходит Каскадный резонанс,по итогу которого в наш мир попадают существа из мира ''Зен''. Всю игру мы,в лице доктора Фримена будем исследовать весь комплекс ''Чёрная Меза'', Столкнёмся с многими противниками: Из мира ''Зен'' (Хедкрабы, Барнаклы, Вортигонты и другие), а также с солдатами HECU, чёрными оперативниками, чья задача зачистить весь комплекс и убить всех очевидцев (и Гордона в том числе). Повстречаем G-Man'a (о котором неизвестно до сих пор). Попадём в мир ''Зен'', где столкнёмся с Нихилантом, лидером сил Зена. В отличии от многих игр тех времён, Half-Life не использует кат-сцены, а показывает всё через геймплей. Стрельба довольно спорная, но это не отменяет того, что убивая толпы врагов (которые далеко не тупые) ты получаешь удовольствие. Half-Life уже давно стала знаковой игровой серией игр, и даже современным игрокам она вполне может понравиться (а если хочется графики,физики то можно ознакомится с ''Black Mesa'').

Tons of great music, the levels generally give you tons of options for how to approach situations, and all that stuff that makes an FPS game, great.\n\nHowever, whenever you have more than one option for how to approach a problem, 9 times out of 10, only one of those options is actually of any use.\nFor example:\nDo you, a.) use your own guns to take down the enemies with the added maneuverability, or b.) use this stationary turret to deal with the enemies?\n\nWell, I hope you chose a.), because that turret not only can't shield you from any incoming damage, but it does so little damage, it struggles to even kill stationary headcrabs. It is literally so useless, you wonder why the designers even bother giving you the option, or if it's bugged, and is supposed to be doing more damage.\n\nAnd of course, Xen. I'm not the first person to criticize this section, but I actually like Xen, mostly. It came in right as I was starting to get bored of all the endless semi-wrecked corridors of Black Mesa. It felt like such a needed change of pace, it felt like the end of the game, which I appreciated.\n\nBut... Here's the thing. I managed to get through Xen in under an hour, and enjoyed myself as I went. Then I got to the Nihilanth.\n\nJESUS. CHRIST. \n\nI have never seen something bug so hard in the direction that f***s over the player. The Nihilinth spawns endless portals, so fast, that once I'm able to teleport back, the nihiliant had somehow already shot a portal at the place I spawned, sending me back. At least I think that's what's happening? It could also be that the game is just teleporting me back into the same room every so often to avoid crashing, because apparently that was an issue a few years back.\n\nBut everything in this game comes together in a cacophony of BS.\n\nUsing the jump pads in Xen, I realized that only SOMETIMES will I be able to move around in air. Other times? Well, you see that hard ground below you? You see that water three inches to the left, that won't cause death? Yeah. Good luck getting in the water. Yeah, you have like 6 seconds before you hit the ground, so 6 seconds to move 3 inches, but no, f*** you.\n\nAnd I have no idea what causes it. or a while, I thought I had to get on it looking upwards to be able to control my trajectory, but that helps so inconsistently, that I just don't know.\n\nAnd even worse, is that it's just not possible to beat the Nihilanth. Sure, its health will go down, but you'll run out of amm and/or patience before that happens..\n\nEvery guide I've read, says to hide behind a pillar, shoot him with the alien bee gun, and shoot rockets into his head when it opens up.\n\nSounds reasonable right? None of it works.\n\nHiding behind a pillar won't help you. Only about 60% of the time will it stop the teleporters from getting you. Other times, they just seemingly clip through the pillar. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is those energy projectiles.\n\nYou see them once, and you think \"Oh, simple enough, it's not a hit-scanner, I just move away and don't get hit.\" Wrong.\n\nThose things to so much splash damage, they may as well be hit-scanners. I've tried, I peak out the right side of the pillar, it rapid fires like  7 energy projectiles in a row, I move to the other side of the pillar, I die as soon as the third ball hits the ground. So then I get 100 health, and move to a farther away pillar. I die when the 5th fifth ball hits the ground.\n\nAnd you can't tell what it's gonna do next. I've watched every inch of that model, and every inch of the arena, there is no visible difference between firing energy, and firing teleporters. So slowly chiping away at its health by shooting it's soft underside with bees IS feasible, I guess. I wouldn't know, I've spent the past hour trying in vain to do anything. And yes, I destroyed all the crystals. I'm not new to this.\n\nBecause just don't even try to go for its brain. You will not get it. I have been on the highest ledge a dozen times, and the MOMENT I saw signs of its head opening, I super crouch-jumped using the pad, and fired a rocket as soon as I was over it. Every time, one of two things happened:\n1.) Its head had already closed, meaning I'd wasted my time and my rocket.\n2.) It had fired energy balls and I was dead before the rocket even hit anything.\n\nLike, maybe I'm doing something wrong? Maybe my version of the game is bugged? Every walkthrough tells me to do these things, or has them doing it in the video, but with my lack of ability to move left or right in the air, the unbelievable amount of damage the Nihilanth's projectiles do, the AOE they have, especially when they hit the ground, the ground troops that spawn in when all of my focus NEEDS to be the final boss and dodging everything it does, it all just adds up to an awful experience.\n\nI mean, maybe I just suck? Maybe, even though I think I'm keeping track of everything and using cover good enough, I'm not actually, and me just coming off of DOOM Eternal is making me unknowingly play this game using brute force, when it requires careful timing and strategy?\n\nAll I know is that even before the Nihilanth, there are several areas where 100 health and 1 health makes no difference. You have to be frame perfect, or you die no matter what. 100 health just gives you an extra 2 microseconds before death, over 1 health.\n\nLike, I knew this game might have some glitches, going in, but that's the issue. Are these glitches, or are these hard coded into this new version? I don't remember having so much trouble with the nihilanth, when my cousin let me play his version of Half Life, over a decade and a half ago.\n\nI don't know. But, anyways, I'm gonna go try to beat this boss for another few hours before I give up. If I can't do it, then I guess I'll just have to play through the original Half Life on the Quake engine, to see if it's just me or not, see if I've regressed as a gamer since I was 6, and I'm gonna do this to prove I'm not just salty over a boss that is supposedly really easy.","timestamp_created":1586653122,"timestamp_updated":1586653122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67091221","author":{"steamid":"76561198801918074","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":164,"playtime_forever":370,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1615999257},"language":"russian","review":".","timestamp_created":1586608986,"timestamp_updated":1586608986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67078428","author":{"steamid":"76561198093462464","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1131,"last_played":1586593215},"language":"spanish","review":"Good luck beating the last part of the game lmao","timestamp_created":1586593395,"timestamp_updated":1586593395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67075635","author":{"steamid":"76561198380110822","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":736,"last_played":1586589906},"language":"spanish","review":"Tiene una cantidad increíble de bugs y fallos.

A common mistake with those first starting out is that all you have to do is aim and shoot, that's not all you have to do, you're a physicist not a super-soldier, you have to use your head to get through the mess of the Black Mesa research facility, with various puzzles as well situations where you're immensely outnumbered and your only advantage is how you can somehow hold like 20 guns somewhere and move the boxes in the room around. Every situation requires you to think it through and plan what you're going to have to do to accomplish the task at hand, if you can't manage that then you're going to struggle to get to the end, this isn't a shoot'em up where the ammo is infinite and the heal stations are around every corner, your bullets and health are resources to manage if you want to get through an area without having to load a save over and over again. A great story, great mechanics, great everything, would recommend to anyone, and it's easily one of the best games ever made.","timestamp_created":1586401231,"timestamp_updated":1624159403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66928581","author":{"steamid":"76561198967076433","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1461,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":563,"last_played":1647784627},"language":"english","review":"Solid 10/10\n\n\nold but classic\n","timestamp_created":1586399175,"timestamp_updated":1586399175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66928086","author":{"steamid":"76561198419910057","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":486,"last_played":1586397858},"language":"english","review":"Pros: \n-The game has a good difficulty progression on normal, where toward the end it was pretty difficult but once you figure it out, you can finish easily.\n-Story was interesting and the ending makes you want to play the next game in the franchise.\n-Many weapons to choose from to play the game however you see fit.\n\nCons:\n-During the whole 8 hours of gameplay and finishing the game, I only saw one glitch and it was only a visual glitch on part of the map which wasn't game-breaking.","timestamp_created":1586398393,"timestamp_updated":1586398393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.621907055377960205","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66898265","author":{"steamid":"76561198365826897","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":481,"last_played":1586361097},"language":"schinese","review":"该做选择了","timestamp_created":1586361132,"timestamp_updated":1586361132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66880054","author":{"steamid":"76561198315097735","num_games_owned":393,"num_reviews":97,"playtime_forever":5018,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5018,"last_played":1585070400},"language":"english","review":"10/10!","timestamp_created":1586341142,"timestamp_updated":1586341142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66877935","author":{"steamid":"76561198135835594","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":130,"last_played":1646343497},"language":"english","review":"A buggy mess compared to the original Half Life.
