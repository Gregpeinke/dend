I think at this point everyone knows what the Portal series is, so I'll just point out some of the highlights.\nThe story is great with interesting characters and a perfect pace. The plot twists are well done and it only tells you what you need to know. The story is also supplemented by the great humor.\nOf course it's a puzzle game, so the puzzles and level design need to be good. Luckily, they're done flawlessly. On top of that the environments are also amazing and add lots to the world.\nOnce you're done with the story mode there's a level creator that is perfectly made and allows you to do just about anything you want. People have used this to make some crazy and amazing levels. The community, while I'm not sure how active it is now, has always been very helpful and creative. You'll never run out of content as long as talented map creators exist.\nDefinitely a must play for anyone. It's only $20 and worth every penny.","timestamp_created":1496991845,"timestamp_updated":1496991845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":61,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.837584555149078369","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32284074","author":{"steamid":"76561198120212780","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":468,"last_played":1486985284},"language":"koreana","review":"ㅇ","timestamp_created":1496987311,"timestamp_updated":1496987311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32283761","author":{"steamid":"76561198156207012","num_games_owned":438,"num_reviews":258,"playtime_forever":593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":593,"last_played":1496985680},"language":"schinese","review":"这游戏的创意屌爆了，简直不能太棒，最后几章真好玩，这才是最棒的游戏，还有什么时候出第三部","timestamp_created":1496985799,"timestamp_updated":1496985857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32283649","author":{"steamid":"76561198201398390","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":495,"last_played":1598199517},"language":"russian","review":"Nice","timestamp_created":1496985273,"timestamp_updated":1496985273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32283367","author":{"steamid":"76561198237948432","num_games_owned":420,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":5283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1456,"last_played":1553849282},"language":"turkish","review":"Pekala itiraf ediyorum! İlk Portal oyunuyla tanışmama bir hayli geç oldu. Neden bilmiyorum ancak ilk çıktığı zamanlarda zamanın yeni çıkan oyunları arasında biraz kaynamıştı. Dolayısı ile tam olarak ilgi gösteremedim ancak en sonunda onunla tanışınca kalbimi bu kadar çabuk fethedeceğini hiç ummuyordum.\n\nOldum olası bilmece, bulmaca olaylarına ilgi duymuşumdur eskiden beri. Ne zaman zeka oyunları veya zeka sorularıyla ilgili bir kitap bulsam, filmle karşılaşsam onu sömürürdüm. Onları çözme konusunda çok çok iyi olduğumu söyleyemem ancak yine de boş değilimdir hani.\n\nİşte böyle bir anda Portal gibi bir oyunu oynamak benim için ne kadar tatmin edici olduğunu hayal edebilirsiniz. İlk açtığımda ne yapacağımı bilemediğim Aperture Science’ın o beyaz duvarları arasında koşuşturmak, GLaDOS’un huşu dolu sesiyle rahatlamak ve turretlerın “I don’t hate you” sözleri ile hala sevildiğimi bilme duygusunu yaşamak oyun boyunca kahkahalarla geçen bu zaman içerisinde ayrı bir motivasyon olmuştu benim için.\n\nŞimdi üzerinden dört yıl geçti ve bu mükemmel oyunun ikincisi raflara çıktı. Ne yalan söyleyeyim hayatımda ilk defa gözümü bile kırpmadan parayı basıp aldığım bir oyundur Portal 2. Hatta ilk defa ön sipariş ile aldığım oyun olduğunu da yine itiraf ediyorum. Neyse benden bu kadar bahsetmek yeter. Şimdi gelelim Chell, GLaDOS, Atlas, P-Body ve elbette ki yeni dostumuz Wheatley’e.\n\nIt’s allright, it’s allright don’t be panic! Ok, you may panic! \n\nValve’ın aslında pek çok oyuncuda büyük bir hayal kırıklığına uğrattığına hepimiz hem fikirizdir büyük olasılıkla. Nitekim Valve’ın Valve olmasını sağlayan, oyun dünyasına 40 milyon tonluk ağır bir top gibi düşen Half-Life’ın Episode 3’ünü yıllar geçmesine rağmen çıkartmaması pek çok kişiyi hayal kırklığına uğrattı. Ancak Valve bu işte bir yerden alırken bir yerden veriyor.\n\nİlk başta dilerseniz Portal 2’nin konusundan başlayalım. İlk oyunu bitirenlerin hatırlayacağı gibi Chell ile sevimli ve esprili yapay zekamız GLaDOS’u yok edip kendimizi Aperture Science’ın dışında baygın (her ne kadar etrafı görebilsek de Chell’in o sırada baygın olduğunu düşünüyorum) bir şekilde yatarken buluyorduk. Ardından göremediğimiz ancak robotik sesler çıkartan bir şey tarafından sürüklenirken oyunumuz sona eriyordu.","timestamp_created":1496984093,"timestamp_updated":1496984093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511111080646514893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32283185","author":{"steamid":"76561198094139260","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":876,"last_played":1536818760},"language":"english","review":"well written game","timestamp_created":1496983366,"timestamp_updated":1496983366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32282512","author":{"steamid":"76561198307729720","num_games_owned":360,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":3913,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2437,"last_played":1639587454},"language":"russian","review":"Шедевральное продолжение первой части Portal.В этой части по моему мнению более интересен сюжет и разнообразие в тестовых камерах.

Also, as repetitive as the Aperture Science's laboratory may be, the developers made the setting look different over time, changing location drastically to keep the player in a fresh environment.\n\nThe game, as expected on Source Engine, ran smoothly through all the 76 hours of playtime I had, and never suffered from a framerate drop.\n\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION: [/h1]\nWhat else can I say? The music is great, it fits perfectly with the sci-fi atmosphere of the game, the sound effects have a really high quality, and if all that wasn't enough, BOOM! 6 extra hours to spend with a friend in co-op puzzles! But wait...that still isn't enough...what about a test chamber editor connected to the steam workshop, so you can play an infinite amount of puzzles for the rest of your life or create your own to share with the world?\n\nThis game doesn't have many downsides, the only problem I had is that I didn't quite like some rare sections of the story set in gigantic, asymmetric spaces, finding it confusing most of the time to get through. The only other problem that you might have with this game is your taste, of course. A must-buy if you like puzzle games.\n\nAfter rating all the aspects of the game, I've come to the conclusion that there is no reason for me to not give this game a 10/10. No game is perfect, but this one comes really close to such achievement.","timestamp_created":1496679589,"timestamp_updated":1542918459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32202507","author":{"steamid":"76561197992880557","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2701,"last_played":1638648406},"language":"english","review":"Excellent with all the workshop maps","timestamp_created":1496678618,"timestamp_updated":1496678618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32200912","author":{"steamid":"76561198231786084","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":6601,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4738,"last_played":1656226102},"language":"dutch","review":"dit is mijn favoriete game.

Now, granted, this is portal...don't expect a ton of depth and meta-strategy, but there's something to be said for a game in which the point is to just keep moving forward.  It's brilliant in its simplicity and beauty, and it's another game that exhibits the truth that games can be deep, meaningful, engaging, enriching art.  Very enriching.  You'll get all the enrichment you can handle, really.  Anyways, I'll stop rambling like on the main characters does and wrap this up!  This is a super well-crafted game and highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1496594912,"timestamp_updated":1496594985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32178875","author":{"steamid":"76561198215020432","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1861,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1176,"last_played":1613671461},"language":"english","review":"Must play, after portal 1, of course.","timestamp_created":1496590307,"timestamp_updated":1496590307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32177751","author":{"steamid":"76561198139954357","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":15463,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":1865,"last_played":1660330345},"language":"english","review":"Puzzles, GLaDOS , annoying little fucc wheatly.\nIts good... inuff","timestamp_created":1496587096,"timestamp_updated":1496587096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32176166","author":{"steamid":"76561198279600706","num_games_owned":1936,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":2962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":256,"playtime_at_review":552,"last_played":1660104632},"language":"schinese","review":"与1代比起来游戏流程也变长了不少。1代通关用了3小时，而2代用了9个多小时。\n传送门系列真的名不虚传，游戏真的很有意思。非常值得一试的游戏","timestamp_created":1496582187,"timestamp_updated":1496582187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.697399139404296875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32176109","author":{"steamid":"76561198217507596","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1056,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":684,"last_played":1626010630},"language":"schinese","review":"延续了1代的剧情，1代的模式。而且还添加了更多的东西。\n即使到现在也是很多解谜游戏无法超越的。\n如果有，那一定是传送门3。","timestamp_created":1496582010,"timestamp_updated":1496582167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32174522","author":{"steamid":"76561198336776600","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":687,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":621,"last_played":1556311363},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩  就是玩久了头太晕了   1、2一起买的   不过 我玩过之后  觉得  只玩2 就够了","timestamp_created":1496577238,"timestamp_updated":1496577238,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv4y9udwCepveeg=="}
