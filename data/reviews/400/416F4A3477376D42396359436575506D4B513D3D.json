I felt the levels were easier than Portal 2, but that may just be because i put 37 hours on Portal 2 before playing this.\nThe pieces of dialogue were good and enjoyable but again...not as good as Portal 2.\n\nIf you want a Portal game, i would say to pick up Portal 2 directly, it's a superior game in every way possible, you don't need to worry about this one. If you want to know a little bit more about Glados, or you just want to know what happened before the events of Portal 2, or even if puzzle games is not your thing and you want a light introduction to Portal, then go ahead and buy this one too, but see Portal as a \"warm-up\" for the real thing, that being Portal 2.\n\nAh oh, let's not forget this game has the best credits screen in all of video games history :)","timestamp_created":1404093333,"timestamp_updated":1499003390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532967031002044678","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10960592","author":{"steamid":"76561198036301521","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":185,"last_played":1404091515},"language":"spanish","review":"este juego es muy entretenido, algunos puzzles son bastante complejos, pero con imaginacion se pueden resolver, las torretas tienen un tono de voz bastante divertido con dialogos muy curiosos.\na cualquiera que le gusten los videojuegos deberian jugarlo\n\nContras: es corto, en una sola tarde te lo puedes terminar","timestamp_created":1404091672,"timestamp_updated":1404091672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10960392","author":{"steamid":"76561198061703404","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189,"last_played":1585874228},"language":"english","review":"I need not describe the components of this game.

The problems placed in your  path by Aperture Science's research departments pose no real hard thinking to solve, however it is all in the execution.  Plus there is cake involved!!  And if cake was not a big enough of a reward there are bonus maps at the end of a successful test cycle. \n\nEven thou this game was released back in 2007 if you have not played Portal before it is a great game for a Steam sale pickup and comes highly recommended.\n\nJazzy :D","timestamp_created":1404087898,"timestamp_updated":1404088028,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10959058","author":{"steamid":"76561198077273370","num_games_owned":1027,"num_reviews":203,"playtime_forever":329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":324,"last_played":1527362537},"language":"schinese","review":"神作游戏分两种，当时的和超越时间的，传送门就属于超越时间的的神作经典，创意真是神来之笔，玩法设计真是赞爆了，可惜引擎的原因，游戏晕眩的人挺多","timestamp_created":1404087340,"timestamp_updated":1525603435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10959034","author":{"steamid":"76561198131200879","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":260,"last_played":1410889528},"language":"brazilian","review":"O que dizer de Portal...
