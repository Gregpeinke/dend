Back in 2007 when the first BioShock game came out, I admittedly didn’t give it a fair chance. Even when BioShock 2 was released and all my gamer buddies were chomping at the bit for another foray into Rapture, I was more so “le meh”. I know, kind of troll-ish but that was how I approached it. I remember when I first saw screenshots and footage of BioShock Infinite and the original debut trailer, I was blown away by this new art direction the series was taking. In place of the bleak solitary horror film-esque tone of the first game, this new world was bright and vibrant with an air of vaudeville sensibilities. Before I continue with this review, I have to mention that it takes a lot for a stubborn bloke like myself to just “change” his mind from something I was so convinced of. I did not like BioShock, and I just put it away much like how I wrote off many other things I didn’t give a fair chance to. BioShock Infinite did for me what many of my friends couldn’t convince my stubborn ass to do, and that was give the first BioShock a fair playthough, and while a few of the things that turned me off a bit still persist, I have to say already being half way through, I am enjoying myself. BioShock Infinite was a memorable gaming experience that I will hold near to my heart, that reason alone was enough to load up BioShock again.\n\nWelcome to the floating state of Columbia. BioShock Infinite takes place in the early 1900’s in a city floating above the United States. Columbia has seceded from the US and rather than still sharing the land, they float above it with a holier-than-thou gaze, a theme that seems ever present throughout the game’s narrative. You are Booker DeWitt, a man down on his luck with debt to his ears. He is tasked with infiltrating Columbia to rescue Elizabeth, a girl who has been kept under lock and key since she was an infant, and take her back with him to New York. With that, Booker satisfies his employers and his debt will be paid. Rescuing the girl isn’t that simple though, Booker will have to face down the leader of Columbia, Zachary Comstock, and a giant beast called Songbird. Booker and Elizabeth’s adventure quickly spirals into a story touching on themes of politics, religion, racism, classism, and of course quantum mechanics.\n\nDespite some incredibly heavy subject matter, the game’s narrative never leaves you wondering “WTF” too often, a few moments may leave you perplexed, but this isn’t like your typical boy meets girl story. Speaking of that, I am so glad that the story didn’t all of a sudden melt into a melodramatic love ballad between the two protagonists. I love a good love story but it would feel incredibly out of place with the narrative. Comstock is an almost perfect villain for the story with Songbird being a truly terrifying monster. What makes Comstock so perfect is how his influence in an effect will turn every resident in Columbia against you; you are the enemy of the state, the false shepherd meant to lead his flock astray. The grand religious undertones are more than evident through most of the game. Songbird is a massive beast, ever watching and searching for Elizabeth, its main directive is to protect her and return her to the tower if she is ever to leave. Some of the best moments of the story come when the pair is forced to deal with and confront Songbird.\n\nOne of Elizabeth’s powers is her ability to open “tears” in the space-time-continuum. These tears lead to another world (or version of the world). The tears stand as the main driving force of the game’s narrative. Are you familiar with the theory behind quantum mechanics? One simple explanation is that for every choice we make, there is the possibility of another choice that directly contrasts. It theorized that if you go left, immediately another world is created where you make the choice to go right instead. This creates a seemingly “infinite” (see what I did there?) possibility of worlds. Elizabeth’s power allows her to access these worlds, interacting with them whether it is an item that wasn’t there before or (eventually) walking into them entirely. It takes a little bit to wrap your head around it, but this leads perfectly to subtitling the game “Infinite”.\n\nThis isn’t 2007s BioShock. When you trade a city under the sea for a city above the clouds, the scenery changes drastically. Gone are the dark corridors and glass pipes connecting one deck to the next. Instead, we have beautiful scenery and bright vibrant colors. One of the reasons I was so turned off by the original BioShock was the overall ambiance of the level design. While Rapture felt incredibly isolating, I never felt alone while traversing Columbia. From the buildings to the beaches, Irrational Games paid close attention to all the little details. Levels are designed fairly linear with some encouraging the player to deviate a bit, mostly for scavenging or side quests, been never too far off the beaten path. At times, Elizabeth will stop and mention that you can either continue the story or take a detour for some supplies. Generally this is a good chance to stock up on salts, bring your health back up, or scrounge abandoned crates for ammo and money.\n \nI was not a BioShock fan when I first bought this game and my purchase was driven solely by the artistic choices the developers made, BioShock Infinite is a great choice for the person who wasn't a BioShock fan\nAt some point in the game, they mention that stealing from folk or provoking the authorities will result in some unsavory consequences, but these are rarely explored. Personally I felt that was a bit of a missed opportunity, they could have implemented a simple morality system into the overarching narrative. Some points do allow a bit of choice, but never beyond a glorified heads or tails. Columbia feels huge, and if it wasn’t for the fairly linear and direct quest path, I feel like I’d be lost most of the time. Though I wouldn’t say this is a bad thing, as I stated earlier the scenery is beautiful, every extra minute I can spend admiring the world in this game was well worth it.\n\nA final thought that comes to mind, in reflection of my time playing BioShock Infinite I feel this sense of regret. It's a bittersweet feeling mind you, this isn't regret from disappointment in the game mechanics or story, based on my review it's obvious how much I loved this game. My regret stems from that fact that never again will I feel the same way I did when I first played this game, never again will I get to experience Columbia the way I did when I first saw that vibrant skyline. I do intend to replay this game sometime down the road mind you, but it won't be the same as my first... There's something inherently beautiful about that.","timestamp_created":1466293601,"timestamp_updated":1466293601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23641648","author":{"steamid":"76561198026089698","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2193,"last_played":1449531480},"language":"german","review":"Vorbemerkung: Ich versuch es kurz zu halten.\n\nBioShock Infinite ist der erste BioShock Titel den ich mir selbst zugelegt habe und wurde nicht enttäuscht. \n(Hab da wirklich keine Platte gehabt wie beliebt das ist/war, bis ich nach dem Spielen mal im Netz geschaut hab xD )\nZuvor habe ich es den 1. und 2.

Not to knock the gameplay itself but the vanilla story plus the burial at sea additions makes for a phenomenal, engrossing story that carries such character and gravity that the themes, lessons and characters will stay with me forever. This game marked the point where I stopped seeing games as fun diversion and a medium for art and story telling. I loved both Bioshock games preceding this one yet, this one smashed both. Set in the early 1900's you play Booker Dewitt; a troubled, drinking, gambling former army man in some serious debt troubles. He is given a small box of pictures, instructions and gun and sent to a floating city in the sky, Columbia. His creditors leave him with one single way to absolve himself or what he owes, \"bring us the girl and wipe away the debt\". This quest takes him through the secessionist city of Columbia, what feels like a homely, nostalgic, comforting, turn-of-the-century American town prosperously steaming its way into greatness into its greatest century. This fantasy is quickly dispelled when the community is revealed to be a strict, racist, xenophobic cult zealously following their evangelical prophet, Father Comstock. You find yourself through a series of unfortunate events, fighting your way to your objective, a massive angelic tower where the \"girl\" is supposed to be. It is here where you are introduced to one of the smartest, toughest, truest, prettiest, and most clever and most complicated female characters in gaming, Elizabeth Comstock. The kind of character I want my daughter to look to as a role model, she is tough and smart without sacrificing any of the qualities that make her feminine like so many poor attempts at making strong female characters in gaming do. She's like the princess locked in a tower that has spent all her time learning how to take care of herself when she gets a chance to break out. Throughout your quest to return with your quarry, she proves she is capable of getting what she wants with or without your help. You are constantly confronted with a horrific perversion of American values tainted with racism and xenophobia. The truly terrifying fact about this dystopia is that it is more truth than embellishment and to be confronted with what we once were as a country is too much for many people to accept. The story takes you through events that make you question whether you are truly a good guy, shows you that those who claim to be righteous never are pure and that all men sin. There is a major turning point changing the balance of power (no spoilers) which feels like Le Miserables meets the Russian Revolution of 1917. The story works its way to a conclusion that leaves you feeling satisfied yet deeply sad and conflicted. This game takes several play-throughs to truly comprehend the gravity of this story. The gameplay itself is dynamic, Elizabeth is the most helpful companion in any game I've ever played (when she goes Navi and says 'Hey! Listen!' she has ammo, health, money and vigor salts). Many different guns and limited carrying capacity constantly keeps your toes as the combat situation changes. Vigors take the place of plasmids but have a similar role making for a variety of strategies when paired with different weapons and environments. Elizabeth also has another trick up her sleeve; she can open dimensional \"tears\" which are portals to different universes. Sometimes she can open a tear that has cover, or an escape or maybe a fully loaded chain gun. This keeps all the conflict fresh and challenging throughout the course of the game. The game itself is absolutely incredible yet it is truly completed by the burial at sea add-ons. I can't get too much into them for fear of spoiling what for me were some truly mind-blowing moments of terror, sadness and heart-fluttering nostalgia. You go forward from Columbia's wonderful vistas and troubled populous to the start of it all, Rapture. You get to watch Andrew Ryan's vison unravel and implode leaving you with the feeling of Deja vu felt when you see the Pillar of Autumn waiting to evacuate Reach. The second part of the game forces you to play differently, confronting familiar enemies as Mrs. Elizabeth herself in a style that feels very much like Bethesda's \"Dishonored\". The conclusion to this story is burned into my brain, watching the stories of Infinite and the original Bioshock woven together in a masterful way.

The pacing of the game and immersiveness is very strong -- plus the game is just gorgeous (and looks good even not on all high graphics settings).
