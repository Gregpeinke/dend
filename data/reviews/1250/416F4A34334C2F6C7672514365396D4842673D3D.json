A maximum of 6 people can participate, and you have a choice of 7 perks/classes which have different specializations in weapons, from automatic rifles to explosives, melee, et cetera. Instead of going from point A to B in L4D's campaign mode, Killing Floor is more or less the survival mode, where you have a bunch of waves of monsters that you mow down, and in between waves you spend your mysteriously obtained cash for better weapons.\n\nEach specimen has their own unique properties to learn and exploit. It's lots of fun trying different things out on the stronger specimens - sharpshooters can pop scrakes and fleshpounds in the head with a crossbow, while berserkers can stun scrakes and kite fleshpounds to avoid them from charging the team. Your classes level up as you use their abilities, and there are 4 difficulty modes to keep you busy.","timestamp_created":1325010022,"timestamp_updated":1325010022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2796585","author":{"steamid":"76561198012755413","num_games_owned":535,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":4544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4281,"last_played":1383844132},"language":"czech","review":"Dobrá kosička zombie, co dodat !","timestamp_created":1325010014,"timestamp_updated":1325010014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2357509","author":{"steamid":"76561198006287429","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":463,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":433,"last_played":1373835670},"language":"spanish","review":"Gore, armas, slow motion, ¿que más se puede pedir?","timestamp_created":1325010007,"timestamp_updated":1325010007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3118789","author":{"steamid":"76561198017760653","num_games_owned":339,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":38263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30121,"last_played":1433014067},"language":"english","review":"Best co-op game ever !!!","timestamp_created":1325009994,"timestamp_updated":1325009994,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1931907","author":{"steamid":"76561197999904398","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1514,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":742,"last_played":1418794167},"language":"english","review":"Zombies, Guns, Great accents, Dosh!

It's an action-packed survival Co-Op that requires both individual and teamwork skills to beat maps, especially at harder difficulties. You can't simply spam whole area with bullets (well, you might, but you won't last long) as you need to make proper use of your perk abilities (7 to choose from) and weapons (varying for each class) to clear ever-increasing waves of mutants (or zombies, if you prefer). Genuinely well-made maps and balanced weaponry seem only natural here.\n\nThe two downsides to this game are an abundance of DLCs and - at times - performance. Fortunately, nearly all of DLCs consist of character packs and only minority showcase new weapons. There are also reskin pack for weapons (golden and camo), but if you're not really into these things, they will only irk you. Performance is a big thing, though - if you have got an old(er) machine, you might find your KF dropping frames as hell, even on the lowest video settings.\n\nCutting long story short, I have to say Killing Floor is one of the best games I have ever played in my life, even despite its flaws - and by comparing to tonnes of fun it can give you, is really inexpensive.","timestamp_created":1325009344,"timestamp_updated":1386082590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3029889","author":{"steamid":"76561198016197613","num_games_owned":378,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1327219200},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра в режиме выживания, можно весело поиграть с друзьями, различное оружия как ближнего боя таки дальнего предостаточно, но к сожелению игра очень быстро вам надоест, играть в неё слишком долго невозможно.
