They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you","timestamp_created":1625235865,"timestamp_updated":1625235865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.327465087175369263","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94880890","author":{"steamid":"76561198941579029","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":349,"last_played":1644529589},"language":"turkish","review":"y

If you want to play the original Half-Life just get the original game, Half-Life Source just adds the following worthless additions:\n[list]\n[*] Useless graphical additions - folks, this is a game from 1998, you can't expect miracles. It will look somewhat dated and blocky, and that is part of the charm. All the visual additions form Source do not mesh well the game at all, the only thing that really looks nicer is the water, frankly this isn't worth it. Plus the levels load much slower than in the old Half-Life.\n[*] Sound is too loud and somewhat broken - instead of doing a lot of the pointless fluff they could have added proper subtitles to the game, but no, instead you get to hear the crowbar sound like it's hitting metal all the time. But you can reduce the overall sound, sure, my OS can handle that itself, thanks for nothing.\n[*] Infuriating physics - with the new engine they also introduced the worst set of physics ever. Not only does Gordon move with this disgusting momentum that keeps him moving when you release the keys, they also added physics to some of the platforming, all of this without redesigning the levels. This is frustrating as all hell, because the maps were not meant to have this \"feature\".\n[*] Buggy as hell - the original also had a few bugs, but this one takes the cake. Too many times I found myself stuck on scenery or characters and had to noclip out of there. The problem?

Ну ладно,начнём по порядку.  Графика: из изменений это освещение,тени,эффекты, частицы, скайбоксы , трупы стали физическими объектами и вода стала прозрачной. По сравнению с первой части конечно стало лучше,но текстуры,персонажи,модели и окружение осталось таким же,разве что геометрию немного улучшили  Геймплей: он остался таким же,но пару вещей изменили. 1: У некоторых пушек увеличили отдачу,если у глока еще более-менее нормальная отдача,то с MP5 стало практически невозможно стрелять,пушку колбасит вверх-вниз,из-за чего кажется что ты играешь за алкаша который держит пушку в одной руке.2: Игра потеряла одну из главных фишек оригинала, а именно жестокость. В оригинале можно было разорвать противников в клочья да и крови было предостаточно. А что в Source: противников можно разорвать на куски,но это можно сделать пока они живы,трупы разорвать увы не получится. А вот крови стало меньше,хоть и стала лучше по качеству. Но самая главная проблема этой игры-баги. Их тут дохрена: Тентакли не могут нанести урон,вертолет который невозможно сбить,все ракеты пролетают сквозь него,физика порой странно ведёт,иногда объекты переворачиваются очень медленно,освещение тоже сломано,как будто все поверхности хромированные,особенно это заметно на пушках. А вот в моменте где надо пройти по конвейерной ленте,я сильно испугался. Я сначала думал что у меня произошёл отвал видюхи,а это был просто баг. А Valve видимо не собирается исправлять их,а зачем,всё равно схавают Итог: Half Life:Souce-это яркий пример того,что разработчикам абсолютно похуй на качество своего продукта и на игроков,и главное для них это срубить побольше денег .
