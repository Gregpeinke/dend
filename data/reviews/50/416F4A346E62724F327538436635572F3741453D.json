Life: Opposing Force[/u] is, like Half Life: Blue Shift, another spin-off of the famous video game Half Life.\n\nThis time, you will embark on the adventures of Corporal [u]Adrian Shepard[/u], a brave soldier from the American military, who, initially charged with capturing Gordon Freeman, will find himself having to cancel the mission and do the only more sensible thing: run away from Black Mesa at all costs!\nWith the help of the survivors of Black Mesa and his military companions, he will face the looming alien threat and the mysterious \"agents in black\", who also seem willing to hunt Gordon Freeman and eliminate anyone who dares to escape from Black Mesa.\n\nThe game proves much longer and richer in content (in fact you will be able to use many military weapons including the Desert Eagle which is a variant of the revolver, the LMG, the sniper rifle, the C4, the anti-personnel mine with laser sensor, the rocket-launcher with laser aiming system to guide missiles and even alien weapons, very useful when you run out of ammunition) and full of action compared to Half Life: Blue Shift (there are many types of aliens and zombies to face and there are the agents in black who are very tough).\n\nThe story may be trivial, but actually, like Half Life: Blue Shift, the game is another important part of the Half Life story.\nIn fact, through Shepard's eyes, you will be able to discover some parts of the Half Life story (for example the powerful explosion in Black Mesa, which occurred because of a bomb brought by the agents in black and tampered with by the mysterious Gman).\nWell yes, even in this game you will be able to meet Gman for more than once, who will sometimes try to help you and in other times he will try to stop you.\n\nAnother peculiarity of this game is the possibility of interacting with the characters, especially with the military companions, who will give you support by fighting alongside you (there are the engineer who, equipped with the blowtorch, can open any armored door and the doctor who will provide you with medical treatment).\nThe problem is their intelligence which is a little bad (they tend to disperse without reason and at some point they don't follow you, as if they don't see you anymore).\n\nThe game is a lot of fun because it gives you the impression of fulfilling a real military mission and acting like a soldier and above all there are some bosses to be eliminated.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1579983099,"timestamp_updated":1579983099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62389725","author":{"steamid":"76561198385036781","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1580233614},"language":"russian","review":"123455","timestamp_created":1579966969,"timestamp_updated":1579966969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62385885","author":{"steamid":"76561198857442455","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1619183524},"language":"russian","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1579962864,"timestamp_updated":1579962864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62384839","author":{"steamid":"76561198048718119","num_games_owned":269,"num_reviews":136,"playtime_forever":347,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":347,"last_played":1576373054},"language":"english","review":"Killing

no termin√© de jugarlo, as√≠ que probablemente edite esta rese√±a m√°s tarde.\nOpposing Force es otro juegazo. Si bien es un Half-Life, se siente distinto al original por las siguientes razones:\n-Hay mayor variedad de enemigos (Algunos son mucho m√°s desafiantes que los del primer juego).\n-Mayor variedad de armas, d√°ndote m√°s opciones en un tiroteo, o incluso en resolver ciertos problemas.\n-Los puzzles se vuelven MUCHO m√°s simples, no s√© si es por el bien del jugador, la aparici√≥n de carteles repetitivos que te dicen qu√© hacer, o si fue solo el hecho de que agarr√© m√°s experiencia al terminar HL1 con sus puzzles.\n-El dise√±o de los mapas (Black Mesa) tiene mucho m√°s sentido que anteriormente, aunque sigue habiendo tonter√≠as como dep√≥sitos de cajas cada medio cap√≠tulo.\n-Da una visi√≥n amplia del lado rival y ''malvado'', los HECU, al contrario que en Half Life, que todos usan el mismo uniforme y una misma funci√≥n\n-etc.\n9.5/10\n\nEDIT\n\n(SPOILER ALERT)\n\n\n\nEl jefe final del juego es realmente decepcionante y aburrido. No solo eso, si no que siempre hace lo mismo. Matarlo ha sido un aburrimiento total. Modifico mi rese√±a sobre este juego.\nEl discurso de Gman fue... ok. No mejor que el de hacia Gordon pero de todas maneras bueno. Un final inconcluso. Me gust√≥.
