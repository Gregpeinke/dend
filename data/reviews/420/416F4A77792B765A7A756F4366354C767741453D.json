I plan on playing through at least HL2 and HL2E1 again and writing brief reviews for them as well upon completion. I also did hide some story related stuff with spoiler text even though the game is over ten years old, but I would feel bad if I didn't.**  \n\nI always understood why people were disappointed that they never got a HL3 or at the very least a HL2E3. When you spend so much time in a fictional world and get invested in how the story plays out, the natural inclination of course is to have a desire to see it through to the end. My goal when starting with the first HL for the very first time over two years was to see this through as far as I thought it would take me. Upon completing the last game in the main series, I have to say I am torn about how I feel, but more on that later. The following \"review\" will not contain a break-down of any single game element. Instead, I just want to try to explain how I felt after finally completing what the main series had to offer thus far.\n\nFirst off, this entire series rightfully deserves its place in the pantheon of Greatest Games/Series of All Time. The game play is [i] so [/i] damn satisfying, the graphics [i] still [/i] hold up (even on my below average PC), the characters are interesting and likable, the story is able to be unique even if it borrows from some tried-and-true SF tropes, the story is told in a very engaging and immersive way, etc. I could go on and on, but what I'm trying say is that this series is the complete package. I would recommend it to everyone even if you think it will be hard because your FPS skills with a keyboard and mouse are trash (like I did...and still do). This game needs to be experienced by everyone, but I realize that if I keep going I will only continue to repeat everything that has already been said about this franchise since the original released over 20 years ago so I will get to my main point. \n\n**Most of what comes next is going to seem obvious to anyone who played the game when it first came out, but it's meant to be taken in the context of the perspective of someone who did not even start the original until 2 years ago and had managed to largely avoid spoilers (except of course that the game ended with no complete resolution).**\n\nI would be more okay with this being the last HL main entry if it had a more definitive ending. I used to think everyone was upset because they didn't get any more HL and simply couldn't finish. I was wrong. \n\nEveryone is pissed because the ending to E2 makes the entire franchise seem incomplete. The player doesn't even get to retaliate after [spoiler] Eli dies [/spoiler]. The game literally ends [i] right [/i] in the middle of a cut scene. There's no riding off into the sunset to take on the next mission or anything like that. It is a HUGE cliffhanger. Another problem that makes the ending worse is that there was a lot of time in E2 that was spent building up the resolution. I feel like the entire last half of the game was dedicated to building the plot for whatever was supposed to come after E2. This wouldn't have been a big deal if they made it more mysterious or possibly just dropped a few obscure pieces of foreshadowing here and there. Instead, they clearly tell you what is coming next. It suggests [spoiler] a new snowy/cold environment and even more pieces of lore with the intro of Aperture Labs [/spoiler] and in over ten years nothing has come of it.\n\nIf it sounds like I'm complaining, I assure you I'm not. I will still sing this franchise's praises as the majority of fans do. I will still recommend the franchise to people who haven't played it because it really is something worth experiencing. I'm simply commiserating with every other person who feels let down or unsatisfied by the ending to this game/series. It just sucks. There is so much potential that just felt wasted after the credits to E2 rolled. \n\nI know the rumor mill has been churning along ever since we realized that a sequel was farther and farther from sight  and I don't know how much I trust any new tidbit we might get even if it's from Valve. However, I'm actually hopeful that we will get a legitimate end and/or continuation (maybe at this point let's just hope for a conclusion though...) to the franchise eventually because I can be stupidly optimistic about this kind of thing. \n\nIf you made it this far thanks for reading and know that another poor soul to share the pain with has been added to the list of people eagerly awaiting Gordon Freeman's next and (hopefully) final chapter.","timestamp_created":1559516098,"timestamp_updated":1559516098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51021510","author":{"steamid":"76561198368666601","num_games_owned":287,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":801,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":503,"last_played":1607537456},"language":"russian","review":"6/10","timestamp_created":1559511189,"timestamp_updated":1559511189,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490192830562591553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51021122","author":{"steamid":"76561198103936871","num_games_owned":777,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":17,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16,"last_played":1588366773},"language":"english","review":"Pros: \nGreat story (BTW I have played through this before I don't know why it's 0 hours)\nGreat gameplay\nGreat mechanics/physics\nGMOD textures\nCons:\nidk lol","timestamp_created":1559509581,"timestamp_updated":1559509581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51011784","author":{"steamid":"76561198204814148","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1990,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1987,"last_played":1655478468},"language":"german","review":"hurensohn achievements","timestamp_created":1559475654,"timestamp_updated":1655478205,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50998059","author":{"steamid":"76561198102072543","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":505,"last_played":1559842457},"language":"turkish","review":"10 yıldan fazla süredir 3. seriyi bekliyoruz hala çıkmadı.half life sever olarak ölenekadar 3. serinin çıkmasını bekleyeceğiz.(tabi o zamana kadar gabe yaşarsa )","timestamp_created":1559412693,"timestamp_updated":1559412693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50994781","author":{"steamid":"76561198262012457","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":264,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1646686553},"language":"brazilian","review":"MELHOR JOGO DA VIDA, incrível história, cenários, personagens, é um título obrigado para um gamer.","timestamp_created":1559402150,"timestamp_updated":1559402150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50994712","author":{"steamid":"76561198038634733","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":368,"last_played":1559390868},"language":"english","review":"one day we might get half life 3 ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne day.","timestamp_created":1559401948,"timestamp_updated":1559401948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50992552","author":{"steamid":"76561198081875438","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1571759865},"language":"english","review":"We need episode three or hl 3.

Also, the Striders were a lot more fun to fight than in the other two entries, in my opinion at least. A lot more creative than just shooting a rocket to its head. I enjoyed the battles against the Combine and the various headcrab zombies. The driving sections were also surprisingly fun this time, which is a first for the Half Life series imo.

[/quote]\n\nBu oyunu tavsiye edip etmeme konusunda çok düşündüm. Baya arada kaldım açıkçası. Dürüst olmak gerekirse kendimi zorlayarak olumlu verdim. Sebeplerini anlatarak açıklayacağım inceleme boyunca.\n\nŞimdi kısaca hikayeyi özetleyelim. Oyun direk Episode One nerede bıraktıysa orada başlıyor. Elimizdeki verileri isyancıların üssüne götürmeye çalışıyoruz. Bu sayede karşı saldırı yapmayı amaçlıyoruz. Bu kadar kısa özetlemem gerekiyor çünkü Episode Two bize hikayeden çok aksiyon sunuyor. Yani hikayeyle ilgili 2 gram bilgi versem bile neler olabileceğini anlayabilirsiniz. O yüzden direk hikayeyle ilgili eleştirime geçiyorum. Aferin Valve. Neden aferin? Size şöyle anlatayım. Serinin hemen her oyununu oynadım. Aradan uzun yıllar geçmiş olmasına rağmen hikayeyi unutmadım. En azından ana hatlarıyla hatırlıyorum diyelim. Hikayeyle ilgili düşüncelerim ise hala aynı. Valve, evet güzel yapmışlar teşekkür ediyorum ama kabul edelim ki Half-Life serisi iyi hikaye anlatımından dolayı değil yenilikçi fizik motoru sayesinde ünlü oldu. Valve ise baktı seri tuttu hikayeyi genişletmeye ve oyunu sağmaya başladı. İyi hoş güzel hikayeler ortaya çıkardılar ama devamını getiremeyeceklerini biliyorlar. Kadroları hiçbir zaman iyi bir hikaye çıkarmaya yönelikte olmadı zaten. Ama buraya kadar iyi geldiler itiraf etmeliyim. Ama buraya kadar iyi geldiler. Yahu bu bölümün sonu niye bu kadar açık uçlu bırakılıyor anasını satıyım? Hayır, insan merak ediyor tutmuş bir seriyi neden bu şekilde bitirirsin? Aklıma gelen tek şey daha demin bahsettiğim olay. Devamını getiremeyeceklerini biliyorlar, çünkü hiçbir zaman hikayeye odaklanmadılar. Eh bu kadar da dallandırınca hikayeyi bağlamak zor oldu tabii ki. İşi çok karıştırmadan çekilmek istediklerini düşünüyorum bu yüzden. Bir yandan iyi bir yandan kötü. İyi yanı hikayenin suyunu çıkarmadan bitirmiş olmaları kötü yanı böyle aptalca final mi olur anasını satıyım? Hikaye yarım kaldım diye bağırıyor. \n\nOyunun mekaniklerine gelirsek bir öncekiyle tamamen aynı. Ama yine oyuna eklenen ekipmanlar ve düşmanlar tipleri var. Oyunu güzelce çeşitlendirmişler. Haritanın büyük olması da tabii ki oyunun mekaniklerini ciddi şekilde etkileyen faktörlerden. Örneğin bir yerden bir yere gitmek uzun süreceğinden kendimize özel araç eklemişler. Eh kuru kuruya da olmaz tabi bu araçta biz oyunda ilerledikçe geliştiriliyor. \n\nGörüntü kalitesi olayına girmiyorum. Episode One ile tamamen aynı. Yorumumu merak ediyorsanız inceleme linkimi bırakayım.\n\nHalf-Life 2: https://steamcommunity.com/id/Setna/recommended/220\n\nEpisode One: https://steamcommunity.com/id/Setna/recommended/380\n\nŞimdi işin özüne gelelim. Oyun güzel tabii ki ama hikayesi daha doğrusu finalleri tekrara uğramıştı, bu oyunun finalinde ise daha kötüsü oldu, yarım bırakıldı. Ben oynamanızı tavsiye ederim tabii ki. İleride, sanmıyorum ama, belki devam oyunu çıkar. O yüzden hikayesini bilmeniz iyi olur bence. 71SP","timestamp_created":1558897642,"timestamp_updated":1579287767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.611182510852813721","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50870277","author":{"steamid":"76561198098294496","num_games_owned":912,"num_reviews":87,"playtime_forever":310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1558897364},"language":"english","review":"it's half-life what do you expect me to say if you don't know half-life go die","timestamp_created":1558897291,"timestamp_updated":1558897291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483028709888458252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50863753","author":{"steamid":"76561198396855952","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":281,"last_played":1606013966},"language":"russian","review":"Прошёл этот эпизод, и... знаете.

Unlike the first episode, Episode II greatly expands upon the base title and almost feels like its own game rather than just a small expansion to the story. New shader, texture, and particle effects; legitimately new content rather than recycled, and an all-new story that allows players to see what lies beyond City 17 and empty barren wastelands off the coast along with knowing more of the true motives of the Combine. As you can tell, this is probably my most favourite of the trilogy had Episode II been better optimized and there was an Episode III.\n\nStill runs relatively well on low end integrated chipsets, although in certain areas and at times the framerate drops a lot and the performance overall is relatively lower than the other two titles because of the new visual assets. I can't really complain since it'd take years for other devs to make their games look as good as HL2 while requiring more powerful hardware to run them. Valve bragged about how HL2 had CGI quality shaders, but I feel like that was an exaggeration for the base game and definitley somewhat of a truth for this episode. Environmental and model textures are still inferior but for that time it was considered above average to good compared to other games then. I dislike how Valve doesn't update the system requirements even though it runs worse...kind of like with L4D2 and CSGO.\n\nWhile the first episode was more on action-packed combat and survival that resembled HL1, Episode II was more about exploring new areas and solving puzzles that weren't just limited to repeated old puzzles. This expansion also has its fair share of combat but I will avoid mentioning the spoilers since everyone probably knows and it's a short game that can be beaten within 6 hours for those that don't.  Obviously, the strength of this installment is being able to explore areas like underground cavern with an insect colony to a research laboratory turned insurgency defense base. Many loose ends are finally answered although thanks to Valve never releasing Episode 3 despite hidden files revealing they've actually been working on it for years several times - and have scrapped each project before it went past beta.\n\nLong story short (pun intended), Alyx and Gordon continue to escape the Combine's pursuit of the data they stole from the Citadel after it exploded in City 17 only to discover it contains the master plan of the empire. They meet up with some long time colleagues to prepare for a final assault to decimating their plans and preventing humanity from going extinct. Sadly, it ends with a major sad cliffhanger...and yes, I'm aware that a former writer at Valve has made a parody of what he envisioned Episode 3 to be like on his personal blog. Besides some minor flaws that aren't worth nitpicking, Episode 2 overall is a vast improvement over the first episode and is on par with Half-Life 2. I definitley recommend this expansion and advise you to buy this together in the HL2 bundle or Valve Complete Pack in a sale.","timestamp_created":1558279242,"timestamp_updated":1558279242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492448925971984863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50722228","author":{"steamid":"76561198081428819","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":337,"last_played":1558275931},"language":"spanish","review":"un final inesperado, que deja muchas intrigas","timestamp_created":1558278336,"timestamp_updated":1558278336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50720645","author":{"steamid":"76561198102845428","num_games_owned":401,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":301,"last_played":1605925260},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life 2: Episode Two\nПродолжение первого эпизода и финальный.\nБыли добавлены новые враги: Охотник, Рабочий муравьиный лев, Страж гнезда муравьиных львов.\nНовый транспорт: Вездеход Dodge Charger, с помощью которого вы будете путешествовать.\nАрсенал: Новый вид мин.\nТехнические изменения:Обновление движка Source, улучшение физики, улучшение графики, освещения с затемнением, улучшенный ИИ.\n\nЛокации  более открытые, что позволяет маневрировать, передвигаться на большие расстояния и использовать различные тактики.\n\nПродолжительность эпизода возросла по сравнению с первым.\n\nСюжет развивает и продолжает общую историю, завершаясь неожиданным, очень сильным и эмоциональным финалом.","timestamp_created":1558272832,"timestamp_updated":1558272832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50716690","author":{"steamid":"76561198849445228","num_games_owned":299,"num_reviews":95,"playtime_forever":338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":338,"last_played":1557391348},"language":"russian","review":"То чувство , когда второй эпизод , лучше все игры в целом","timestamp_created":1558256185,"timestamp_updated":1558256185,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50713523","author":{"steamid":"76561198014740076","num_games_owned":568,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":798,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":798,"last_played":1420000899},"language":"english","review":"Really needed a sequel","timestamp_created":1558238760,"timestamp_updated":1558238760,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50698778","author":{"steamid":"76561198235921746","num_games_owned":638,"num_reviews":143,"playtime_forever":372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":372,"last_played":1466429154},"language":"koreana","review":"하프라이프 트릴로지의 사실상 마지막 작품 3은 어디에다가 두고 더빙도 안해주고 그래도 마지막 작품으로써의 재미는 있지만 이게 마지막이면 안되는데...","timestamp_created":1558170973,"timestamp_updated":1558170973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50691040","author":{"steamid":"76561198841291104","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":609,"last_played":1581444297},"language":"russian","review":"3 ИЗ 3","timestamp_created":1558124053,"timestamp_updated":1558124053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50684657","author":{"steamid":"76561198216397895","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1424,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1406,"last_played":1608165895},"language":"english","review":"Had a lot of fun!
