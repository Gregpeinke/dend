In this 6-player co-op shooter, you must fend off wave after wave of nasty looking zeds, or you'll all be eaten alive.  The number of threats increase after you clear each wave, as well as presenting new, horrifying creatures over time.  After clearing a wave, you and your teammates must locate the Trader who opens up shop in various areas across each map to stock up on ammo, repair armor, and even purchase new weapons that'll come in handy later on.  After every wave has been cleared, players will be forced to face the Patriarch, the boss (or father of the zeds, as he claims) at the end of each game.  Not only is he the largest creature of them all, but can sprint at an incredible speed, attacking any player in his path.  In addition to chasing your team across the map, he has a machine gun for an arm to attack at great distances, as well as a rocket launcher to deal devastating blows if you aren't too careful.  Players will need to work together to face these challenges and come out alive.\n\nI highly recommend this to people who just enjoy violent, gore-heavy zombie shooters.","timestamp_created":1309724127,"timestamp_updated":1577892075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1252353","author":{"steamid":"76561197990124217","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":99,"last_played":1393377442},"language":"english","review":"TIITIIIISSS!!!!

A friend sent me the \"guest pass\" for Killing Floor and had me try it out, and then ended up gifting me it for $5 when I enjoyed it.  I first got Killing Floor in August of 2009, so 4 years later and I still play this game daily pretty much.  The replay value is through the roof, not to mention if you buy it on one of the frequent sales (I've seen Killing Floor more than 50% off at least TEN times in the year 2013 so far) will put it under $10 USD.  DLCs might have become a little pricey over the past few years, but the fact that Tripwire Interactive still does free content updates for this game nearly FIVE YEARS post release is simple mind blowing.  I don't know of any other company that continues support for it's product that long into the future.  The few companies that continually support releases that I can think of have all produced sequels to those games.\n\nNow to get down to gameplay.  Killing Floor first and foremost is a FPS game.  There are a variety of different types of guns, spread around in 7 different perks or classes.  These perks have a \"progression system\" that allows a player to get more \"profficient\" with the weapons of their classes and earn more \"bonuses\" such as being able to carry more ammo, do more damage, and other things of that nature.  Each perk has a different role which helps a team in it's own unique way.  Like making things blow up, then Demolitions is the perk for you with it's LAW, M32 multiple grenade launcher, m79, and others..  Like setting things on fire and feeding the inner pyromaniac in yourself?  Then firebug is the perk for you with it's flamethrower, flare revolvers, Husk fireball launcher, and other guns with incendiary ammo.  Enjoy the satisfying feeling of blowing an enemies head off?  Then pick the sharpshooter perk, with it's assortment of pistols, sniper rifle, compound crossbow, or various rifles.  Killing Floor has the most satisfying gun play of any game I've ever played.  Excellent feel to the weapons, and they look and sound great.  \n\nWhen it comes to enemies, there are 10 different types of enemies to deal with.  Each one of the \"zeds\" are similar in some ways, but different in most.  There are the basic enemies, such as the clot, which can grab any perk aside from the beserkser.  Clots don't do all that much damage, but they can make you not able to move and allow the other, more dangerous enemies to get to you and do more damage.  Then you get to the more specialised enemies such as stalkers, which can go invisible, bloats, which puke \"bile\" on you which can hurt you and ruin your body armor, to sirens, whose screams can shatter glass, destroy rockets, grenades and explosives, break down the welds of doors, and eventually make your head explode, to the husk, resistant to fire attacks (for the most part) who can melee you when up close but is much more dangerous at distance where they can shoot fireballs at you. The more advanced of the enemies are the Scrake, which is a high health enemy with a chainsaw that if it gets close to you, it will start to saw away at your health.  If you are getting attacked by a scrake, don't run, because their full swings and charging attacks do exponentially more damage to you.  Scrakes are best left to sharpshooters which can stun it, berserkers which can do the same thing, or support specialists that know advanced \"Techniques\" to deal iwth them,Next you have the Fleshpound, which is a big, hulking enemy with high health and hard to kill.  High head damage resistance make it so it shrugs off weaker weapons.  Sharpshooters with good aim and fast reflexes can take them out in a number of ways, but can really only do so one at a time.  Support specialists get explosives bonuses, which make it a good choice to take out fleshpounds (unless there is a siren nearby).  Demolotions is the most polished perk to take down Fleshpounds, as they have a weakness to explosives.  \n\nAfter you finish the \"waves\" of enemies, you then have to prepare to fight the boss of Killing Floor, the Patriarch.  The patriarch has some vicious melee attacks, and also has an arm with a rocketlauncher/chain gun combination that can and will kill you quick. Defeating the patrairch requires good teamwork and communication generally.\n\nLastly, but not least, is the fact that Killing Floor comes with a free to download SDK system that allows for modding of the game and creation of custom content.  This also comes with a community workshop area dedicated solely to Killing Floor.  So check out the steam workshop and try out some of the amazing modded content there is to offer.","timestamp_created":1309723670,"timestamp_updated":1385933319,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605396687984466553","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2577858","author":{"steamid":"76561198009515599","num_games_owned":1170,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":488,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":380,"last_played":1418196246},"language":"english","review":"If you like Left 4 Dead, you'll like this.","timestamp_created":1309723660,"timestamp_updated":1309723660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1632106","author":{"steamid":"76561197995644632","num_games_owned":438,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":42907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24770,"last_played":1592779710},"language":"english","review":"Jogo viciante!

You need to stay grouped up to survive the waves of zeds that will come for your flesh as there are simply too many zeds to deal with alone, especially in later waves.  Different classes will have weapons that can take out certain zed types more quickly and efficiently than other classes, which makes it more important to stick with your buddies and to put together a group of varying classes than can handle any situation.
