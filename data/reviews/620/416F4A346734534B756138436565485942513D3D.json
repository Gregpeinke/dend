I don't want to spoil it, but the first few minutes alone are so impressive, it literally took my breath away. Not since the opening scene of BioShock was I so awestruck at every single detail, from the grandiose to the minute.

On more than one occasion I looked into a chasm or void and was rewarded with a scene that instantly reminded me of the \"Neo wakes up\" scene in the Matrix. The length of the game is at least twice as long as the original but that is still not long enough, but this is a small quibble against what is easily the best game I have played this year.","timestamp_created":1303303424,"timestamp_updated":1303303424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1134282","author":{"steamid":"76561197987496632","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":45029,"playtime_last_two_weeks":65,"playtime_at_review":27466,"last_played":1659843847},"language":"english","review":"Awesome!!","timestamp_created":1303302570,"timestamp_updated":1303302570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2778888","author":{"steamid":"76561198012493084","num_games_owned":923,"num_reviews":103,"playtime_forever":1128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1056,"last_played":1441880970},"language":"english","review":"The sequel to the amazing hit portal released in 2007, this game plays like the original but is story much better story, puzzles, graphics. it awesome. go buy it.\nits amazing","timestamp_created":1303301309,"timestamp_updated":1303301309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"530854","author":{"steamid":"76561197971654833","num_games_owned":493,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":993,"last_played":1545528274},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely amazing game.  100 times better than Portal 1.
