Ken has been known for Bioshock and most importantly System Shock 2, and both those games focused on a interesting worlds with complex narratives. The game systems were flushed out and enjoyable, with Bioshock being streamlined with some great combat mechanics. They're not perfect games, but they keep the player interested. \n\nBioshock Infinite does not keep the player interested, instead you are in a giant linear shooting gallery with no thought involved. Gone are the tactical choices regarding Big Daddys, rather it's just pew pew you're dead all 7 hours of it. Not only that, but most of the enemies are bullet sponges. Serious, shooting at Robo Washingtons over and over again was just boring as hell. Rather than have an engaging story, you have a muddled mess of alternate realities, which just comes off as a lazy narrative technique. Seriously, it's been a few years and I forget the majority of this game's story. Bioshock's, however, will always stick with me.\n\nThere's a reason Ken shut down Irrational Games after this game was released. He knew he produced a game with boring gameplay and a trite narrative. I mean, look at this [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muJYTeQlvC4]video[/url] of the game we were supposed to get compared to what actually got released  \n\nThis was no where near the quality that was expected of Irrational, and frankly I'm surprised by the amount of positive reviews for this game.

In Columbia, der Stadt in den Wolken, hat man zunächst eine Art \"Freizeitpark- Feeling\". Alles ist farbenfroh, hell und freundlich.  Man kann ein paar Minispiele an Buden machen, bevor die eigentliche Handlung beginnt. \nSobald man Elisabeth gerettet hat,  steht sie einem hilfreich zur Seite und findet Münzen oder Dietriche. Im Kampf muss sie nicht beschützt werden, stattet uns aber mit Munition, Salzen oder Gesundheit aus. Zudem kann sie Risse öffnen, wodurch wir Zugriff auf zahlreiche Dinge erhalten, die das Leben und besonders den Kampf in Columbia vereinfachen. \nDie Story erscheint teilweise verwirrend, da man manchmal die Zeitebene wechselt. Richtig aufgeklärt wird die Handlung erst in den beiden DLCs, wo dann auch die anderen Bioshock-Teile mit Infinite verknüpft werden.\nEtwas schade ist, dass man nur zwei Waffen zugleich dabei haben kann, jedoch liegen überall verschiedene Waffen herum, sodass man schnell wechseln kann. Auch wäre es schön gewesen, wenn man selbständig speichern hätte können. So muss man immer einen Checkpoint abwarten. Falls man jedoch stirbt, wird man an Ort und Stelle wiederbelebt. Was mir auch sehr gut gefällt, ist das Prinzip der Voxophone. Man muss nicht selber stehen bleiben und sich einen Zettel durchlesen, sondern kann dieses Audio-Tagebuch einfach abspielen während man sich bewegt. \n","timestamp_created":1521029248,"timestamp_updated":1521029248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40806772","author":{"steamid":"76561198283615535","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":47,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47,"last_played":1520954969},"language":"schinese","review":"开头部分第一人称视角对于晕FPS的人来说太难受了","timestamp_created":1521027331,"timestamp_updated":1521027331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40806760","author":{"steamid":"76561198077517779","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1031,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1024,"last_played":1521019986},"language":"schinese","review":"神作不解释","timestamp_created":1521027293,"timestamp_updated":1521027293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40806310","author":{"steamid":"76561198096885708","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":346,"last_played":1643263499},"language":"schinese","review":"大家都喜欢会撒娇，爱吐槽，打起架来还给你扔血瓶的女主角\n可是为啥瑟拉那就只会在背后拿寒冰箭戳我呢！","timestamp_created":1521025359,"timestamp_updated":1521025359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40806043","author":{"steamid":"76561197991294640","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":646,"last_played":1638954285},"language":"tchinese","review":"優秀的一輪片. \n\n獨特的天空之城, 值得玩味的劇情.","timestamp_created":1521024250,"timestamp_updated":1521024250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40805434","author":{"steamid":"76561198293686190","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1298,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1298,"last_played":1521020701},"language":"schinese","review":"本体+海葬dlc，评价三个字：艺术品。有的差评说win10 64位闪退卡顿的，本人没有遇到过。","timestamp_created":1521021322,"timestamp_updated":1521021322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40805185","author":{"steamid":"76561198132176504","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1037,"last_played":1613544613},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic game, has lots of great game mechanics and by far has one of the best/most interesting stories that I have ever played through. 10/10 easy I put literally everything down to play this.

This is a FPS with a mind-bending story and a fantastic gameplay. You may not be able to get 1000 hours of gameplay out of it, but goddamn this is an amazing story. If you're at all into cerebral type movies and first person shooters you NEED TO PLAY THIS GAME + THE DLC. It's fucking amazing. \n\nAll I can say is I can't wait now to go back and play Bioshock 1 and 2 because I want to learn more about the history of rapture and Booker Dewitt and Elizabeth. This is a masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1521001275,"timestamp_updated":1521001275,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40800942","author":{"steamid":"76561198433318015","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":1876,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":634,"last_played":1632585284},"language":"english","review":"Holy crap 2hii2 game ii2 2o cool iiv just started playing it and iit2 great god iit remiinds me of playiing the old biioshock back iin 2the day thii2 game wa2 recmended by my cousiin and let me just say iit2 great god iits hard to believe thii2 game came out 5 year2 ago that2 iinsain!","timestamp_created":1520997187,"timestamp_updated":1520997187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40799049","author":{"steamid":"76561197996944806","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":407,"last_played":1520988756},"language":"english","review":"combats pretty mediocre but story is amazing worth buying if on sale","timestamp_created":1520987707,"timestamp_updated":1520987707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40798641","author":{"steamid":"76561198242023972","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1101,"last_played":1521053810},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I've ever played.","timestamp_created":1520985454,"timestamp_updated":1520985454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40795609","author":{"steamid":"76561197980949132","num_games_owned":391,"num_reviews":189,"playtime_forever":2949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2949,"last_played":1520990986},"language":"english","review":"I really enjoyed this BioShock; regardless of \"what it should have been\" according to the interwebs. For context, and I'll probably get a bunch of flack for this, I've tried playing the first BioShock (even the remastered version) a few times and got bored an hour in. Infinite I've now played through completely, twice. The combat is fun and the story is pretty good as well. I did pretty much only use 2 vigors until the end but there is a possibility to play different ways throughout the campaign. \n\nThe \"Burial at Sea\" DLCs are also a nice addition to the story and made me want to try and give the original BioShock another fair try. I'll probably end up streaming it as well.\n\nYou can watch my livestream gameplay of the game on my [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZSgc0qO4Tc&list=PL0q93Rkkmx_sJy0fgrujwB_3cipyvekFX]YouTube Channel[/url] if you so desire.
