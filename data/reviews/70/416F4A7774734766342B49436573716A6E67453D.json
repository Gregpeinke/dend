But the project somehow broke, and open a gate, to aliens, some of them are the head crabs, and it’s up to you, to survive.\nWithout any spoilers, the story of this game is great, the weapons feels very fun to use, and the bosses are strong, but once you learn how to kill them, you wouldn’t see them again for a long time.\nThe game is very fun, and know where it’s the time to let the player some quite, where to surprise you, and when you think it’s over, it’s not. The game, even if it is FPS, still uses s lot of game puzzles, that let’s you use your brain, game puzzles that don’t effect the gameplay or making the game less boring, and can make it more of an action game, like you need to solve the puzzle, while fighting against enemies.\nWhile the game Is very fun by the term of single player, unlike the other games you used to in this years, the multiplayer felt for me less fun, and the game lacks for today standards in term of graphics.\nFirst, the multiplayer of the game, feels less balanced with strange but strong weapons, like a mosquitoes weapon that locked on the enemy, a lot of RPGs (because of quick) and many more.\nThe graphics of this game aren’t what you want to play at 2018, because the game made in 1998, and the graphics then aren’t a masterpiece.\nBut over-all, if you still didn’t play this game, I think you should play if you like FPS games, because you will see you wouldn’t disappointed.\nGame’s pros and cons:\nPros:\n-\tFun gameplay\n-\tFully game story \n-\tGreat story\n-\tFun puzzles\n-\tKnows how to surprise the player when he don’t expect it.\n-\tRemembered main character.\nCons:\n-\tBad graphics (at least for 2018).\n-\tBad multiplayer. \n-\tNothing else more then the multiplayer and singleplayer.\n\nGame settings:\n-\tFPS.\n-\tPuzzle game.\n-\tRequire potato to bad computer conditions to run.\n-\tParts single player (auto save sometime).\n-\tRequire some skills to play.\n-\tViolent game.\n-\tScience fiction game.\n\nI give this game 9/10\n","timestamp_created":1524918034,"timestamp_updated":1524918034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550172984600067139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41733443","author":{"steamid":"76561198401140163","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1788,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":116,"last_played":1653842749},"language":"english","review":"ilui,l,jj","timestamp_created":1524913827,"timestamp_updated":1610690021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41729010","author":{"steamid":"76561198076405899","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":3696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2749,"last_played":1526071971},"language":"spanish","review":"Está

suck at FPS and I just got this because it was less than 100 yen (around 1USD/1EUR) and I never got to play it when it was released, and I felt that I should play it at least once in my life just for the sake of history. \nFor that price, I think everyone should play it. Even if you suck at FPS, it's still a milestone in this genre and you should at least know what it looks like. I don't plan to ever finish it but I still enjoyed playing it for a few hours (I probably died 50 times but okay). \nAs someone else mentioned, I liked how the story was explained through dialogue and not logs or narration - you're as clueless as the main character, and that makes the story more immersive. The story is also quite interesting and the way you proceed feels quite natural and matches the story. \nCannot say much about gameplay because as mentioned, I suck at it and FPS in general. It' s very old game but maybe it's because I'm old and the \"newest\" machine I could ever afford was a PS2, I didn't feel it was very dated, it still looked decent enough to me. \n\nNot sure if it's worth the full price given its age, but it's worth for everyone on sale!","timestamp_created":1524483875,"timestamp_updated":1524483875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41636909","author":{"steamid":"76561198290746934","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":3928,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1962,"last_played":1658895076},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un buen juego, su modo campaña te envuelve y quizas no encuentres servidores pero puedes añadir la ip de una pagina y te conecta, no pide muchos requisitos te recomiendo que lo compres en oferta creo que vale un dolar o menos.\n","timestamp_created":1524455147,"timestamp_updated":1524455147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41635724","author":{"steamid":"76561198428091755","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":56,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56,"last_played":1520688125},"language":"schinese","review":"G胖快出3啊","timestamp_created":1524447623,"timestamp_updated":1524447623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41631562","author":{"steamid":"76561198343525736","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":971,"last_played":1529630952},"language":"english","review":"For a game released in 1998, it holds up pretty well.\nIt’s aged a bit, but I’d still highly recommend it.\nIt was a bit buggy at times, though.
