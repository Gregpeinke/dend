It isn't the best in my library in my opinion but it was good.\n\nHalf-Life is about a physician who has to take on both the forces of the US Military and the an alien race. This physicain isn't any ordinary physician, this physicain is Gordon Freeman. This is the beginning of a saga that is still remembered to this day as one of the best first person shooters ever made, but does it live up to that title? Let's take a look.\n\nUnlike most first person shooters that give you the ability to look in all directions Half-Life takes the Doom movement route. Meaning that Gordon Freeman is constantly sprinting every where even when it would be safer to walk or go at a leisurely jogging pace. This both makes and breaks the game. The game is full of platfoming sections where the default super speed will constantly throw you off. The last eighth of the game would be much easier and it would make me grind my teeth a whole lot less during these portions. Where it makes this game is when you have to be constantly running from one side of the level to another, there are a couple of levels like this and they do get annoying, but if you're used to back tracking in games (like myself) you won't have too much trouble dealing with this.\n\nNow let's talk about the enemies in this game, well they aren't bad. The game is very dark and gritty and the enemies are pretty much the same. They don't have too much color to them but which makes them feel like they belong in this world. So here's a noob tip, the first time I saw a Vortigaunt, you know those guys that will charge your armor in Half-Life 2 and are generally friendly towards you, I walked up to it and pressed e, don't do that. If you do that it'll get two or three cheap shots in on you and leave you nearly dead on the easy setting (which is what I played on). Other than that the other enemies are well designed and suited for their purposes, some of which make up entire levels on their own. I especially found it interesting how you had to fight a giant ball sack called Gonarch though three different boss level stages. I don't understand why Gonarch hasn't become a meme yet, I mean it's two of the things that people on the internet obsess about, balls and Half-Life. Why was Gonarch not brought back as a synthasized being in Half-Life 2? And we have the final boss, whom I can't remember the name of but he was well designed and looked like some sort of Alien Overlord. The head crab zombies in this game also look a whole lot more threatening than in Half-Life 2. Having those mouths in their stomachs was a good idea.\n\nNext on the menu to talk about is the music, which is decent at best. It's kind of like Doom as it just kind of suits the mood of what's happening at any moment. Though the songs don't loop, so if you're stuck at a part of the game then you're stuck with just the sounds of the enemies.\n\nThe story wasn't bad, but it wasn't really anything compared to Half-Life 2's story. I guess it's a good story for a first try and the usage of portals as a plot point was a pretty good idea.\n\nAge Rating: M for Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Explicit Language, and Disturbing Content.\nOverall Rating: 8/10\n\nit plays well and it's fun. If it weren't for the non looping music and sometimes frustrating controls I would have given it 10.","timestamp_created":1441758434,"timestamp_updated":1441758434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17946078","author":{"steamid":"76561198026513486","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":43133,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26968,"last_played":1654197519},"language":"english","review":"There is no limit for skills in multiplayer...\n\n\n\n\nEdited As of august 30 2017 \n\nHalf life series has been officialy killed...
