However, if you, a self described gamer, one who uses this platform more frequently than one takes shits in one's life, haven't once entertained the possibility that this game just might live up to the ungodly hype that surrounds it, then you clearly haven't played it yet. \n\nSome curious part of your mind longs for a drag of this perfectly rolled cuban spliff, to see whether the design, the direction, the story, the characters, the palpable universe through which they trudge, is really everything they said it would be. To that part of your mind, I do declare! I would, without hesitation, present this beautiful amalgamation of code to the pope, as no wine can possibly ammount to the sweetness of a crowbar weilding theoretical physicist, shredding the minions of a dimension-traversing dystopic empire, surpassing the most insurmountable of odds, traversing the very edge of the reapers blade and rallying the hearts and minds of every man, woman and (not) child (there's plot related reasons for that, don't you worry), all whilst being mute, ginger and short sighted!

It packs good gameplay, great story, dynamic environments and interactivity all under the power of Valve's Source Engine. It's an unregreatable buy, but keep in mind its a 2004 PC game, don't expect high-end Nvidia graphics. \n\nQuick brief on HL2 (SPOILERS):\n\nRise and shine, Mr. Freeman... \n\nRiiiiiiiight back to Earth just as our favorite alien slashing crowbar wielding physicist, Gordon Freeman, arrives in a mysterious train bound for city 17 (somewhere in Eastern Europe), our dude springs into the action as he doesnt realize its been a decade since he fell victim to a portal rapturing the space time continuum as we know it in Black Mesa. The world was taken over by a cross-dimensional alien force known as the Combine, who grotesquely surpass humanity both physically and technologically, after the so called 7 hour war, where Dr Breen (former head of Black Mesa) had negotiated Earth's surrender and vitality at the cost of enslavement, genocide and a general dystopia (Little did many know, Dr Breen he was promised power by the Combine). Along his quest to bring down the Combine, Freeman meets up with various resistance characters, who mostly date back from his days at the Black Mesa facility, and fights hes way through City 17 and other regional sectors pushing off Combine and other unearthly forces to reach Dr Breen's citadel and disrupt the Combine's centralized power. As you progress your way into the citadel, you notice how Earth is being exploited of its natural resources and things progressively turn even more grim..... \n\n\nNo more spoilers.","timestamp_created":1454677889,"timestamp_updated":1456844264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20968760","author":{"steamid":"76561198065186307","num_games_owned":412,"num_reviews":247,"playtime_forever":1076,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1076,"last_played":1454501357},"language":"japanese","review":"点数：10/10\n日本語完備。\n\n日本ではあまりピンと来ないが、とてつもなく凄い実績があるらしい伝説的なFPS。\n\n物理演算が特徴的なゲームで、随所に物理演算を使ったパズルや、\n物体を掴んだり投げ飛ばせる重力銃による戦闘ができる。\n当時としては斬新だったであろう物理演算を余すところなくゲームに活用している。\n\nしかし何より凄いのはゲームとしての魅せ方。\nゾンビだらけの街から脱出し、ドライブしながら長距離移動し、虫の大群を率いて敵基地を陥落させ、市街地で敵部隊と銃撃戦を繰り広げる……\n遊びの舞台と内容が進行と共にガラリと変わり、プレイヤーを全く飽きさせない。\n\nそれなりの頻度でローディングが挟まれたり、武器切り替えがやりにくい、進む方向がたまに分かりにくいといった問題点はある。\nしかしそんな事よりも10年以上前のゲームであるという事実が凄すぎる。\n今遊んでも文句無しに面白く、最近のゲームよりもむしろ新しいと感じる部分が多かった。\nさすが名作とされるだけあるなあと思ったのでした。","timestamp_created":1454677542,"timestamp_updated":1455016522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474785417318344116","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20967770","author":{"steamid":"76561198208332977","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":70,"last_played":1455023604},"language":"russian","review":"В принципе игра хороша, очень хороша. ну конечно нельзя при целиваться, но это в стиле Valve","timestamp_created":1454674050,"timestamp_updated":1454674050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20961649","author":{"steamid":"76561198122130329","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":342,"last_played":1498969897},"language":"spanish","review":"Game of the year...

Unlike the first Half-Life, you have no idea what you're doing or why.  You get off a train, some sort of resistance is so plesaed you're there, and then you participate in the underground railroad, followed by a rescue the parent mission.   There's no introduction.  No reason why you're with these people, or even who they are, really.   At least in the first Half-Life there's a situational set up: you go to work, there's an accident, now there are aliens and you need to help/escape.   That's missing from Half-Life 2 in a big way.  It was disappointing and I was confused the entire time I played.  I like /some/ plot with my linear FPS, like in F.E.A.R.   Still, I can't say it wasn't a decent run-and-gun from that aspect of it, and so again I'd recommend it for people who like those types of games.  \n\nPS I think the USA television show Colony is based off this game.

В ней несомненно вы найдете атмосферу, угловатый юмор, затягивающий геймплей, достаточно неплохой, но все же предсказуемый сюжет, ПРАВИЛЬНУЮ физику, и много того, что навсегда отложится в вашей памяти. В серию можно играть бесконечно, но вернутся хочется только в самую первую игру. Без модов  и сурсовского движка.
