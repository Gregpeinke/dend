Rise and... shine.\"\n- G-Man\n\nHalf-Life 2 is by many claimed to be one of, if not the best, game ever made. When I started playing Half-Life 2 I was a bit sceptical for if the game could live up to it, but I can now happily say Half-Life 2 didn't disappoint me.\n\nLike the original Half-Life, Half-Life 2 is a well made game, with a lot of attention to detail and gameplay, I'm still amazed by the fact that the magnifying glass in Dr. Kleiner's lab actually works.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is more story driven than to originally Half-Life, the story is great but unfortunately you may have to have played the originally Half-Life to fully understand the story.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and enjoyable, each chapter of Half-Life 2 attempts to try something new gameplay wise so it doesn't get too repetitive. The gunfights are fun, and the Gravity-Gun and the ability to throw big heavy objects at enemies is a nice fun addition, that makes Half-Life 2 stand out from other FPS games.\n\nOverall Half-Life 2 is great experience, and definitely lives up to the claims to be one of the best games ever made, and is worth its price tag.","timestamp_created":1522485030,"timestamp_updated":1532340934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41172202","author":{"steamid":"76561198103473713","num_games_owned":373,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":2535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1955,"last_played":1658122304},"language":"english","review":"Need I say anything?!\nLook at the hours I played it...

Мне только купили компьютер. О существовании интернета я даже и не подозревал. О новых играх узнавал или в магазинах или компьютерных клубах, ну или же немногочисленных друзей, у кого тоже было это чудо техники - компьютер. И вот все друзья говорили, и ходили рубиться в какую то странную игру Counter-Strike. Ну я и попросил ее у друга, верней играл еще до этого, но тогда в клубе попалась забогованная версия, да и вообще не про контру разговор. Так вот, попросил у друга, ну чтоб распробовать наверняка, а он мне дал не привычную всем 1.6 версию, а некую \"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero\". Ну побегал, пострелял, прошел - фигня, ничего хорошего. Отдал другу, а шла она только с диском, и получается все, игра не нужна, а удалять толком не умели еще. Зашли в папку с игрой, и в множественном числе потому, что с братом, и давай тыкать на все подряд, и хоп, что-то запустилось. Half-Life. Что это такое, вообще без понятия, и что это есть на диске нигде даже не было написано. И вот с тех пор Халва по моему мнению лучшая серия игр. Потом был 2004 год, когда я из Игромании узнал, что появилась Half-Life 2, и побежал за ней в магазин, но была только лицензия, которой требовалась страшная штука Steam, причем продавалась она сразу с карточкой на 1 час времени, вроде как, интернета. Но с ним, интернетом, были проблемы, поэтому предпочел подождать, и дождался пиратки. Так же вышло и с первым Эпизодом и лишь на втором Эпизоде я купил полноценную лицензию. И вот 2007 год, все серии Халвы пройдены, некоторые и не по разу, в сумме наверное все игры серии прошел раз 30 наверное, а то и больше, и стал я ждать 3-й эпизод, ну или же полноценную 3-ю часть. Прошло 8 лет, а я все жду. Жду каждую конференцию видео игр, что может Валв анонсирует там новый эпизод, жду появление пасхалок в их играх, с новыми обновлениями, ведь это излюбленный способ анонсов он Вентельных ребят. Просто жду. Хатико стаил.

I tried everything, and nothing (see update). I even tried enhancement codes (a.k.a \" cheats\"), in order to boost the character´s suit, so that he could perform a simple jump.\nNo deal, and worse, after I used the cheats, the character wouldn´t move.\nI spent one hour and a half of my life trying to get rid of that situation. I might resort to a video walkthrough, but I don´t know about that; I barely started the effing game, it was all going so well, it wasn´t supposed to get so hard so early.\n\nUPDATE: I just watched a walkthrough and will continue playing. But be careful, it´s deceiving. I´m never gonna have my one and a half hour back\n\nUPDATE 2: far too many puzzles than I´d like. It goes like this: walk through filthy tunnel=>solve an irritating puzzle=>shoot opressing soldiers=>shoot opressing drones=>walk through another filthy tunnel, this time with underwater sections and ladders=>solve an irritating puzzle=>repeat\n\nUPDATE 3: now I´m starting to get the hang of it. I´m starting to figure out more quickly what must be done in each puzzle (yes, they´re still there). And some sections of the game are (well, at least one) quite thrilling, I have to admit. And considering the gameplay is fluid, the shotting mechanism is good, and the game never crashes, I´m starting to understand why this game receives so much love.\n\nUPDATE 4: level design, although inventive, lacks what I call dramatic progression. You are always alternating epic, dramatic shooting and underground, puzzle grinding.\nit goes like this:\nMe: Wow, that´s pretty epic. Maybe this is the final level.\nGame: Nah, you´re wrong. Here, have some more unimportant puzzles in a depressive tunnel maze.\n\nCONCLUSION: i recommend it, because it´s obvious it´s a good game in all aspects. But I myself don´t intend to play it again - heck, not even finish it.\n\nP.S.: I finished the game. The last level game me some thrilling feeling. That´s more than I can say for most games. Although the very ending is rather disappointing and not movie-like at all, I still recommend this game.
