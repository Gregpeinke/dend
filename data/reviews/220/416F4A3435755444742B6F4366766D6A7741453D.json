There's one of each common type of weapon, all of them equally viable, so you won't have to use the \"strongest weapon\" only, meaning the gameplay won't stagnate. Each chapter also adds something unique to the gameplay, so you won't get all comfortable neither will you know exactly what to expect;\n-This game was released on 2004 and until today it still has one of the best physics mechanics and graphics to date. Of course there are better graphics today with new technology and stuff, but if someone told me this game was 15+ years old, I wouldn't believe it, myself.\n-The characters are unique and very memorable; the story is rich. The antagonist is not your common chaotic evil villain, he comes up with speeches and thoughts are so great that you forget he's actually full of lies and the world is in a complete state of alien authoritarism, brutality, misery and decay. \n\nPlay this game twice or more and you're bound to wake up thinking about this game, be it about the gameplay mechanics, the physics and the sceneries, or to paint your own view of the story.

Играть бывает порой сложно, но зато всегда интересно. Стрельба  реалистичная и приятная.\n\n+ Сюжет.\nПроработанные интересные персонажи, отличная основная сюжетная линия, диалоги (правда без участия главного героя). Понравилась загадочная концовка игры. Эпизоды же продолжают сюжет и делают его ещё интереснее и лучше.\n\n+ Графика.\nДля своего времени выглядит просто великолепно. Движок игры сделал своё дело, поэтому игра выглядит стильно даже в современное время. Физика отличная.\n\n+ Атмосфера.\nПроработанный, интересный и оригинальный пост-апокалипсис, приправленный фантастикой и даже мистикой. Всё гармонично и продуманно остаётся в эпизодах. Образцовая и легендарная атмосфера.\n\n+ Оптимизация.\nВо время прохождения игры не встретились проблемы в виде лагов, багов, фризов и прочего. Вылетов не было. Всё шло стабильно, что несомненно радует.\n\n+ Звук.\nПонравилась отличная музыка в игре, качественные звуки и озвучка.\n\nЛегендарная классика своего жанра. Однозначно рекомендую.\n\nГеймплей: 10/10\nСюжет: 10/10\nГрафика: 10/10\nАтмосфера: 10/10\nОптимизация: 10/10\nЗвук: 10/10\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1556649376,"timestamp_updated":1563271308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543269217014312744","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50406291","author":{"steamid":"76561198059037729","num_games_owned":703,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":840,"last_played":1556647046},"language":"turkish","review":"3.sünün asla çıkmayacağı bir oyun","timestamp_created":1556645238,"timestamp_updated":1556645238,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":31,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.718499064445495605","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50405278","author":{"steamid":"76561198308151146","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":811,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":811,"last_played":1556641385},"language":"spanish","review":"GOOD","timestamp_created":1556641425,"timestamp_updated":1556641425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513513505458831787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45uTDt+oCfvmjwAE="}
