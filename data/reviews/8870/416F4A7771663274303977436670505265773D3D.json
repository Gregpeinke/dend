The world is stunningly beautiful, and the story is incredibly fresh and fascinating. I have a deep love for all the characters, and after playing the game the first time and seeing the ending, upon replaying I felt quite a strong emotional bond with Elizabeth especially. I also loved how the game didn't hold a players hand to guide them to the end, and rather relied on attention to detail and the Voxophones for a player to piece together a full understanding of the story. I also thoroughly enjoyed the combat, though it was not really a challenge til the final battle. Finding new vigors was thouroughly thrilling, and gear made fighting all the better. (Favorite gears being 'Burning Halo,' 'Fit as a Fiddle' and 'Storm'. ) I also fell completely in LOVE with the setting. The steampunk-esque style of everything was so lovely, and I enjoyed reading all the posters and seeing how everything was made. \n\nOne thing I was a bit sad about was how the Vox Populi ended up being an outright enemy. I was hoping to be more part of their movement, but seeing the bloodlust and savagery they gained was quite a statement ...\n\nI think that the people who dislike this game hate it simply because it isn't the first, and maybe were a little attatched to Rapture. Other 'haters' were probably the types of gamers who are more into the weapons and combat side of games, rather than story and setting. (I myself care most about an enthralling story and interesting setting, and I get easily bored with too many guns lmao) \n\n\nAnyway, I say this game is absolutely worth buying!

Es mi favorito de la saga Bioshock\n\nJugabilidad: 10/10 , Shooter frenetico, muchos poderes (llamados vigores) y muchas armas cada una con su variantes y mejoras para usar. Nada se compara con la adrenalina de correr con poca salud y tirarle electricidad, cuervos y escopetaso a la cara de un enemigo en una fraccion de segundo mientras piensas como lidearas con el tipo que te tira fuego :O y un monton de enemigos mas. Si tambien compras el DLC. \"enfrentamiento en las nubes\", es un modo arcade que resulta ser un VICIO, adictivo y frenetico\n\nHistoria: 9/10. Como dice el nombre de uno de sus logros, es una \"desgarradora historia\", nada de spoilers, solo dire que bioshock infinite ofrece una gran experiencia de FPS con una historia atrapante que hasta pega un poco en los feels TT_TT\n\nArte: 10/10. Magnifico el paisaje de Columbia es caramelo para los ojos, todo colorido, ese estilo retro y la ciudad flotante es muy lindo todo, esas pausas al frenetismo y locura de los combates si que valen la pena para apreciar esos bellos paisajes y los detalles de la ciudad que tienen una ambientacion surrealista y rara comparado con lo mainstream de los FPS\n\nMusica y Sonido: 10/10. Con una lista de canciones originales, mas reversionados de canciones populares el soundtrack de este juego puede ser bastante emotivo y acompaña a la narracion de la historia y los momentos de combate de una manera muy armonica.\n\nGraficos: 7/10.  En este apartado, hay que decir que el juego de hace 4 años (es 2017 al momento de escribir esto) no explota al maximo a mi GTX1060 :), y no tiene nada que hacer en comparacion a grandes titulos recientes como por ejemplo DooM 2016. Sin embargo sus efectos de postprocesado, luces, sombras, detalles del entorno y los personajes orientados a crear una atmosfera genial logran potenciar enormemente la parte artistica del juego.\n\nY aqui el unico punto en contra que le encontre:\nMultijugador: 0/10. No tiene, es una lastima ya que un multijugador explotando estas mecanicas hubiera sido fantastico\n\nPuntaje final: 8/10. Es un juego con una gran campaña, que aunque le hubiera venido muy bien un modo multiplayer (como el bioshock 1), no lo necesita (como el bioshock 1) y si te gusta su estilo de combate frenetico y sus variaciones (lo ya mencionado: armas y vigores) lo jugaras una y otra vez, e incluso su historia vuelve a tener sentido si la repites, porque como dice si titulo, es \"infinito\" xD\n","timestamp_created":1497926103,"timestamp_updated":1497926103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32580308","author":{"steamid":"76561197988740407","num_games_owned":2537,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":1832,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1415,"last_played":1499215389},"language":"english","review":"Bonded with elizabeth, cried when the adventure ended.

Compared to the other bioshock, the story is far superior, but the combat is a little loose and it's not as confined, dark and frightning as the first two games. The first bioshock was awsome, and perfectly balanced. The dark and shady corners of rapture, the completely crazed splicers and the claustrophobic feeling you had in rapture is not present in the open bright daylight world of columbia. The vilains are also not the same and the game is more \"kill bad guys, move to the next cover, kill bad guys, repeat\" where as in rapture, you had no cover and had to kill your way through the mindless vilains of the underwater city. That being said, the game is awsome and balanced, the scenery is breathtaking and the story is second to none. The combat, although not as good as I felt it was in bioshock 1 and 2, is still great and the skylines make the combat 3 dimensional which gives a whole new perspective to combat.

They explain everything from start till end and are worth it.\n\nOther things I can say about the game is that it looks nice, it plays well and is pretty challenging while being very fun.

Ending，而是那个成人世界里的自己。但你能说，这不是童话吗？\n\n[h1][b]>> 画面 8 <<[/b][/h1]\n\n本作以蒸汽朋克风格为大背景，又十分浓艳。游戏前期，和平的空中城市景象极具童话性质，这个乌托邦充斥着温暖的亮黄色，幻境一般浓稠的光更是本作最为独特之处。随着剧情的发展，环境基调明显变暗，而少有的明亮在淋漓鲜血面前更是讽刺。色彩的要素在整个游戏中得到了很好的发挥，建模和远景方面也没有明显的瑕疵，在童话背景的题材下，可以说十分出彩了，可以给到9分。\n\n[strike]那么为什么要扣1分。因为优化确实，怪怪的。[/strike]\n\n对了，换个人话的说法：颜色很艳，糊糊的。\n\n[h1][b]>> 音效 6 <<[/b][/h1]\n\n本作音乐同样是浓重的蒸汽朋克风，复古钢琴和小提琴是音乐的主要成分，十分入耳。但实际游玩过程中，bgm本身的存在感并不很高，主要还是以提示是否脱离战斗为第一功能，渲染气氛方面稍有不足。此外人物的脚步声和移动不完全合拍，有时候会误判有敌人，算是一个小问题。\n\n[h1][b]>> 操作 8 <<[/b][/h1]\n\n本作默认操作是左键射击，中键（或Z）开镜，右键技能，键位适应度上没有明显问题。滑索和空中扑杀的设定很过瘾，强化了动作要素，增加了游戏爽度。整体而言是fps元素和动作元素并存的正经rpg游戏之手感。\n\n[b]而且给了官方任务路线提示按钮可以按着玩。[/b]\n\n[h1][b]>> 游戏性 9 <<[/b][/h1]\n\n游戏的配制分为三个方面，枪械，技能，和套装，下分开讨论。\n\n游戏中枪支有十余种（我忘了x），每一种有4个不同的升级，其中几种步枪的手感差距和伤害面板差距并不大，游戏流程中步枪基本随缘升级，捡到啥用啥。困难难度下，狙击枪是最优先升级的武器，因为没有弹道，且非精英基本可以爆头一枪一个，有效避免正面火力冲撞，有利于续得更久（不）。\n\n技能需要消耗法力值，不同技能消耗不同，法力和生命一样只能通过拾取来回复。按获得顺序排序分别是【魅惑】【火雷】【乌鸦】【电击】【奔马】【飓风】【触手（x）】和【护盾】8种，每种技能的用途差别明显，而都有直接使用和形成陷阱两种使用方式，游戏性中规中矩。高难度下由于敌人伤害很高，更需要合理规划资源，限制了一些技能的使用（读作不能作死），常用的主要有魅惑（对精英和炮台）、乌鸦（对精英）、奔马（对add）和护盾（别傻了前期根本没有这种好东西）四种。\n\n再说套装，游戏中击败巨人boss或者在部分3锁开锁房间会有套装掉落，共有4个部位且套装效果重复度较低，可玩性不错，不过高难度下还是老老实实用保命+控制好了2333.嗯爆击+50%伤害一定要穿，强，无敌。\n\n游戏中另一个要素是上述所说的升级要素，每种枪械有4种升级，技能有2种，都需要游戏内金币购买，游戏内金币获取十分十分的有限，死亡也会扣除部分金币。就个人体验而言，一直到通关，我只升级了共15次枪支和6次技能（大概），所以金币规划也是一个重要环节。此外人物有血量护盾蓝量三种升级，也是套装类似的稀有拾取，高难度下不先升盾怕是连门都不敢出哦。对了，我真的是三光，信我。\n\nBTW最后一战，真的难打，过关的时候狙击枪还剩1颗子弹，rpg早就轰完了，很刺激。\n\n[h1][b]>> 剧情和女主 10 <<[/b][/h1]\n\n本作剧情呈线性，但主旨方面直到最后一战，都并不明晰，揭秘剧情过后，期间的线索才逐渐串起来。但考虑到游戏10+h的流程，部分段落稍显拖沓。剧情本身当然，拒绝剧透啦。\n\n说本作女主Elizabeth是[b]全宇宙最良心女主[/b]都不为过。女主手无寸铁，战斗中却完全不需要男主保护，到处找子弹找血包找蓝药扔给男主，时不时还会给点零花钱，这种感动已经无法用言语形容了，这就是天使吧。\n\n[h1][b]>> 重复可玩性 8 <<[/b][/h1]\n\n成就部分，尽管主线+DLC全通只完成了51%的成就，但其他成就无非是收集成就，枪械击杀成就，技能击杀成就，整体完成难度不算高，但我会不会去刷就是另外一回事了。\n\n[h1][b]>> DLC 8 <<[/b][/h1]\n\n本作的全部内容性dlc有三个，DLC1包含了4组竞技场，玩家可以使用不同的方式对固定的敌人进行击杀，完成挑战，与好友进行排名等，大体上是中规中矩的竞技场DLC，探索不同的游戏方式（使用狙击枪爆头以外的方式杀人x）确实也增加了游戏的乐趣。\n\n唯一的缺点是不能即时存档，所有波次全部打完才有存档。别问我怎么知道的。微笑就好了。\n\nDLC2与3是扩充章节《海葬》，共两个大篇章。讲述了女主寻找最后一个世界线上男主的故事，将主线进行了一定上的解释和延伸，没有主线的世界观基本理解不来剧情。海葬篇增加了一个更高的【1999】难度，而篇章本身的难度较游戏本体也高出很多。整个游戏过程中补给十分微量，钱基本攒不起来，而且在地图各个房间中往返会导致刷新大量的巡逻怪，进一步消耗玩家资源。\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1089161261\n\n海葬篇第一章依然是男主视角，整体流程在1-2小时。引入了一些新的枪、套装，和一个新的冰冻异能，但由于资源本身匮乏，游戏性并没有呈现提升趋势。同时第一章优化较本体稍差，且进部分房间会有较长时间的读图（10秒左右），有些影响体验。高难度下，由于上述所说的资源问题，游戏时间会更长一些。\n\n第二章是女主视角，完全变成潜行游戏，取消了护盾，包可以带5个在身上手动吃，新增了偷窥狂异能（单击鹰眼，按住隐身）和鲨鱼盾异能（类似主线吸收盾，吸子弹，回血），加入了弩武器，有睡眠针、警报针和催眠瓦斯针三种弹药，全部为潜行设计。整个流程在2-3小时，剧情信息量十分大，十分刺激，[strike]差一点就全收集了好气啊[/strike]。\n\n第二章整体而言十分有趣，因为引入了新的潜行玩法，由于睡眠针一定概率可以回收使用，卡门引一大堆敌人进来然后piupiupiu全部放倒可以说是非常有趣了（笑得像个从没玩过潜行游戏的孩子.jpg）。此外前期的有一个【取消鹰眼消耗】的隐藏模组请一定要找到，游戏爽度的主要来源。\n\n但是我还是要给差评。[spoiler]因为主线男主死了，dlc女主死了。官方我们好好谈谈剧本。[/spoiler]\n\n想了一下没有具体去写剧情讲了啥，自行感受吧。\n\n[h1][b]<<

Stay far, FAR away.\n\nIf you in any way enjoy using mods, enjoy watching modded content, view lets plays with modded content, or prefer single player to multiplayer, do not buy this game.\n\nBioshock Infinite is an excellent game that is very well built, created by innovative, brilliant developers who geniunely love what they do. You can see it in their work. However last week, the publisher of the Bioshock Series, Take Two Interactive, sent a cease and desist order to the developer of the most commonly used mods in another game they developed, GTA V. A mod which thousands of other mods and hundreds of thosands of work hours depend upon. A mod which has existed for ten years, and has only now become the focus of legal action due to Take Two's efforts to increase monetization. This move came on the 5th of June, in what appears to be an attempt to hide this action from public attention as the gaming community is occupied with the E3 conference. \n\nThis game has recieved a continued level of attention and constant exposure to new audiences through the way in which modders have continued to create new and interesting content that is related to this game. Despite this being of net benefit to their sales, Take Two is now betting that they will be able to make more money by cracking down on mod development in order to further monetize the existing player base. In short, they are actively destroying collaborative works and content they have previously allowed, making the singleplayer experience of their game LESS enjoyable, in an effort to wring more money out of players. Considering that a significant percentage of their sales from the PC release of this game (i.e., this version) has come due to interest in using and developing mods, this move is unconscionable. \n\nTake Two's recent actions represent the very definition of corporate hackery. They are choosing profits over people. There are plenty of other game developers and publishers that do not do this. Go spend your money on their games instead. This decision has utterly ruined the game in my view.","timestamp_created":1497546421,"timestamp_updated":1497546421,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479382485151290894","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32442519","author":{"steamid":"76561198066510614","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":988,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":988,"last_played":1474651596},"language":"english","review":"Take 2 interactive is anti-consumer.
