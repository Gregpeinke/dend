Местный искусственный интеллект ломается в процессе зачитывания своего искусственного приветствия. Пройдя нехитрый тест, вы заходите в обитый войлоком лифт и отправляетесь проходить следующий нехитрый тест. Что не так с комментирующей ваши действия компьютерной женщиной? Зачем в лифте мягкие стены? Почему за окнами нет людей? Кто написал «help» на стене тестовой камеры 16? Эта игра определённо заслуживает того, чтобы разобрать её по составным частям.\n\nPortal - линейная игра небольшого размера. Четырёх часов хватит, чтобы изучить Экспериментальный центр вдоль и поперёк. А если кампании вам мало - попробуйте преодолеть особые испытания и усложнённые камеры. Хорошим поводом перепройти игру являются комментарии разработчиков: из них вы узнаете много нового о создании проекта.\nБольшую часть игры вы будете пребывать в неведении касательно окружающего мира и своего места в нём, но прямо перед концовкой сценарий выкидывает жирный твист. ГЛаДОС - практически единственный персонаж в игре, и сыграна она бесподобно - от её реплик хочется то угарать, то убегать в панике.\nВ оригинальности игры нет никаких сомнений: она проявляется во всём, а в первую очередь в механике порталов. В своё время подобное чудо техники встречалось только в Prey и в Narbacular Drop - прототипе Portal, разработанном студентами Технологического института DigiPen, которых Valve взяла под своё крыло.\nЕсли умеете «думать с порталами», пробежать через все испытания не составит вам трудности. Но для новичка некоторые моменты могут оказаться чересчур мудрёными: в любом случае, стоит вам только отвлечься и пойти подышать, импульс к верному решению сам поступит к вам в голову.\n\nКак становится понятно из названия, в Portal вам придётся открывать порталы - отверстия в пространстве, которые помогут игроку преодолеть путь из точки А в какую-нибудь другую точку. У порталов есть и свои особенности: как известно, что быстро влетает, то быстро и вылетает. При помощи этих самых порталов игрок должен решать головоломки, осложняющиеся наличием кубов, кнопок, смертоносных боевых андроидов и поехавшей суперкомпьютерки.\nВ игре приятная графика и стильный визуал. Минимализм и пустота используются здесь как намеренный художественный приём. Серые тестовые камеры сменяются заброшенными ржавыми коридорами Экспериментального центра, а красное свечение за панелями навевает ассоциации с пеклом. Энвайронментал сторителлинг - это отдельный разговор: каждое новое посещение убежища Рэтмена вызывает у игрока всё больше и больше вопросов.\nЗвук и музыка в Portal - на уровне. Композиторы постарались на славу: чего только стоит «Still Alive». А эмбиент создаёт впечатление гигантского комплекса, в котором ты полностью одинок. Главное - не пугаться внезапных звуков Рейвенхольма.\nМестный интерфейс минималистичен и совершенно не мешает играть. Управление максимально оптимизировано для взаимодействия с порталами.\n\nВывод [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/31943256] читайте на VALVe MEMES!
