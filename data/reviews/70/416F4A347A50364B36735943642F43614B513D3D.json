Maybe it was good for the time... but now wrong-way-achieved difficulty makes the game suck ass. Enemies take too much shots and soldier's aim is far too perfect. Good games usually offer you two kind of tactics (sometimes both): use stealth to avoid the deadly, istant bullets of your opponents or to go Rambo and dodge whatever they throw at you. Usually not bullets because they are istant and cant be dodged (serious sam). In half-life the corridor map (wich doesn't HAVE to be bad) doesn't let you use stealth and the bullets can't be dodged. The result is that in good games, the more you're good the less damage you take. Damn, in SS if you are VERY good you can even set the maximum difficulty and don't lose even 1 HP. In half life, it doesn't matter how good you are, you are going to take those shots. That's why i love games like serious sam where you can dodge everything.

I only played it recently so I am not recommending it based on nostalgia, I am recommending it because it was the most fun I had in an FPS in a while.\n\nStory:\n\nThis game is not about the story. There are no cut scenes and barely any dialogue. Most of the story is in the background and doing some research and some exploring can reveal quite an interesting world. However you will most likely never notice all these details on your first play through. This game is about the gameplay, not the story.\n\nGameplay:\n\nLike I said, this is one of the most fun FPS games I have played. There is pretty good enemy variety and a nice reange of weapons to choose from. The pacing is very fast in the combat sections, the fun part is to keep moving and kill enemies as fast as possible before they drain your health. When you blast through an area, barely giving the enemies enough time to think before you blow them up with these satisfying-to-use weapons, it feels great. \nThere are also a few physics puzzles but they are very basic.\n\nGraphics:\n\nObviously the game is very old but it still looks great. The basic graphical style gives the game a nice nostalgic feel for the way games used to look with their simple textures and effects. I also enjoy the graphics of old FPS because the levels are not cluttered and full of usless objects like todays FPS games. Without the ability to create giant set pieces and battles on an epic scale, the developers of this game were forced to focus on level design which this game is very good at.\n\nOverall: \n\nA must play for fans of FPS games! I enjoyed this game more than Half Life 2 because of it's old school charm and fun run and gun gameplay in a memorable environment. I can see why this game was so popular back when it came out, it's still a great game even today.","timestamp_created":1403908068,"timestamp_updated":1403908068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10879439","author":{"steamid":"76561198130514798","num_games_owned":1263,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":727,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":413,"last_played":1534601522},"language":"english","review":"Classic.

Half Life is a great FPS game that involves puzzle solving and some backtracking at times.\n\nGameplay:\nPretty diverse gamepaly, including shooting aliens, alien zombies and opposing human soldiers, solving evoirmental puzzles and observing your surroundings to maneuver the areas. Sometimes you are required to backtrack a little bit after completing certain tasks while visiting a lot of different kind of areas which also include some secret areas.\nThe  controls are all fine and feel responsive, and most of the guns are pretty darn solid and give a good enough feel.\n\nGraphics:\nFor a game from 1998, you gotta admit the graphics are pretty solid, considering this came out only 6 years after Doom.\n\nMusic:\nThe music in this game includes mostly of ambience sound music, that only play at certain spots in the game to add extra atmosphere, which it does very good.\n\nStory:\nHalf Life has a decent story, but doesn't really go in depth. Most of the story consists of the  areas you visit yourself, without much dialogue. The main character you play as doesn't talk at all, but is definately not a negative point.\n\nReplayability:\nYou might wanna try playing it a second time if you really badly want to look around for some extra secret areas and stuff, but other than that, there's not much to it to re-live this game unless you want to feed your nostalgic hunger.\n\nOver all:\nA solid classic FPS game that in my opinion defines the better half of the FPS genre that does not play like a game on rails to go from point A to B.","timestamp_created":1403831717,"timestamp_updated":1403831859,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10854208","author":{"steamid":"76561198063389770","num_games_owned":405,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":790,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":790,"last_played":1373758465},"language":"english","review":"It's the original Half-Life.
