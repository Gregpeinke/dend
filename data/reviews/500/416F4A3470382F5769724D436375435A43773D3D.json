I am a lover of all things Valve, and a sucker for games that make you feel epic in every aspect possible, and this game delievered exactly these things.

I got both, and gotta say I love L4D over twice as much. I've never really played a multiplayer co-op before but this just took me by the balls and made them produce a cournucopia of jizz due to the amazing factor. It brings together players easily and in very cool ways. CONSIDERING L4D2 OVER THIS?? Grab this one. The characters are so much more fun imo, and I think the hype of new weapons is unnecessary, as I have never felt a shortage or care of weapon diversity. And melee weapons are cool but more of an extra, and will kill you if you buy a game for that!

Nothing I can say will do it justice - but I'll try.\n\nThe original.  The masterpiece.  Left 4 Dead 2 is a great improvement on many aspects, to be sure, but you just can't beat the old days... when all we had was an M-16 and a Jesus-room to ward off the literal hordes of undead.  Now that L4D2 is out and all of the L4D1 maps are available in it - as well as game modes that remove all of L4D2's new items and infected - there really isn't a reason to pick up the first... but it will always have a place in my heart.","timestamp_created":1319182128,"timestamp_updated":1399275044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2936322","author":{"steamid":"76561198014820081","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":2997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2997,"last_played":1320739200},"language":"english","review":"The base concept of moving from area to area killing hordes of zombies is nothing new. How they go about making it is remarkable, however. The game forces teamwork and with the help of the ai director you can play this game over and over and over and almost never have two similar situations and the VS is pertty cool to up to 8 players 1 team as the zombies 1 team as the survivors but this game isnt that fun playing solo or with someone you dont know so get this if you have some friends to kill zombies with ya ^^\n","timestamp_created":1318913211,"timestamp_updated":1318913211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p8/WirMCcuCZCw=="}
