And now with DK2 support...this is too much, I can't handle the awesomeness :) After playing it more than 15 times since 2004 including episodes, it feels like I'm experiencing this for the first time, only this time it's real, all around you... I LOVE IT !\n\nJust imagine driving the hovercraft in Water Hazard and aiming at gunships by looking at them or being jumped by those fast f@ckers in Ravenholm with headcrabs on their heads, blowing them away in mid air with father Grigori's shotgun while they jump off buildings with the intention of r@ping your face :)\n\nFor real now, if you are a HL2 fan or not, this is something that every DK2 owner should try. This is the Holy Grail of gaming, for me at least. The only minor drawbacks are:\n1. A longer adjusting period to overcome the motion sickness because it implies moving with your body in first person, but once you achieve that, it is a guaranteed mind-blowing experience.\n​2. Zoomed view in the buggy/car on Highway 17 which is a bit annoying at first.\n​3. Aiming can be frustating for some, but there are multiple modes that can be tried and you can easily adjust to the default scheme.\n\nBut I guess these issues are going to be solved in time. HL2 is definitely the benchmark for future VR games.","timestamp_created":1417212978,"timestamp_updated":1417213091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13129937","author":{"steamid":"76561198085596899","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":457,"last_played":1556560738},"language":"english","review":"10/10 would rate 20/10 if there was hl3 confirmed by valve but this is.

This has to be one of the greatest games of 2004 and maybe even one of the best of the decade and that's why I would give this a 10/10.

The characters and the voice acting can't seem to make me yawn or flinch a bit and I can't seem to stop playing every little second of the way. The only issue I have with this game are the friendly AI helpers. They just seem to get in the way and it might get you killed and it will bother anyone. Another extremely minor issue that won't bother anyone is that I think that Canals carrys on for too damn long. Still a great game and I always tell dog when whenever to wake up \"Rise and Shine, mister Freeman!\".
