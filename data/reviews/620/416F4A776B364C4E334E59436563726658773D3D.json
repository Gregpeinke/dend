It's just not as fun as the first Portal. The middle of the game has too many vast levels where the goal becomes spot the spot as apposed to solve the puzzle. There's some great moments in that section, but nothing as fulfilling as the puzzle rooms the game excels at.

this game is extremely fun with a much longer storyline than the last one, it took me 1.15 hours to complete portal 1 but 4.5 hours to complete portal two  and i haven't completed the co-op yet but i'm told that it's much longer than the single player.\n\nso if you're just staring out the price tag wondering if you should buy it or not i say..........(drum roll please)...yes you should, this game is amazing and the storyline is superb, puzzles, boss fights (two) and much,much,much,much, what was i saying, oh right yes, if you're still unsure let me reasure you.\nif you like story-driven games then this is definetly for you and if you're still unsure, hover over the buy button, look away, and click.\n\n\nDo i need portal 1 to run this game\nwell you don't NEED it to run but it'll help you understand the storyline better, alternatively you could watch a youtuber play portal one then you can buy portal 2 for your self and understand it.\n\nwhat about level-building\nyes they have level building but it's very simple, if you want more complex options you need to download portal two authoring tools also known as hammer (which is free)\n\nand the only down side i can think of is that the maps AREN'T compatible with G-mod which is a shame, plus another downside is that when i write this review it asks me if i recommend this game and there isn't an option for \"YES I LOVE IT
