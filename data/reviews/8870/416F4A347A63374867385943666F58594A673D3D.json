Les FPS sont les jeux que j'apprécie le moins habituellement mais ce jeu-là fait définitivement parti des plus marquants et des meilleurs auxquels j'ai joué. Tout d'abord pour les graphismes : Techniquement, c'est bien sans être exceptionnel (quelques textures sont bien laides) mais artistiquement, ça dépasse plus ou moins tout ce que j'ai pu voir jusqu'à maintenant, Columbia est tout simplement magnifique et très vivante, les couleurs flattent votre rétine. Le gameplay est très dynamique, les combats sont parfois épiques et on y prend beaucoup de plaisir. Enfin la durée de vie est bonne pour un FPS, avec une difficulté très bien dosée, qui vous donnera parfois du fil à retordre (je pense notamment à l'ultime mission qui met la barre très haut). Enfin quand vous aurez fini le jeu, un mode de difficulté bien au-dessus des autres se débloquera. Mais je ne peux pas terminer cet avis sans parler du scénario d'une qualité que je n'avais tout bonnement encore jamais vu dans un jeu vidéo, avec un final époustouflant. Je ne peux que vous conseiller ce jeu, que vous aimiez les FPS ou non.","timestamp_created":1400602821,"timestamp_updated":1400602821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522265851497650146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10179155","author":{"steamid":"76561198004014060","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":3699,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1197,"last_played":1521875833},"language":"english","review":"After the original Bioshock, I didn't think they would find a way to make a sequel with an equally original concept than an underwater world stuck in the nineteen fifties, but somehow they managed it! With such an original and surprisingly brilliant story in the first game, I was shocked to find that the story in this game is also brilliant - not only is it engaging but they threw in a surprise ending, just like they did in the first one. The fighting is as exciting as the fighting in the first one was, with the game mechanics being quite similar - the ammo is scarce at times but you always seem to manage to find a way out of a tight situation. If I had one tiny criticism it would be that at times I felt myself wishing that this game was an open world game; I guess it's just because I wanted more areas to explore, more side stories to uncover.

But, if Bioshock was good, Infinite was art. And if Infinite alone was art, the Burial at Sea DLCs (you have to play them all the way through, with Bioshock as well) made the enter Bioshock sequence a masterpiece plain and simple.\n\nThe mechanics of the game were nothing revoluntary or particularly special in my opinion. I prefered the healing system of Bioshock to that of Infinite (In Infinite, you do not store the health packs for later use like you do in Bioshock), though I did like their addition of simultaneous Vigour (plasmid) and weapon use and the sky hooks were a joy. The final episode of Burial at Sea represents, I think, a beautiful and near perfect balance of the two systems, though the nature of Burial at Sea prohibits me from being able to say precisely how it would work in intense combat. I predict it would work great.\n\nWhatever the mechanics may themselves lack in average-ness, however, Infinite makes up for in beautiful graphics and a stunning storyline which rivals that of many of our modern-day novels. The pure depth and beauty of this game is what elevates it so and what ultimately makes it what it is: one of the best, if not the best, games of the decade.\n\nThis is the first video game I have truly lost myself in.  I felt for the characters, fought hard for victory, and every death (both of myself and of NPCs close to the PC) hurt. This game made me laugh, cry, and hope. I recommend it on its own, and even more strongly recommend that it be played with Bioshock 1 and the Burial at Sea DLC (I cannot speak for how much further Clash in the Clouds and Bioshock 2 might contribute since I have not played them).","timestamp_created":1400544496,"timestamp_updated":1400544496,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10174351","author":{"steamid":"76561197988494760","num_games_owned":423,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":919,"last_played":1400541114},"language":"hungarian","review":"Jó játék, nekem a vége nagyon tetszett, mert egyedi :)","timestamp_created":1400542888,"timestamp_updated":1400542888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10173546","author":{"steamid":"76561198030859157","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1895,"last_played":1410482040},"language":"spanish","review":"Hacía mucho mucho tiempo no jugaba un juego tan bueno!

Even if the setting changed dramaticly it has still the old feeling while figjting and shooting through the lovely designed levels. However, the levels are kind of \"very well structured\" and don't leave that much space for walking off the beaten path. But BioShock isn't an open world game and keeping that in mind all of the levels in Biochock Infinite leave space for searching all the buildings and corners for getting loot or voxophones.\nThe most important (and interesting) point of the hole game is the plot. Typical for Bioshock are plots you have to think over... a dozen days. And so does BioShock Infinite! Beside the two perfect characters Booker DeWitt and Elizabeth the overall-plot waits with several twists and surpises.\nI think it's one of the best games that year not wanting to put it into a genre,because it's not just a shooter or a rpg but much more on a psychological way.

Если вдуматься и следить внимательно за сюжетом, то обязательно порадует своей оригинальностью и подкинет не мало вопросов в конце игры. Геймплей остался таким же, как и в предыдущих частях: в одной руке — плазмид, в другой — оружие, которое можно носить только двух видов. Разнообразие противников, по сравнению с \"BioShock\", мало, ибо кроме механизированных гигантов, загадочных людей в черных плащах, сирен (которых и так редко видно) и людей разной степени защиты не встретишь. Несомненно, по ходу игры можно осуждать мотивы Комстока, сравнивая их мировоззрением Эндрю Райана. В плане шутера, игра не преподносит ничего нового, лишь доработанный старый движок. Визуальная составляющая необычная, но для любителей придется по душе.\nНо помимо основного сюжета игроку предлагается три дополнения, два из которых являются сюжетными, а третье  (\"Clash in the Cloud\") не несет в себе никакой смысловой нагрузки, предназначенное на преодоление волн, забитыми всевозможными врагами Колумбии на четырех закрытых аренах. \"Burial at Sea - Episode One\" больше подкинет вопросов в общий котел. нежели даст какие-нибудь ответы, а вот цель \"Burial at Sea - Episode Two\" - расставить все точки на i и полностью закрутить в неразрушимую спираль событий \"BioShock Infinite\" и \"BioShock\". Кстати, если по какой-либо причины Вам неизвестны события \"BioShock\", то настоятельно следует ознакомиться для полного представления всей картины, ибо в дальнейшем могут возникнуть вопросы и недопонимания!\n\"BioShock Infinite\", как и ее предшественница, игра редкая, каких выходит раз в несколько лет, о которой можно говорить долго и с удовольствием. Не стоит упускать этот момент. \"BioShock Infinite\" – это все тот же \"BioShock\". Просто он другой...  BioShock завершает основную повесть (ибо есть еще \"BioShock 2\" и неизвестно, будут ли еще игры по этой вселенной), оставляя напоследок один из самых интригующих вопросов, на который нет ответа — продумал ли изначально всю историю Кен Левин со своей командой или же финал дописывался походу пьесы?\n\nВсегда есть маяк.

К главным плюсам можно отнести: \n  1)отличнейшую графику. \n  2)очень много красивых мест, в которых вам дадут возможность побывать.\n  3)эффектные перестрелки с комбинирование кучи энергетиков и прыжков по аэротрассам, которые дают еще больше динамичности. \n  4) интересный, затягивающий сюжет (который я не до конца понял, а после прохождения Season Pass'a да и вообще в тупике оказался. Только прочитав про концовку в инете, я понял, что все-таки смысл есть и что он немного философский :). \n  5)Ах да, огромный плюс за Season Pass! Во многих играх ДЛС создают, дабы собрать еще больше денег с геймеров, а взамен дать 1-2 часа геймплея. Но только не в этом случае! Season Pass шикарен. На полное его прохождение у меня ушло не менее 8 часов. Во втором эпизоде ДЛС вы сможете поиграть за Элизабет, который рассчитан на стелс-прохождение.\nПерестрелки большого успеха не принесут, т.к урон от пуль очень велик и нужно действовать аккуратно.\n\nМинусов не обнаружил, игра выполнена великолепно!

Returning to the game eight years later was an interesting journey. The first time I played it, I had never played Bioshock 1 or 2 so none of the references or any of the final scenes meant anything to me. Now, after having recently played 1, 2, and Minerva’s Den, I have a much greater foundation of the series and can completely understand some of the negativity about Bioshock Infinite upon its release. Bioshock 1 & 2 are dark, cramped, claustrophobic, and earie. Bioshock Infinite is bright, spacious, and airy. It is the absolute opposite of Bioshock 1 & 2 in setting and tone. I understand people wanting Rapture, not Columbia. It’s like when people started playing RDR2; they wanted John, not Arthur. For me, I found returning to Columbia to be a wonderful change of pace even though I very much love the setting of Rapture.\n\nInfinite’s story is absolutely engrossing. The setting pulled me in once again and had me exploring every section of the city looking for money, lockpicks, gear, infusions, kinetoscopes, code books, keys, and voxophones. I wanted to know everything about Columbia, its founders, and its beliefs. Finding and listening to voxophones flesh out the city’s history and its main citizens as well as build a foundation as to what’s actually happening in game. The city is beautiful, and I could spend hours walking through it and taking it all in, that is, until you start reading the billboards and advertisements and start listening to the abhorrent chatter of the citizens. You quickly realize that Columbia is not the Eden it portrays, but a cesspool of racism and bigotry. Seeing and hearing all of this in a game is challenging even though they do pull back on some of the racism. No one gets lynched; no one drops the “N” word. Thankfully.\n\nMoving on, Elizabeth is by far my favorite character in the game and one of my favorite characters in gaming. She exudes innocence, naivety, curiosity, empathy, adventure, courageousness, bravery, and sadness. I’ve never played a game that caused me to feel such guilt and sadness towards a character. What really hit me on my fourth playthrough was an overwhelming need to save Elizabeth and this time around, I recognized the feeling. It was the same feeling I felt in Bioshock 1 & 2. I had to save the little sisters. In Infinite, I had to save her. The emotions and connection I felt during the game created this absolute need to protect her and save her and these feelings were far stronger now than they were when I first played in 2013. I attribute this to the fact that I lost my own daughter to a disease, and I am older, wiser, and grief-stricken.\n\nThe ending of the game still punches me in the heart. The slow piano piece playing over the final scene ending in just a single resonant key being struck before fading to black just hits you. Like all the Bioshock games before it, I just sat in my chair, stared at my monitor, and watched the credits roll by. The emotional tug of the game had left me immobile and speechless once again. I wanted more time with these characters. I didn't want the game to end. I wanted to know more about the city, about Comstock, about Booker, about Songbird, and about Elizabeth. I didn't want this to be the end.\n\nAside from Red Dead Redemption 2, no game I have ever played has caused in me such an emotional reaction. No game has made me want to save a character more and no game series has made me sit and contemplate the game’s story when it ended. The story has ended… and I'm sad that it has.","timestamp_created":1400516701,"timestamp_updated":1641748043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598540186882019043","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10170549","author":{"steamid":"76561198085423710","num_games_owned":227,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":468,"last_played":1651332743},"language":"polish","review":"Tak bardzo mindfuck na koniec.\nPolecam!","timestamp_created":1400514259,"timestamp_updated":1400514259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10169497","author":{"steamid":"76561198047647751","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":495,"last_played":1400506233},"language":"russian","review":"Best game ever!

This game is a wonderful addition to a great series. Another wonderfully story driven FPS with more engaging characters then the previous in the series (not that this is a hard thing). Comstock is a much more engaging villan then Ryan was, and Booker is better then the blank slate of Jack. The supporting cast is good enough as props, some of them you may get attached too, but it is unlikely as the story doesn't lend itself to such things. Elizabeth is not what was promissed, but vainly tries to be useful, asside from summoning semi-useful things and digging up random things she is just another prop. There is one point, about midgame where she shines as a character, but after that it's back to more of the same. \n\nThe combat is very good, with lots of options how to kill all who stand before you. A down side is the removal of the semi-stealth style of play with such things as cloaking and wrench lurker missing in favor of the more traditonal \"run-n-gun\", or \"trap laying hunter\". Plenty of weapons, with a slight variation in the Shotgun/ Rifle/ Carbine/ Launcher weapon slots will keep you busy. The crappy two weapon limit is as stated, crappy, but that's more a statement on modern gaming on the whole. \n\nThe story... well... just try not to hurt yourself thinking about things too hard.\n\nIn short: Great game that everyone should play. Just marginally less then the first game, greatly better then the second, a good swan song for a good production company.","timestamp_created":1400385911,"timestamp_updated":1400385911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10155051","author":{"steamid":"76561198063860607","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":4219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":413,"playtime_at_review":2518,"last_played":1660606882},"language":"english","review":"Possibly the best game I've ever played.","timestamp_created":1400383650,"timestamp_updated":1400383650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10154981","author":{"steamid":"76561198006222582","num_games_owned":1162,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":665,"last_played":1400236126},"language":"english","review":"This game does not have multiple endings, but the ending is still the same kind of mind-f**k that you got at the end of the Original Bioshock.

Its story, setting, art design (you bet!) left me absolutely marvelled. I mean, in what other game could you find quantum mechanics as the basis for the whole plot? This game made me seriously interested in this science and I actually went a bit crazy already dwelling on what we really are, how we are and \"why do you ask \"what\", when the delicious question is \"when\"? The characters are also brilliant (Fink, Luteces, Slate) and I am certainly not the only one who fell in love with Elizabeth.\nBut when it comes to gameplay, this game has some issues. For instance, the system of Vigors in my opinion is far from perfect. Having completed the game on PS3, I found with regret that some vigors I simply didn't need (that despite I was playing with gamepad without aim assist, so I was forced to use Vigors creatively). It is even worse with weapons, as many of them are virtually useless and would rather get you yourself killed than your enemies, and even upgrades are a slack argument for carrying them, especially as you can carry two pieces only, which I think is rather good and challenging. Besides, the whole gameplay could be less linear and repetitious. They could put those mechanical horses to use somehow, or add telekinesis, like in the first game. But no. Enjoy the great story between call-of-duty style shoot-outs with electromagnetic field in place of regenerating health. \nBut as I have already stated, the story is so absolutely fantastic and overwhelming that I, for one, intend to play it over and over again countless number of times, discovering new details and building new theories about what actually is behind all of these ideas.\nThank you, Ken levine. A must-have masterpiece, still there is nothing perfect.","timestamp_created":1400351681,"timestamp_updated":1400351681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10150609","author":{"steamid":"76561198079752966","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":948,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":459,"last_played":1456508988},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is the best singleplayer game i have ever played!!\nIn my opinion the best game of 2013. 10 out of 10.","timestamp_created":1400350375,"timestamp_updated":1422733153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575471699237823486","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10149990","author":{"steamid":"76561198082307412","num_games_owned":470,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":3450,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1974,"last_played":1498753609},"language":"english","review":"Since I started gaming year 1999 this game is easily one of my top 5 best games i've ever played. The interactions between the two characters, the story, and the combat makes this a very appealing game. The last 15 minutes of the game will be a total mindfuck and you'll probably gonna have to visit Youtube for clarification and it will also leave you depressed and wondering how they can make dlc after it so play the dlc to find out how. Be aware that it's singleplayer only so if you're looking fo multiplayer then you're out of luck. A MUST own for everyone with amazing graphics that can be pulled off with a rather old PC. 9/10, it would be a 10/10 if not for the ending although the fact that this game has affected me so much after spending 14 hours to finish the story it has to get a high grade.
