묻히거나 조화를 이루지 못하는 것인데, 이 게임에선 주인공 일행을 이끄는 주 서사와 그들을 둘러싼 세계의 갈등이 어느 하나 튀어나오는 것 없이 서로 긴밀히 관계를 이루며 조화를 형성했기 때문에 그 깊이를 확실하게 느낄 수 있었다.\n그리고 그 모든 이야기를 일방적인 컷씬, 텍스트의 나열 등으로 평면적으로 나열하는 것이 아니라, 복소폰, NPC들의 대화 등, 게임의 시스템을 통해서 유저가 알 수 있도록, 그야말로 게임에 맞는 스토리텔링으로 훌륭하게 풀어냈다.\n덕분에 바이오쇼크 인피니트의 세계를 구석구석 탐험하면서 사건의 전말을 추리해가며 게임에 깊게 몰입할 수 있었다.\n그렇게 차근차근 빌드를 쌓아올리다가 터지는 엔딩에서의 충격과 쾌감은 여태 플레이했던 보다 크고 깊은 떨림과 여운을 남겼다.\n이쯤 되면 이 작품은 그냥 비디오 게임이 아니라 예술의 경지에 오른게 아닌가 싶다.\n\n다만, 전투시스템은 많이 아쉬웠다.\n무기간의 밸런스가 맞지 않아서 성능이 좋은 무기만 계속 쓰이는데, 부족한 재화와 업그레이드 시스템 때문에 쓰이는 무기만 계속 쓰이고 결국 전투가 전반적으로 단조로워졌다. 게다가 전작과 달리 무기를 두 개밖에 휴대하지 못하는 점이 이런 문제를 더 악화시켰다. 그래도 스카이라인 시스템만큼은 정말 호쾌했다. 하지만 스카이라인 활용이 전투의 메인이 되기에는 너무 볼륨이 적었다.","timestamp_created":1580135749,"timestamp_updated":1580135749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62514905","author":{"steamid":"76561198368350034","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1585444447},"language":"brazilian","review":"Simplesmente

Pay attention to understand the overall story or just watch any youtube video explaining the same. \nAI are pretty decent & not dumb. It took me about 18 hours to finish the main story line.

Not showing racism would have been wrong.\nLet's just hope that they will consider making a 4th Bioshock game.\nIts a must buy & best when bought at a discount. Be loyal to your wallet and not the publisher.\n\n[b] Suggestions [/b]:\n1. Play this game at it's hardest difficulty as it is not very tough.\n2. Don't just shoot and play. Use the vigors to your advantage. Mix and match in different combination to see the AI die horribly in different ways.\n\n[b]Pro[/b]:\n1. Player character is not dumb. He has voiced dialogue.  \n2. Very well written story.\n3. Elizabeth/[spoiler]Anna Dewitt (AD at the back of your right hand) [/spoiler] is not a dumb companion. You don't need to take care of her. She finds useful items like health, ammo, coins during the game and in combat.

There is no annoying pointer on the screen showing you where you have to go next, you have to press 'n' and it will show you the way.\n5. Traversal by skyline and shooting from it is new and welcome addition.\n6. There is a wide variety of weapons & power at your disposal to fight with a wide variety of AI. \n7. The background music and song are really good.\n8. Art style looks very beautiful and fits perfectly for the time period..\n9.

You can carry only 2 guns at a time.\n3.[spoiler] At times, the game will make you think that this game has multiple ending based on you decision but there is only one ending which is a bummer.[/spoiler]\n4. You are Pewdiepie (you don't have legs)\n5. In the world 'Gears' can be found. These are skill boosters (melee, defense, etc). There is no active screen here you can see all the gears you have and equip it to your current situation. You can just compare it whenever you find a new gear.\n6. There is no puzzle in the game.

MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD\nBioshock Infinite is a game that seems to have so much, but almost everything that it has, has been managed so poorly, it would have been better off if half the content was just removed.\n\nThe story is... alright I guess? To be honest, and this is largely subjective, I found it incredibly boring. I suppose things start off alright with a bit of a twist as to the nature of the floating city, that being that the town is extremely racist, and that black people are treated awfully, and like slaves, but then the story goes into a heavy time-travel focused direction which gets convoluted, and it seems to jump so fast from point to point that it just gets overwhelming. The whole \"racism\" aspect of the story is presented in a really primitive kind of way, where it's a simple case of \"hey look, we have cages with blackface pictures on them, how shocking!\" and the game seems to really want to shove this into your face, but it just becomes obnoxious with how much there is and how it really feels like surface level stuff that doesn't need any deeper thought. My point is, it's not really engaging, at least not to me. You get to make some choices in the game, but they don't change anything. Still, covering a topic like racism and showing off the suffering of its victims isn't the worst thing to do, but I felt it was generally presented in too simple a way and was boring because of it. It felt like it was trying to show something that would shock 12 year olds, without actually asking them to think about it any deeper than beyond \"this is bad\".\n\nThis wouldn't have been that big of a deal if you could have skipped this, but you are CONSTANTLY being interrupted during gameplay to either listen to, or watch, or take part in another story section. Maybe I'm just an old retro asshole, but holy shit, this game does not just let you fucking play. It's constantly making you stop, and do something that could have easily been accomplished without taking control away from the player. Half-Life figured this out decades before this game came out. But you know, I'm actually not extremely angry about this. Usually, this pisses me off to no end in games, but not as much here...\n\n...mainly because the actual gameplay isn't fun either.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a game where it feels like the developers had a million different ideas, and then shoved them all into a game without actually giving any of them any real depth, or considering how they interact with the other ideas around them. There are many examples of this, but I'll just list a few (8000 character limit).\n\n-You get 8 vigors (same thing as plasmids, literally identical in function, many of them being copies of the ones in the first Bioshock), but they almost all behave in the same fucking way. Bucking Bronco, Murder of Crows, Shock Jockey, and Undertow are all focused more on stunning enemies, and whether it's by a flock of birds or by a bolt of electricity, the end result is the same with little changing other than the visual effect. Charge, Devil's kiss, and return to sender are all used for direct damage (and RTS for slight defence), and it honestly doesn't really matter which one you use in MOST situations. Possession makes an enemy target friendly for a few moments, though on the biggest targets that you WANT to possess the most, it lasts all of 5 seconds before running out, making it more of a chore to even bother using on them. Each of these vigors has 2 different upgrades you can get for them, but these upgrades are EXTREMELY PRICEY. You will not be able to afford more than a few for the majority of your play time. I did not feel a need to even bother with most of the vigors, since shooting enemies with a gun gave me the same effect, but more reliably and faster.\n\n-You get a somewhat varied selection of weapons, but half of them are just copies of previous versions with somewhat different effects. Would you like a machinegun, or a red machine gun that shoots slower but does more damage per bullet? A shotgun, or a shotgun that has less shots but does more damage per bullet? Oh, and each weapon also has like, 4 different upgrades you can get for it, all being purely statistical upgrades (faster reload, more damage, ect) and they are PRICEY! In addition, weapons don't actually carry around much ammunition at all, so if you want to stick to a certain few weapons that you like, you're going to have to buy ammo constantly (there's an extreme shortage), and even still, you may run out in the middle of fights at times unless you're carrying a generic machinegun with a high clip size.\n\n-The game world is absolutely LITTERED with shit to look through and scavenge. There are boxes and trash cans and bodies EVERYWHERE, and they all contain shit that the game expects you to pick up, like money and bullets and healing items and stuff, but they contain it in such small amounts, that if you actually want to amass a decent amount of money for upgrades and such, you need to go through EVERYTHING you can find, which means that a large chunk of the game is just looking at piles of shit and pressing \"e\" as fast as you can. Was there a fucking reason that the devs had to place 8 coins in the same spot, but have them all be separate individual items that I have to individually press \"e\" on every single time? Am I having fun going around to every single goddamn shelf in a room and pressing \"e\" on it? No, no I am not, but the game DOES expect you to do this to actually have enough supplies to buy upgrades, because they are expensive as fuck. I was doing everything I could to get the most money, and by the near-END of the game, I only just barely got like 3 of my Vigors maxed out, and 4 weapons fully upgraded.\n\n-Speaking of Gear, gear is basically perks you can pick up and equip on yourself, maxing out at 4 pieces. You pick it up fairly often, like, every 20 minutes or so. About 95% of it is COMPLETELY USELESS. Tell me, what's better? A perk that gives you a 75% higher clip size for all weapons, which is useful for... the entire time you're playing the game, or one of these 4 other pieces of gear that give you effects like moving faster for 5 seconds after jumping off a sky-line, something which, by the end of the game, will literally only have an effect for about 2 minutes of game-time in total? Yeah.\n\nMaybe this could have all been forgiven if the actual base gameplay was fun, but it's not. Enemies hardly react to attacks, and when they do, it's not satisfying. You blow up an enemy with a rocket launcher, their intact bodies flings away comically without any real weight. Guns all sound weak. Killing is not fun. Oh, and you can only carry 2 FUCKING GUNS AT A TIME! For fuck's sake. The game gives you so many options, but none of them are enjoyable to use, and at worst, it's overwhelming. Except it's not, because the game is piss easy. Seriously, if you are at all decent at FPS, max out the difficulty. It's unbelievable how easy this game is.\n\nThat's not to mention shit like backtracking for secrets, boring lockpick rewards, shield regen waiting garbage, boring damage sponge enemies, crap navigation support, constant control-stealing button prompts, annoying weapon placements, audio logs being placed in areas where you are about to encounter a story section (cutting off the audio for them), an unimportant melee system, fuckloads of scripted sequences, nonsensical ending, plot-holes, constant yelling and noise with minimal downtime, and other shit.\n\nI must say, I'm honestly blown away at by how so many people think this game is so great. It was an absolute slog for me to get through, and just made me wish I was playing DOOM or STALKER or something. If you liked this game, that I'm happy for you, genuinely, but for anyone who just wants a fun game to actually PLAY where combat is enjoyable, then stay away.\n\nWant to keep updated on games I recommend?
