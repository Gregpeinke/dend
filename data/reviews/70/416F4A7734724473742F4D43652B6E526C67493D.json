Before that the game was a fun, fast paced and atmospheric shooter with interesting level design and an engrossing story. The monster designs were unique and challenging to face. The shooting was visceral and fast; accompanied by a useful movement kit. The story was immersive and surprising; it caught me off guard several times. I heartily recommend the game until the POWER UP stage, and cannot comment past that.","timestamp_created":1595550607,"timestamp_updated":1595550607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73184927","author":{"steamid":"76561198397163028","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":520,"last_played":1657722057},"language":"english","review":"probably worth spending money on it if you're in for a nostalgia trip. if you think that's it, there's couple of fan-made mods around the internet that you can install btw.","timestamp_created":1595549963,"timestamp_updated":1641741582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73183483","author":{"steamid":"76561198298231809","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":122,"playtime_forever":79,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1598461375},"language":"spanish","review":"De las mejores sagas 10/10","timestamp_created":1595547214,"timestamp_updated":1595547214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488455295562744141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73181931","author":{"steamid":"76561198038473160","num_games_owned":285,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":927,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":927,"last_played":1595544157},"language":"english","review":"play it","timestamp_created":1595544169,"timestamp_updated":1595544169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":71,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.793076932430267334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73181606","author":{"steamid":"76561198397723483","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":846,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1620205331},"language":"czech","review":"Doporučuji všem co se považují za opravdové hráče.

Instead of having to sit through boring exposition and dialogue you have no interest in, Half-Life tells a story with its incredibly immersive world, a world that few other games can rival. The game is one, long journey - no filler, no wasted time, no annoying interruptions, and certainly no times where you are forced to deal with situations in specific ways, which brings me to my next point: freedom; Half-Life is an extremely linear game, which completely contrasts what I just stated about it being linear, but that is where you are wrong! - the linear environments and level designs allow for a well-tailored experience that was built in a fashion that every single weapon (even the weak pistol) is useful. The sheer amount of weapons and options combined with the freedom the player has in using them lends itself to pure freedom for the player in combat, thus giving it some of the greatest combat, if not THE greatest combat, in any FPS game ever made! The game is perfection and has aged like a fine wine in both the game-play and story department, with the tiny exception of ladders (which are clunky nightmares), so I absolutely insist on anybody reading this to buy this game if they are interested!","timestamp_created":1595476773,"timestamp_updated":1595476773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73143067","author":{"steamid":"76561199047809764","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1612986375},"language":"spanish","review":"simplemente epico","timestamp_created":1595475246,"timestamp_updated":1595475246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73142841","author":{"steamid":"76561198201334653","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3303,"last_played":1595558463},"language":"english","review":"this game is pretty cool but also annoying, its honestly impressive for the time but the collision/hit boxes are really bad sometimes.","timestamp_created":1595474785,"timestamp_updated":1595474785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73140392","author":{"steamid":"76561198317662346","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1675,"last_played":1606453163},"language":"english","review":"It's a classic.
