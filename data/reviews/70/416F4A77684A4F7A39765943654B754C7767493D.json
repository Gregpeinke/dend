He was my best friend during those times of desolate tragedy at black mesa. Frequent stops to  vending machines, discussion of whether or not I saw his last shot, asking to buy me a beer. Good times.\n             \nAfter rescuing a few straggling scientists in office complex, I turned around to find my best buddy... Slaughtered, on the tiled floor, by a lone head crab.\n                 \nIn an unstable and deteriorating mental state, I bombarded that bastard of a head crab with my shotgun, pistol and all of my grenades, until I was entirely out of fire power.\n                 \nAfter about a week, my nerves had been recovered to a point that I could continue and play the game again. As I reluctantly passed though chapter 6, I was being followed by a few scientists. I needed as much company as I could get to keep moving on. I'm not sure what I did, or what sort of fate this game had led me into, but I suddenly came to my senses, as all three of the scientists went off script and exclaimed \"STAHP\" in perfect unison, in the dead center of a hallway. That word was burning in my mind. I was having office complex flashbacks. These three were trying to tell me something. I immediately ran. Bolting so fast that the scientists eventually stopped following me, as I carelessly left them in the distance. Despite how many others where counting on my to get the the surface, I was heading back down. I just couldn't bare to continue.\n             \nOnce I got back down to the offices, I found all of the tables, crates, and movable items I could find, and I made the most beautiful grave you could imagine. It might have just looked like some oil drums, crates and a small box for a headstone, but I'm sure my long lost security guard would have had the utmost respect and appreciation for our existing friendship. \n            \nHe never bought me that beer he said he would, he gave me something so much more. An emotion and depth to a game that so many new modern gamers will never get to experience. A connection, and story with an NPC, as such I had, with my beloved security guard.\n\n*I cried*","timestamp_created":1610427999,"timestamp_updated":1610428108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514285683631896973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84532310","author":{"steamid":"76561198846193335","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1447,"last_played":1621480170},"language":"english","review":"game\n","timestamp_created":1610427603,"timestamp_updated":1610427603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84531003","author":{"steamid":"76561199067848800","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1609826780},"language":"koreana","review":"처음에 멀미나서 고통받았다","timestamp_created":1610425152,"timestamp_updated":1610425152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84530664","author":{"steamid":"76561198128983958","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1746,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1702,"last_played":1644852617},"language":"english","review":"This game is so much fun that I could play this all day until Half-Life 3 comes out!","timestamp_created":1610424620,"timestamp_updated":1610424620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84530421","author":{"steamid":"76561198368151577","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":915,"last_played":1614097128},"language":"english","review":"This game deserves all the praise and high status it deserves, it's amazing.

Half-Life is history, but even to this day the game holds its original charm. It can be as challenging as you want, with a huge and dedicated community of fans that makes it more of a phenomenon than a simple game.\n\nI’d say it’s the Number 1 title to teach those that never tried FPS before. It illustrates remarkably well how a carefully developed game rewards effort and persistence in overcoming increasingly difficult odds.\n\nDo not be afraid to try it out if you haven’t yet.

However, even now, more than 20 years post the release date, Half Life's gameplay is solid. it has elements that one can still find in recently released games, and it is nice to see that this game, together with other titans of its time, has such a profound influence on what we know and love to play today.\n\nIt is not without its flaws. Disregarding the rather lackluster options menu and the aged graphics, the game does a bad job of explaining things. Sure, there are people who give you general directions, but at several points in the game i found myself aimlessly wandering the map looking for the correct action to perform. Specifically, the gate at chapter 7 with the gargantua, and in the subsequent chapter when you're required to crouch jump for the first time are really poorly explained. Lastly, long jumping received no explanation either.\n\nDespite these flaws, Half Life is still a decent game. You can't go wrong with this, especially since it is OFTEN on sale for less than €2.","timestamp_created":1610382015,"timestamp_updated":1610382015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84499956","author":{"steamid":"76561198256921430","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1959,"last_played":1630262545},"language":"english","review":"The birth of the modern fps.

provato il gioco per 3 ore circa, perché non potevo non aver mai giocato ad “Half-Life”, ma sinceramente in queste 3 ore non sono proprio riuscito ad apprezzarlo, per varie motivazioni che trascendono la grafica che tutto sommato poco importante quando vi è un contorno che fa divertire e tenere incollato allo schermo. Ma qua purtroppo, saranno gli anni, sarà che siamo abituati ad altri tipo di game play, ma proprio non riesco ad appassionarmi avrò giocato non più di 20 minuti poi diventa noioso.\n\nA mio avviso sono due le pecche che lo rendono davvero frustrante.\n1) L’intero pavimento sembra che sia completamente oliato, voi non camminate scivolate, e questo fin quando resta fine a se stesso si può sorvolare essendo un gioco che va giocato per cultura videoludica, ma onestamente dover fare 20 volte sequenze di salti e morire solo perché il personaggio levita magneticamente sopra le superfici mi sembra un po’ eccessivo. \n2) Per tutte e 3 le ore che ho passato, non ho mai avuto la sensazione di sapere che cosa dovessi fare e perché. Andavo avanti seguendo i vari piani senza avere un minimo di storia o guida sul perché facessi quelle azioni, continuando a procedere quasi meccanicamente. Ed è una cosa che annoia abbastanza.\n\nPer il resto devo dire che non ho nulla da criticare, non avrebbe senso parlare di grafica, texture dei personaggi e quant’altro perché ovviamente è un gioco datato, ma soprattutto non sono il tipico giocatore che si preoccupa di questo ma più dell’esperienza, e di solito riesco a giocare davvero a qualsiasi gioco anche “brutto”, ma questo proprio non mi va giù, non sopporto l’idea dei controlli oleosi e di girovagare per le stanze senza sapere perché e come, mi sembra un FPS dove vai avanti e uccidi i nemici, con la difficoltà di scivolare costantemente. \n\nProverò sicuramente il due leggendo la trama del primo capitolo così da farmene un’idea ma sinceramente preferisco credere che sia stato un grande gioco ai suoi tempi punto.","timestamp_created":1610328104,"timestamp_updated":1610328104,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512820541858673096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84463232","author":{"steamid":"76561198957244858","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7345,"last_played":1638387609},"language":"russian","review":"Ну что говорить то легендарная игре же.\n","timestamp_created":1610325167,"timestamp_updated":1610325167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84461984","author":{"steamid":"76561198157798519","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":1361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1361,"last_played":1608532247},"language":"english","review":"best game ever","timestamp_created":1610323269,"timestamp_updated":1610323269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84461897","author":{"steamid":"76561198359227264","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":415,"last_played":1610140311},"language":"english","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1610323151,"timestamp_updated":1610323151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84461170","author":{"steamid":"76561198158854290","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":743,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":743,"last_played":1610321957},"language":"spanish","review":"legendario pero hoy en dia muy tosco, entiendo lo que lo hizo enorme sin embargo algunos bugs y la velocidad de movimiento se me hizo insoportable, a no ser que quieran jugarlo como reliquia historica recomendaria que jugasen el remake de black mesa, aun asi adoraria ver un remake hecho por el propio valve, una reliquia atemporal","timestamp_created":1610322033,"timestamp_updated":1610322033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84458445","author":{"steamid":"76561198167513939","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":460,"last_played":1610586385},"language":"latam","review":"Si, tenes que ser muy pelotudo para no tener este juego en steam.","timestamp_created":1610318126,"timestamp_updated":1610318126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84458154","author":{"steamid":"76561198010626522","num_games_owned":458,"num_reviews":164,"playtime_forever":754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1610487102},"language":"english","review":"Classic.

La historia es espectacular y que cualquier fan de la ciencia ficcion debería disfrutar . gameplay muy variado , si bien es un shooter el juego incorpora puzzles que no se sienten como un relleno. EL diseño de niveles es de lo mejor que he visto en un shooter , es variado y completamente compenetrado con la historia . El comportamiento de los personajes es muy avanzado para su epoca , pues interactuan con freeman se asustan, o sirven para contar la historia sin la necesidad de cinematicas. Si bien el juego es lineal permite distintas estrategias y caminos para resolver distintas situaciones , ademas de la infinidad de secretos que se pueden encontrar . Al principio la atmosfera es espectacular y tiene muchos momentos de genuino terror, luego el tono pasa por momentos a satira como cuando militares o cientificos mueren de formas ridiculas al enfretarse a una situacion que se les salió de control. Como si fuera una pelicula de Paul Verhoeven.  Como defecto le encontré que me quedé atascado muchas veces en ridiculeces como caerme de las escaleras y la dificultad de lograr algunos saltos pues esta mecanica la encontré muy complicada, otro problema mas grave es el sistema de guardado , tiene un sistema automatico que nunca se sabe si funciona . recomiendo guardar manual y no guardado rapido porque se sobreescribe.

To jedna z tych gier która pokazała że w FPSach można opowiedzieć poważną i ciekawą fabułe. Mieszanka klaustofobicznego klimatu, walki o przetrwanie oraz bardzo różnorodnych zdarzeń nie pozwalała sie nudzić. W swoich czasach tytuł ten był naprawde innowacyjny. Pomysłowe poziomy, niezły soundtrack, spore i przydatne uzbrojenie oraz bardzo dobry gameplay, chociaż mam wrażenie że headshoty nie zadają wiele obrażeń oraz że gra jest trudniejsza niż half life 2, ale to nie są jakieś znaczące wady. Opowieść trwa, w zależności od wybranego stopnia trudności od 7 do 12 godzin lub dłużej, o i można sie pobawić modami czego nie da sie w wersji Source. Dałbym tej grze 10/10 mimo iż nie jest graficzną czy technologiczną rewolucją.

Recomendo \"maratonar\" os games em 2020. Apresenta uma dificuldade acima da média, mas sem ser injusto, semelhante a de Resident Evil 7. Jogabilidade continua sendo ótima, é claro, existem limitações, como o personagem em alguns momentos parece estar deslisando e o momento de objetos ser bem esquisito. Em muitas vezes você vai se perguntar \"O que eu estou suposto a fazer com nessa bagaça?\" e sim, esse sentimento vai aparecer algumas vezes durante sua primeira gameplay, mas isso faz com que o jogo te desafie de formas diferentes do que só com tiro, socão e granada [spoiler] (Os militares desse game adoram jogar elas pra todo lado) [/spoiler]. Por final, a história dispensa comentários.\n\nRe-jogar esse game em 2020 foi uma ótima experiência e recomendo sem sombra de dúvida.\n\n[b] Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman.
