You play as Gordon Freeman, who awakes on a train right after G-Man stops talking to you. The game was basically made to admire the beautifulness of the Source engine, which can be seen on a City 17's square.\n\n[b]BASICS OF THE GAME[/b]\n\nIt's like every other FPS (moving with WASD, shooting with MOUSE1, recharging with R) but you now can do more things with the HEV suit, like running (hold down the SHIFT key), swimming and the lantern. The lantern has been improved since Half-Life. All of those three features consume [b]auxiliar power[/b], and spends them, so use them carefully. You can pick up items with E, you pick up weapons and munition simply walking upon them.\n\n[b]OVERALL NOTE[/b]\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nSoundtrack: 10/10\nPlayability: 10/10\nFINAL NOTE: 10/10 (Masterpiece)\n\n[b]THE GOOD[/b]\n-The graphics are AWESOME!\n-The soundtrack is very good\n-Life in that game is very hard\n\n[b]THE BAD[/b]\n-A tiny bit of lag\n-I have only a few bad things to tell about Half","timestamp_created":1403657172,"timestamp_updated":1403657172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10776510","author":{"steamid":"76561198010597228","num_games_owned":2828,"num_reviews":287,"playtime_forever":2447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2250,"last_played":1403656151},"language":"german","review":"Auch von mir ein dickes +\n\nMan kann es einfach immer wieder durchspielen!!!\n\nEs ist natürlich kein Grafikwunder wie Crysis, aber in der Grafik würde es mir vermutlich nichtmal gefallen!\n\nTop FPS mit vielen guten Ideen, mit einer ordentlichen Länge, von der sich so manche ein moderner Shooter was abschneiden kann!\n\nHalf Life 2 ist der mehr als nur würdige Nachfolger von dem ersten Teil!","timestamp_created":1403656659,"timestamp_updated":1403656659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10776361","author":{"steamid":"76561198072538815","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":213,"last_played":1403971133},"language":"english","review":"Hit an invisible wall with my boat made of an idunstrial fan. 10/10","timestamp_created":1403656299,"timestamp_updated":1403656299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10775739","author":{"steamid":"76561198040988093","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":558,"last_played":1652936245},"language":"spanish","review":"...","timestamp_created":1403654646,"timestamp_updated":1637803572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10775675","author":{"steamid":"76561198074629060","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":85,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71,"last_played":1418996099},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games of my life. 12 out of 10","timestamp_created":1403654489,"timestamp_updated":1403654489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10774322","author":{"steamid":"76561198068007683","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":898,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":411,"last_played":1659219765},"language":"english","review":"One of the best FPS ever made...","timestamp_created":1403651331,"timestamp_updated":1403651331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10774068","author":{"steamid":"76561198087629747","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1881,"last_played":1458858524},"language":"english","review":"I think this was a very fun game so think about buying it!

Even though I still think it doesn't hold a candle original, I'm glad that I decided to take the time to try it a couple of years ago. I was reluctant to try it back then but I don't really remember why anymore. \n\nThis game is great fun, which includes the Episode 1 and Episode 2 expansions. Just another great example of the work that Valve is capable of, story, game play and graphics wise. Keep in mind that this game was released several years ago so back then the graphics were well ahead of their time and this was deemed a revolutionary game, and for good reason too.\n\nThis game really needs no introduction or further explanation,  so I just want to say that if you haven't played this or are reluctant to give it a try (like I was), you really should play it! Valve practically give this away in their sales even though it is worth far more than what they charge for it these days. A revolutionary game is revolutionary for a reason. Experience why and understand why Half-Life 3 is the most anticipated game in history.","timestamp_created":1403624889,"timestamp_updated":1403625058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572903633117675781","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10758294","author":{"steamid":"76561197973633395","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":79,"last_played":1560301011},"language":"french","review":"Already waiting for HL3!","timestamp_created":1403624760,"timestamp_updated":1403624760,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10757017","author":{"steamid":"76561198067288149","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1146,"last_played":1403551868},"language":"english","review":"One of the best action games i have played on PC!!

The act of which is incredibly unenjoyable due in part to the crippling controls, and some of the most unintutive shooting mechanics to date. Speaking of which, I should take the time to mention that the weapon selection in this game ranges from pointless to an aenurysm causing level of retardation. In retrospect one could even say that Half Life 2 represent everything wrong with Modern Video games. A dry, humorless First Person shooter with unpolished gameplay, vomit enducing graphics, and a purely broken story. The story at its core truly is broken, featuring a contrived an nonsensicle chain of events, forgetable characters, a setting more generic than its predesescore, and hysterically, overwhelmingly, dumb dialouge.
