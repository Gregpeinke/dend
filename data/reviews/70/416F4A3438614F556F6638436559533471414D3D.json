уже достаточно поиграл в эту игру и могу высказать своё мнение:\n-Нравится что эта игра в 2022 году смотрится неплохо\n-Как по мне есть главы которые уж слишком тяжёлые и ты проходишь их еле еле на 1-10 здоровья\n-Очень нравится управление\n-отлично перепроходить","timestamp_created":1646085916,"timestamp_updated":1646085916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512596964836120605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111263817","author":{"steamid":"76561198342858444","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2860,"last_played":1648752079},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely brilliant game!\n\nThe combat is brilliant, at first because you can basically move like doom guy you think you're practically invincible...typical strong FPS protagonist. \nHowever, soon you figure out you have to think to survive. \nPlaying with caution and skiull instead of blindly rushing corners.\nvery clever game with fun puzzles, parkour, fighting and expolration.\nPretty good sound effects that genuinely immerse you, especially the guns- you feel as if you're actually handling a deadly weapon.\n\nOverall, very fun game, basic story but very immersive and fantastic for its age!
