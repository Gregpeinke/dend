Where's the Little Sisters? Where's the Big Daddies? The Plasmids? Why isn't it Rapture!?!? I myself and plenty of my friends have sat here and said \"If its not Rapture its not Bioshock!\" however unlike some of them I actually still wanted to check out what Infinite was all about where others refuse to play this title simply cause of the location. Despite this personal reason so to speak I love Bioshock Infinite and there's no reason to rule it out due to it's alternate location! It's certainly a game to consider playing whether your a newcomer to the franchise or a fan from the Original Bioshock games set in Rapture. Its not Rapture but that doesn't mean its not a fantastic game like the previous Bioshocks!\n\nWith that said this game isn't set in the Underwater city as we know Rapture. Nope, Infinite is set in the airborne city known as Columbia. The year is 1912 and you are playing a character called Booker Dewitt. You are tasked with a mission to retrieve a girl called Elizabeth and bring her back to the Luteces to repay a debt. Things get a little more complicated than that however and evolves in your Journey with Elizabeth to stop her Guardian known as \"Songbird\" and alongside that to confronting her father and learning more about herself.\n\nSo whats so special about Elizabeth? This girl has a gift so to speak where she's able to create these \"Tears\" in reality to a different universe. Sounds somewhat confusing no? It will be explained however it is also a helpful maneuver in your gameplay! While this mission is seeming to be an escort mission she is never a burden unlike some I can think of.. \"Leon!\" Heh, she doesn't get in your way and never seems like a burden at any point, far from it. She will toss you money, discover and throw you ammo,salts (Vigor/Mana Resource) or even health packs during combat! Not only this but you can exploit her tear ability to bring in supplies or even things such as turrets to aid you too! Certainly a helpful gal. The enemies never directly attack her so in result it doesnt feel like she's a huge liability. It doesnt feel like an Escort mission throughout the entire game and most will be relieved to hear that.\n\nSo with the story set in motion what is Columbia? Columbia is a fantastic floating/airborne City that is simply stunning! Fantastic detail to the atmosphere and beautiful sight to behold. The whole 'old' essence about it all given this is set in 1912 is emphasized brilliantly! So Columbia seems like a great place to be right? Well thats the image I thought of at first however it turns out that Columbia is a.. Well to put bluntly a White-man City. It turns out that this seeming peaceful city is actually full of racsists so to speak. Quite an eye opener when first realising it! You'll see... On further information about Columbia, its citizens turn to a certain person known as \"The Prophet\" as he fortells the future of Columbia and able to predict the actions of this \"False Shepard\" in which he labels as Booker Dewitt. The False Shepard character is used as a individual to Corrupt the \"Lamb of Columbia\". This shall be explained in game!\n\nQuite a story set in motion! But how does it play? Gameplay is great, just like the other Bioshocks. In this game you are able to carry two main weapons. Sadly there isn't any weapon purchase stations unlike the first games which does limit you to find two weapons you like or simply the best to make the experience easier and stick with them the whole game. Its a shame there isnt more of a variety of what you could do to make it so you could utilize the other weapons more appropriately. I only found myself using the Shotgun and the Volley gun. On the odd occassion if the distance was long enough and there was a Sniper \"Tear\" at my disposal I would temporarily swap out my Shotgun for the sniper and dispose of my enemies before swapping them back. Just a point Id like to add where some it might not bother but certainly did me a touch.\nIn this game Plasmids are now called \"Vigors\". Its the same crack from the previous games. Some sort of magic ability if you will where you can throw firebombs or throw a flock of flesh eating crows at your enemies, using your environment to your advantage by throwing a firebomb on a fuel puddle or lightning bolts at a.. well water puddle to define the difference between the two! Also to note your Sky-Hook is a fantastic melee weapon! And a rather bloody one too as you'll with your first encounter... Quite something I wasn't expecting that much I'l say! Besides it being an deadly weapon it's also a tool to help you get around on Columbia's \"Skyline\". Think like a roller coaster but without seatbelts! Certainly a great and interesting way to get around some areas and as well around your enemies but even on that note your enemies will even join  you on the Skyline and follow you! That is a great mechanic!\n\nSo after all that you may be asking yourself, is there a twist? As for those who have played the previous Bioshock games know that there is a twist in both of the previous games and you may questioned yourselves, Is it the same deal? And thy answer to said question is Yes! There is a twist, one that even Im still trying to pull together after finishing the game! The twist lingers and makes you wonder and its great that a game can do that!  \n\nSo in Conclusion I would like to state that Bioshock Infinite is simply a fantastic, stunning and a pleasure to play! As a fan of the Rapture Bioshock games I had my doubts, I will be honest but now I cant believe that I let it be a reason to stop me from playing this game and in result I'm glad I decided to pick this up after reading much about it while also witnessing that this game getting much attention for one of the most anticipated games of 2013! My rating is 9/10! I will certainly be coming back to this game just to nab those additional achievements and complete on higher difficulties while enjoying the atmosphere of the world of Columbia! There is also Dlc being made \"Burial At Sea\" which I will certainly get round to picking up at some point to enjoy this game even further!\n\nSo is one of the most anticipated games of 2013 worth the money? Really want to ask that question? I think we both know that answer...","timestamp_created":1390158684,"timestamp_updated":1390159370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8772642","author":{"steamid":"76561197968885313","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":714,"last_played":1439112473},"language":"german","review":"Sehr gut, nur leider ist die Spielzeit insgesamt ein wenig kurz ansonsten 1+","timestamp_created":1390156840,"timestamp_updated":1390156840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501829087734222412","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8772026","author":{"steamid":"76561197967016826","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2087,"last_played":1397432868},"language":"english","review":"Good but very short - a couple hours max.","timestamp_created":1390154287,"timestamp_updated":1390154287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8771990","author":{"steamid":"76561198039788848","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7909,"last_played":1564881916},"language":"spanish","review":"SI realmente quieren disfrutar este juego tienen que jugarlo en su idioma original.

Believe me, I spent way longer than I should have just walking around Columbia during the opening. The Skyhook is an interesting mechanic, and flying along the rollercoaster-like rails is very fun and provides you with tons of mobility. The Handymen give that same feeling of panic and fear that Big Daddies did in the original bioshock, and everytime you encounter on is a thrill. Last but not least, Elizabeth is an incredible companion. She saved me many times, and having her there makes you feel like you are always in the fight. Plus her tears provide a whole new level of depth to combat. This game is one of the best I've ever played, I extremely recomend it.

Like it's predecessors, it offers the potential for an open world that would be wonderful to explore, yet you're never given a chance.  It offers a dark, mysterious and compelling narrative unfortunately bogged down by cumbersome gameplay, plodding and repetitive combat sequences, and limited weapon/armor/upgrade options that even cloud-spanning ziplines barely improve .  To be fair, the AI in combat was challenging.  But every time I came to yet another vending machine, I wanted to scream because the machines always sold the same half-dozen items.  Likewise, the entire town was populated by the same half-dozen faces saying the same half-dozen things.  This could have been a perfect game for weapon/armor crafting a la Dead Space 3 (if you want total control in developing your character into a visceral bad-ass while still retaining your humanity, play Dead Space 3) and the open-worldliness of Fallout 3.  As it is, however, I never felt compelled to continue playing in the hopes of getting to further explore the world or of stumbling upon yet another fight sequence, but only to push the narrative forward.  It might as well have been a rail shooter.  The storytelling and development of the two main characters is by far the best part of the game; everything else just gets in the way.  I'd recommend this game if you can get it on sale for less than $20.","timestamp_created":1390074863,"timestamp_updated":1390355669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8757832","author":{"steamid":"76561198059627920","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":761,"last_played":1390150775},"language":"portuguese","review":"Bom demais!!!!","timestamp_created":1390073092,"timestamp_updated":1390073092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8757702","author":{"steamid":"76561198000423747","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":108,"playtime_forever":1256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1256,"last_played":1373645057},"language":"english","review":"A game filled with so much racial insensitivity that I literally could not stop laughing.
