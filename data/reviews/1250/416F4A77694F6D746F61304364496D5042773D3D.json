When I finally got around to trying this out, I ended up on the Suburbia map with no clue what to do.

If you missed playing Invasion mode on UT2004, this is your alternative.

It has a good enough amount of it that you can actually enjoy playing it without replaying the same game every time. It also doesn't have so much of it that you'll lose track of the basis of \"balance\"\n\nA really noticeable (and very annoying) con of this game is its communication system. Microphones have bad quality and lag like heck. You're probably at your best if you visit a server that offers its own teamspeak or mumble server (which is really really rare). Second to that are the pubs.
