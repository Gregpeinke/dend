Anyway, Portal really earned its place in the gaming canon. It was rightly recognized as a masterpiece at the time and the benefit of hindsight only makes its influence more apparent. The central gimmick is extremely clever and the puzzles are very well designed. If you've already beaten the game you can breeze through it in about 90 minutes without much thought yet something has kept me coming back to this game over the years despite knowing it like the back of my hand. Portalling around just [i]feels[/i] good and atmosphere is incredible. I had forgotten how surreal and moody this first game felt despite the humorous elements and I think it's something that the franchise sadly lost as it became more mainstream (though the comedy in the second game is very funny). Aperture has a real sense of [i]mystery[/i] and the incredible ambient soundtrack has this sense of forlornness I can't describe. \n\nIn some ways this is the most important game I've personally played because the developer commentary feature was what really inspired me to look at game design as a career and I've ended up with a decent career in that field because of it, so hopefully I've made back what I spent on Steam over the course of my life.

Der Humor ist einmalig und habe ich noch nie zuvor irgendwo gesehen. Es ist eine ganz andere Art von schwarzem Humor. Die Rätsel sind am Anfang noch recht simple können aber später einen verzweifeln lassen. Das Spiel selber hat eine Spielzeit von ca. 1 Stunde (wenn man die Rätsel relativ schnell checkt. Die meisten werden so 1,5-3 Stunden brauchen. Man muss aber auch bedenken, dass das Spiel eigl. nur eine Techdemo der Entwickler war, weswegen sie Teil 2 entwickelt haben. Dieses Spiel eröffnet einem den Weg in ein fantastisches Universum was von den Fans geliebt wird. Nach Teil 1 sollte man Teil 2 auf jeden Fall spielen! Beide Spiele sind oft im Sale für gerade mal 0,99 Euro. Nachdem man die beiden Spiele gespielt hat sollte man auch die kostenlosen Mods ,,Portal Stories: Mel\" (im Prinzip Portal 3) und danach ,,Portal Reloaded\" (im Prinzip Portal 4 + sehr fordernd!).\nAlso ja, das Spiel lohnt sich!

It's amazing how much they were able to do, especially for 2008 standards. Valve made a very bold and good decision by making it take place in a first person perspective. Only a couple of small problems. One, it screen-tears often. This, for the most part, disappears about twenty minutes into gameplay, but it still happens regularly. The only way to stop it is to enable an option that delays your mouse inputs in order to apply anti-aliasing, which doesn't work out too well in a first person game. Two, it's extremely short. Took me three hours and ten minutes for the campaign. Sure, there is a lot of bonus content, but I would either buy this in the Portal bundle, which comes with the sequel for 25% off each item (this is how I got it), or wait for it to go on sale.","timestamp_created":1630799772,"timestamp_updated":1630799772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98797849","author":{"steamid":"76561198366760499","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":938,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":762,"last_played":1657468472},"language":"english","review":"Splat gate","timestamp_created":1630798855,"timestamp_updated":1630798855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98797184","author":{"steamid":"76561198347538170","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1593824719},"language":"brazilian","review":"história muito boa a sequência do 2 deixa melhor ainda","timestamp_created":1630797690,"timestamp_updated":1630797690,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98794392","author":{"steamid":"76561198166133162","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":143,"last_played":1625419138},"language":"turkish","review":"Uuuuuuu\n","timestamp_created":1630792922,"timestamp_updated":1630792922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98792367","author":{"steamid":"76561199091257647","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":876,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":331,"last_played":1656548357},"language":"spanish","review":"Chell es mi Crush","timestamp_created":1630789792,"timestamp_updated":1630789792,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98791790","author":{"steamid":"76561198260773807","num_games_owned":271,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1631391050},"language":"english","review":"Maybe Black Mesa?\nThat was a joke.
