while short, provides a very memorable experience and is well crafted in all aspects of the game.    The levels in Portal often use verticality and gravity to make a more fun experience.  The core mechanic of Portal is the Portal Gun, which creates two linked portals.  Turrets, moving platforms, deadly water, and weighted cubes can often serve as both obstacles and tools in a level.  The way in which portals can conserve energy and create gravity defying feats can be difficult to imagine, but is extremely satisfying.\n\tThe graphics are from many years ago, and they can’t be compared to any recent games, but they look good enough.  The visual design of the entire game doesn’t require or would benefit from extra detail.  After all, you’re in an industrial-looking testing facility.\n\tThe main story focuses on the silent Chell and GLaDOS within the Aperture Science facility.  You play from the first person perspective of Chell, navigating through and solving puzzles in the facility.  I won’t spoil anything else.  \n\tThe main storyline lasts under four hours, but the voice acting and use of dark humor is superb, and something rare in the puzzle genre.  There are also many bonus levels in addition to the regular ones. [u] The low price, low hardware requirements, replayability, and how fun it is overall make it necessary for any collection.  [/u]\n\nShould you play this game?\n\nYes:  \n-If you’re new to puzzle games, the shortness and low price make it a great introduction to the genre.\n\n-If you have played Portal 2, and you liked it, or you like puzzle games in general.\n\n-If you don’t want a frustrating or drawn-out puzzle game.\n\nNo:\n-If you want a very lengthy game.\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1486588122,"timestamp_updated":1486588122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601449251174926758","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29787911","author":{"steamid":"76561198296591164","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1641316654},"language":"russian","review":"Игра хорошая.

Проход из одной точки в другую - это же огромный простор для экспериментов! Так посчитала и группа студентов Технологического института DigiPen, которые в 2005 году заявили о себе, выпустив бесплатную игрушку под названием Narbacular Drop, использующую концепцию порталов. Тогда-то их и заметили ребята из Valve (гении видеоигр, ответственные за серию HL и сервис Steam) - пригласили в свою команду, дали приличный бюджет, сценаристов, кучу времени и творческую свободу. Результат вышел через два года, и имя ему - Portal. Итак, чем же так захватывает эта игра, если она в одночасье стала хитом мирового масштаба, а в американских школах по ней даже преподают физику?\n\nНачать пожалуй стоит с её сюжета, который начинается вполне просто и невинно. Игрок просыпается в маленькой стеклянной будке со всеми удобствами, где его приветствует холодный и безэмоциональный голос GLaDOS, который управляет неким комплексом занимающимся исследованием порталов и их свойств. Её (именно так, это девушка, если компьютер вообще может иметь пол) механический голос будет вашим спутником на протяжении всей игры и не раз заставит от души посмеяться или же передёрнуться - черноты в юморе машины хватает. Что же остальной персонал, спросите вы? А он... Впрочем, это вы узнаете сами.\n\nС самого начала испытаний, в виде которых оформлен весь Portal, игрок увидит в действии те самые порталы, на которых построен геймплей. По сути, это две дыры в пространстве, которые связаны друг с другом. Объект входит в синий портал - выходит из оранжевого, и наоборот, при этом не меняя своего направления движения и скорости (относительно портала, конечно). Когда вы примерно поймёте, как работают эти переходы, GLaDOS любезно вручит вам портальную пушку - устройство, с помощью которого вы сможете сами их создавать (одновременно может быть лишь один синий и один оранжевый), тогда же и загадки в комнатах резко набирают сложность. Затем появляется ещё ряд дополнительных правил вроде стен, на которых порталы открывать нельзя, объектов вроде турелей, которых необходимо избегать или использовать в своих целях. Всё это приводит к тому, что к финалу игры у игрока искажается мировоззрение - то, что раньше было непреодолимым препятствием, теперь вполне может оказаться подспорьем, а само пространство уровней расширяется во много раз.\n\nЗвуковое сопровождение в Portal приятное. Треков не так много, но они точно передают атмосферу происходящего в игре, а голоса GLaDOS и тех самых турелек (вы ещё поблагодарите их за разговорчивость, когда встретите) выполнены на высшем уровне. Песня из финальных титров - Still Alive - в первые дни после релиза игры стала хитом, который вполне заслуженно запомнят ещё надолго.\n\nЗа графику и воплощение законов физики в игре отвечает уже зарекомендовавший себя движок Source. Надо отметить, что в архитектуре тут преобладает кубизм, но даже так игра выглядит красиво. Portal - один из примеров того, что технология должна просто позволять художникам выражать себя, а те уже придадут игре сколь угодно приятный внешний вид.\n\nУвы, но не обошлось и без минусов. Главный из них - краткость. Когда вы обучитесь обращению с порталами, комнаты станут пролетать одна за другой очень быстро, и вы наверняка будете слушать упомянутую Still Alive куда скорее, чем ожидали. Впрочем, это можно записать и в плюс - из-за своей миниатюрности. По моему мнению это намного лучше, чем если бы разработчики искусственно пытались растянуть игру, что почти всегда заметно невооружённым глазом и может вызывать сильное раздражение. \n\nИ, конечно же, как любую другую игру от Valve, Portal можно свободно было, модифицировать бы желание. В интернете легко находятся сотни новых уровней и \"полных\" модов, которые по качеству могут посоревноваться с оригинальной игрой, тем самым в разы увеличивая время, проведённое в обнимку с портальной пушкой.\n\nИтак, вердикт: Portal - отличная игра. Только попробуйте, и я гарантирую - в конце вы попросите добавки.","timestamp_created":1486320578,"timestamp_updated":1486320578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29726118","author":{"steamid":"76561198019554006","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":600,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":600,"last_played":1343804400},"language":"polish","review":"Fajna gra, bardzo grywalna, masa funu, zmusza do myślenia","timestamp_created":1486320250,"timestamp_updated":1486320250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29726046","author":{"steamid":"76561198170022641","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":151,"last_played":1558770682},"language":"french","review":"cool","timestamp_created":1486320098,"timestamp_updated":1486320098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29724821","author":{"steamid":"76561198319867772","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":346,"last_played":1641083242},"language":"spanish","review":"Un plataformas muy curioso, buena trama.","timestamp_created":1486317005,"timestamp_updated":1486317005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29724461","author":{"steamid":"76561198138041457","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":627,"last_played":1457784951},"language":"english","review":"I love this game..... that's it...","timestamp_created":1486316021,"timestamp_updated":1486316021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29722914","author":{"steamid":"76561198353368331","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1352,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1302,"last_played":1626578403},"language":"french","review":"Portal est un très bon FPS qui vous tiendra en haleine pendant 6-7 heures (et plus de 20 heures pour ma part pour le torcher complètement).
