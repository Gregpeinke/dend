This game is so neck and neck for me between HL1 and this game. Half-life 1 wins though, but barely. This game is fu cking astounding, I wouldn’t be surprised if the developers were on drugs when making this game. \n\nPROS: \n- I love the weapons in this game so much; my favorite being the Spore Launcher and it's my favorite HL weapon in general. There are so many fu cking weapons in this game, like what the fu ck why? BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! GAVE ME YOUR FU CKING WEAPONS!!! AARRRRRROOOOOOOOOO!!!! Ummmm?? Sorry about that, I don’t know what that was.\n- The story is really good, you play as Adrian Shephard, a marine sent in to clean up the Black Mesa incident. It’s really good man trust me.\n- YOU DON’T PLAY THROUGH MUCH OF XEN!! FU CK YEAH!!!\n- I love the new enemies too, really good\n- For some reason, this game is really fu cking HARD!!!!! And I like that.\n\nOkay so everything else is pretty much in my HL1 review for pros because it’s an expansion pack, so it’s basically the same game. Now for the cons…….\n\nCONS:\n- This game is too short, I want to play more god damn it!!\n- Honestly, I don’t care much for the soundtrack. A lot of the tracks feel like they have the same beat. WTF!!???\n- I hate the ending because Shephard never comes back in the future games. I’ve always wanted a conclusion to his story, but it never happened. There are some mods out there that do try, like HL2 awakening……….. does anyone remember that mod? No? Same here. Well, there’s Prospekt on stream: sorry Rich but your game sucks asss and I didn’t enjoy it. But it’s not on my worst mods list of all time like Wilson Chronicles and HTDF, so there’s that. Anyways Rich, please put your money to good use, I’m counting on you. *KISS ON THE FOREHEAD* Hopfully you're doing something with that money, right???? Since I mentioned Wilson Chronicles and HDTF, I might as well say how HDTF is worse than when England touched the fu cking White House back in 1814, and Wilson Chronicles makes me want to have a fu cking lobotomy. There’s Opposing Force 2, looks awesome and fun. TO BAD IT’S FU CKING DEAD AND LOST FOREVER!!!  You know, I don't even care if he comes back in HL3 and all he does is just takes a sh it and then dies right after. I just what to know what the happened to him.\n\nYeah, that’s about it for me, I love this game from my heart to my di ck. But don’t play this game first if you've never played Half-life before, play Half-life 1 first then play this game.

В отличии от BS, эти чувства больше смешаны в положительную сторону.\n\nДобавлено множество новых пушек и противников, не всегда всё сделано удачно, но тем не менее это что-то новое, поэтому дополнение не ощущается совсем вторичным в плане механик, а иногда даже преподносит и приятные сюрпризы.\n\nОбщая проработка всё так же не дотягивает до уровня оригинала. Например, местный аналог вортигонтов - пещерные трутни не убиваются альтернативным выстрелом из дробовика на максимальном уровне сложности. Мелочь? Но очень сильно раздражает и тормозит геймплей. Излишняя толщина представителей новой расы  - это существенная проблема дополнения. Для убийства некоторых приходится скакать вокруг слишком продолжительное количество времени.\n\nТеперь о новой расе Х, да, именно их представители являются нашими новыми врагами и в рамках данного дополнения это круто, нам презентуют новую сторону конфликта, со своими мотивами и целями. Это создаёт интригу и желание продвигаться вперёд по сюжету. К сожалению, ни целей, ни мотивов мы так и не узнаем, а сама раса Х не появится больше ни в одной игре серии, что несколько уменьшает важность событий OF, но это точно не минус самой игры.\n\nТут нет загадок, которые мы были в Blue Shift (и были очень даже неплохи), зато больше перестрелок с представителями человечества, что чудо как хороши благодаря базовой механике.\n\nВ целом, я получил удовольствие при прохождении Opposing Force, это неплохая игра, в контексте вселенной Half-Life даже смелая. Разработчики из Gearbox постарались создать что-то новое и у них это с переменным успехом это получилось, жаль только, что не все наработки ушли в дальнейшее развитие

I prefer more run and gun, as opposed to the platforming and puzzle solving. If you loved Half-Life, then you will enjoy this expanson as well.

Mas mesmo sendo esquecido, Opposing Force tem uma proposta interessante: Ver pelo lado de um dos seus inimigos. \n \n\nRecapitulação rápida: Você é Adrian Shepard, cabo da HECU, responsável da invasão no jogo base. Você começa o jogo em um avião, a caminho da Black Mesa, mas você sabe como helicópteros funcionam em jogos. Enfim, depois da queda, Adrian se vê sem ordens claras, e tenta escapar da Black Mesa a todos os custos. \nO conteúdo novo aqui é bem meh, para falar a verdade. As armas novas são armas já presentes no jogo base, mas com um reskin, como a Desert Eagle sendo basicamente uma Magnum mais rápida, e a faca de combate rapidamente botando a chave inglesa para ser obsoleta. Os únicos destaques que posso citar são o Barnacle Grapple, que funciona como um gancho e é criminalmente pouco usado, e o Displacer Cannon, que é a típica arma de último recurso contra inimigos gigantes.\nE para os inimigos novos, a maioria também são um reskin de inimigos presentes no jogo original. Outros, como o Pit Drone, parecem curiosamente com um jogo que conheço, e o Voltigore, cujo você deve rezar para não encontrar. \nUma das oportunidades perdidas foram os soldados. O jogo apresenta vários tipos de soldados diferentes, como o engenheiro, que consegue derrubar portas e abrir caminhos alternativos, e o MEEEEDIC, que obviamente te cura. O problema com os soldados é que enquanto fora do combate, a inteligência deles é horrível e você precisa literalmente guiar eles para eles poderem te seguir direito. Ou seja, quando funciona é incrível, mas quando não funciona...\nMas não se preocupe, porque esses não são problemas maiores. A variedade apresentada em Half-Life ainda persiste aqui, com um level design que cof cof, ouso dizer melhor que o jogo original, por ser mais consistente e sem capítulos mais maçantes. \n E, para ser honesto, a Gearbox melhor fez seu trabalho enquanto esteve na sombra da obra que a Valve originalmente criou. Sem as adições, seria basicamente um mission pack (como o seu sucessor), mas na realidade *é* um mission pack, coisa que eu creio que a Gearbox foi perceber nos momentos finais do jogo.\n\nEsquecido por não ser memorável, Opposing Force faz um bom extra para Half-Life, sendo meh em alguns pontos e ótimo em outros. Distinto, criativo, e divertido: Tudo o que uma expansão era e deve ser.","timestamp_created":1540048085,"timestamp_updated":1540049033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45357269","author":{"steamid":"76561198240416248","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":355,"last_played":1501561293},"language":"koreana","review":"꿀겜","timestamp_created":1540043016,"timestamp_updated":1540043016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45344698","author":{"steamid":"76561198319756591","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":66,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":66,"last_played":1545524897},"language":"english","review":"It's

The game goes on forever, it just keeps going, on and on and on and on, it picks up some time late in Half-Life. There's actually, shockingly no clear plot or anything, since maybe a chapter or two in you get to the point where you're going to leave Black Mesa with the rest of the soldiers, and G-Man steps in to stop you... for some reason, and then the rest of the game is just nonsense. You just... go through Black Mesa, fightin' and killin' everything in your way.\n\nThe only things not hostile to you this time are Black Mesa personnel and fellow soldiers, but there's a new faction of 'black ops' troops who are out to get you... for some reason, so you have to fight those guys. For the most part, your enemies are pretty much just vortigaunts, houndeyes and headcrabs for the first half of the game, then after about that point you're just fighting these weird lookin things which run up and claw you, and then for the last third or so it's almost exclusively these giant things that spit purple lightning balls at you, and these ground troops which shoot blue laser balls.\n\nIt's actually horrible, everything does huge amounts of damage to you and there's not much you can do to stop it. I never felt so consistently outgunned in any of the other games, and it might have something to do with the fact that after about the halfway mark, I think Gearbox just completely forgot about giving you anything to do with HP or armor. You're supposed to be able to charge up your combat armor with these military grade chargers as well as the HEV suit chargers, and during training you even see a third party one, but honestly I think I only saw one or maybe two military chargers during the whole game.\n\nAdditionally, health is a huge problem. After that halfway mark or so, they just stop placing the medkits on walls, so you only have rarely, a big bunch of crates in a room that have maybe 3-4 health kits as items which restore about 15 hp each, so gaining 45 to 60 health at once. This is nice, but I really felt up against it for that entire third or half of the game, if you ever make a mistake and drop to like 10 or 20 hp, that's it, that's pretty much all you get for what feels like another chapter or so.\n\nThere's this one really annoying bit where there's this tunnel system with a whole ton of these spider lookin things that shoot purple lightning, and they take a LOT of hits to kill, and I mean a LOT, like multiple shots with a rocket launcher. I found that the BFG or whatever it is does about 1-shot them as long as you hit them with it, but you only get five shots anyway.\n\nI think it says a lot that I played this game for not even 5 hours, and it felt like 10.\n\nThe first third of the game or so feels pretty good, it's fun enough, and playing as Shepard is novel enough to keep you interested, but from then on, perhaps after G-Man stops you boarding the helicopter out, that's when the game just sort of takes a dive. I don't know why, it just stops being fun. Maybe it's because they never really give you anything else to do, and the game culminates in an absolutely pathetic excuse for a boss fight. It doesn't even work properly on Linux, what I found is that once you kill the boss, its model sort of bugs out and it instantly disappears, and it doesn't let you finish the game unless you manually change level to it via the console.\n\nThere's some other issues too, like the game not giving you weapons early enough. For example, the Barnacle. You get an actual Barnacle as a 'gun' in this game. You just kind of use it to grapple enemies, you can grab headcrabs and they are tugged right into the maw of the Barnacle, chomp, it's crunched into a giblets. But, anything larger than that, and you get pulled towards it like a grappling hook. Now, everyone knows grappling hooks are super awesome, why didn't they give it to us earlier? You get it only a couple chapters before the end of the game!\n\nLike Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes, there's a bunch of stuff in the tutorial which doesn't really feel like it's made enough of a big deal of in the game itself. An example is the ropes, in Opposing Force you can climb ropes which act kind of like actual physics objects, it's very impressive, the only issue is the game doesn't really do much with them. I'm not sure if it was a technical limitation or not, but either way, they're very few and far between and the only few times you get to use them are usually just... climbing up a small distance you could have just had a ladder for.\n\nA better use could have been something like... having you use an elevator, it stops, so you need to grab onto the electrical cable and climb down instead while it plummets down below and explodes. That'd be cool! People like seeing stuff blow up. Instead, they're almost all 'just kind of there'.\n\nI should talk a little more about the final boss. It's just a big squid, it can't move, and to kill it you just shoot it in each eye with a pair of laser guns you have to press E to use, and then you shoot it in it's... portal mouth thing until it dies. It's boring, not challenging, and while the Nihilanth in Half-Life is constantly speaking to you, whispering stuff in your ear like as soon as you get to Xen, this thing just kind of shows up! A guard says \"hey there's a bad thing coming through a portal and you gotta kill it\" and you do that and that's the end of the game. It just ends, G-Man shows up to tell you you're going to be put away now and then it ends. It's very disappointingy.\n\nIt's a shame that we never really got a sequel or anything, I'd actually love to see that today, with a stronger emphasis on the differences between the scientist, Dr. Freeman and the veteran soldier, Corporal Adrian Shepard, but... Gearbox is a huge company now, and they probably wouldn't even care about doing it. Valve don't really make games anymore, and everyone's kind of forgotten about Half-Life.\n\nI can't say I disliked Opposing Force, some parts of it are really great. The soldiers are ALL just hamming it up, it's great, you get an intro that's reminiscent of Predator, there's one part with a trash compactor which is like 1:1 with the scene from Star Wars, and the few occasions you get to lead around some of your fellow soldiers, it's fun, it's good, it's just a shame it can't remain like that throughout the whole thing. I'd give it like a thumbs sideways, but since I have to pick one, my affection for the game outweighs my disdain.","timestamp_created":1537152894,"timestamp_updated":1537152894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44774532","author":{"steamid":"76561198175643053","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1613444364},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 1 but you play as a cannon-fodder.","timestamp_created":1537139224,"timestamp_updated":1537139224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44771816","author":{"steamid":"76561198182033634","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":2503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":898,"last_played":1620989364},"language":"english","review":"A nice game.
