Combine güçlerine karşı Freeman, Black Mesa'daki bilim adamları ve bazı arkadaşları tarafından organize edilen Barney Calhoun, Alyx Vance ve Dr.Kleiner'ın da bulunduğu yeraltı direniş örgütüne katılır. Gordon, Dr.Eli Vance'in laboratuvarı Black Mesa Doğu'ya ışınlanmak istenirken başarısız olur. Laboratuvara eski şehir kanallarını kullanarak ulaşır. Black Mesa Doğu'ya vardığında Alyx'in robot hayvanı Dog ile tanışır ve burada yer çekimi silahını alır. Daha sonra laboratuvar Combine saldırısına uğrar ve Dr. Eli Vance, eskiden üst düzey bir hapishane olan Nova Prospekt'e götürülür. Mossman ise sözde kaçırılmıştır. Gordon terkedilmiş ve zombiler ile dolu olan Ravenholm Kasabasından gider. Papaz Grigori'nin yardımıyla otoyol 17 ye ulaşır ve Tau topu isimli silahla donamlı olan arazi aracıyla Deniz feneri'ne ulaşır ve orayı Combine'a karşı savunur. Arazi aracını orada bırakarak yola yürüyerek devam eder. Antlionlar ile dolu olan bir sahili geçer ve bir antlion guard ile savaşır. Yakındaki kamptan gelen Vortigaunt Gordon'a antlion guardların antlionları kontrol etmek için kullandığı Pheropodlar diğer adıyla Bugbaitler verir. Gordon bugbaitleri kullanarak Nova Prospekt'e ulaşır ve Alyx ile buluşur.\n\nEli'nin yerini tespit ederler ve Mossman'ın bir Combine casusu olduğunu öğrenirler fakat Mossman Alyx ve Gordon onu durduramadan kendini ve Eli'ı Citadel'e ışınlar.Ardından Alyx ile birlikte Dr.Kleiner'ın Laboratuvarına ışınlanırlar ve bu sırada Nova Prospekt patlar. Işınlanma bir hafta sürmüştür.Direniş Nova Prospekt'in patlamasını Combine'a ayaklanma başlatmak için bir sinyal olarak görmüştür. Gordon ile Citadel'a ulaşmaya çalışan Alyx kaçırılır ve Citadel'a götürülür. Gordon Direniş üyeleriyle beraber, Combine ve striderlar ile savaşır ve Gordon Barney ve Dog'un yanına ulaşır. Barney ve Dog, Gordon'ın Citadel'a girmesine yardım ederler.\n\nGordon, Citadel'a girmiştir. Citadel'da ilerlerken Breen'in El Koyma odasına giriş yapar ve Yerçekimi silahı hariç her silahı yok olur. Yer çekimi silahına gelen enerji sayesinde silah daha güçlü olur ve Gordon onu Combine'a karşı kullanır . İlerleyen kısımlarda Gordon da Dr. Breen tarafından yakalanır. Dr. Breen burada insanlar ve Combine ile ilgili planlarını anlatır ve anlattıkları Mossman'ın söylediklerine zıttır. Sinirlenen Dr. Mossman, Gordon, Alyx ve Eli'yi serbest bırakır. Dr. Breen, Kara Enerji Geçidine girer ancak Gordon, Dr.Breen'i Alyx'in yardımıyla durdurur. Reaktörün patlamasıyla G-Man zamanı durdurur. Gordon'ı yaptıkları için tebrik eder ve ona \"Gordon'ın hizmetleri için gelen teklifler\"den bahseder. Gordon'ın görevi bitmiştir ve G-Man Gordon'ı zamansız bir boyuta koyar.\n\n\nOynanış\nHalf-Life 2, bir birinci tekil şahıs oyunudur. Olaylar oyuncunun gözünden anlatılmaktadır. Tüm olaylar ilk oyun olan Half-Life'ta ki konunun üzerine kuruludur. Ekranın altında oyuncunun sağlığını, cephanesini; üstte ise silahların olduğu listeyi gösteren bir monitör bulunur. Oyuncu sağlığını ve enerjisini ilk yardım paketlerinden, enerji pillerinden veya duvara entegre edilmiş ilk yardım panellerinden yükseltebilir. Oyuncuya gitmesi gereken hikâye içindeki seviyeye göre üstündeki zorluğu değişen tek bir yol bulunur. Bu yolda işgâlci Combine polisi veya askerleri, zombiler, kafa yengeçleri, vortigaunt'lar ve daha birçok çeşit uzaylı bulunabilir.\n\nOyuncu, gitmesi gereken yolda birçok engel ve çözmesi gereken bulmacalarla karşılaşır. Örneğin, önüne kilitli bir kapı çıktığında çok daha uzun başka bir yol kullanarak bu kapının arkasına geçmesi gerekebilir. Bir barikat çıktığında bu barikatı aşmak için patlayıcı kullanması gerekebilir.\n\nOyuncu, düşmana karşı bilim kurgusal veya gerçek birçok silah kullanır. Bu silahlar arasında 9 mm'lik bir tabanca, hafif makineli tüfek, el bombası, roket atar, arbalet, pompalı tüfek bulunur. Ayrıca oyun motoru'na dahil edilen fizik motorunun sayesinde Sıfır noktası enerji alanı yönlendiricisi ya da diğer adıyla Yerçekimi silahı kullanır. Bu silah, cisimleri oyuncuya doğru çeker ve çok büyük bir kuvvetle başka bir alana doğru fırlatabilir. Yerçekimi silahı oyunun bazı kısımlarında bulmacaları çözmek için de kullanılır. Örneğin asla kumlara basılmaması gereken bir bölümde oyuncu, etrafındaki nesneleri kullanarak kendine yol yapar. Diğer bir örnek ise oyuncu otoyolda ilerlerken önüne arabalardan bir engel çıktığında yer çekimi silahı ile arabaları itebilir.\n\nKaynakça: https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2\n\n","timestamp_created":1472665051,"timestamp_updated":1472665051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524684607982635498","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25272194","author":{"steamid":"76561198076103872","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":734,"last_played":1469348816},"language":"english","review":"Great storyline also really twisting storyline","timestamp_created":1472664604,"timestamp_updated":1472664604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25266932","author":{"steamid":"76561198118443369","num_games_owned":626,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":777,"last_played":1472643804},"language":"russian","review":"10 гордонов из 9","timestamp_created":1472643830,"timestamp_updated":1472643830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25265004","author":{"steamid":"76561198095292094","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":126,"playtime_forever":2182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":762,"last_played":1590089155},"language":"polish","review":"genialna gra","timestamp_created":1472634832,"timestamp_updated":1472634832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25263093","author":{"steamid":"76561198023790652","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":778,"last_played":1471986486},"language":"english","review":"Despite being released nearly 12 years ago, Half-life 2 is still tops when it comes to a proper first-person shooter and is definitely one of the best, and most influential, video games of all-time.

It's a work of art, containing gameplay that not only is some of the best out there, but causes emotional feelings to occur while playing.\n\nWe start off in a fucking train just like Half-Life except its not five fucking minutes this time.  We see that everything sucks ass.  We meet the villian Dr. Breen who is the administrator of City 17.  We walk around a bit and learn than the alien race, the Combine has taken over earth and put him in charge.  We meet some other shit heads like Barney and Kliener but the only real important character so far is Alyx because her ass is probably the nicest thing to look at before the gameplay actually kicks in about 15 minutes later.\n\nWe get our old crowbar back but, heh, who the fuck needs that when you got your pistol?  Probably the best \"weapon\" in the game, the pistol feels like a fucking hand canon, shooting fast ass bullets at your enemies making you feel like you are fucking epic as hell.  And YES theres the smg and the 357 but those are pussy ass weapons for those weak sucker fucks unable to aim- sorry...\nGot a little carried away, but why add such horrible weapons if the only thing I want to use is the pistol?\n\nWe also get out first vehicle in the game the airboat.  Most people hate the airboat though and LOVE the jeep because some people dont understand how complex the airboat actually is.  It is a boat, made of air.  The jeep is just a seagul shit magnet.\n\nWe get to Eli's lab and we get to see the Gravity Gun.  Apparentally Valve couldnt code the physgun to work so they just made a crappy Half-Life 2 spin-off called Garry's Mod to use instead.  The Gravity Gun picks up stuff and punts it.  Its a cool weapon with a cool concept but who needs the Gravity Gun when you got the mother fucking shotgun!\n\nWe go to Ravenholm and we meet this old dude I think I saw in a Pamtri video.  He gives me this wicked shotgun that I can either shoot 1 bullet or 2 at the same time which basically 1-Up's the pistol.\n\nWe get to Highway 17 and we get our jeep, the worst vehicle in the game.  It slides around and doesn't control good and most of the time it makes me want to jump off the cliff, but I guess the one upside is that you can drive off the cliff instead of jumping and thats funny.\n\nThe best vehicle in the game, isnt the airboat, the jeep...\nbut the fucking Crane.\n\nIts just, a well designed vehicle.  No more said.\n\nWe have to leave our car behind and we make our way to the shitty antlion part of the game.  But, this part isnt bad because of the antlions, or the bad physics.  Its because of poor Lazlo, the finest mind of our generator, gets killed by antlions.  WHY LORD GABEN, WHY MUST YOU KILL OFF SUCH A POOR INECENT SOUL!?!\n\nIts horrible that such a horrible thing happened to him and brings out the tears hidden in my eyes, and its a shame because even though this is the worst part of the game, its my favorite for 2 main reasons.  Lazlo's death brought upon real tears when I saw him die.  His friend couldnt take it anymore, and he stepped on the dunes causing antlions to come up and kill him (or was that me?).  But after we killed the antlion gaurd, a vortigaunt comes out and greets us, and gives us the best item in Half-Life 2- no, the best item in the series- NO, the best item in all of Valve- NO, THE BEST ITEM IN VIDEO GAME HISTORY...\n\nThe Mother Fucking Bug Bait!\n\nThis item is the best item anyone could use it combat.  It's a high tech mind control device that allows the player to mind control antlions.  I dont use it to defend myself from the combine, but I use it to send them straight into combine fire, killing them instantly.  I do this to avenge Lazlo and his friend, so that their souls can rest in piece.  \n\nWe make our way to Nova Prospekt and meet up with Alyx's sweet bum, but that doesn't matter now, what does is that Eli has been captured and we need to rescue him.  Mossman is a traitor and steals him, we go to the citadel and fine that Alyx was also captured.  You destroy the citadel and Breen falls and turns into a Grub.\n\n6/10 Not Enough Bug Bait","timestamp_created":1472433742,"timestamp_updated":1534026162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25219035","author":{"steamid":"76561198254890112","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":8794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4583,"last_played":1628316616},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1472432610,"timestamp_updated":1611627688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25216474","author":{"steamid":"76561198109891574","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":2084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1448,"last_played":1650080656},"language":"brazilian","review":"Simplesmente Perfeito.... não hà geração ainda que supere isso... ainda é o melhor jogo de todos os tempos.","timestamp_created":1472421564,"timestamp_updated":1472421564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25215330","author":{"steamid":"76561198168701285","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":106,"playtime_forever":1395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":703,"last_played":1555433009},"language":"czech","review":"Skvělý, protože je to Half-Life :)","timestamp_created":1472417609,"timestamp_updated":1472417609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578813016414642334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25211163","author":{"steamid":"76561197983277771","num_games_owned":431,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":1133,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1040,"last_played":1656771271},"language":"english","review":"[h1] Rise and Shine Mr. Freeman....
