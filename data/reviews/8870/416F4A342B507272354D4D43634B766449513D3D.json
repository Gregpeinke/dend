It's one of the best games ever and one of the BEST sidekicks ever: Elizabeth.\n\nIt has an excelent story that will leave a mark on you.\nThe graphics and sound are execelent at imersing you in the environment. They could take away all the shooting aspect of the game and give you just a camera, change the genre to a investigation game, and it still be damn good.\n\nGame play wise, it's an evolution to the Bioshock series, meaning guns + special attacks/vigors. You can probably finnish with just the gun part, but the vigors are a good help.\n\nWhere this game shines however is you sidekick: Elizabeth. She helps you every step of the way, se gives you insight on the maps, she even finds things for you. And the best part she reacts to events around you: disgust when you execute an enemy, surprise when she finds things, angry when you do something that she doesn't like, happiness when she does things she likes. Without her, I don't think that the end result would be this good.\nYou really have to play it to experience it.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?

I just say that this game had a lot of potential to be a lot better. \n\nFirstly, in this game the story is a big deal, since there are plot twists, a lot of mystery around the main characters, which is the main driving factor to continue through the game. The way the story is presented will leave you with many questions as the game progresses, but does not answer all of them. The best experience would probably be the 2nd run, because there are so many little story hints and details scattered everywhere, that you will not have any idea what to link to on your 1st run. Either way, if you do not get attached to the story you may not mind the unanswered questions, gaps, and out of place fantasy elements the story has.\n\nSecondly, the gameplay is between fun, frustrating and repetitive. The frustration could be completely eliminated by either letting you carry more ammo, or 3 guns instead of 2. It is repetitive when you face enemies doorway after doorway, and you mostly use the same tactic to defeat them. Also a bit in the repetitive side, is the need to loot in order to obtain ammo, money, and upgrades. There are many rooms and sections from where you can loot, if you are the type of person that do not like to miss an upgrade, you will spend half of the game scavenging. \n\nThirdly, Elizabeth. If you have seen trailers from like 2 years ago, you will be disappointed. You are probably expecting a character that can interact with you dynamically and in interesting ways. But what you get here is an AI that follows you around, makes some meaningless comments about random objects in the background, and throws you objects when you need them. It is just the same as any other game, no breakthroughs here.\n\nLast, but not least. The graphics and art. Well, this game is very good in this aspect. A lot of detail and beautiful landscapes. For me it does not make up for the cons, but well, if you take this away you may not even consider this a good game anymore.\n\nThere are some other annoyances like being presented with choices that do not affect the game at all, constantly facing racism, high class vs low class and religion brainwashing speeches, but they are tied to the story and to the context Ken Levine wanted to create for his game about Quantum Physics.\n\nIn summary, Quantum Physics + Attempt to create charismatic companion + Random Context + Great Graphics and Art = Bioshock Infinite","timestamp_created":1390769597,"timestamp_updated":1390779316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8860867","author":{"steamid":"76561198057619897","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":523,"last_played":1396117961},"language":"english","review":"I really enjoyed this game, I love games that have a deep story and twists and turns, especialy the ending that just completely screws with your head.

I really thought the game was beautiful, had great sound design, refreshing combat elements and a good story. Where Bioshock 1 really sold me was the twist in the story making it one of my favorite games of all time Bioshock Infinite kind of left me dissapointed. I thought the ending was a little bit jumbled and the narrative could have been told in a tighter package. The middle section of the campaign felt tedious and became reptitive. However the 1/3 and the last third of the game was amazing. I would highly recommend this game over a vast majority of the games out there.

С одной стороны это плюс, так как сохраняется оригинальная озвучка и игра актеров, но с другой стороны, часто бывает не возможно полностью прочитать субтитры или в пыла боя нет возможности вникать в них.

Здесь нет ничего лишнего — ни «приклеенной» RPG-составляющей, ни надуманных сюжетных поворотов. Геймплей, сценарий, графика, музыка в синхронном звучании создают поистине потрясающую стимпанковскую атмосферу. Когда ты проходишь по солнечным улицам парящей над небесным сводом Колумбии, слышишь приятную музыку, раздающуюся из каждого радиоустройства, подбираешь всякую дребедень, а твои действия сопровождаются характерным «биошоковским» треском и хрустом, то понимаешь, что мир Infinite совершенно уникален, и одно лишь нахождение в нем становится настоящим праздником.\n\nДизайнеры уровней проделали, не побоюсь этого слова, грандиозную работу. Внешний облик Колумбии заставит трепетать сердца даже самых притязательных любителей графики. Локации разнообразны, декорации на протяжении всего прохождения постоянно меняются, каждый квадратный метр города полон каких-то мелких деталей. Хочется ходить по этому миру, заглядывая в каждый закоулок, слушая все диалоги случайных прохожих, просматривая наборы забавных картинок в каждом кинетоскопе.\n\nНемаловажную роль в погружении в мир играют аудиозаписи, повсюду разбросанные жителями города и главными действующими лицами. Помимо всего прочего, они позволяют лучше понять местный сюжет, разговор о котором достоин отдельной статьи.\n\nСценарий BioShock Infinite поначалу кажется в меру банальным и не слишком выдающимся — мистер Букер Девитт отправляется в летающий город Колумбию, чтобы найти и вернуть на землю бренную некую загадочную девушку Элизабет. На деле же сюжет оказывается сложной мозаикой, сложить которую предстоит игроку. Он чем-то напоминает фильмы Дэвида Линча (David Lynch) — ткань повествования разорвана, последовательность событий нарушена, и лишь концовка, сначала озадачивающая и приводящая в священный трепет, дает ключ к разгадке.\n\nВопреки нашим ожиданиям, финал один — изредка встречающиеся возможности выбора в конечном итоге ни на что не влияют. Однако скажите: насколько часто развязка игры заставляла вас часами вспоминать все детали сюжета, долгими мыслительными спекуляциями пытаться закрыть бреши и желать повторного прохождения — более внимательного, неспешного и вдумчивого? Сюжет BioShock Infinite никого не оставит равнодушным — после финала вас ожидает или длительный сеанс самостоятельного мозгового штурма в поисках ответов, или кратковременный серфинг по фанатским форумам. В центре истории оказывается традиционная психоаналитическая проблематика внутреннего конфликта и вытеснения. Правильно обыгранная и встроенная в повествование, она придает Infinite особый драматический привкус и настраивает на философские размышления.\n\nСюжет изобилует всеми самыми удачными фишками научно-популярного жанра. Здесь найдется место и параллельным вселенным, и квантовым парадоксам, и путешествиям во времени. Что очень важно, все эти модные вкрапления ничуть не смотрятся вычурно — конечная картина происходящего в игре оправдывает наличие «мистических» элементов.\n\nНичто в Infinite не болтается никому не нужным придатком, не вызывает раздражения или скуки. То же самое касается и RPG-составляющей BioShock. «Прокачке» подлежит все: как оружие и способности Девитта, так и его постоянные характеристики — максимальный уровень здоровья, щита и запаса соли. Помимо этого, Букер может надеть на себя одновременно четыре предмета одежды, которые дарят герою различные бонусы. Важность «апгрейдов» ощущаешь достаточно сильно — двадцать пять процентов дополнительного урона у дробовика или усиление какого-нибудь энергетика существенно сказываются на игровом процессе. Все это добро стоит немалых денег, так что по мере прохождения удастся реализовать далеко не все возможности роста главного героя. Чувство постоянного материального дефицита дает дополнительный стимул к обыску трупов противников и предметов интерьера. В свободное от боев время передвижения Девитта по Колумбии превращаются в сплошной «шуршащий» сбор всего, что плохо лежит.\n\nПлюсы: потрясающий дизайн; захватывающая атмосфера; интересный сюжет; продуманные образы персонажей; динамичные перестрелки; прекрасная Элизабет.\nМинусы: Вам не стыдно сюда смотреть?\n\nОЦЕНКА: 10/10","timestamp_created":1390718277,"timestamp_updated":1390768607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533161461353302002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8851482","author":{"steamid":"76561198015890344","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1842,"last_played":1386466671},"language":"english","review":"Amazing storyline.

The depth of the games story mixed with the religious and racial extremist outlook, creates a familiar and uncomfortable yet beleivable fictional setting. \nColumbia itself is gorgeous and squeeky clean all the way down to its enhabitants. The Skylines offer a quick and versitile way to travel and see the city's scope, and offers interesting and varied mechanics to keep each fight fresh and exciting.\nThe heavy hitter enemy types are just that, and whilst I'm personally pershall to the Big Daddy enemies of the first 2 games, these mechanical giants offer a fair fight and have unique weaknesses making them a flawed but exciting force to be reckoned with.\nMy only gripe, and this is a push, is the combat itself. There's just too much of it in my opinion. The story is so deep and its somewhat disjointed, even more than it should be, by the uncomfortable brick wall some of the combat becomes. Minus the odd backtracking video game trait, which in this works from a story perspective, it flows so well that the combat is often both jatting and forced.\nThe difficulty isn't a smooth curve either, but once you learn how to affectively utilise your vigors and weapons in conjuntion with one another, and find a nice 1-2 punch for the majority of enemies then it never becomes too challenging. This is both a posative and a negative. I would prefer less, but more intense fights with more of a focus on pulling you out of your comfort zone as I beat the game blind on 1999 mode with only 3-4 deaths in the last sections. \nOverall, this is a fantastic single player game, the DLC is superb and whilst the story DLC is short, perfecting the CItC challenges is tough and rewarding as is most of the game's fights with larger enemies. \nHighly recommend to series veterans and new comers  alike, though a trip to Rapture would be wise as its heavily referenced in a few sequences and is not so subtle with some larger scenes and cameos. \nTLDR: Buy it!","timestamp_created":1390691629,"timestamp_updated":1390691900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8848339","author":{"steamid":"76561198001042907","num_games_owned":383,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":964,"last_played":1398852454},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная графика в стиле Steampunk.\nОригинальный летающий город, населённый странными людьми.\nНебольшой выбор оружия компенсируется несколькими разнообразными \"энергетиками\"-заклинаниями.\nНевнятный сюжет по ходу игры в конце разворачивается в отличную историю с открытым финалом.","timestamp_created":1390690207,"timestamp_updated":1391097846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8848168","author":{"steamid":"76561198043386921","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":549,"last_played":1390958720},"language":"english","review":"this game is absolutely one of the BEST/AMAZING/THRILLING games i have ever played in my life","timestamp_created":1390689276,"timestamp_updated":1390689276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8847682","author":{"steamid":"76561198094217220","num_games_owned":293,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1661,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1431284897},"language":"english","review":"Amazing","timestamp_created":1390686512,"timestamp_updated":1390686512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520958065986633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8847649","author":{"steamid":"76561198093518157","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1580,"last_played":1472273788},"language":"english","review":"I fell in love with Infinite on the first playtrough, much of this coming from my pretentious love of a fantastic story in games, and Infinite excels in that aspects.

Un je ne sais quoi qui flotte dans l'air et qui promet une expérience hors des sentiers battus. Bioshock Infinite fait partie de ces jeux.\n\nA peine arrivé sur Columbia, on se rend immédiatement compte de la richesse de l'univers crée. L'univers est riche, détaillé et on a qu'une envie, flâner dans les rues de cette cité volante. Mais pas le temps de rêvasser, il faut trouver la mystérieuse Elizabeth. Si à la base, la ramener servira à effacer les dettes de Booker De Witt, il s'avèrera rapidement que la jeune fille a plus d'importance qu'escompté. Fuir Columbia avec la demoiselle sera alors l'occasion de multiplier les scènes épiques où la contemplation de l'environnement laisse place aux combats nerveux. Pour gérer les ennemis qui voudraient entraver notre départ la cité flottante, Booker pourra utiliser des armes classiques mais aussi et surtout les Toniques, ces pouvoirs à utiliser appropriées en fonction des situations rencontrées. Est-ce que tout cela suffira pour que Booker et Elizabeth quittent l'utopie volante ? A vous de voir.\n\nAu final, le seul point négatif du jeu est sa fin. Non pas qu'elle soit mauvaise, loin de là, mais cela signifie notre odyssée aérienne se termine. Car une fois que le générique arrive on quitte Columbia avec des sentiments ambivalents. On est tout d'abord triste de quitter cette expérience mémorable qui se sera appuyée sur un univers d'une richesse rare aussi bien sur le fond que sur la forme ou la religion côtoie la politique et l'idéologie, le fanatisme. On est ensuite heureux, heureux d'avoir vécu une expérience aussi riche et forte, heureux d'avoir croisé la route d'Elizabeth et de Booker.

She doesn't get in the way, doesn't steal your kills, gives you stuff that you need, and obeys your orders without a second thought.\n\nWhat really makes Infinite shine is its story.
