на века полный моря недостатков; сюжет не идеален, не всегда строен и достаточно наивен порой, но как сильно он может бить по эмоциям, мама не горюй. Графен, боже упаси. Эти розы на каждом кусте никогда не приму, но стиль, стиль решает все. Работа со светом, музыкой, звуком, диалогами, все прекрасно. Выбор слов, которые говорят персонажи, порой, вызывают мурашки, а концовка просто бомба. Несовершенная шутерная составляющая, конечно, может сильно задолбать, особенно в финальной битве, где уже нет никакого желания продираться через месево врагов и отсутствие хоть какого-то импакта от стрельбы по ним, оставляющей после себя какое-то фрустрирующее огорчение. Энергетиков много, оружия много, и все это разнообразие просто ни к чему. Хорошо еще есть ачивки, а то многие механики игры я так и не увидел бы, потому что их все пробовать даже и не хочется. Но Кен Левин сделал куда больше для всей индустрии, чем просто пару несовершенных игр с хорошими идеями, но скудной реализацией. Он вдохновил многих разработчиков использовать его идеи и архетипы геймплея и сюжетов, чтобы у нас было много куда более совершенных, чем его, игр, от тех же Аркейн.

This games covers topics ranging from class struggles to the idea of parallel universes. I have played through the game enough times to get all of the achievements and still come back to play through it again. It is so much fun getting to run through and experience Columbia over and over again. The different locations are detailed and interesting to explore. This game also includes a dlc arcade style game Clash in the Clouds and then two smaller campaigns, Burial at Sea Episodes 1 and 2. I personally find that Burial at Sea is a decent standalone experience and a nice reference to the first BioShock games. CitC is fun to go through once but doing all the blue ribbon challenges to 100% the game blows.

Pourquoi ? Au vu des tests et commentaires dithyrambiques je m'attendais à un chef d'oeuvre. Force est de constater que je suis très déçu. Je suis allé au bout par principe. \n\nOui, comme vous pouvez lire ça et là, l'histoire est sympa sans être extraordinaire. L'intrigue abuse de la carotte et du bâton. C'est utilisé à outrance dans le scénario et on a vite fait de le remarquer et de s'en lasser. Je le classerai dans les Visual Novels moyens. \n\nCôté fun, c'est juste horrible. C'est soit un FPS nul et ultra-répétitif (mêmes ennemis, environnements, patterns, etc.) soit un jeu d'exploration à la première personne et là, on fait rigoureusement la même chose de la 5ième minute à la dernière heure: fouiller des tiroirs et trouver des crochets. \n\nIl plait parce que les choix de départ des développeurs sont bons mais passé le cap du début, terminé, la magie n'opère plus. Entendons nous bien, ce n'est pas un mauvais jeu mais certainement pas un jeu qui vaut 30€ sur Steam. Pour moi, c'est un petit jeu sympa.
