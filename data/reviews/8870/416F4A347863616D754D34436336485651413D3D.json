Once you get past the first fifteen minutes and the wow factor is out of the way, you're left spending the rest of the game trawling through samey looking locations and very linear action.  One of the strong points of Bioshock was undoubtedly it's setting.  Rapture was a captivating and unique environment to explore.  Columbia is, well... lacking.  I stuck with it for the supposed remarkable twist ending, which in fairness is very good, but the journey there was hardly thrilling.  Only being able to wield two guns was a complete pain in the rear.\n\nI personally found Bioshock Infinite to be a hollow experience, style over substance.  When you find yourself in Columbia for the first time and begin to explore, you'll be thinking that this is going to be something REALLY special.  Ten hours later however, when you have killed the same enemies for the zillionth time, looked at the same buildings, rode the same rails, and played through essentially the same action sequences over and over the gloss tends to wear off.","timestamp_created":1436735500,"timestamp_updated":1436735500,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499092578887939453","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17015047","author":{"steamid":"76561198023229018","num_games_owned":239,"num_reviews":113,"playtime_forever":899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":899,"last_played":1436728157},"language":"spanish","review":"Visualmente y artisticamente es un juego muy especial, muy bonito en el sentido mas completo de la palabra, la historia es profundísima, tal vez hasta desmasiado para un shooter al fin y al cabo, para mí podría tener un poco más de acción y menos tramas y tomas de historia en forma de video en primera persona.

Die Story des Spiels ist sehr gut, aber WIE die Geschichte erzählt wird ist der Hammer! Geht man nur durch die Hauptstory ohne die Welt zu erforschen, weiß man um was es geht, versteht es einigermaßen und man trifft auf verschiedene Leute. Wenn man aber die Welt erforscht, kann man Sprachaufzeichnungen von besagten Leuten finden und erfährt so auch die Geschichte dieser Leute.\nNeben der Story und dem Aufbau des Spiels muss ich noch die Musik loben. Es handelt sich dabei vorallem um Musik aus den 50ern.\nDie Atmosphäre des Spiels ist sehr dicht und so hat man nie das Gefühl, nur von einem Punkt zum anderen zu rennen.\nEiner der wichtigsten Punkte in diesem Spiel ist für mich der Twist am Ende des Spiels. *Gänsehautfeeling*\nInsgesamt hat mir Bioshock Infinite super gefallen und ich habe daraufhin auch Bioshock und die DLC von Bioshock Infinite gespielt. Wer jedoch noch keinen Bioshock-Teil gespielt hat, dem würde ich empfehlen zuerst den ersten Teil zu spielen. Auch dieser hat einen Twist in der Geschichte, den ich aber nicht ganz so mitreißend fand, wie den von Bioshock Infinite.\nEin negativer Aspekt des Spiels ist, dass die Story (vor allem gegen Ende hin) sehr kompliziert wird. So habe ich das Ende gespielt, hab mir eine Erklärung im Internet gesucht, hab das Ende nochmal gespielt und hab die Erklärung nochmal durchgelesen.\nGanz wichtig ist, dass man die DLC von Bioshock Infinite \"Seebestattung 1+2\" erst nach Bioshock 1 und Bioshock Infinite spielt.\nInsgesamt glaube ich ist Bioshock Infinite, oder Bioshock im Allgemeinen, für all jene etwas, die bei Spielen auf eine gute Story und eine erforschbare und dennoch überschaubare Welt setzen.\nFür mich ist Bioshock Infinite das beste Spiel der Reihe.","timestamp_created":1436608492,"timestamp_updated":1436608715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16989639","author":{"steamid":"76561198044628878","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":1914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":679,"last_played":1603951723},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏情节非常魔幻 画面宏大 有很多非常有的技能 射击做的很质感","timestamp_created":1436607103,"timestamp_updated":1436607103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16989617","author":{"steamid":"76561198178798239","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":569,"last_played":1446186380},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกมากครับเนื้อเรื่องดี(แม้ยังเล่นไม่จบก็เหอะ)เพื่อนแนะนำก็เลยเล่น1000/10","timestamp_created":1436606964,"timestamp_updated":1436606964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16987148","author":{"steamid":"76561198059371275","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":811,"last_played":1437454366},"language":"spanish","review":"-Booker......¿Tienes miedo de Dios?\n-No, Pero tu si me das miedo\n100/10","timestamp_created":1436590554,"timestamp_updated":1436590554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16987044","author":{"steamid":"76561198029319471","num_games_owned":332,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1079,"last_played":1536815203},"language":"english","review":"First of all, this game is a mixed bag.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty solid and fun to get into action, yet the upgrade system is awfully one sided. The more you die, the less money you have to upgrade items and then do worse in combat. The burstgun was pretty much impossible to use if you didnt have a damage upgrade for it. Each weapon has its own \"Vox\" counterpart which is pretty much a reskin which some few minor changes. Although I prefer the \"Vox\" weapons, they came pretty far into the game (about halfway) and they seem to just be few and far between; especially the explosive variants.\n\nThe story is god awful; it may have started ok, but Jesus Christ that climax, ending, and \"reveal\" were so fucking awful. The writers rewrote the original Bioshock plotline and practically stomped on the original material. Don't get me started on the DLC. You'd think that if you went back to Rapture you'd work with what was originally given, right? NOPE. The DLC Burial at Sea takes the special wonder of the first games and writes them off as. \"Oh, the things that happened in Bioshock One and Two was special right? Nope, everything is different. Thank you for your money, you shit.\"\n\nOver-all: Good gameplay, disapointing story.\nIf you want a better game: go play Bioshock Two for gameplay or One for story.\nIgnore this shined up turd if you don't want mediocracy.","timestamp_created":1436589854,"timestamp_updated":1436589854,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47962614893913269","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16986040","author":{"steamid":"76561198122565188","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1375,"last_played":1437165021},"language":"spanish","review":"20/10!!!!!

She can take care of herself and she'll help you too when you're in fire-fights, so you don't have to worry about her. She's really well done as a character, imo. Her voice-acting, animations, emotional expressions and attitude ring well with Booker DeWitt (The main character you play). \nYou also don't need to have played the first two Bioshock games that came out before. There's a reason why they didn't call this game Bioshock 3, because 1 or 2 doesn't lead to this game. It does have a few relative story elements however. The DLC's Burial At Sea are okay. They bring back more of the creepy and scary elements from the first two games. I'd suggest you beat this main game before playing Burial At Sea.\nIf I were to rate this game: Gameplay 7.5 out of 10. Story 11 out of 10. I have not been this impressed with a video game story to date. It's refreshing to know that they're still making video games with mind-blowing stories. Good job Bioshock Infinite.

Дальше тем, кто еще не прошел игру, читать рецензию не советую (кроме разве что последнего абзаца).\n\nВсе началось в лифте, когда Соловей похитил у меня Элизабет. Я всеми силами пытался удержать ее и защитить, но своими механическими когтям он вырвал ее у меня, и унес к облакам. Потом я бежал за ней по мосту времени, и попал в сюрреалистическую психиатрическую лечебницу с людьми из которых выкачали всю душу, и которыми управляют жуткие существа-сирены. Там я услышал ее крики, слышал что ее пытали, чувствовал ее боль. С какой же силой я пытался найти ее и спасти, с какой яростью пробивался к ней сквозь этих бездушных существ. Но это оказались лишь магнитофонные записи с ее голосом. Что это за записи? Почему она кричит от боли?!! Где она? Где я? Что вообще черт возьми происходит!!!? Но времени нет, надо скорее найти ее. Сражаться, умереть если придется, но спасти Элизабет. И наконец, когда я нашел ее мне открылась жуткая и ошеломляющая картина; ночь, пылающий пламенем город внизу, звуки сирены, взрывы, крики, смерть повсюду... и предо мной стояла Она, отстраненно взирая на все это, только не той какой она была еще совсем недавно, а старая, изможденная и совершенно опустошенная. И она говорит мне, что она не справилась, что ее пытали и заставили, что я должен вернуться и спасти ее. Но я не успеваю ничего понять, как я уже стою на красном бархатном ковре, а все вокруг заливает яркий солнечный свет, и в его лучах мерцает пыль, а из патефона рядом играет беззаботная мелодия. Что это было??! Но вот я уже бегу по коридору и в этот раз, я точно слышу ее настоящий голос, она кричит от боли и ужаса. Я добегаю до чудовищ которые мучают ее, и с пронзающей всего меня ненавистью, убиваю их, убиваю их всех, не щадя никого. И наконец я увидел ее, она была привязанна к креслу в окружение шприцов и других инструментов для пыток.Такая хрупкая и беззащитная....  Столько боли и страха было на ее изможденном и прекрасном лице.... Почему я не смог спасти ее раньше, почему...и все же я спас ее. Но меня не покидала мысль, что это другая Элизабет, а ту Элизабет я так и не смог спасти, и от осознания этого, режущая боль пронизывала все сердце... но нам надо было идти дальше.\n\nКак-то так. В тот момент казалось что мир игры это единственно реальный мир. Но это было не то тупое чувство, когда ты просто погружен в процесс игры и забываешь есть, пить и спать. А именно переживание мира игры, как единственно реально существующего в данный момент. \n\nЕсли говорить о недостатках, то главный минус это непосредственно сами сражения, их слишком много и они весьма примитивны, что портит общую атмосферу, лучше бы их было меньше, и они были более изящны и реалистичны. Еще из минусов, можно отметить второстепенных персонажей, и простых обитателей Колумбии, все они какие-то неживые и плоские, при этом Элизабет на их фоне смотрится еще более живой и настоящей, а все остальное будто лишь сон который снится нам обоим...но при этом игра насыщена таким количеством запоминающихся и ярких событий, что эта пара недостатков не столь существенны. Ведь было столько всего: и полеты на рельсах между парящими островами, и прогулка с Элизабет по пляжу посреди облаков, и даже революция, а после нее угнетаемые сами стали угнетателями, прямо как в жизни. И наконец откровение, о том, что я сам во всем виноват, а потом удивительное путешествие по маякам параллельных миров. И вот наконец все они собрались вокруг меня и прощаются, а потом мой последний вздох...\n\nЯ играл в эту игру больше двух лет назад. И сейчас пониманию, что до сих пор нахожусь под сильным впечатлением от нее. И что Она запала мне в самое сердце. И вот вновь устанавливая игру я чувствую странную тревогу и беспокойство, думаю может быть лучше не играть снова, и оставить эти воспоминания и переживания как они есть. Но при этом так хочется сыграть (прожить?) это удивительное приключение вновь. Интересно как Она там? А облака все так же красивы? А пространство и время все также запутанно и закручено...\n\nЭто действительно одна из очень немногих игр которую можно назвать искусством.","timestamp_created":1436429447,"timestamp_updated":1542834349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.680511713027954102","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16954590","author":{"steamid":"76561198027502932","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1730,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1730,"last_played":1404655167},"language":"english","review":"This game is an odd one; it's both excellent and grossly overrated. Is it worth playing? Of course. The gameplay is great fun, with satisfying combat and RPG elements that are light enough to feel easy but involved enough that you actually consider your options. As per franchise standard, the setting is well-realised and provides plenty of cultural curiousity. The plot, for the most part, is engaging, and the AI companion plays of the protagonist well in conversation and combat.\n\nSo why is it overrated? Two major reasons; Elizabeth's character, and the ending. Unmarked spoilers ahoy.\n\nElizabeth was quickly compared to Alyx from the Half-Life series for no other reason that she was a female companion in a first person shooter, and that she actually had a role in the story. However, Elizabeth is nothing like the strong, proactive, independant Alyx.\n\nFor one, all of Elizabeth's abilities are handed to her by the game's Reality-bending \"science\" (magic); all of her agency comes from this gift, as does all of her relevance. The protagonist (or, more specifically, his employers) care about her for her magic, the villain cares about her for her magic, and the plot only cares about her for the magic too. Unlike Alyx, she doesn't earn her relevance.\n\nSecondly, she's a step backwards in terms of female stereotypes. For starters her design is highly sexualised; big eyes, girly mannerisms, and a tendancy to revolve around the player (in combat, literally). Alyx, or even Eleanor from Bioshock 2, forge their own paths through the world, and rescue the male protagonist as many times as he rescues her through their own ingenuity. They're equals, in combat and in relevance. Elizabeth is not an equal. In combat she hides, occasionally supporting the player with ammo and magic. In the plot, she spends the entire game either as a lab experiment, sidekick, or a damsel in distress. The ending gives her agency, sure, but even then only in regards to the protagonist's journey and only due to her gifts.\n\nShe's likeable, sure, but the game spends an extended beach sequence ramming her \"carefree spirit!\" through to the player, including a first person dancing sequence reminiscient of an old disney movie. I guess that's what she is: a disney princess, a damsel, a MacGuffin.\n\nAnd then let's talk about the ending. The game spends the first 3/4 of its plot building up three excellent elements: the city, with all its anachronistic wonder and hidden (or not so hidden) dark side, the revolutionary Vox Populii and all the fun tropes that come along with that, and a monstrous Songbird that continually curb-stomps the player throughout the game. All of this got me excited for an excellent plot resolution, and... the game said Nope.\n\nIn the last, extended sequence of the game, the player is told that none of that interesting stuff matters. The Vox Populii dissapear after a final siege, the Songbird is killed in a cutscene after a crappy reveal about musical notes, and the city fades into the background, revealed to be nothing but a set dressing. We're told that the only things that matter are the protagonists pre-game backstory and the bogus reality magic. The cool revolutionary plotline, the setup for a great final boss in the Songbird, an intruiging reveal involving the city itself rather than just its origin were all thrown in the trash in favour of a left-field M Night Shyamalan-level super-twist that took its cues from the generic time-travel-story handbook. And this twist lasts a ten minute cutscene-esque sequence that drew out the truth bombs like they'd invented the coolest twist ever. It was crap, and it let down the first 3/4 of the game. And before you ask, yes, I understood it all. \n\nSo Infinite is a good game, with a terrible ending and an overpraised female sidekick. Is it fun? Definitely. The first 3/4 of the game, where it focuses on the city and the revolution, are a blast to play, and Elizabeth is still serviceable as a vessal of exposition and foil to Booker. The DLC in Rapture continues with even more ridiculous reality magic, but while it's fun Elizabeth's extended story fades into silliness. Still, the gameplay is always solid right through the DLC, so if you're a fan of Bioshock 1/2 or First Person shooters this game is still worth your time.\n\nIf only the ending used the fun setup of the early game instead of trying to out-twist itself.","timestamp_created":1436428393,"timestamp_updated":1436428393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16954410","author":{"steamid":"76561198076044587","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1349,"last_played":1559362596},"language":"schinese","review":"good","timestamp_created":1436427086,"timestamp_updated":1436427086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16952578","author":{"steamid":"76561198039401451","num_games_owned":310,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1772,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":611,"last_played":1474153083},"language":"english","review":"This is a great game.
