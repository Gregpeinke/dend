It gives the player a wealth of tools and weapons and constantly promotes the utilization of these through well designed combat scenarios. It also builds off of the first games bare bones narrative with memorable, bright characters and a clear-cut antagonist along with a much more substantial world that is constantly telling the story about the Combines effect on City 17 along with the war that rages on in it. But while Half-Life 2 is great it isn't perfect, not every weapon is as creative or interesting as the last, NPC's very often block your path which was not only frustrating but it felt like at times it ruined the smooth pacing of the game, the soundtrack has a cool vibe that sounds like it came right out of a blockbuster heist movie and fits the tone of the game very well however felt quite unmemorable. Yet Half-Life 2 has stood the test of time very well and even holds a torch to today's best shooters.

It also fixes a lot of the issues with the first Half-Life. For instance, I absolutely hated the platforming sections that you play through on Xen. Some of the jumping mechanics in the game were just annoying and I think that was just Valve's way of trying to vary the gameplay between just shooting enemies and have some \"puzzle\" sections in the game. This game also relies on you being able to solve certain puzzles, but they rely more heavily on physics and often times, instead of being irritating, they are actually quite fun and relatively easy to solve. Most of the time it relies on picking up weighted items and placing them on a platform. The gunplay is better than the first Half-Life as well. In the first game, it sometimes felt as though shooting an enemy in the head didn't kill them right away. In this game, you really feel the power of your weapons depending on where you aim. Also, the head crabs are far less irritating and easier to shoot. All of this isn't to say that the first game was bad by any means. It was great and revolutionary for its time.\n\nThe graphics are obviously quite dated, considering that I am posting this review in July of 2020 and this game came out 16 years ago. However, I would say that they still hold up and physics engines haven't necessarily had to advance far beyond the one that is present in this game. After all, the Havoc physics engine that was used in this game is still being used in many games today. The graphics actually still kind of hold up. It is forgiving to note some of the bland textures and character models based on the time at which this game was released. This was the same year Doom 3 was released and was the beginning of a new era of game graphics. I would say the Valve did a particularly great job at the time. Assuming that you are capable of running this game with most of the graphical features turned on, the lighting is fairly responsive to changes in conditions, such as when you shine your flashlight on a character or object. Also, the water reflections are quite gorgeous and actually look better than some games I have seen that came out last year. \n\nI didn't actually get to play this game back when it was released. At the time, you needed a pretty beefy computer to run it and even a 256MB dedicated video card was not the cheapest thing to come by back in 2004. So, I waited for the XBOX version of the game to be released and played it instead. I will say that this game was definitely meant for PC. Although I have it installed, I tend to play it more often through GeForce Now because it steams pretty well and by default the graphics settings are set to the highest. I later played the game again on XBOX 360 when The Orange Box was released, but again, the graphics settings and playing with a controller were not nearly as good as being able to see the game how the developers intended and also aiming with a mouse feels so much more responsive and satisfying. I think it is really what Valve intended. \n\nI think that I bought this game on sale for $1.99 and that is an absolute steal for this game. It also came with The Lost Coast, which I haven't played yet because I am still playing through the main campaign. If you haven't played this game or even just played it on a console, I can't recommend this game highly enough.

 這東西比槍還好用啊~\"[/h1]\n這款是經典中的經典, 網路上的評論多到炸裂, 畢竟也是出了超過15年的神作, 近期才開始仔細體驗這部作品, 被稱為經典中的經典確實有它的道理。最優先該提到的就是物體互動, 雖然以現代的物理引擎很常見, 但以當時的技術來說可是創世之舉, 大大開拓了遊戲世界的可能性, 目前很多VR互動遊戲老祖宗就是這部了; 但讓玩家能體驗到物體互動的可能性得就屬遊戲中的重力槍了, 基本上非太大型的物體都能由重力槍吸起並投射, 到遊戲後期甚至連有機體也能吸, 而且投射後是有傷害的, 且傷害與物體的大小成正比, 說實在除非某些特殊敵人, 不然重力槍就是你最好的夥伴, 比起一路上尋覓子彈, 尋找可以投射的物品反而更重要了, 這也是讓這款遊戲在控制基礎上就與其他第一人稱射擊遊戲有明顯的區分, 不得不說不愧是Valve啊。\n\n[h1]\"Yamero!! 不要再往我頭上交配了\"[/h1]\n筆者並沒有玩過前作, 以劇情的接續性來說, 遠遠的不足, 因此對於遊戲中提到前作的事件和遇到的故人完全沒有頭緒, 也沒有類似的文件或參考可以知悉, 還得上網查詢這點真的非常可惜。就一開始被追殺時只覺得是一般的FPS遊戲, 沒想到到劇情中後期開始出現大量怪物, 食腦蟲, 殭屍, 藤壺怪, 雖然對比現在的恐怖遊戲畫面差了一些, 但配上配樂, 場景, 以及惡意的出怪處, 營造的緊張和恐怖感完全不輸一般的恐怖遊戲。然而遊戲中最常碰到的還是合成人軍隊, 一狗票一起來就算了, 當碰到大型機具像是砲艇及長腳蜘蛛, 壓力實在是很大, 尤其是高難度下, 探頭出去沒兩秒就直接升天了, 作唯一些關卡的頭目, 著實夠格為需要多次挑戰的難關。\n\n[h1]\"跟隨弗里曼!!\"[/h1]\n在遊戲中有幾段會有反抗軍跟隨主角, 但畢竟是早期的遊戲, AI不是很聰明, 基本上只會尋找旁邊的掩蔽物, 變成如果要讓他們續命的話只能快速擊殺敵人或找尋大片遮蔽物讓他們能自己掩護。另外遊戲中也會碰上不少解謎關卡, 都不會太困難, 基本上讓玩家感受Valve物理引擎的力量。成就部分, 大部分都屬於劇情必得, 只有額外特定擊殺與尋找補給處比較需要花費一些心力。所以雖然本作是FPS遊戲, 但加入了不少其他元素, 讓這部成為經典中的經典也毫無令人意外, 甚至拿到現代標準檢視都能拿個不錯的成績。\n\n\n*總體: B+\n*故事劇情: A\n*畫面呈現: B+\n*音樂/音效/語音: A-\n*角色塑造: C+\n*操作: A+\n*周回性: B-\n*成就達成性: B+\n*恐怖感: A-","timestamp_created":1595390401,"timestamp_updated":1595390706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73093380","author":{"steamid":"76561199014754490","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":697,"last_played":1659587407},"language":"english","review":"this game is one of the if not the best game on steam after playing the first the second one blew me away with it's story and scenery","timestamp_created":1595390233,"timestamp_updated":1595390233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73092881","author":{"steamid":"76561198975071379","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":375,"last_played":1647581280},"language":"english","review":"i like the part where they say shet","timestamp_created":1595389260,"timestamp_updated":1596586773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73092752","author":{"steamid":"76561198170116383","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1625,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1625,"last_played":1594941772},"language":"english","review":"It's pretty fun.","timestamp_created":1595389034,"timestamp_updated":1595389034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73090743","author":{"steamid":"76561199039366017","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":8902,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1220,"last_played":1655590641},"language":"english","review":"good\n","timestamp_created":1595385495,"timestamp_updated":1595385495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73090461","author":{"steamid":"76561198165248026","num_games_owned":384,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":802,"last_played":1595410293},"language":"english","review":"6 chapters full of shitty 2 hour driving sections that are boring as shit and with shitty ass gunships that require 50 rockets to destroy and these fucks appear every 30 mins in one section of the game\n\noverrated and overhyped af","timestamp_created":1595384982,"timestamp_updated":1595473876,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":"0.377848267555236816","comment_count":17,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73090275","author":{"steamid":"76561198198158923","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":5119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4240,"last_played":1657837920},"language":"english","review":"HEY!
