The gunplay, level designs and enemies are already enough to make it a triple A title game. But the story just makes it so much more amazing. The story is delivered and executed perfectly with the cutscenes and an absolute magnificent voice performance by the voice actors. The unravelling backstories of each character is just perfect giving the player an actual sense of pity, joy and anger towards them and making it truly real. In the end, you WILL miss this game and it's absolute beauty.\n\nAs a personal note of praise, after I finished the game i had a lapse for about 2 days of where I could not think of anything else except this game and could not properly do anything else for a while. This is the only other game that has ever done this to me besides MGS V. Although I was deeply saddened by the fact this is the last of the franchise and Irrational Games confirmed it, I take peace that it ended on such a masterpiece. This game and franchise shall and always have a special place in my heart  and will go down in history and one of the greatest game franchises in the world and will be remember throughout the ages.","timestamp_created":1562315975,"timestamp_updated":1587483941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53631207","author":{"steamid":"76561198929359923","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":126,"last_played":1628869228},"language":"russian","review":"Красота","timestamp_created":1562315466,"timestamp_updated":1562315466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53631099","author":{"steamid":"76561198162353602","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":768,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":752,"last_played":1615879143},"language":"english","review":"I love this game","timestamp_created":1562315383,"timestamp_updated":1562315383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53627951","author":{"steamid":"76561198445244590","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":743,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":316,"last_played":1638097259},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра, интересный сюжет, неплохая графика, как по мне так это лучшая часть из всех !","timestamp_created":1562313093,"timestamp_updated":1562313093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53627556","author":{"steamid":"76561198446740572","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1060,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":508,"last_played":1567867948},"language":"schinese","review":"请问，这游戏玩着玩着突然画面卡住，并且无论如何屏幕只有游戏卡住时画面，只能关机重启电脑结束游戏，大家又遇到过吗？能解决这个问题吗？不要再说什么没有关闭输入法之类的了，我百分百关了。游戏是个好游戏，就是这个毛病叫人没法玩啊。","timestamp_created":1562312813,"timestamp_updated":1562312813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":33,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.797202229499816895","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53625975","author":{"steamid":"76561198362209963","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":534,"last_played":1508590304},"language":"english","review":"Excellent game.

[/b]\n\n生化奇兵无限在我心目中就是top3的作品，一部艺术品。\n\n[b] ①社会结构的构建；②设计师们的文化功底；③震撼的美工水平；④复杂的平行世界理论；⑤蒸汽朋克风格；⑥伊丽莎白！！！[/b]\n\n[b] 这就是游戏的艺术。 [/b]\n\n[i] “Booker,are you afraid of God?\" [/i]\n[i] \"No, I'm afraid of you\" [/i]\n\n[i]含可能的剧透！\t[/i]\n简单的来说，丰富的想象力和宏大的视觉效果，就很容易引人入胜。本作的几个代表元素：1主角（身世复杂，特别是被写进平行世界），2天空之城（代表上层人类的极端理念和控制欲），3宗教元素（几乎被大部分游戏都使用的背景主题，能巧妙的解释人们被洗脑（负面）或者拥有向往，憧憬（偏正面）的原因），4蒸汽朋克（蒸汽机钢铁机组成的不可思议的力量代表着人们的科技理想和制造力量，科幻浪漫主义？），5还有就是被用烂了的平行世界（本作却浓墨重彩的描绘了平行世界理论，在不断变化中，什么是一直在变的？什么是不变的？也是本作悲剧的来源。但无论如何，任何世界都没有“如果”，没有后悔药）天空之城“哥伦比亚”因为乌托邦式的人性的复杂和黑暗，这种幻想终究还是要被打回原形。\n\n从所谓的民主自由到对社会形态的批判。制作组在游戏中发表了他们对政府对意识形态的独特理解，也对民主和自由给出了自己的看法。当然这些都要依靠玩家自己去探索去发掘理解。而当玩家通关后，也一定会若有所思，明白这一切都是 意料之外，但是在情理之中。\n\n[b] 以下是游戏内容评测（不含剧透，可放心食用）[/b] \n\n[b] 游戏画面，10/10 [/b] 本作在画面十分惊艳，与前两作阴郁的海底都市不同,这次的游戏场景直接架构在云端之上，天空之城阳光明媚，满是虔诚的信徒与丛生的花草,随处可见蜂鸟欣然觅食，白鸽在坐落于云端的建筑群间翱翔,开发商为玩家营造了一副盎然的景象,与前两作那类阴森诡异的游戏体验完全不同。(场景很容易让人联想到梦工厂制作的动画)\n       引擎方面,本作使用了修改版虚幻3引擎制作,爆炸以及射击时的光影效果都属上乘,有更为丰富的物理效果,而且帧数比较足，相信PC版的表现会更为出色.\n      本作中有不少可以互动的细节,例如靠近水池可以放出伴着蒸汽的热水,火焰类的技能能够点燃场景内的烟火,美中不足的是，制造商或许为了渲染出天空城的盎然与晴朗,过渡地使用光影效果,使得一些露天场景的光芒实在过头.有些腻与刺眼，通过降低游戏亮度又会使部分室内场景过于昏暗.除了过份的光效外还有其它几处蛋疼的地方的,例如自始自终玩家不能从水里看到主角的倒影,仿佛这名勇闯天空城的主角是名透明人魔,仔细的话还能够发现水面波纹的贴图棱角,更离谱的是大白天的还能在草丛见到萤火虫.\n       当然细小的瑕疵并不会影响本作神作的潜质.\n\n[b] 游戏操作，9/10 [/b] 主人公右手持枪，左手释放技能，我在玩的时候总是习惯右键来开镜，所以总是被迫再切换下技能取消施法，然后瞄准也不能改侧键于是我改成了V键。游戏战斗风格血腥暴力，同时玩家也可以在游戏里不停上蹿下跳（锁链轨道），各种挂索飞行，包括和伊丽莎白的互动（交流，补助）因此游戏虽然为RPG，但是刷怪（面无表情冲向你）和某些场景都略有点恐怖，但实际战斗效果流畅爽快。\n\n[b] 游戏音效，8/10 [/b] 音效方面，新的动态混音系统，让空中之城无处不在的风声，群众交谈声，嘈杂熙攘声，战斗时的交火声和技能爆裂声也有了动态效果。音乐部分为整个游戏的灵魂所在，当时的天空城被极为盛行的美国优越主义所主导，城内随处播放着导游浓烈的爱国主义色彩的音乐。\n\n[b] 游戏风格，10/10 [/b] 互动频繁，可玩性很高。游戏中有很多收集要素和小游戏（建议玩家多扒一扒街边的垃圾桶）。热狗补充血量，汽水补充盐分，还有各种服装可拿。在任意难度下通关就会解锁1999模式，1999模式成倍增加了难度，你在游戏中可使用的金钱会直线下降（因此当你被杀时你就又得重玩一遍来增加金钱），减缓护盾的重新充能时间，并且敌人的伤害会增加。\n       还有哦，跑路很复杂，我喜欢把所有场景探一遍，所以玩的时候一直用导航键才能摸清具体的方向。战斗技能多种多样，玩家通过击倒不同属性的敌人可以获得相应的能力提升,而不同的能力也可以搭配使用,以达到最佳效果。\n\n[b] 伊丽莎白 [/b]游戏里最最最迷人的姑凉伊丽莎白很少离开你身边，而且不像这年头的大部分AI一样，她不需要你像某个游戏像个保姆似的看着她保护她。恰恰相反，她会好好照顾你，不顾战火丢给你子弹和治疗，用贩卖机还会朝你扔钱，甚至在战场你可以用她的次元传送能力帮你辅助战斗。在交火中，这种能力或许可以帮你轻易到达飞行的炮楼，掩体，重火力武器或者医药包。在游戏剧情中，会有一段离开她的时间，那时候，是我最焦躁最不安的一段时间。\n\n如果你以为这只是一部大叔拯救少女的俗套故事，那就大错特错了。如果你在游戏中仔细观察，就会发现制作者不遗余力的在游戏中大大小小的地方埋下一些有深意带暗指的文字。\n\n   而伊丽莎白自己事实上是整个故事的中心角色，也是时时刻刻的中心。当她决定和我一起行动时，只要有一小会儿不在，我就会注意到。这不仅仅是一种游戏设定，更是当她不在身边的时候，我真的会打从心眼里感到怅然若失。\n[spoiler]伊丽莎白小天使真的是有史以来最最最棒的AI队友，能及时给物资，给奶，不烦人，不粘人，不堵门，不卡模型。[/spoiler]\n\n\n[strike] 抒发情感时间到！ [/strike]\n\n在“Booker”把女儿赎给“Comstock”却又反悔的时候，这注定是一场悲剧，我用尽全力去赎罪，最后还是改变不了已经写好的最终结局。\n\n我痛苦过，我痛苦在致远星战到最后还是寡不敌众，失去整个殖民地，\n\n我后悔过，我后悔为什么不和幽灵直接离开找钱队而是听从军令去找谢菲尔德，\n\n而生化奇兵：无限是最让我难过和伤心的一部，\n“如果我知道我们去不了巴黎，我就不该把她拉出舞池”\n\n但我多希望既有个时间好好的带她逛完整个巴黎，也想让她在舞池里享受秋水共长天一色\n希望时间暂停在她和人们跟随欢快的音乐翩翩起舞的时刻，\n又希望时间暂停在欢快和喜悦洋溢在她美丽的脸庞的时刻，\n也许不应该把她从舞蹈中拉出来，也许我应该永远都不要跟她提起巴黎去完成那该死的任务。\n\n二刷的时候我在她拉住我手的那一刻截了张图，关闭了游戏，还是就让那一刻[b]成为永恒 [/b]吧  。\n\n\n[b]生化奇兵：无限，真的做到了前所未有的高度，告诉世人什么叫做美轮美奂。

worth buying.
