The maps and classes are good as well. The only problem that I have with the game is that they don't do major updates. Like a new class or a new gameplay mode or map. I like all the classes, my favorite class is Scout. So yeah you should get it if you are looking for a fun game that you will sink in and also play so many different maps in.

Philadelphia born and raised\nOn the playground was where I spent most of my days\nChillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool\nAnd all shooting some b-ball outside of the school\nWhen a couple of guys who were up to no good\nStarted making trouble in my neighborhood\nI got in one little fight and my mom got scared\nShe said, \"You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.\"\n\nI begged and pleaded with her day after day\nBut she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way\nShe gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.\nI put my Walkman on and said, \"I might as well kick it.\"\n\nFirst class, yo, this is bad\nDrinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.\nIs this what the people of Bel-Air living like?\nHmm, this might be alright.\n\nBut wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that\nIs this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?\nI don't think so\nI'll see when I get there\nI hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air\n\nWell, the plane landed and when I came out\nThere was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out\nI ain't trying to get arrested yet\nI just got here\nI sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared\n\nI whistled for a cab and when it came near\nThe license plate said \"Fresh\" and it had dice in the mirror\nIf anything I could say that this cab was rare\nBut I thought, \"Nah, forget it.\"\n– \"Yo, home to Bel-Air.\"\n\nI pulled up to the house about 7 or 8\nAnd I yelled to the cabbie, \"Yo home smell ya later.\"\nI looked at my kingdom\nI was finally there\nTo sit on my throne as

Pero tiene una pega el excesivo merchandising que contiene, siempre vas a ver a un personaje con mejor arma que tu, con lo cual más posibilidades de ganar te dará cuanto más compras realices en el. Armas que se recargan más rápido o hacen más daño. Si solo fuera opciones como trajes o burlas no habría problema pero lo de las armas es bastante injusto o sueltas la pasta o lo llevas crudo.\n\nTambién de vez en cuando la maquina te regalara alguna que otra chuchería, algún arma, algún accesorio, pero rara vez sera lo que buscas, y de vez en cuando cajas cerradas con llave, que contienen algún premio, eso si pasa por la tienda para conseguir una llave que abra esa caja.\n\nSe dan situaciones bastante absurdas en el juego, peca a veces de hacer las partidas excesivamente des-balanceadas, muchas han sido las ocasiones al comenzar una ronda donde se han visto equipos con 3 jugadores frente a 10, para cuando el juego a balanceado la partida ya esta en las ultimas. Luego otras situaciones extrañas como dispararle hasta en dos ocasiones a un francotirador en la cabeza con carga máxima y este ni inmutarse eso si todos sus disparos son certeros y letales. Si se trata de lag no lo se ya que el propio juego avisa del impacto mediante una campana que suena cada vez que golpeas en el juego o eres golpeado.\n\nA veces con suerte encuentras una partida balanceada, ambos equipos igualados y es entonces cuando disfrutas mucho de este juego, es adictivo como el solo. Pero eso si como entres en una des-balanceada preparate, por que vas a estar más tiempo viendo el tiempo de regeneración que llega a ser hasta 30 segundos, para nada más salir verte a todo el equipo contrario en tu puerta bailando sobre los trocitos del cadáver que acabas de dejar ya que te han hecho picadillo toda la horda de disparos y explosiones del equipo rival que tan cariñosamente te han enviado desde el otro lado de la puerta, que para eso han estado esperando a que te regeneres.\n\nMi consejo… Pruébalo, lo amaras o lo odiaras pero no te dejara indiferente.","timestamp_created":1486946917,"timestamp_updated":1486946917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29886132","author":{"steamid":"76561198357150844","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":62575,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8608,"last_played":1658368943},"language":"english","review":"you need to get it, end of story.","timestamp_created":1486945563,"timestamp_updated":1486945563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29886057","author":{"steamid":"76561198199205682","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":31121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10006,"last_played":1650056953},"language":"english","review":"very good","timestamp_created":1486945200,"timestamp_updated":1486945200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29885987","author":{"steamid":"76561198361038627","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":53123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":492,"playtime_at_review":2578,"last_played":1660507898},"language":"english","review":"recommend this game,10/10 so free","timestamp_created":1486944893,"timestamp_updated":1638041653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29885918","author":{"steamid":"76561198329626535","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2542,"last_played":1583388182},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1486944538,"timestamp_updated":1486944538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29885600","author":{"steamid":"76561198202068981","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":135680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33370,"last_played":1656213738},"language":"english","review":"I enjoy TF 2 and the past 2 years i've played have been great, the only major problems i have are long waiting times and hackers.

In truth mostly nothing, over the years with is degrading server system and Hitdetection its still a hilarious and fun game.\n\nWhats that? Fun is not a thing in TF2? It does not exist anymore? Well ♥♥♥♥ you pal for there still is and its plenty, just because you like things to be more serious does not mean everyone wants it.\nSpeaking of which maybe some of what I said has a part in this. What do most \"professionals\" say these days, specially about competitive? Well in all my years in this game even competitive was fun no matter what was involved or the costs, at the end of the day even if you lost you still had a smile on your face because you gave it all and god damn was it ♥♥♥♥ing good, the dissapointment does not last forever and only a fool would just give up from one defeat. As someone once said \"A Defeat means nothing if the soul remains unconquered\" and quite frankly I am starting to see that more rarely. \n\nWhat was once a place full of magic, insanity and crazy explosive flying people, multicolored as well, giant fat Bear wrestlers fighting amongst themselves with tickle mittens and australian snipers having a spit contest while the texan and the nazi have a philosicial disscussion about the diffrent ways of murder and how to get away in fashion as the Mumbling freak prepares some weenies for the great BBQ and the boston boy prepares some tunes while scateboarding over the french fry.\n\nHas become into a generic Kindergarten game of that one Kid who would invent every counter to your attacks or spells (if people remember the days where stick fights were infact great battles that were more gloryous then the Lord of the Rings stories)...that is also how I envision this community and specially the whole update and competitive\n\nEven before Lobbies were a thing, there was a level..no respect was mandatory, honor and some ♥♥♥♥ing decency for once. Apparently having a \"fashon\" sense makes you unbeatable, have you tried the barbie games? Im pretty sure even they had more sense then what you are making right now.\nI mean have you seen how most people react? Forget the children, mass media ♥♥♥♥ed them up and specially youtube, filled with horrible memes and terrible ♥♥♥♥ing tips. Nobody is trying anything by themselves its all in the youtube how too's And even their super star youtube players tried at one point to educate them properly but when all fails..I guess we gotta go with the flow...I don't believe in that but I am not them.But whats worse\nas I said before, forget the children, most of us were stupid one time, but when you see people at the age where thinking should be a thing..no they just repeat what you say, talk ♥♥♥♥ behind you and if you dare tell them about skill they will give you their CV(poorly writen with wank stains(male and female) ) or tell ya why are you not playing competitive then? But the question comes? Why are you not playing competitive? Im pretty sure you can showcase your skill a lot better there with people of your level...but whats Ironic is that even there..there is no such thing as skill, you'd expect some level of power but really, that exclusiveness, that specialty in team building the idea of actual competitive has been dumbed down like ♥♥♥♥ing hell, to the point competitive and casual are not so diffrent, and really Casual should practically be like in MvM, a boot camp for competitive..but it became such a casual thing itself ( mind the pun please ) it became nothing more then a simple and stupid word..hell even a Insult for that matter. So who means what anymore?\nIn Team Fortress 2 this update means nothing, for its just a update folks, change happens anyway, remember the time with the quick play? It replaced community servers with vanilla, at first it aint so bad, but in that time would you all have believed me if I would say that this would cause a lot of players to consider the Server Browers a very complicated system? I wouldn't..and even now I don't.. everybody complaining before the community is dead( not bit soup rice)..but why did you not server browse? Its still a thing you know..whats that? ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Plugins and crappy advertisements? there is adblock you know, it works in games as well..but thats valves problem..no..thats not 100% valves problem..what does \"community server\" mean to you? I want you to think deeply, im not going to force you to write me a essay on that, your a big boy now so get busy doing something then pretending you are depressed for attention okay? Thank you.\n\nUnusuals...where do I even begin..before I hated those hats, I started around the time it became f2p, I wanted to buy the game myself but when it became free I was happy but low and Behold I learned about the f2p curse..but..to speak truly I never could understand what was so bad infact my f2p times were the best ever...oh I'm turning into a old man speaking jibberish again..ahem..Even unusuals have lost their value..no not economical value..that was lost years ago when Backpack.tf2 cought power..I still regret the day I used to be a vigilante trade moderator..im pretty sure the exact same people I helped are using bots to ship stolen unusuals half their price on Scrap.tf2 (yes,thats where most ♥♥♥♥ goes btw, pay attention) but their stance..their emotional and god damn aspect has decreased over time. What was once a item that simbolizes uniqueness, specialty and power..that would give sometimes the wearer a effect that would turn even a Worm into a Super Mega Ultra Legend...now its just a hat with a Michael Bay special effect..these things get stolen, thrown and rebought..hell even unboxing one must not feel the same anymore..all the economical mish mash destroyed it..its a shame really... I usually say \"A thing that becomes too comercial, grows in economical value, but loses everything else that made it seem special\", have a new unusual that nobody has ever unboxed? wait around 2 weeks, someone will dupe it or steal it through the dumbest ways possible and there will be so many people who have had this hat it will become as bland as this community.\n\nHave you noticed a pattern here? Ive never said anything bad about the game other then the actual issue, the servers and hitscan. This game still is and will forever be great, nothing will beat it 100%, not because it uses special features or has incredible graphics. But because of its charm, the way it touched people (clean thoughts people, clean thoughts) there may be a game that can beat its performance, its looks, maybe even its economic system, but it will never take away its image, its soul..which even to this day it brings people back to play once a while.\n\nI still love this game..love, not like, love.\n\nDespite the years, the abuse and changes, the mess ups and horrible community, I recommand this game to all ages,nationalities and galaxies, for this game has a endless supply of Fun that no wanna be pompous ♥♥♥♥♥♥ will ever take...\n\nP.S. I am super ♥♥♥♥ing surprised how I did not swear like a mother♥♥♥♥ing sailor here..usually ♥♥♥♥ is 90% of my vocabulary..but ♥♥♥♥ me was this a little too honest from the depth of my mushy ♥♥♥ heart.\n\nP.S.2 Remember what I said about all ages? No children, Why? Multiplayer games are bad kids, its filled with failures, come back when Honor and respect is a thing again. But that dont mean you should not play singleplayer games or games over your age. I was no better. I was a ♥♥♥♥twat in my time.","timestamp_created":1486931811,"timestamp_updated":1486931811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":48,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.701815128326416016","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29882168","author":{"steamid":"76561198073936458","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3858,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3016,"last_played":1490290142},"language":"english","review":"this

sido jugador de TF2 durante un tiempo, antes de este , tenia otro analisis respecto a este juego\nPero viendo como esta el juego actualmente, creo que es una buena opcion actualizarlo...\nPero, TF2 es un juego que ya tiene muchos analisis, asi que la cantidad de gente que no conosca el juego simplemente es inexistente.\nPor ello mismo, creo que lo mejor que puedo hacer ahora, es una reflexion de los ultimos años de TF2 a mi parecer... porque actualmente el juego, para mi, esta muerto...\nEmpeze a jugar hace mucho tiempo y siempre disfrute mucho de este juego (joder, incluso gaste mucho dinero en tener cosmeticos, armas de australium y armas strange) pero que ocurrio para que este juego muera para mi?\nSe los explicare... LA JODIDA ACTUALIZACION DE MATCHMAKING!\nEn sus primeras etapas de esta actualizacion, el juego era relativamente el mismo, seguia encontrando servidores lleno de gente, el competitivo funcionaba realmente bien y no era mucho tiempo de espera entre partida y partida.\nPero que ocurrio?\nValve se le dio la \"brillante\" idea , de limitar los servidores \"a tus alrededores\" un ejemplo, en mi caso, soy de Perú por ello me va a limitar a encontrar servidores solamente en perú y a jugar con gente de paises cercanos como lo son ecuador, argentina, chile, etc. ( y no, el ping setting del menu , no sirve para un carajo porque me sigue buscando servidores peruanos) ( y no, los servidores comunitarios no cuentan porque son cancer con todas las estupideces que ellos meten en el servidor y que para colmo uno tiene que descargar...)\npero cual es el problema de todo esto? no es bueno encontrar gente que comparte tu idioma y una mejoria de ping?\nEl problema, es que TF2 tiene una comunidad bastante pequeña en latinoamerica, por ello casi nunca encuentro una partida de 12 vs 12 , a mayor suerte encuentro un 6 vs 5 (y eso es con mucha suerte, he tenido ocaciones que e esperado 10 minutos y encontrar partidas de 1 vs 2), los tiempos de espera son super larguisimos y estresantes y ni hablar de las busquedas de competitivo son simplemente eternas.\nGracias a Valve y esta grandiosa idea de los servidores cercanos, simplemente ha matado la comunidad del juego, ya que ahora el juego se ve limitado y cada zona se encuentra en su propia burbuja y no se puede salir de ella.\nPor todo ello...Solo puedo decir... Gracias valve :) gracias por matar una de las mejores comunidades del juego y de dividirnos peor que trump con el muro a latam :)\nPero... aun con todo... odio el TF2? la verdad.... es imposible odiarlo :( y me es imposible no recomendarlo, es uno de los mejores juegos que he tenido la dicha de jugar, tiene uno de los mejores conceptos que ha inspirado muchos actualmente y cuando se tiene la suerte de encontrar un servidor donde la gente se toma en serio el juego, es simplemente lo mas hermoso que hay y me hace añorar esos viejos dias donde cada partida de tf2 era igual a esa, donde la comunidad estaba unida, donde un latino y un norteamericano podia jugar juntos , cooperar, competir y ganar una partida...\nLamentablemente, al parecer esto no volvera u.u y los que aun inviertan muchas horas al TF2 tendran que acostumbrarse.\nSi es que algun dia valve vuelve a permitir que la comunidad se una en servidores pubs , yo personalmente, volvere a enviciarme con lo era antes :(\npero bueno, por ahora, solo puedo ver el juego como \"ese maravilloso juego que ha caido en desgracia\"\nNada mas que decir\n-----\nNota:\nPersonalmente, estoy intentando buscar alguna solucion que me permita entrar nuevamente a los servidores de EEUU ya que, para mi, es insoportable jugar en servidores de mis alrededores.\nsi alguien sabe algun modo que me permita volver a los servidores de EEUU , soy todo oidos para probar :(","timestamp_created":1486921584,"timestamp_updated":1542825926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543726265430450439","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29878653","author":{"steamid":"76561198301814446","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":495,"last_played":1619377648},"language":"russian","review":"Super puper duper\n","timestamp_created":1486921518,"timestamp_updated":1486921518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu7nbmdoCfZf9cQ=="}
