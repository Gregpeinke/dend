This just might be my favorite game.  Yes, even more than the Elder Scroll games and numerous Zombie shooters.  If you haven't played it yet, you really should give it a shot.  Doesn't look dated at all even though it's now 9 years old.  Also, you can skip Bioshock 1 & 2 and go directly to Infinite if you like.

Fast forward several years, I played through all three again and came back to this one. Having experienced more games over the years and playing the games again I think I realized why I didn't enjoy the world Columbia as much as Rapture. \n\nVisually, the game looks well polished and great with Columbia looking exactly like the shining city on the top of a hill they wanted to depict. Unfortunately, that's about the best part I can say about the game. \n\nEverything that made Bioshock what it was is minimal here. The vigors (plasmids) all are more or less the same with little difference besides the naming and the visual affect it applies losing the creative ability to create different skirmishes in previous installments. \n\nThe gun play was always the weakest part of the series but you had the satisfaction of having an arsenal of weapons on your person. In this game you're only allowed to carry two weapons at a time and they have a bad habit of running out of ammo quickly causing you to have to rely on Elizabeth for ammo resupplies mid fight. Not to mention, if you happen to choose a gun that you chose to upgrade, that same gun may no longer appear in future parts of the game leaving you with having to pick up a downed enemies gun with worse combat stats that barely inflict damage on the higher end game enemies making the enemies feel more bullet spongy. \n\nStory wise and this is where it falls flat for me. I think the game was trying to bring together several different topics and form a reflective story for the players to consider after beating. You have the obvious racism topic, bringing it up in the beginning but did nothing more with it by mid game. \n\nThe topic of choices and ones choice can spin off different time lines with different ramifications from said actions. The different timelines part I get what they were trying to convey but the problem is it ends up leading the player asking more questions that do not get answered. I like the idea of how our actions are supposed to have an impact but I never had that impression where my actions influenced the outcome of the games ending. \n\nI wanted to like this game, being a big fan of the previous two I remember seeing interviews and game play demos where Infinite was going to be more open world and had more interesting choices with how the ending would play out. Check out early idea concepts of Elizabeth and how she would change based on your decisions in game. It feels like the game needed another year or two in the oven to make it what the developers had originally envisioned. It's not an awful game and if I could give it a middling score I would but compared to the older Bioshocks it's a

недоумение-абсолютно кривая система сохранения с долбанутыми чекпоинтами , ограничение на ношение только 2 стволов(можно было сделать хотя бы 2 основных+пистолет,эх...) и слегка нестабильный фреймрейт с частыми микрофризами(как будто что-то постоянно подгружается,хотя память и пустует).Но в принципе это не критично.Bioshock infinite-однозначно лучший Bioshock,и просто шедевр,в который должен,даже

Its storyline is carefully crafted, its characters for the most part well-rounded in their heroism or villainy. Or rather, the grey morality of it all, as campaign players can attest to. \n\nUnfortunately, I had already known a rough outline of the game's storyline even before I began playing, a consequence of having too much time on my hands and reading the official wiki in the preceding years. As a result, what should have been stunning revelations or amazing discoveries in the storyline came to me as no surprise. I suppose I have only myself to blame for that 🤷‍♂ \n\nNonetheless, it does not detract from the overall enjoyment I had from playing Bioshock Infinite.

I recognize that it's a very well put together game with some awesome things in it, and I do enjoy it for what it is.  But, it ultimately still disappoints me.  I can't help but think about what the game was originally envisioned to be over what we eventually got.  I also have my own issues with some of the story's plot points and overall direction, but I won't talk about those here because my review length would inflate from a newspaper article to a book.\n\nYounger me fell in love with what was shown off in the 2010 premiere trailer & gameplay demo.  I will link them below.  I want to experience [b]that[/b] version of Columbia - the darker tone, the seemingly much bigger interconnected areas in an open world, dynamic world events, boss fights that fluidly interweave with said events, dapper looking handymen, dangerously patriotic Americans, and telekinesis!  Honorable mention, the 2011 Gameplay Demo is awesome too even though it lost some of what I really loved about the 2010 material.  It has really epic level verticality and marks a tonal shift towards what was ultimately in the final product.  I'll link it as well.\n\nI replayed Infinite after replaying BioShock 1 & 2; in terms of level design and gameplay, Infinite does feel quite inferior.  \nWhile Columbia does look beautiful, it does not feel fully realized.  The levels are extremely linear to a fault.  I do not think this was the original intention of the devs, but they had to do it in order to meet their release deadline, which is unfortunate.  There are many load triggers, some even in the middle of walking through an open space.  This lack of optimization is disappointing.  There are even a few points in the game where you can still walk into invisible geometry the devs forgot to turn off.  \nAs for weapons, being limited to using only 2 at a time doesn't do any justice for them.  This leads to a lack of experimentation, and is in stark contrast to BioShock 1 & 2 which let you hold every weapon you unlocked.  I never use the Vox weapons.  They look cool, but they didn't need to be their own unique weapon variants.  Every Vox weapon mirrors one of the regular weapons with some kind of change (rate of fire, add elemental damage, etc).  So, they could have just been upgrades or alternate fire modes.\n\nDespite my criticisms and my yearning for what ultimately didn't come to be, BioShock Infinite is still a high quality game with some really great moments.  I do recommend it.\n\n\n\n2010 Premiere Trailer: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_gEzOZKyE4\n\n2010 Gameplay Demo that still makes me hype for a version of the game which sadly doesn't exist:
