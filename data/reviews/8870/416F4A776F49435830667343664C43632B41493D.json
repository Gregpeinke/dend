Logo de cara, você é introduzido a uma cidade voadora chamada \"Columbia\", no qual é extremamente desenvolvida para a época em que ela esta inserida (1912 se eu não me engano). Essa cidade aparenta ser governada por um homem que se denomina o \"Profeta\", no qual possui um culto amplamente disseminado por toda população que o venera cegamente. Você é um detetive que vai para essa cidade em busca de uma garota que esta presa em uma grande torre, para poder \"quitar sua dívida\".\nO jogo te da um conceito amplo do inicio, sem muita explicação e com bastante mistério. Conforme você vai jogando, as coisas vão começando a fazer mais sentido de forma progressiva, mas sempre deixando alguns fatos em aberto, para que você esteja constantemente teorizando e se questionando. No final, todo o mistério desenvolvido é explicado de uma forma fenomenal e imprevisível, deixando sua cabeça fritando pela abordagem de um tema físico (não vou falar, pois pode ser spoiler).\nNesse quesito eu me impressionei muito, pois estava com a expectativa baixa pelo fato de não se passar em Rapture. No final, você percebe que esse game está diretamente ligado aos dois jogos anteriores, principalmente se você for jogar as DLC's, que são altamente recomendadas para completo entendimento da história.\n\nGameplay\nA gameplay pegou a mecânica dos jogos anteriores, porém, aprimorando e adaptando para o universo em que o personagem está inserido.\nOs combates são mais rápidos, fluidos e dinâmicos, te dando a possibilidade de usar diversos \"vigores\" (que seria os Plasmids desse game) para traçar estratégias de como você vai aniquilar seus inimigos. Além disso, agora você pode usar o \"skyhook\", que seria um tipo de gancho feito para transitar em aerotrilhos espalhados pela cidade, que ficou muito bem feito.\nAo contrário de Bioshock 2, esse game trouxe uma grande diversidade de inimigos que você pode enfrentar, cada um possuindo seu desafio e peculiaridade no combate, sendo que a IA destes, foi amplamente melhorada, proporcionando um maior desafio.\nAgora nós possuímos também a companhia da personagem Elizabeth, que está longe de ser um NPC inútil. Durante o combate, ela pode te jogar itens como munição, kit-médico e sais para a utilização dos vigores, podendo ela também utilizar seus poderes (que eu não posso falar, pois seria spoiler).\n\nGráficos/Arte\nO jogo é muito lindo, mesmo para quem for jogar hoje!\nA parte técnica gráfica é muito bem feita, com texturas de boa qualidade, iluminação e efeitos realistas. Porém, o que mais impressiona é a arte do jogo. Columbia foi muito bem feita, proporcionando ao jogar diversos tipos de ambientes únicos, cada um com seu capricho e beleza, o que torna a imersão do jogo muito grande. O primeiro contato com a cidade me lembrou muito a vez quando joguei o primeiro Bioshock, e me deparei com Rapture após sair daquela torre (o sentimento é o mesmo).\nAlém disso, os personagens são muito bem feitos, com animações fluidas e de alta qualidade. Elizabeth por exemplo, constantemente explora os lugares que você joga, procurando por itens e interagindo com o ambiente.\n\nConclusão\nBioshock Infinite é um jogo com uma história complexa e muito bem feita, que conseguiu estar no mesmo nível que a do primeiro jogo. Para aqueles que são fãs dos jogos anteriores, esse game é OBRIGATÓRIO, já que é um complemento para a história dos outros dois jogos, além de ser uma evolução literal nos mais diversos aspectos possíveis.\n\nNota: 9,5/10\n\nTempo de Gameplay: 26 horas","timestamp_created":1630771017,"timestamp_updated":1630771017,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98777337","author":{"steamid":"76561199147295745","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":881,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":734,"last_played":1632809959},"language":"schinese","review":"伊丽莎白永远滴神\n","timestamp_created":1630770141,"timestamp_updated":1630770141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98776317","author":{"steamid":"76561198169807773","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":80,"last_played":1640869691},"language":"polish","review":"bardzo fajna gra","timestamp_created":1630768913,"timestamp_updated":1630768913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98771200","author":{"steamid":"76561198316293191","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":294,"last_played":1630926331},"language":"schinese","review":"66666666666666666","timestamp_created":1630762929,"timestamp_updated":1630762929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98764996","author":{"steamid":"76561199079078411","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2032,"last_played":1652836945},"language":"english","review":"theres a reason this game is the gold standard for game storytelling","timestamp_created":1630754736,"timestamp_updated":1630754736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98763489","author":{"steamid":"76561198243308620","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":786,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":786,"last_played":1630729651},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情理解需要一些时间","timestamp_created":1630752622,"timestamp_updated":1630752622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98762153","author":{"steamid":"76561198065842486","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3341,"playtime_last_two_weeks":292,"playtime_at_review":1037,"last_played":1660146747},"language":"spanish","review":"Inmejorable","timestamp_created":1630750631,"timestamp_updated":1630750631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98761681","author":{"steamid":"76561198357137407","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":3290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1053,"last_played":1631624339},"language":"english","review":"No manual save, only check points save the progress, and sometimes there is no check points in 30 minutes.\n\nThe benefit of the manual save on previous Bio shock Series is we could find own strategies so easily during game playing, which is really important since the games has various weapons and powers we can choose and makes games so fun.\n\nThe story, music, characters, game playing, everything of Bio Shock Infinite is perfect except the save points, Who the hell thought this is good idea deleting manual save features from previous Bio shock series for an inconstant auto save feature?

Story\n- the main story is an amazing a lot of twists and turns, but it doesnt stop there the DLC's continue the story to give light to everything and at the same time confuse you but its worth it.\n- the game takes place at a fictional city of Columbia, a city on the clouds.\n\n\n2. Gameplay\n- what worked on the first 2 games remained but improved a whole lot better.\n- the plasmids are now called vigors which is the same thing but better because not only you get abilities that are recognizable from the previous games, they also introduce a whole lot of new ones, some imo are OP.\n- combat remains fun and you have this skyline which you can shoot enemies while riding it.\n- new enemies to fit in the setting\n\n\n3. Collectibles\n- there are collectibles in a form of voxophones which are audio recordings to expand the narrative and give background to the story. They are tied to some achievements so if you care go help yourself.\n\n\n4. Soundtrack\n- wow this is kind of what the previous games are lacking in a way, not only they have a lot of music to fit the setting but there are performances with the npcs that you can interact with, which I found welcoming and refreshing.\n\n\n5. Graphics\n- 10/10 the game looks amazingly good.\n\n\n6. Bugs/Glitches\n- encountered a game crash when I am changing gears I dont know why but this occurred during the last parts of the game which I found weird because I have never had an issue changing my gears almost the whole game but during the last parts now the game crashes? oh

Она необычайно красивая и, что необычно для серии Bioshock, яркая. В этой части лучше геймплей по сравнению с предыдущими частями, большая свобода действия во время боя и соответственно большее количество комбинаций разрешения конфликта. \n\nТеперь о менее положительных вещах. Проработанных персонажей, за которыми интересно наблюдать всего два, и это Гг и Элизабет. Остальные же персонажи блещут харизмой, как картонки, не считая близнецов, но их в игре невероятно мало. Выбор же, который дают игроку раза 2-3 за всю игру не имеет НИКАКОГО смысла и последствий. И да, сюжет игры намекает на незначительность наших выборов, но учитывая, как было приятно осознавать хоть какой-то выбор в прошлых частях, нахожу отсутствие оного в этой недочётом. И совсем этим вытекающим, переходим к концовке. Огромное, подавляющее количество игроков находит её гениальной и чуть ли не лучшей в игровой индустрии. Не знаю ребят, как по мне концовка хороша, я бы даже сказал, что она отличная, но гениальная? На этот \"неожиданный\" поворот очень жирно намекают ближе к концу игры по несколько раз подряд. Так же, если теория о существовании бесчисленного множества параллельных миров еще более менее воспринимается, то прыжки во времени-нет. Интересно, сколько временных парадоксов Элизабет создала, открывая эти \"двери\"!? Учитывая, какая вакханалия происходит во временной петле в этой части, вы только представьте сколько еще Элизабет и ей подобных могло появится из-за её проделок, и из-за них в свою очередь, так же прыгающих по времени. Атмосфера местной антиутопии так же не порадовала, особенно, в сравнении с прошлыми частями. Да, есть ущемления по расовой принадлежности и очевидно авторитарный режим с полицейским государством, но назвать это антиутопией язык не поворачивается.\n\nУчитывая, какой сумбур тут в сюжете, выше 7/10 поставить не могу.\n\nНемного о DLC. Сюжет завязан на прыжке во времени, но и черт с ним. Даже зная это, мне DLC понравилось чуть больше оригинальной игры, скорее всего из-за более темных и гнетущих цветов, с которыми игра лучше передает анти-утопичные нотки. И хоть концовка в первом DLC мне понравилась, во втором опять какой-то бред. [spoiler] Да-да, Элизабет никак не смогла бы вырубить 5ых бомжей без способностей, конечно. Единственный выход это умереть и дать сделать всю работу Джеку...
