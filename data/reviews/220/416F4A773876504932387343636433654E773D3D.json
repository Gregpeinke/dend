Главный герой игры - Гордон Фримен - физик-теоретик, который, как мы знаем из событий Half-Life, положил начало такому событию, как \"Каскадный резонанс\", но лишь косвенно (Кристалл, породивший данное явление, был передан герою G-Man'ом, самым загадочным персонажем игровой серии). Сюжет игры гениален, запутан, увлекателен и полон загадок. В самом начале игрок прибывает в Сити-17, город, который захвачен межпланетной цивилизацией \"Альянс\", и по мере прохождения вам придется бежать оттуда. С боем. Вы встретите многих героев из прошлой части игры, таких как Барни Калхун, Илай Вэнс, Айзек Кляйнер... В игре нет необходимости носить только два-три вида оружия - весь используемый в игре арсенал можно одновременно хранить у себя и доставать необходимое в любой момент. Монтировка, пистолет, револьвер, дробовик, два варианта автомата, управляемая ракетница, гранаты и даже арбалет! Также в качестве оружия можно использовать грави-пушку, но она больше подходит для манипуляций с предметами а-ля бочки, ящики, двери и стальные пластины. Сам игровой сюжет растянут на 13 глав. Каждая из них проходится не быстро, а иногда и таит в себе головоломки, сюжетные повороты, красочные боевые действия. Half-Life 2 затянет вас и вы будете проходить ее не отрываясь, а также горя желанием узнать, что же случится ПОСЛЕ прохождения игры... Но это вы уже узнаете, когда начнете играть в Half-Life 2 : Episode One и Half-Life 2: Episode Two. \nОценки по критериям: \nСюжет - 10/10\nГрафика - 10/10 - игра использует новейший для 2004-го года движок 'Source', предоставляющий игроку шикарные анимации, красивую графику, высококачественные шейдеры и многое другое.\nЗвук - 10/10 - эффекты и музыка в каждом уровне на высоте!\nГеймплей - 10/10 - простой и понятный интерфейс, нет никаких заморочек с управлением и ориентацией в игре. \n","timestamp_created":1425151044,"timestamp_updated":1425151044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14694826","author":{"steamid":"76561198169747386","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":286,"last_played":1427502564},"language":"english","review":"What can I say?

Cuando tuve mi primer PC, el primer juego que me regalaron fue el Half-Life 1 y lo disfrute de sobremanera, me parecio un juego increiblemente divertido, ya que con 12 años no me fijaba en otros apartados.\nAños mas tarde cuando salio Half-Life 2 mi PC ya estaba un pelin anticuado para el y no fue hasta el año 2013 cuando me puse una cuenta de Steam en mi flamante nuevo sobremesa y me hice con el juego y sus dos episodios.  \nA dia de hoy he jugado 2 veces cada uno de ellos y estoy seguro que en el futuro los volvere a jugar.\nHalf-Life 2 es uno de esos juegos que entra en la categoria de videojuegos perfectos. \nNo tiene fallos, por lo menos desde mi punto de vista, su narrativa es como deberia ser en un videojuego, siempre desde el punto de vista del avatar y dando al jugador la opción de elegir que quiere saber de la trama, asi los jugadores mas pacientes se enriqueceran mas de la gran historia que esconde este shooter.\nEn cuanto a jugabilidad, este es el jugego con las mejores escenas de disparos que he tenido el placer de jugar. Cada tiroteo es como estar dentro de una escena de acción de Michael Mann. Ademas aqui cada arma si es diferente de las demas y el uso de la pistola de gravedad es simplemente maravilloso. \nLos puzzles, los escenarios, los planteamientos....todo es perfecto en este videojuego. \nEn definitiva, si no tienes Half-Life 2, compralo. Si no lo tienes por que no te gustan los FPS, compralo. Y aunque no te gusten los videojuegos, compralo. \nPara despedirme solo hacer una de las miles de peticiones hacia Valve.

For a game released in 2004, the graphics and mechanics hold up well. The story is amazing, the visuals are stunning, and it stars the legendary, silent physicist we all love: Gordon Freeman. Although the Combine and its technology are interesting and quite advanced for a game set in the 2020s, this game is a captivating sci fi shooter that has a nice arsenal of weapons at the player's disposal. The physics are great and fun to mess with. The soundtrack is great and the sound design works its way well as it gives a feeling to Half-Life 2's destitute environment based in Eastern Europe. A personal favorite of mine, Half-Life 2 is a classic and a milestone in FPS history. Since it is easy to acquire through Steam sales or Valve related events, Half-Life 2 should have a place in anyone's library.","timestamp_created":1424742231,"timestamp_updated":1505179558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14628315","author":{"steamid":"76561198093115700","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":3394,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2269,"last_played":1535590619},"language":"english","review":"its worth the money","timestamp_created":1424740175,"timestamp_updated":1424740175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14627656","author":{"steamid":"76561198094829532","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":630,"last_played":1656032207},"language":"english","review":"Gman: wake up mr freeman wake up and smell the ashes\n\nBarney: about that beer i owed ya\n\nGordon Freeman:","timestamp_created":1424735619,"timestamp_updated":1570801045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14616757","author":{"steamid":"76561198123261662","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":860,"last_played":1428153114},"language":"english","review":"one of the very best games of all time, sequel to a classic and a classic in its own right this really is a game that should be in everyones STEAM LIBRARY!","timestamp_created":1424730147,"timestamp_updated":1424730147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14616157","author":{"steamid":"76561198154978023","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6770,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5804,"last_played":1427141998},"language":"brazilian","review":"bom jogo,recomendo para meus amigos mais tem um problema nao consigo fazer o download half  life -lost coast,pessoal resolva este problema pra gente ;obrigado.","timestamp_created":1424726937,"timestamp_updated":1424726937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14615133","author":{"steamid":"76561198137681526","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":634,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":634,"last_played":1417820210},"language":"german","review":"After all this years.
