You start off on a train to City 17, being awoken from stasis by G-Man. Afterwards, you make your way to Dr Kleiner's lab to teleport to Eli. However, the teleporter malfunctions and you have to make your way back to City 17 by fighting antlions, combine soldiers, zombies, and more. You meet some interesting characters. They either help you out with killing or give you some new equipment. The game doesn't really get repetitive and it has a fantastic and entertaining story.\n\n[u]Storyline Length[/u]\nBeing honest, it all depends on how you play. This could take you half an hour, it could take you three hours, six hours, a day, it all depends. I'm the type of person that's quick to solve puzzles and gets distracted by trying to do achievements. That being said, it took me about three or four hours because I kept on checking every corner for lambda caches.\n\n[u]AI[/u]\nI don't really understand why this game has a difficulty setting because the experience is the same. The AI is alright. They deal a bit of damage and will use everything at their disposal except for the cover. This applies to allies and enemies. Some AI is really annoying, like the headcrabs, and some are fairly scary like the striders. The AI is really accurate though, which makes all of them fairly scary to some point. Moving on from that, what's great is that the AI actually have facial expressions.\n\n[u]Experience[/u]\nThe thing I love most about this game is that even though there's no time limit, your heart will be racing and your mind will be screaming to 'Just get it done before this or that happens!' The puzzles aren't very hard, but they're not very easy. They do require a bit more than a single brain cell. Another cool thing is no matter where you are, the right mood for that place will always hit you. In Ravenholm, you'll feel cautious and hurried before you even see any AI. In City 17, you'll feel relaxed but curious. It's fantastic! From the start to the end, you'll feel stress slowly building up. By the end, you are rushing to get the job done. Once you get to the end of the game, all the built-up stress will leave you and you can breathe normally again. I believe the right word for that is 'intense'.\n\n[u]Graphics[/u]\nConsidering that this is a game from 2004, I was amazed the first time I loaded this game up. Almost every surface and material has a good amount of detail in it. Explosions and fire achieve what most games can't achieve today. They look threatening. They're the last thing you'd want to see in this game. Other than that, I'm impressed that this was made in 2004. At a quick glance, you'd assume it was from 2007 or 2008. There are great little details too. Shells fly out of the guns when you fire them, sparks of metal can be seen, and the blood can actually make you think [i]'Those poor people.'[/i]\n\n[u]Sound[/u]\nI think I'll end this novel of a review quite soon. Overall, enemies actually sound threatening and will make you stay away from them. Your footstep sounds change depending on what you're walking on, which is a great detail! Gunshots are actually quite loud, especially from your revolver or the striders. Voice acting is beautifully done, you can hear the emotion in their voices. However, Gordon remains mute.\n\n[u]Overall[/u]\nNo Steam library is complete without this game. This is definitely one of the best games I have ever played and I would recommend it to quite literally almost anybody. For achievement hunters, this game would prove to be a little bit of a challenge. The lambda caches are cleverly hidden and some achievements are just tedious which is a great challenge.\n\n[u]Specs[/u]\nYou won't need a very demanding computer, it's not that big of a game.

The good - physics are enjoyable, masterful digital artwork, engaging original storyline, expressive facial expressions for NPCs, intense action. The bad – puzzles can become a little tedious after 2 or 3. How many times do you want to move some boxes/barrels to reach a window or uncover a hole in the floor?

But the game also has a pretty good story except also has pretty liner levels but (in my opinion) is made up for with it's satifying gameplay and did I mention the enemies, the enemies are super fun to fight and the guns are satisfying to play especially the iconic gravity gun, this gun is so fun to play with. And if you really want a game that has this kind of gameplay but don't like the liner story levels then you might like gmod, but if you're like me you'll find nothing to do, you might play it for a few hours and then stop playing all togehter, but if you like just goofing around with a few friends in a game like half-life then gmod can be the game for you.

Still great fun to this day, although many of its innovations are standard practice now.

How do you use your environment and the physics system of the game (which was amazing at the time of release) to kill combine and progress through the level? That's the bottom line of Half Life 2.
