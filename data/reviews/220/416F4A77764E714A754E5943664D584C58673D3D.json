The game follows an arc similar to most forms of media, especially film media, with the player seeing highs, lows, and an excellent climax as through the eyes of Gordon Freeman.\n\nAs stated above, this game remains an amazing title and experience, both in gameplay and in plot, with a great deal of effort directed at character development and map and AI design. You could be told this was released a week ago and would believe it, as both its graphics and physics engine remain top-notch and put to shame those of most other shooters, both at the time and now.\n\nThe game follows M.I.T. graduate and Black Mesa Research Associate Scientist Gordon Freeman, who, after being placed on a train heading to City 17, faces off against the oppressive Combine Empire that controls the city and the planet. With the help of the resistance movement and old and new friends alike, Gordon fights the Combine as they launch continued assaults against him, viewing his return to be a serious if not the single greatest threat to their dominion.\n\nThe game is an outstanding example of storytelling, with the arc being one of my favorite in any game released - period. Without a word coming from Freeman's lips, the universe and history of City 17 and Earth in general is greatly explained, and through events the player grows to despise the Combine Empire, which in turn grants extra reward to the player when they succeed in trading blows with it.\n\nWith an excellent soundtrack composed by Kelly Bailey, the game's means to convey emotion increase, action scenes become more epic, horror scenes become more terrifying, and emotional scenes become more deep and impactful. The game uses its soundtrack in a masterful way, reintroducing old tunes and beats from Half-Life 1, and introducing a new soundtrack that perfectly fits the situation.\n\nThe game is also masterful at finding a blend of pleasing and challenging a player; Most concepts are introduced by some form of training to help open the player up to them, rather than forcing the player to learn skills on the spot, though the game makes sure not to help the player too much to keep the challenge going.\n\nIf you haven't bought this game yet on Steam, I strongly suggest you do so. It's an excellent title that has everything a good game should have: Interesting Plot, well-written characters, interesting and fun mechanics, a fitting and enjoyable soundtrack, good map design, excellent world-building, and so on. It stands 12 years since its release in most majestic fashion with the means to challenge most AAA titles shat out to the market with its first chapter alone.","timestamp_created":1471508654,"timestamp_updated":1471510246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":40,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.78275221586227417","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24986401","author":{"steamid":"76561198018276961","num_games_owned":249,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":394,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":394,"last_played":1441891749},"language":"english","review":"Yes Yes YES!! buy this game","timestamp_created":1471496389,"timestamp_updated":1471496389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24983785","author":{"steamid":"76561198129155357","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1460,"last_played":1470629802},"language":"spanish","review":"Half Life es uno de los mejores juegos en la historia y con HL2 es sorprendente como mejoran todo, en aquel tiempo el mejor juego incluso hoy en dia es de lo mejor que existe.\nMuy recomendado, a seguir esperando a HL2 ep 3 ; o HL3\nNunca perdere la esperanza de este estupendo, maravilloso juego.","timestamp_created":1471481185,"timestamp_updated":1471481185,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24972860","author":{"steamid":"76561198058115931","num_games_owned":4243,"num_reviews":463,"playtime_forever":381,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1445874677},"language":"english","review":"\"Never fear, Gordon.

Anyway, I just wanted to say that the first third of HL2 felt a lot like a tech demo and spent more time 'teaching' the player how to play the game than actually playing it, but the latter two thirds impressed me with the large amount of variety. The biggest issue with this game is that the levels are inconsistent in terms of quality - some are small and linear while others show moments of brilliance. Even then though, the linear levels are still pretty fun, and the linearity allows for cool scripted events that otherwise wouldn't be possible with a larger level. Overall, HL2 is a pretty fun game and it is very much action packed.\n\n\nThere are a few settings I recommend for HL2:\n1. Disable v-sync. I've found that the game stutters with v-sync on if you are running at max settings. Even if you do turn down the settings I wouldn't recommend using v-sync because it results in very noticeable mouse lag on a 60hz monitor.\n2. The game runs at a very high framerate (300fps) when you turn v-sync off. Unfortunately this results in a lot of tearing. If you are running a 60hz display I would suggest using rivatuner  (this is usually bundled with MSI afterburner) to limit fps of HL2.exe to 120fps - this reduces screen tearing. \nIf you are running a high refresh rate monitor, this is less of an issue. Actually, you probably would be fine if you turned on v-sync for a 120hz display\n\nAlternatively, you can disable framerate limit (set it to 0) and try running scanline sync x2 and set the number to something like -1000 (on a 4k monitor) so there is one tear line underneath the crosshair and another above it (you don't want the tear line to be on the middle, ideally it's better to have the tear line on the top as high up as possible while keeping the bottom tear line below the crosshair) - to see the tear lines, move your mouse side to side horizontally while looking at a large vertical object (such as a corner of a building or a trea) - then alt+tab out of the game and adjust the scanline sync numbers - you will see the tear lines move up or down. I think scanline sync looks a bit better otherwise the tear line moves all over the place when using regular framerate limiter. This depends somewhat on your GPU load, if you find that your GPU is struggling to output 120fps, then you can use scanline sync (not x2) to get better results.","timestamp_created":1471001288,"timestamp_updated":1594111712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479452043771743774","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24840430","author":{"steamid":"76561198153582707","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":924,"last_played":1424511225},"language":"english","review":"Classic game, still worth playing over 10 years later.

Half Life 2 - это не просто легендарная игра. Вторая часть франшизы является лицом всей серии. В этой игре есть колоритные персонажи, ньютоновская физика, классический геймплей с индикатором здоровья и брони. В 2004 году графон и физика в этой игры были настоящей революцией. Да и сейчас они смотрится вполне пристойно. И это при смехотворных системных требованиях. Именно так врезаться в память может только настоящий шедевр - продукт гениев игровой индустрии. Именно такие игры, как HL2, показывают миру, что компьютерные игры - это точно такое же искусство, как кино и литература. Так же в этой игре есть очень интересный антиутопический сюжет, который опасен для любой власти. Уже только по этим причинам стоит хотя бы ознакомиться с историей молчаливого Гордона Фримена.\n\nВ общем, про эту игру можно говорить очень много. Поэтому лучше поиграйте сами. Сей шедевр нужно не просто увидеть - его надо пережить.\n\n10 из 10 бесспорно.","timestamp_created":1470906548,"timestamp_updated":1511551672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560286164283752441","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24822436","author":{"steamid":"76561198099310403","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":9844,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4240,"last_played":1652417869},"language":"english","review":"play it already dumbfuck","timestamp_created":1470903411,"timestamp_updated":1470903411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24820330","author":{"steamid":"76561198208487276","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":688,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":390,"last_played":1475590359},"language":"spanish","review":"Solo puedo decir una cosa:JUEGAZO","timestamp_created":1470888065,"timestamp_updated":1470888065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24817223","author":{"steamid":"76561198039305959","num_games_owned":271,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":3666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1738,"last_played":1635476093},"language":"spanish","review":"El mejor videojuego que pudo haber creado el ser humano.

Игра начинается в вагоне  поезда который направляется в \"Cити 17\" который находится под властью тоталитарного правительства, глава которого Уоллес Брин, по совместительству бывший администратор научно-исследовательского цента \"Black Mesa\". Игра имеет неплохую графику на 2004 год которую ей обеспечивает движок \"Source\". Который так же использовался в последующих проектах \"Valve\" на протяжении многих лет. Игра была поделена на несколько глав: Сама игра \"Half-Life 2\", \"Half-Life 2: Episode One\", \"Half-Life 2: Episode Two\". Которые выходили в последующие годы и распространяться за отдельную плату. Главное ради чего стоит играть в Half-Life 2 и Episodes это конечно же сюжет и он здесь на высоте. Каждый персонаж и его характер раскрыты на полную. Гемплейная часть игры не уступает сюжетной, именно благодаря её игра проходится на одном дыхании и не надоедает до самого конца. Я рекомендую эту игру каждому любителю шутеров от первого лица, так же любителям хорошей истории. Но что бы понять сюжет вам следует пройти первую часть \"Half-Life\". λ\n\nМоя оценка игре:
