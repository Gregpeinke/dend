If you want more juicy details check out my Half Life 2 review for more information. \n\nAnywho. Let us get the elephant out of the room. This particular episode tries a little bit too hard at what it wants to be. Is this still an action adventure game? Is it a science-fiction horror FPS? The reason why I say this is because unlike in Half Life 2 where the sections are spread out. The \"chapters\" jump from one genre to the next with really no breather for the player. And I guess you can say it's because of the \"intense\" circumstances of the story. But still, Episode One could've used more chapters to spread things out rather than just cramming it all in.\n\nThe story obviously takes places just hours after the events of Half Life 2. The overall goal is to get out of City 17. That's basically it. You get some \"new\" 'plot questions' in this particular game. But these 'plot questions' won't be explained until Episode 2. And even then, the new plot questions you encountered in this game and in the next episode won't be REALLY answered until (Half Life 3) <- Lol. \n\nI recommend this game. But! And this might be a hard pill to swallow. But, I think Episode One and Two should've just been in the ACTUAL Half Life 2 game rather than spacing the game out. It might've been because of budget or giving players a breather. If that's the case then they should've made Ep 1 and Ep 2 into purchasable expansions rather than actual 'full games'. I recommend buying the Orange Box rather than the games seperately btw.","timestamp_created":1475078708,"timestamp_updated":1475078708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515868604183197021","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25736745","author":{"steamid":"76561198068236676","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1475046381},"language":"english","review":"AWESOMENESS over 9000!!!","timestamp_created":1475052692,"timestamp_updated":1475052692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25710372","author":{"steamid":"76561198139364021","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1474733826},"language":"english","review":"You , and the girl who is secretly in love with you, are running away together !","timestamp_created":1474899735,"timestamp_updated":1475231346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536679506301879883","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25698949","author":{"steamid":"76561198055517152","num_games_owned":316,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":3851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2106,"last_played":1638728678},"language":"english","review":"GET OUT OF CITY 17 AT ONCE!!!","timestamp_created":1474832076,"timestamp_updated":1643318251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25693286","author":{"steamid":"76561198320103334","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1477417259},"language":"english","review":"Kind of short for a Half-life game but i loved it i recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1474813744,"timestamp_updated":1474813744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25683502","author":{"steamid":"76561198055533323","num_games_owned":478,"num_reviews":129,"playtime_forever":374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":374,"last_played":1467923181},"language":"english","review":"A great expansion to Half-Life 2.","timestamp_created":1474773230,"timestamp_updated":1474773230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486486494541168213","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25677733","author":{"steamid":"76561198033757873","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":1226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":318,"last_played":1579799396},"language":"russian","review":"Рекомендую поиграть в эту часть с условием, что все остальные части до этого были пройдены.

Игра является первой частью в трилогии эпизодов — продолжений Half-Life 2. В Episode One используется следующая версия движка Source с поддержкой технологии HDR.\n\nЗначительную часть Episode One игрок проходит, взаимодействуя с компьютерным персонажем — Аликс Вэнс, что является нестандартным приёмом для серии Half-Life. Эпизод состоит из 5 глав (уровней), рассчитанных на 4-6 часов игры, и рекламного ролика второго эпизода. Сюжет игры продолжает историю Half-Life и Half-Life 2, и начинается с момента, на котором завершилась предыдущая игра: игрок в роли Гордона Фримена вместе с Аликс Вэнс должен успеть сбежать из охваченного хаосом Сити 17, пока Цитадель Альянса, которой Фримен нанёс непоправимый ущерб, не уничтожила вместе с собой весь город.\n\nВерсия игры для ПК появилась в розничной продаже и системе онлайн-загрузки Steam 1 июня 2006 года. В России и странах СНГ коробочная версия была выпущена 8 июня компанией «Бука». Episode One является самостоятельной игрой, не требует установленного Half-Life 2 и поставляется вместе с двумя сетевыми играми: Half-Life 2: Deathmatch и Half-Life Deathmatch: Source. Игра входит в набор игр от Valve под названием The Orange Box, релиз которого для покупки через Steam и в розницу состоялся 10 октября 2007 года, в Северной Америке и России. Этой же датой, портированный вместе со всеми играми (включая Episode One), The Orange Box вышел для игровой приставки Xbox 360. Версия набора для консоли Sony PlayStation 3 появилась 11 декабря 2007 года в США и Европе.\n\nEpisode One значительно короче своего предшественника Half-Life 2, причём всё действие происходит на территории Сити 17. В то же время он является полностью самостоятельным платным дополнением, не требующим оригинальной игры для установки. Это связано с изменением политики Valve в отношении выпуска новых игр. Вместо выпуска полноценного сиквела, разработка которого займёт долгие годы, Valve выпустит три сравнительно небольших эпизода, по ходу выпуска обновляя стареющий движок Source и добавляя в него новые возможности, чтобы обеспечить конкурентоспособность своих игр.\n\nHalf-Life 2: Episode One впоследствии был включён в набор The Orange Box, все игры которого поддерживали специальную систему достижений. Однако после выпуска набора обнаружилось, что в Episode One и Half-Life 2 система достижений не была добавлена. Спустя долгое время (около двух лет) очередное обновление игр Valve, наконец, сделало её доступной.\n\nЕсли вы прошли Half-Life 2, то и должны пройти \"Episode One, а также Episode Two\".","timestamp_created":1473768347,"timestamp_updated":1473768347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25491801","author":{"steamid":"76561198117061413","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1473358626},"language":"russian","review":"Это как посмотреть матрицу в первый раз, или что то на подобии, хорошая игра","timestamp_created":1473762323,"timestamp_updated":1473762323,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25482635","author":{"steamid":"76561198030026715","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":436,"last_played":1473692991},"language":"russian","review":"Короткий но довольно интересный эпизод!

But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (Laughs, tears out a page of the book) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush).\n\n\"Allstar\" by Smash Mouth begins to play. Shrek exits an outhouse and goes about his day in the swamp.\n\nIn a nearby village, an angry mob gather up to go after Shrek. At night, the villagers head into the swamp and wait outside Shrek's home.\n\nNIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME\n\nVillager 1: Think it's in there?\n\nVillager 2: All right. Let's get it!\n\nVillager 1:Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?\n\nVillager 3: Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.\n\nShrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.\n\nSHREK: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin...\n\nVillagers: No!\n\nSHREK: They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.\n\nVillager 1: Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (Waves the torch at Shrek.)\n\nShrek licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The men shrink back away from him. Shrek terrifies the mob with a frightening roar, his spit extinguishing all the remaining torches.\n\nSHREK: (Whispering) This is the part where you run away.\n\nThe men drop their torches and pitchforks and flee as fast they can.\n\nSHREK: And stay out! (looks down and picks up a wanted poster. Reads.) \"Wanted. Fairytale creatures.\" (He sighs and drops the paper on the ground.)\n\nTHE NEXT DAY - FOREST\n\nLines of fairy tale creatures are put in chains and are led into wagons by Duloc Guards. The Captain of the Duloc Guards sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairytale creatures in. Waiting in line is Donkey on a leash and his owner. Some of the others in line include Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Geppetto who is carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer carrying the Three Little Pigs.\n\nGUARD: All right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Next!\n\nGUARD: (Taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half)\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!\n\nGUARD: Get up! Come on!\n\nMama Bear and Papa Bear are locked inside giant cages, with Little Bear in his own cage.\n\nLITTLE BEAR: (crying) This cage is too small.\n\nDONKEY: (To his owner) Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!\n\nOLD WOMAN: Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)\n\nDONKEY: Oh!\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?\n\nGEPPETTO: This little wooden puppet.\n\nPINOCCHIO: I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows)\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.\n\nPINOCCHIO: Father, please! Don't let them do this! Help me! (Geppetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up to the table.)\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?\n\nOLD WOMAN: Well, I've got a talking donkey.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.\n\nOLD WOMAN: Oh, go ahead, little fella. (Donkey stays silent).\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Well?..\n\nOLD WOMAN: Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. (Smacks Donkey) Talk, you boneheaded dolt, talk!\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!\n\nOLD WOMAN: No, no, he talks! He does. (Moving Donkey's lips) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Get her out of my sight.\n\nOLD WOMAN: No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!\n\nThe guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled with fairy dust and starts floating upwards.\n\nDONKEY: Hey! I can fly!\n\nPETER PAN: He can fly!\n\nTHREE LITTLE PIGS: He can fly!\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: He can talk?!\n\nDONKEY: Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (The pixie dust's effects begin to wear off) Uh-oh. (He drops out of the air and hits the ground with a thud.)\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Seize him!\n\nDonkey dodges the guards as they try to grab him and runs deeper into the forest.\n\nGUARDS: He's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!\n\nDonkey keeps running and he eventually runs head first into Shrek's backside. Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him and glares down at Donkey. Donkey looks scared of Shrek for a moment, but he quickly hides him after seeing that the guards have caught up to him.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: You there. Ogre!\n\nSHREK: Aye?\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: By the order of Lord Farquaad, I am authorized to place you both under arrest and...(Shrek slowly approaches the group of guards, the guards visibly frightened by him) transport you to... a designated...resettlement...facility?\n\nSHREK: Oh, really? You and what army? (Smiles)\n\nThe Captain looks behind himself and sees that all the other guards have abandoned him. The Captain tucks tail and runs off. Shrek shakes his head and starts walking back to his swamp. Donkey, impressed by Shrek, follows him.\n\nDONKEY: Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!\n\nSHREK: Are you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa!\n\nDONKEY: Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back there? Man those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.\n\nSHREK: (Annoyed) Oh, that's great. Really.\n\nDONKEY: Man, it's good to be free.\n\nSHREK: Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?\n\nDONKEY: But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're a mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.\n\nShrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before loudly roaring in is face.\n\nDONKEY: Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day.\n\nSHREK: Why are you following me?\n\nDONKEY: I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have friends...\n\nSHREK: Stop singing! (Picks up Donkey by his ears and tail) It's no wonder you don't have any friends (drops him).\n\nDONKEY: Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.\n\nSHREK: Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?\n\nDONKEY: (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh...really tall?\n\nSHREK: No! I'm an ogre! You know, \"Grab your torch and pitchforks.\" Doesn't that bother you?\n\nDONKEY: Nope.\n\nSHREK: Really?\n\nDONKEY: Really, really.\n\nSHREK: Oh.\n\nDONKEY: Man, I like you. What's you name?\n\nSHREK: Uh, Shrek.\n\nDONKEY: Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of \"I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me\" thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill overlooking Shrek's home.) Whoa!

2: Episode One begine right where Half-Life 2 ended, and continues the story of Dr.Gordon Freeman in City 17, however, this time, the priority remains to escape the city following the events of Half-Life 2.\n\nWith updated lighting and AI for deuteragonist Alyx Vance, and expanded usage for the Gravity Gun, Half-Life 2: Episode One continues Half-Life 2's usage of advanced graphics, physics, music and writing to create a game that is both rich in gameplay, plot, and emotion. Like its predecessor, it uses training techniques to allow for a more fluid experience, and utilizes the game's physics engine to a full. With excellent performances by its cast, it's able to greatly explain the story of Gordon and Alyx escaping City 17.\n\nWith an excellent soundtrack composed by Kelly Bailey, the game becomes even more action packed, and the act of blasting zombies in an infected hospital with a shotgun becomes far more enjoyable, and the scene of fighting infected Combine soldiers in the underground becomes more threatening.\n\nThe game also includes Developer commentary in the form of a commentary mode that allows the players to listen to the developers' thoughts on everything from map design to character and scene writing, and includes all variant of Valve Employee sharing their thoughts on the game.\n\nIf I had to say I had any issues with the game, I'd have to say that it's fairly short, while Half-Life 2 is around 12-15 hours long, Episode One is around 5 hours long. That's not to say it's a bad game for that, though, as the story and game runs at a certain pace that allows for it to be enjoyed to the fullest; Replaying the game with the knowledge of how short it is doesn't damage or reduce the enjoyment of playing it, as Valve injects a great deal of fun into the game so there aren't many moments or time that is wasted, and every minute is used to its fullest.\n\nIf you enjoyed Half-Life 2, and want more, I greatly suggest you buy the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/231/]Half-Life Complete[/url] Steam bundle, preferably during a Steam Seasonal Sale. The bundle consists of this game and every other Valve-released Half-Life title, and is an essential for a fan of Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1471920294,"timestamp_updated":1471920294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.647203922271728516","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25076252","author":{"steamid":"76561198145852798","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1468245929},"language":"french","review":"C'est sympa ... mais un peu court.

Игра является первой частью в трилогии эпизодов - продолжений \"Half-Life 2\". В Episode One используется следующая версия движка \"Source\" с поддержкой технологии HDR. \"Half-Life 2: Episode One\" начинается с того момента где завершилась предыдущая игра. Играем мы всё за того же Гордона Фримена который вместе с Аликс Вэнс должен успеть сбежать из охваченного хаосом \"Сити 17\", пока \"Цитадель Альянса\", которой Фримен нанёс непоправимый ущерб, не уничтожила вместе с собой весь город. Графика как и гемплей остались прежними что и в \"Half-Life 2\", за исключением немного улучшенных текстур. Эта игра является частью истории: \"Half-Life\", \"Half-Life 2\", \"Half-Life 2: Episode Two\". Я рекомендую эту игру только тем кто прошёл прошлые игры серии.
