This also happened to be the first Half Life game I had ever played, and I enjoyed it. However, there are some terrible game design choices that stuck out far too much to give a positive review. None of these problems are issues related to the time the game came out; all of these could be implemented in 2004.\n\nThe shooting sections were very satisfying, but the sheer number of guns overwhelmed me a little. It also is relevant that some guns just suck or are essentially upgrades to previous weapons. The standard pistol is essentally a paperweight after you get 2+ new guns, and likely will never touch it again. In addition, the magnum is a direct upgrade to the pistol, outclassing it in every single way, and essentally one-shotting everything, so long as it lands a headshot. What sucks about it is that the Pistol still takes up a weapon slot after the Magnum is unlocked, and Magnum ammo is only plentiful in the late-game. A less powerful Magnum with more plentiful ammo would have been prefered. This is only one example of this; there are many guns/items only useful for a specific part of the game, and make navigating the weapons and items a chore. \n\nTo break up the shooting section, there are essentally \"puzzles\" that show off part of the physics engine or force you to navigate through tight corridors. Many of these are fun: the water puzzle where you have to bouy the ramp upwards to be able to make a jump immediately comes to mind. However, many of these are just simply \"find x of y\" and \"find this hidden air duct and climb through it.\" Overall, these sections often lead to the player spending several minutes just attempting to find out how to pass through an area. This prompts flashbacks to Nova Prospekt, where I spent more than 15 minutes walking around one room blocked by a force field with turrets shooting me, only to find out there was an air duct that led around the room. \n\nStamina. Dear god, stamina. It's fine for running, when it seems realistic. However, the FLASHLIGHT draws from the same meter. Why, God, why? I eventually just turned up my brightness enough to see in dark places without the flashlight, as it dies at very inopertune times.\n\nAt other times you are forced to play the waiting game. Not for an NPC or a door to open, no no, for you to be taken to a far away place. The final level, the Citadel, does this: the player must jump into essentally moving metal straightjackets that carry them for several minutes in nearly dead silence.\n\nAnd to top everything off, there is a room in one of the last areas of the game that is essenally a stealth section where you avoid tripping off lasers. If you run out of the room quickly enough if a laser is tripped, or something else triggers it, which is a human reaction when alarms go off, the room will close, essentally breaking that part of the game, not allowing progress.

[/i]\nHalf-life 2 to sequel jednego z najlepszych fpsów w historii, jakim jest Half-Life 1. Studio Valve, założyciele steama, w 2004 roku zrobiło moim zdaniem kawał świetnej roboty, do dziś uznaję to za najlepszą strzelankę w dziejach, która przebiła nawet pierwszą część.\n\nPlusy:\n- Fabuła: pięknie opowiedziana historia praktycznie nie występuje w innych tytułach, a tutaj mamy do czynienia z arcydziełem, na podstawie którego mogłaby powstać wspaniała książka.\n- Gameplay: Ciągle zmieniające się krajobrazy, na których przychodzi nam walczyć, super wykonane strzelanie, w późniejszych etapach gra zamienia się w gta, kiedy to dostajemy łodkę i samochód (oczywiście nie ma tu gangsterki, chociaż żołnierzy rozjeżdżać można), ciągłe wciskanie jakichś guzików, legendarne brońki itp. To po prostu trzeba poczuć.\n- Fizyka: Silnik Source miał przede wszystkim szokować fizyką, wszakże Gordon Freeman jest fizykiem. Wyszło świetnie - zagadki logiczne oparte na fizyce, rzucanie różnymi przedmiotami, ragdolle, które chyba wszyscy kojarzą, jak nie z rozgrywki, to np. z Garry's moda. Ta gra ma 14 lat i oczywiście dzisiejsze tytuły mają to wykonane lepiej (a w zasadzie dokładniej, niż tu).\n- Grafika: 14 lat minęło, dziś może to być co najwyżej poprawne, ale mi tam się podoba. Jakby ktoś przerzucił się z silnika GoldSrc, na którym chodził pierwszy Half-Life, na Source, to i tak doznałby szoku, że to tylko 6 lat różnicy.\n- Tajemnice: Gman, advisory, kombinat, sam Gordon - nie wszystko zostało tutaj wyjaśnione i wymaga doprecyzowania. Chociaż moim zdaniem owa otoczka tajemniczości spowodowana jest brakiem trzeciej części (Gaben, to do ciebie!), to sprawdza się genialnie i sensowne było, żeby nie ujawniać tego od razu. ALE wyjaśnienie wszystkiego by się przydało w 2018 roku, GABEN!\n- Achievementy: Half-Life 2 na steamie był jednym z pionierów systemu osiągnięć. Nie ma ich może tylu, co w takim PAYDAYu 2, ale moim zdaniem sprawdzają się świetnie, sam nie mam ich wszystjich nabitych, pomimo całkiem nielichemu licznikowi godzin u mnie nabitych.\n- Gravity gun: Muszę coś dodawać?\n- Klimat: Postkomuna, zastąpiona jeszcze gorszym totalitaryzmem, wszechobecny brud i prowizorka, stojąca w opozycji do siedzib zła, np. takiej cytadeli, emocje w rozgrywce, ciemne uliczki spowite nocą i kanały, gdzie czają się headcrabowe zombie, walka rebeliancka - to wszystko mogę opisać jako sztuka. Nieco odmienny klimat od części pierwszej, gdzie najpierw walczyliśmy o swoje życie, a następnie ratowaliśmy świat w wymiarze Xen, tutaj walczymy o życie nie tylko swoje, ale i ludzi uciskanych przez Kombinat.\n- Poziom trudności: Sensowny. Podział na łatwy, normalny i trudny, każdy po prostu spełnia swoją rolę.\n- Świetnie napisane postacie: Alyx, Eli, dr Kleiner, Wallace Breen, Barney, ojciec Grigori, Lamarr, kurczę, nawet niemy Freeman jest w moim odczuciu bardzo ciekawą postacią.\nWady:\n- Zwykły pistolet: niby mała wada, ale w przeciwieństwie do innych broniek, pistolet coś mnie nie porwał.\n- Brak części trzeciej: No tego to ja nie wybaczę! Kieruję moje słowa do całego zarządu Valve, prosze, błagam, wołam, zróbcie wreszcię tą trzecią część, to nie możże się tak skończyć, a 10 lat to troszkę czasu.\n\nPodsumowanie: Sama gra dostaje ode mnie 10/10, nie znam lepszego fps-a, to po prostu musi być ograne przez każdego, no już, szukaj na g2a klucza za jakieś kilkadziesiąt groszy i do grania!","timestamp_created":1531919438,"timestamp_updated":1531919438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43604241","author":{"steamid":"76561198420888153","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":842,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":841,"last_played":1609776110},"language":"russian","review":"10/10 Одна из самых лучших игр, в который когда-либо я играл.","timestamp_created":1531918173,"timestamp_updated":1531918173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43603718","author":{"steamid":"76561198099117168","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":345,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":142,"last_played":1576915292},"language":"thai","review":"สนุก","timestamp_created":1531916053,"timestamp_updated":1635128170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43601505","author":{"steamid":"76561198144143786","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1562442563},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyunun akıcı bir hikayesi var. çok güzell tavsiye ederim :3","timestamp_created":1531906763,"timestamp_updated":1531906763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43601201","author":{"steamid":"76561198263316031","num_games_owned":1186,"num_reviews":402,"playtime_forever":920,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":920,"last_played":1531903796},"language":"spanish","review":"Ok, es un excelente juego, pero por las historias yo me esperaba un mind blown, pero creo que no fue asi, si es muy bueno, tiene una variedad de situaciones muy amplia, lanchas, autos, una ciudad de zombies, una campo de guerra, entre otras cosas, que si me hicieron emocionarme.

The sequel sticks very close to the blueprints set by the original, but also surpasses it in nearly every way. The game has its fair share of problems, but these are overshadowed by the game's many, many strong points. Basically, I can't think of a game I could recommend more than Half-Life 2.\n\nSTORY: 9.5/10 The game starts you off at the train station of City 17; where it becomes very clear that something is not right. You have obviously been placed here by the G-Man for a reason, but as of now, you don't know that reason. In the beginning of the game, you have no means of defense for yourself, so the Combine, an alien force of some kind, can attack you however they please. But this just gives you more of an incentive to get your payback; and you shall get that payback very soon. The story itself is good and intriguing. You will be captivated from the very beginning to the end. The only problem with it is that the game leaves a bit too many questions unanswered. The ending is a little bit too much of a cliffhanger. There is a positive aspect to this, though. It means that Valve will almost certainly make a sequel. It would have also been nice to have even more run-ins with the game's excellent characters, as they were very memorable. Overall, though, the story is truly great.\n\nSOUND: 9.0/10 Half-Life 2's sound is not the game's strongest point, but that's not to say that it is bad. In fact, the sound in the game is anything but. The voice acting in the game is top-notch, and you will surely be impressed by it. The characters in the game have a very nice script and deliver their lines very well. The sound effects in the game are also, for the most part, exceptional. The weapons pack a very punchy sound and are very nice. The soundtrack in the game isn't around all that much, but when it is, it is very apparent. It only plays about a dozen times during the game, but it makes those moments very memorable. The soundtrack itself, though, is only pretty good. It just doesn't seem all that fitting, but it is nice none-the-less. There are also same sound glitches every now and then, but they are not too bad. All in all, the sound in the game is very, very good. \n\nGAMEPLAY: 9.5/10 Even if everything else in the game was great, if the gameplay wasn't good, the game wouldn't be good. But gameplay is another place where Half-Life 2 stands above the rest. In most ways, the gameplay of Half-Life 2 isn't revolutionary or innovative, but it sure is fun. The amount of variety in the game is also pretty impressive. The most interesting item in the game is the Gravity Gun. You are able to pick up objects and throw them, both in combat and in use for the game's several puzzles. The puzzles in the game are pretty simple, but are a nice change of pace. It would have been nice to see some more puzzles in the later stages of the game, though. There are also two rather lengthy sequences in the game that involve vehicles. The vehicles in the game are a little awkward to drive, but are, however, fun. The weapons are pretty well balanced, for the most part. The only real balancing issues are that the pistol can be a little too useful at times, and the last weapon given to you in the game feels very overpowered. You will go up against a variety of enemies in the game, from the menacing Combine soldiers, to zombies, to antlions. The Combine are the most advanced enemies in the game, from an artificial intelligence standpoint. The zombies just tend to lumber over to you pretty slowly. The artificial intelligence in the game is great. The game's length is also more than satisfactory; coming in at close to 20 hours for the average player. There are three different difficulty levels to choose from in the game; easy, normal, and hard. Easy will definitely be too simple for the vast majority of players, but hard should suit even the better players. You will be fighting alone for most of the game, but in the later stages you will sometimes have allies. The allies in the game are not as helpful as you might have hoped, but they are still a nice gameplay addition.\n\nGRAPHICS: 10/10 From a technological standpoint, Half-Life 2 stands above all else. The graphics in the game are truly stunning, and are some of the best, if not the best, graphics out there. Everything from facial animation, to shadowing, to textures is astounding. The game also holds up at an impressive frame rate, even on older computers. The art direction in the game is also a sight to behold. Everything about the game conveys the look that was intended; and the result is nothing short of spectacular. All the explosions in the game are also great. Lighting and shadowing is also beautifully mastered in the game. The superb facial animations truly bring the characters to life like no other game has been able to do. But what is even more amazing than Half-Life 2's graphics, is its incredible use of physics. Graphically, the game is virtually unsurpassed. \n\nMULTIPLAYER: 9.5/10 Originally, Half-Life 2 shipped with only Counter Strike: Source; but was soon updated with a death match mode. The better of the two is easily Counter Strike: Source, although Half-Life 2: death match is better than you might expect. Counter Strike: Source is just a graphically updated version of the hit game Counter Strike.\n\nOverall Score:\n\n9.6\n\nout of ten.","timestamp_created":1531778562,"timestamp_updated":1531778562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43572697","author":{"steamid":"76561198799341364","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":117,"last_played":1514759594},"language":"brazilian","review":"Receita de churros \n\n1 e 1/2 xícara (chá) de leite\n1/2 xícara (chá) de água\n2 colheres (sopa) de margarina ou manteiga\n2 xícaras (chá) de farinha de trigo\nsal a gosto\naçúcar a gosto\ncanela a gosto\n\nEm uma panela, adicione o leite, a água, a manteiga e o sal\nQuando o leite ferver, adicione a farinha de trigo e mexa rápido até a massa soltar do fundo da panela\nColoque a massa em um saco de confeiteiro com o bico pitanga, depois faça tirinhas com a massa e frite\nMisture a canela e o açúcar, depois passe nos churros fritos","timestamp_created":1531775601,"timestamp_updated":1531775601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43572465","author":{"steamid":"76561198324777397","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1296,"last_played":1556087884},"language":"spanish","review":"Half Life 3 confirmado y explicare por que:\n\n\nHay 2 expansiones del Half life\nHalf Life:Opposing Force\nHalf Life:Blue Shift\nHalf Life: Source\n\nSi sumamos esas tres expansiones con el Half Life,nos dara 4\n\nLuego está Half Life 2.
