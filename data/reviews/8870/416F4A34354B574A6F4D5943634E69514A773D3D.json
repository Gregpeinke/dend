Звукорежиссура - далеко за пределами игровой индустрии: эта высокая планка задана еще со времен первого Bioshock. Недостатки движка Unreal компенсируются тем, что самые сильные его стороны раскрыты здесь во всей красе, когда как слабые - настолько замаскированы, что их не замечаешь. Конечно, многие обвинят Bioshock Infinite в излишней кинематографичности, но почему бы игре не быть таковой? \nИ еще одна особенность: оригинальное озвучивание. Я не отношусь к категории снобов, вопящих о кривом дубляже и прочих недостатках местной локализации, но в серии Bioshoсk отсутствие русской озвучки нисколько не огорчает, ибо чувствуется подход авторов игры к озвучиванию не как аттракциона на пару вечеров. \n","timestamp_created":1401640807,"timestamp_updated":1401640807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589110910892486572","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10313493","author":{"steamid":"76561198058282739","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2488,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1597,"last_played":1413435357},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um jogo que é uma obra prima !

Infinite has provided several fun things to think about in terms of its story and atmospheric execution.  \n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n-- The story is very interesting, moreso even than what made us like this series in the original Bioshock.  It also opens a LOT of possibilities for the future of the series, which I will not get into here because of spoilers. You have a companion through most of the game as well, named Elizabeth, who is an excellent addition to the gameplay and story that the original Bioshock lacked.\n\n-- The sound effects are at a good level of volume and seem to match up properly, which can always be a little jarring through a playthrough otherwise.  The voice-acting was also rather good.  I also enjoyed the music selections that were  utilized here.  There were actually more choices available in the original Bioshock, as that takes place a few decades later, but at least the selections were loyal to the game's timeline, which is admirable. \n\n-- The graphics are a huge step up from previous titles, which may sound like a \"No duh\", but we've all seen sequels that have actually taken steps backwards, and Bioshock Infinite does not do this.  A game that takes place [spoiler]on a city in the clouds[/spoiler] demands some atmospheric justice, and this game delivers.  I've spent more than one guilty set of minutes forgetting what i was supposed to be doing because i was staring  at  the sky, heh.\n\n[b] The Bad(?) [/b]\n\n-- You are only able to carry two guns with you at a time.  This may seem to be detrimental at times, but it DOES kind of make sense to me, which is why I did not terribly mind it while in-game.  I mean, a guy carrying a shotgun,  a pistol, a hand cannon, and at least two bigger variety guns all at once isn't going to be jumping around like mad, and be able to run.  Just  be sure to switch off sometimes, there's plenty of chances to reclaim a favorite once you find more ammo for it.\n\n-- Vending machine prices are rather high in the game, meaning that you won't be getting a lot of upgrades at first.  Also, there is no longer any hacking, as there was  in the original Bioshock, to reduce the prices any that way.  But you will eventually find enough money that it won't matter heavily, just do not expect to buy out machines at the early stages.\n\nAlso, forewarning, this game takes place in 1912, in Columbia. Expect some religious craziness and racism.  If it makes you feel any better, you are perfectly within your game-rights to shoot just about anyone who does that if it bothers you!","timestamp_created":1401568517,"timestamp_updated":1401568662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10303362","author":{"steamid":"76561198033671014","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":4456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1744,"last_played":1404775780},"language":"english","review":"Great game with excellent graphics.

Where Bioshock had charismatic villians that brought the story together nicely, Infinite has one lame villian that has a handful of lines. Interesting villains with well-developed personalities and motives are one of the most important things to making a good story, and Infinite is totally lacking this. \n\nThere are a few redeeming qualities, though. \n\nFor one, the voice actors are very skilled and do a great job with their characters. Especially the actress of Elizabeth, who is sort of a sidekick character. That reminds me, the game mechanics are a bit revoloutionary. Elizabeth doesn't fight, but she does toss Booker (the player) ammo, health kits, and other useful items. She has the power to opens tears, dimensional rifts into other worlds which can summon objects to help the player. She also provides some company and comentary which is a nice change of pace from most shooters, Bioshock 1 included. Overall, she is a compelling character that adds flavor to the game. Elizabeth is probably the best thing about this game, in fact.\n\nThe setting, the floating city of Columbia, is also totally unique and an intriging sci-fi concept. The motifs and visuals are a change of pace from Bioshock 1 and 2, as it is bright and beautiful rather than dark and creepy. The technlogy has a new spin on sci-fi as well, much liek Bisohock. It's like futuristic tech mixed with old civil war weapons (the games takes place in the early 1900's). Trust me, it's pretty trippy. As a sci-fi buff, I find anything of the genre that is creative and unique to be compelling. However, I find Infinite's setting and style (much like Bioshock) to be especially cool. \n\nWhat people talk about most though is the ending. Up until the end, the story is pretty straight forward. You're a badass gunfighter who has to rescue a girl with strange powers from a strange city and its denizens who worship her. But about 20 minutes before the end, it takes on dramatic and bizzare plot twists. They're pretty complex, and it takes a while to sort out what happened. If that sort of thing bothers you, you may not like it. It does make sense though after a while, and is actually pretty cool.  \n\nAdvantages: \n-unique, beautiful setting and technology\n-story driven and complex narrative\n-compelling sidekick that ties the game togethter\n-excellent voice acting\n-mechanics are revoloutionary\n \nDisadvantages:\n-gameplay is pure shooter\n-no horror or survival element\n-lacks a compelling villian\n\nI think the advantages outwiegh the disadvantages, though Infinite still isn't as good as Bioshock 1. However, it is still one of the best games I've ever played. \n\n","timestamp_created":1401397596,"timestamp_updated":1401397596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471391409635543823","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10278703","author":{"steamid":"76561198122494286","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":504,"last_played":1398456942},"language":"russian","review":"Просто отличная игра всем советую поиграть !","timestamp_created":1401392783,"timestamp_updated":1401392783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10278478","author":{"steamid":"76561198119728214","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":743,"last_played":1459012290},"language":"spanish","review":"Obra de arte.","timestamp_created":1401391354,"timestamp_updated":1401391354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10278277","author":{"steamid":"76561198000689440","num_games_owned":538,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3471,"last_played":1401155117},"language":"english","review":"BioShock Infinite isn't perfect - far from it.

Первый и абсолютно несущественный - иногда для того чтобы направить сюжет в нужную сторону используются крайне примитивные приёмы, которые уж слишком очевидны, особенно в контрасте с остальным повествованием. И второй - геймплей.\n\nГеймплей примитивен до тошноты. Игрок попадает в большую локацию, сражается с парой-тройкой волн врагов и идёт дальше. Всё. Я только что описал ВЕСЬ геймплей в этой игре. Разработчики явно пытались разнообразить происходящее фишками вроде луж бензина и автоматических пулемётов, которые можно использовать против врагов, но кому это нужно если есть хэдшоты? Недостатка в патронах никогда не будет, недостатка в здоровье тоже. И даже если вы умудрились умереть вас всё равно воскрешают на том же месте немного востановив врагам здоровье. В этой игре невозможно проиграть в обычном режими даже если очень этого хотеть. Я не могу всерьёз воспринимать утверждения по поводу идеального геймплея в Инфините. Тому кто так говорит нужно либо снять розовые очки, либо поиграть в какой-нибудь хороший шутер вроде Dishonored. Или даже в Half-Life 2. Этой игре 10 лет, пора бы уже научиься делать нормальные FPS.\n\nНо за то всё остальное в игре выше всяких похвал. Сюжет, музыка, атмосфера, герои. Работа художников, сценаристов и музыкантов создала нечтно действительно неповторимое. Более того, если бы BSI был фильмом или скажем книгой он бы многое потерял именно без своей интерактивности. В это нужно поиграть, испытать мир Колумбии самостоятельно.\n\nИтак, игра хорошая, которую и правда не стоит пропускать. Ни в коем случае не шедевр и не революция, но с большой любовью сделанное произведение искусства. Не с любовью к жанру FPS, а с любовью к миру Bioshock Infinite.","timestamp_created":1401387474,"timestamp_updated":1401389687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516449928283691406","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10277519","author":{"steamid":"76561198123116421","num_games_owned":359,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":575,"last_played":1402830561},"language":"english","review":"Fucking AMAZING!!!","timestamp_created":1401385486,"timestamp_updated":1401385486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10276579","author":{"steamid":"76561198015908785","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1910,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":780,"last_played":1525345712},"language":"german","review":"Eben fertig geworden und absolut gebrainfuckt worden sehr geiles Ende zu einem sehr geilen Spiel.

Not exactly a Call of Duty, I guess, but not very far from it either. I was playing on the \"Hard\" difficulty\". Lots of guns and powers to use, but I found my favorites somewhere in the middle and never touched the others again. Sometimes you can interact with the environment for example to set an oil puddle ablaze while enemies walk through, but these occassions are rather rare, and timing isn't always easy. It seemed simplier and easier to me to just fire my guns at them right away. The enemy AI felt rather bad. I could be crouching behind a small pillar or crate to wait for my shield to regenerate and sometimes none of the enemies would try to flank me. If they tried they weren't doing it aggressively enough but stumbling around before shooting leaving me enough time to take them out. There was a \"boss\" who was harder to defeat because he would constantly spawn minions, and those Handymen kept pushing me around because they are are glued to your tail and hit hard in melee. There is no serious death penalty or sense in struggling harder though.\n\nThe skylines are either not always there or I haven't always noticed, so they not necessarily make up for the somewhat lacking combat. Freight hooks you will sometimes find too. But again: Why jump up there, possibly expose myself to enemy fire, to charge at them with my skyhook and dropping into the middle of some semi-open spaces - possibly exposing myself again -, if I can just take a small peek from around a small corner and do a headshot with a sniper rifle from a safe distance instead? I used the skylines to zip around if Handymen were closely behind me, and in some instances because it felt a bit epic doing that with gunboats around to drop on and harrassing their crew close up, but those moments were few and change little about the rail-ish nature of the gameplay.\n\nI've seen the press apparently praising the AI and companion nature of Elizabeth. She is a great companion story-/narration-wise and I liked her a lot, she is nicely animated, her voice actress did a great job and she has an interesting personality (she is neither some stupid damsel in distress nor some oversexualized bitch for men to stare at), but in terms of gameplay she is overrated. Some wrote she would greatly take care of herself. Actually no, she does not. It's just that the enemies pay zero attention to her. Story-wise capturing her should have priority for the enemies over killing me, the player, and yet there were a few instances in which she exposed herself to the enemies in silly ways. There is no real stealthing, but sometimes enemies aren't initially aware of your presence, and one time I was sneaking up on a few of them. They didn't notice me, but Elizabeth \"decided\" to run up ahead in plain sight. Nothing happened. She just drolled back to me like these enemies weren't even there. If you don't pay attention to such things you may believe she was controlled by some smart AI, but I did notice and it's just not as fancy as some people put it.\n\nAlso, the degree to which she interacts with you is fairly limited. Yes, she throws supplies at you when you need them. But it's just a \"Hit button X\" prompt. Yes, you can make her open \"tears\" to spawn supplies, cover, freight hooks, decoys, environmental hazards and whatnot during combat. But it rarely matters much. And again: It's just you holding down a button when prompted. And Elizabeth can open locks, but again it's a mere prompt to make her do something that takes like a second. There is no real added gameplay value by her doing it. Booker could have done that himself. It's nice to have her do it instead, it sure doesn't hurt the companion idea, but I doubt it to be the massive edge and innovation in gameplay design as some reviewers or press representitives apparently believe it to be.","timestamp_created":1401349422,"timestamp_updated":1401350753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552657604217529297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10271836","author":{"steamid":"76561198004410202","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":733,"last_played":1592015467},"language":"english","review":"Just like the other games in the series, Bioshock Infinite is an instant classic.

The plasmids have been replaced with \"Vigors\" and each new ability unlocks all new ways to create chaos and mayhem in your wake. As with Rapture's dismal halls, Columbia rewards those who venture off the beaten path, often revealing the city's dark secrets and history. The gameplay may be the same as previous Bioshock entries, but the skylines and \"tears\" offer a few surprises and create unique advantages in the battlefield.

Auch auf den kleinsten Einstellungen, ist man immer noch überwältigt. Die Story ist sehr gut geschrieben, auch mit vielen Wendungen.
