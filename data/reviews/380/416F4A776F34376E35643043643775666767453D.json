This is a direct sequel, and rather assumes you know the NPCs already.  The original game is also great, so playing it is no cost.  Also, if you [i]don't[/i] like HL2 you won't enjoy this either.\n [*] Are you willing to play an unfinished story? As you should know, this was intended to be the first of three episodes making a complete game, and Episode Three has never been, and likely will never be, released.  Indeed, the only people I can understand not wanting to play this are those who can't leave stories unfinished.\n[/olist]\n\nIt's a shame, because HL2:E1 has a lot to recommend it even compared to other HL games.  The chance to play with the supercharged Gravity Gun again is welcome. The option to set Zombies on fire is always a plus.  We learn more about the Combine here than in all of HL2, and also get to learn more about Alyx.  This game even manages to make an escort mission somewhat enjoyable!\n\nReally, the Half-Life series is excellent, and the Episodes would be indisputably the highlight, if only the third had been released.

These are as much of expansion packs in the epilogue of the Half-Life 2 campaign as they are an entirely new game broken into parts. Episodic models of the mid-2000s did not have as bad of a reputation as they do nowadays with the idea of unfinished games, and the episodes of Half-Life are example of the benefits of its model as well as the possible downsides. As much complaints people have with Episode 1 due to its length and its linearity that focuses on the well-executed scripted levels of the base-game like Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt, EP1 manages to take the best parts of the gameplay of HL2 into a game that does a better job masquerading its tutorials as they shifted the focus on the combat rather than the puzzles.\n\nBefore we continue with the review of Episode 1, as a reminder I will not be discussing the recent leak about Half-Life 2: Episode 3 until we get to the end of the Half-Life 2: Episode 2 review. This review mainly serves as a retrospective view of Episode 1 to follow-up my review of Half-Life 2, so if you want my thoughts about that section of the game or the end of the series then it’s best to read the review associated with it. EP1 should be remembered not so much as embodying the pitfalls of episodic models that may begin strong/weak or that rely on its future iterations for closure; instead, it should be remembered of how these stand-alone expansions can refine the mechanics of a finished game and continue the development of the future of a series by recusing their assets. \n\n[h1]Gordon & Alyx Went Up the Citadel to Fetch A Plot McGuffin[/h1]\n\nEpisode 1 begins immediately after the events of Half-Life 2’s ending where instead of fading off into obscurity yet again for the G-Man’s plans Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance are rescued from one dire situation and put into another. The two of them must escape the Citadel impending on its inevitable collapse by going through the bowels of the Citadel tower and escaping through City 17 from its remaining trainyard before the portal to the Combine’s home world opens again. Immediately following this minor victory is where the game ends the first episode at another cliffhanger ending that has become a staple of the series that leaves the player desiring another adventure for Gordon Freeman.\n\nSomething that has become more apparent with each chapter of the original Half-Life 2 and its episodes is that every level can be condensed down to one sentences about each level, and the series of chapters would read off as a synopsis rather than the full-scale story itself. EP1 is perhaps the most blatant of these set-ups as the game constantly paces the player with the simple objective of escaping the city with various deviations in the player that could be read off from the script as, “Gordon and Alyx were _____ when suddenly….” This isn’t so much a complaint about the obvious set-up of these level designs but it showcases how rather deceptively simple these campaigns are as the player is always given a clear direction and a current obstacle that makes every moment punctuated like the end of a sentence. What this really tells is not that the campaign itself needs to have an engaging storyline with complex narrative tricks but that structuring a Half-Life game is really closer to a bullet-list than a plot-structure where the level-design and gameplay obstacles are the main attraction.\n\nThis is perhaps why as short and sweet as EP1 is compared to the base game and EP2 are structured it’s why replaying EP1 is always a worthwhile turning point of the series because the level-design and set-pieces are as memorable as Ravenholm. Similar to Ravenholm and other linear levels of Half-Life 2 the sequences of EP1 are moment-to-moment obstacles that range from using the charged Gravity Gun to deactivate a reactor without guns to scavenging between a pistol, shotgun and gravity gun with Alyx in the bowels of the tower amongst the zombies and Antlions. These obstacles are largely combat-focused, including the puzzles themselves such as closing Antlion holes with cars, as well as working with Alyx and the other resistance members to fend off the waves of Combine as the remaining people make their escape. The result makes for a much more engaging experience than the many physics seesaw puzzles of the original game, and what was simply another excuse to get Gordon back on his feet yet again is one of the better sections of the entire Half-Life 2 experience.\n\n[h1]”You Have Destroyed So Much, But What Have You Created? Can You Name One?”[/h1]\n\nOther than the brevity of its campaign and its somewhat formulaic composition of an experience, the only bad things about Episode 1 itself is that it’s more of the same except more polished and more geared towards its combat, which are not bad things compared to the slower sections of Half-Life 2. Even the narrative elements, though few and far between compared to the base game and Episode 2, are condensed down into the only notes needed for the player to follow along that expands upon what players know about the lore of Half-Life. Compared to the insignificance of the first Half-Life expansions and how poorly Blue Shift was as a stand-alone title, EP1 does more to redeem itself from the ire of its fanbase. Perhaps the only thing it is guilty of much like Episode 2 is that it is doomed to repeat the same mistakes with its ending of holding the player’s attention long enough for a future sequel to continue where it previously left off and bringing up story-arcs that will likely never be given an in-game resolution to reward the player’s patience of the wait.","timestamp_created":1503863446,"timestamp_updated":1503863446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554881095886230469","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34534956","author":{"steamid":"76561198156738108","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":12,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1503855373},"language":"english","review":"I´ll be honest Half-Life,Half-Life 2 and now this episode One these games were one of the worst games i played in my entire life such a waste of time..

2: Episode One powstał w celu szybszej dystrybucji gier i krótszego czasu czekania na następne części, (Różnica między dwoma HLami trwała 6 lat) lecz równocześnie z tego powodu nadal nie mamy Half-Life'a 3. Dla niektórych to mógł być dobry pomysł, ale jak kto uważa. W grze znowu wcielamy się w Gordona Freemana i wraz z Alyx Vance będziemy musieli uciec z City 17, zanim całe wybuchnie. \n\nGrafika się postarzała, lecz w delikatny sposób, więc granie w nią nie sprawia bólu oczu jak w innych grach wydanych w tamtym czasie. Rozgrywka nadal jest dynamiczna, choc strzelanie wydaje się łatwiejsze niż jest w dzisiejszych grach. Muzyka jest skomponowana bardzo dobrze i pasuje do rozgrywanego poziomu, scenariusz Marca Laidlawa jest bardzo angażujący, gdyż w grach Valve scenariusz był pisany w taki sposób, aby gameplay nie wydawał się nudny i dlatego gra daje odgroma frajdy. \nZ wad produkcji, to jest jej długość, gdyż można przejść grę w 2-4 godziny oraz czasami podczas niektórych momentów można poczuć nudę. \n\nZalety: \n- Grafika do dzisiaj nadal się nie postarzała się drastycznie\n- Świetny gameplay\n- Klimatyczna muzyka\n- Dobra fabuła\n- Daje dużo frajdy\n\nWady:\n- Momentami jednak nudna :v\n- Krótka (Może jakieś 3-4 godziny) \n\nTa gra jest po prostu bardzo dobra, obowiązek dla fanów serii Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1503517525,"timestamp_updated":1552139330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60000002384185791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34444097","author":{"steamid":"76561198295628372","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1618231989},"language":"turkish","review":"E F S A N E","timestamp_created":1503512943,"timestamp_updated":1503512943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34420771","author":{"steamid":"76561198257924313","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1651875234},"language":"english","review":"i like this game it's a good sequel of half life 2","timestamp_created":1503424235,"timestamp_updated":1503424235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34417375","author":{"steamid":"76561198045322504","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":664,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":573,"last_played":1538926123},"language":"english","review":"Yes.

The game is difficult and you will die a lot but with a little patience you will get through its 8 or so hour campaign\n\nHalf-Life 2: Episode One offers some good level design with a modding community which is still alive to this very day!
