The reason I enjoyed Ep. 2 so much is because I always liked the bits of countryside in Half-Life 2, such as: Highway 17 and Water Hazard.

Makes sense why everyone wants HL3 [/h1]\n\nA marvel of escalation to continue the story of half life 2, using excellent time management for such a short gameplay, keeping the formula and packing huge amounts of hype and intense emotions. It is understandable why a third part is so requested.\n\nAs a direct successor to the events of Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2 Episode One, Half-Life 2 Episode Two is the second (and last) expansion of Half-Life 2, which like the expansion above, continues the story directly.\n\n[list]\n\n [*]This expansion, like the previous one and everything related specifically to Half-Life 2, works based on the Source engine, the quintessential engine which offers a large number of possibilities and an aesthetic that is very well preserved over time. However, the graphics at their maximum configuration point began to show slightly more detail than in the previous titles, so that, despite using the same graphics engine, its bases were more modern.\n\n [*]The environments that this expansion makes us aware of remain at the same level as the original title, offering a wide variety of different scenarios which fully manage to express the situation of the place at the time and achieve a fast and effective immersion.\n\n [*]Having recently finished episode one, I expected a story just as fast and not fully exploited in relation to gameplay time, however, the story turned out to be the main focus of the entire title in my opinion, you go from a simple and exclusive mission in Episode One to give rise to a possible solution to the biggest problem of the entire title, but not before going through tragic, terrifying and joyful moments. The history of this title reaches the level of depth of the original title taking into account the capacity that this title had to express itself and develop in such a short time. In addition to this, the story makes us understand that not only has it improved, but because of the events that occur in it, something huge is approaching, and this, together with the harsh ending it has, definitely makes it a magnificent continuation at the level of your story.\n\n [*]Our relationship with Alyx develops to a great extent and everything that happened previously is kept in memory, but the most outstanding thing is the value that Eli (Eli Vance) has approaching the end of the title, because in addition to strengthening his relationship with the player , becomes a very important character, but not for the game, but for the player, due to his relationship with a certain character that I will not mention.\n\n [*]This expansion maintains all the classic action and frenzy of the original game, going through various types of combat, defense and other ways of interacting with the environment. However, it is important to highlight the time factor. This expansion, which hardly takes more than 10 hours to complete, manages to test you in a wide variety of scenarios and offering you a list of tools at your disposal which was not entirely well managed in Episode One, which makes everyone feel this chapter as more than a simple chapter, becoming a kind of direct sequel to the level of its predecessor.\n\n[/list]\n\nHalf Life 2 Episode Two was really a surprise for me, waiting for a short, simple, but beautiful new chapter, and receiving a real gem which he made the most of as much time as he could, developing diverse gameplays, extraordinary scenarios and a story that also to continue a quite exciting one, he has made it climb to unimaginable levels thanks to the enormous possibilities offered by its ending.","timestamp_created":1653063548,"timestamp_updated":1653063589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115739098","author":{"steamid":"76561199135156613","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1653064627},"language":"turkish","review":"Bir Efsanenin Devam Oyunu Ne Di yem Ve Son Oyunu:(","timestamp_created":1653060523,"timestamp_updated":1653060523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115737937","author":{"steamid":"76561198322920131","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":451,"last_played":1653058937},"language":"russian","review":"👍","timestamp_created":1653058922,"timestamp_updated":1653058922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115735904","author":{"steamid":"76561198996487129","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":766,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":766,"last_played":1651360839},"language":"english","review":"-rep no Peter Griffin","timestamp_created":1653056036,"timestamp_updated":1653056036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115735841","author":{"steamid":"76561197961042369","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":381,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1653055815},"language":"english","review":"Well... now... listen carefully, my dear.

Of course, being based on another solid contender for that title, its a given. It still looks great. It still plays great. It all still works just like it did in 2007, and its still as engrossing. Better than Episode One owing to its more expansive environments. Short, but sweet. The episodic format really worked for me. It expands the story in a well paced, bite-sized chunk that continues Episode One's more character driven narrative with memorable set pieces, the usual clever puzzles and engaging combat. I couldn't wait for Episode Three and to see where things went next. Would it end there? Where else could things go? Back then, anything seemed possible. \n\nThen nothing happened. We all know the story. The cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers after a masterful slap-in-the-face ending. I won't retread this all too familiar ground. Part of me though it was for the best that the story was left open. Then Alyx happened, and for the first time in over ten years, there is new Half-Life. If you have VR. I don't, but what's important is that it happened...and if that can happen, then Half-Life 3 can happen, and it was that revelation that prompted me to revisit HL2 and its expansions with a slightly refreshed perspective, for the first time in years....and yeah, its still a damn good game. Still one of the very best.\n\nAll is not yet forgiven, but the dream lives again.

Выпуск \"Оранжевой коробки\" в целом был событием знаковым. Эпизод 2 под завязку загружен атмосферой HL2 и новым лором, в который вплели еще и Portal с Aperture Science. Но, как и со всеми прочими играми Valve, это все еще и стоит на каркасе из плотного геймплея. Как будто HL2 в сжатом, концентрированном виде, обросшая новыми механиками и выгодно повторяющая старые. \n\nКто-то до сих пор ждет завершения сюжета (который уже успели отретконить, кста), но оглядываясь назад, лучше ждать по 10-15 лет, чем повторять судьбу, например, Mass Effect 3 с его слитыми интригами и неудовлетворяющей концовкой. Так или иначе, удовольствие от игр серии HL получается в основном от геймплея. (но все же хотелось бы поглядеть чего-нибудь еще в рамках этого сюжета на своем веку). \n\nРекомендую, кстати, играть с оригинальной озвучкой. На то у меня несколько аргументов. Первый - HL2 озвучивали внутренними силами valve и правила бука, что привело к некоторому наслоению и стилистической неровности голосов. В эпизодах это усугубилось тем, что их переводила уже бука целиком. Поэтому голоса, например, Илая и Джи-мэна в них другие. Второй - может это конкретно мне попавшийся баг, но реплики очень часто не вмещались в хронометраж и были обрезаны. Может конечно тайминги порушила реструктуризация движка и прочие патчи, вышедшие за годы после релиза, но на момент мая 2022 года, версия с последним патчем для steam deck, у меня было так.","timestamp_created":1652121376,"timestamp_updated":1652121376,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115217827","author":{"steamid":"76561198319523163","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1652133055},"language":"english","review":"Hey look, Half-Life 2","timestamp_created":1652121341,"timestamp_updated":1652121341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115216568","author":{"steamid":"76561199012570896","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2047,"last_played":1652367960},"language":"turkish","review":"Bu serinin en son pc oyunu olmasıyla ( hl alyx hariç) cidden güzel bir oyun ve flash light barının hev suit barının ayrırması cidden güzel olmuş ve güzel bir uzunlukta umarım Half Life 3 harika bir oyun olur çok fazla olasılık var keşke Vale oyunlarının 3. oyunlarının yapsa neyse bu yorumu okuyorsan al bu oyunu asla pişman olmadın ve sende olmuyacaksın :))))","timestamp_created":1652119334,"timestamp_updated":1652119334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115212504","author":{"steamid":"76561199089722562","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1652115316},"language":"spanish","review":"Brutal","timestamp_created":1652113293,"timestamp_updated":1652113293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115212222","author":{"steamid":"76561199152784917","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":71,"playtime_at_review":316,"last_played":1659773574},"language":"polish","review":"100% gang be like vortigaunts gangbanging alyx","timestamp_created":1652112859,"timestamp_updated":1652112880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115206897","author":{"steamid":"76561198823255148","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1888,"last_played":1652015510},"language":"russian","review":"имба","timestamp_created":1652105284,"timestamp_updated":1652105284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmsHJ1IADca+9twM="}
