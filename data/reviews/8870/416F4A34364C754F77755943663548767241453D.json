Třetí díl série BioShock výborně doplňuje předchozí díly. Tentokrát neobsahuje morální volby a konec je tedy jediný. Vertikální pohyb a akce je snadný a společník výborně asistuje. Zpracování hry nelze nic vytknout.\n+ nádherné živoucí město plné obyvatel\n+ vertikální pohyb a akce\n+ dvě zbraně a vigory (speciální schopnosti)\n+ společník\n+ zajímavý příběh\n\n[h1]DĚJ[/h1]\nČtyřicetosm let před prvním BioShockem, v roce 1912, připluje k majáku nedaleko pobřeží u Maine muž jménem Booker DeWitt. Má najít a přivést do New Yorku Elizabeth, dívku z fotografie, a to nezraněnou. Tohle je jeho poslední šance jak splatit svůj dluh. Vybaven zbraní a instrukcemi stoupá po schodech majáku. Na půli cesty k vrcholu najde mrtvolu umučeného muže se vzkazem: \"NEZKLAMTE NÁS\". Na vrcholu na něj, po zahrání správné melodie na zvonky, čeká křeslo. Usedne a vylétá v kapsli k oblakům, ale ztrácí zbraň. Ve výšce přes 4,5 km se před ním objevuje nablýskané město Columbia, které ho vítá slovy:\n[i]\"Proč by nám seslal svého Spasitele, když nehneme prstem pro naši spásu? A ačkoli jsme si nezasloužili jeho milosrdenství, přivedl nás do nového ráje, poslední šance na vykoupení. A Prorok povede lid do nového Ráje. Sémě Prorokovo usedne na trůn a v ohni zahubí zástupy lidí.\"[/i]\n\n[h1]INSTALACE[/h1]\nDo základní hry lze doinstalovat [url=https://prekladyher.eu/preklady/bioshock-infinite-complete.235/]české titulky[/url] s úplnou diakritikou.\n\n[h1]JAK SE HRAJE[/h1]\nHra \"BioShock Infinite\" se ukládá pouze automaticky. Hráč se ujímá postavy DeWitta, který postupně získá i zvláštní schopnosti díky plazmidům, kterým se v této době říká vigory. Na rozdíl od prvních dvou dílů BioShocku může hrdina nést pouze dvě zbraně a mezi nimi přepínat. Takže není ověšen zbraněmi jak vánoční stromek ozdobami. Pokud hráč najde jinou zbraň, tak ji lze jednoduše zaměnit. Munici nosí pro všechny zbraně najednou. Vigory nejsou fyzické, takže těch může ovládnout mnoho, ale opět dva z nich si hráč určí jako aktivní. Změnu lze provést kdykoli během akce. Sílu a účinnost a další lze pro jednotlivé vigory a zbraně vylepšovat v prodejních automatech. V jiných typech lze dokupovat munici.\n\nPříběh je vyprávěn i díky zvukovým záznamům, které sice lze přehrát, ale nejsou přímo otitulkované. Přepis záznamu je k dispozici v menu hry. Krátce po začátku hry získá hráč cenného spojence, který nemůže zemřít a do akce se zapojuje jen pasivně. Kromě toho, že na požádání dokáže otevřít paklíči dveře a trezory, a že tu a tam najde nějaké peníze či munici, tak disponuje schopností, která zhmotní šikovné věcičky.\n\nPohyb je na rozdíl od předchozích dílů více dynamický a vertikální. Columbie je město, které je protkáno kolejnicemi vinoucími se nad zemí. Hráč musí kolejnice využít pro postup hrou anebo je může využít pro útoky shora. I přes počáteční obavy o náročnosti vertikální akce ji mohu hodnotit jako snadnou a jednoznačně přínosnou.","timestamp_created":1540848338,"timestamp_updated":1540848338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45505504","author":{"steamid":"76561198286165937","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":2385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2278,"last_played":1626818774},"language":"english","review":"this is the second best bioshock game. the gameplay is awesome, like the first, graohics are stylized but somehow not as good as the first, and the story? i just got back from finishing the game for the second time. i have no idea how many playthroughs i have started. what i do know is that i only finished two out of those very many (one being the first time i played it). here's why. this game's ending is probably the worst video game ending in video game history (that i know of), and is way up there with Fran Bow, which was equally as disappointing. why? as i mentioned earlier, the game is great! it's fun, intuitive, the story for the first half is engaging, and overall it's one of my most favorite games. which is why the ending sucks. because the game was fun. the ending leaves you in a fit of rage, it makes so little sense. it goes into some bullshit about time travel and all that, stuff you'd have a hard time understanding, and if you did you'd be able to refute every single point the game comes up with using simple logic. this ending doesnt deserve this good of a game. this ending is a stain on the bioshock franchise. a bigger stain than bioshock 2, which had a marginally better ending. bioshock infinite's ending brings up a catestrophic inconsistency in bioshock, which is the removal of good and bad endings. I'm not expecting them to add little sisters or anything, but jesus. this ending sucks balls and i'm mad bout it.

Overall i love story like all Bio Shock you never know where it is heading. Game got only one ending, what is sad, because it is explained why it is infinite and your choices does not affect almost anything. But what killed game for me were achievements, half of them havent got label, so if you are not googling you dont know what you are supposed to do, other problem is that 80% main game achievements are like \"kill X enemies with  ... weapon\". So you go, pick up one weapon and carry it around until you get required kills, then switch and do it over and over again. Lastly i decided to skip 3 achievements, becouse their difficlity is just too much for my nerves. (Complete game on even harder than hardest difficlity without buying items from vending machine, and complete blue ribbons in CiC DLC). Getting to DLC, clash in the clouds is similar to protector trials in Bio Shock 2, you go thru waves of enemies and for money you upgrade your gear or buy muzeum pieces that show making of Bio Shock game. As i mentioned blue ribbons achievement, it is almost impossible to get, because, there are 4 areas with 15 challenges with incrasing difficlity and blue ribbon challenge adds some condition to it, not too bad so far, but problem is when you die, blue ribbon failed and only way to replay it is to start again from first round. Shortly you play over half hour to get only one chance to complete blue ribbon, but any friendly fire, or missclick will fail it and you can try again. But not all DLC dissappointed Burials at Sea were really plesant experience, that expanded main story and gave like a good dot ath the end of story.","timestamp_created":1540158971,"timestamp_updated":1540158971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501701831817626953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45381203","author":{"steamid":"76561198201620245","num_games_owned":690,"num_reviews":468,"playtime_forever":1667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1667,"last_played":1540624305},"language":"english","review":"Checkpoints.\nTherefore, instant garbage.\n\nWhat kind of moron removes the free save feature of Bioshock and replaces it with a system that doesn't hold a candle ?

Like imma keep it real with you this game has nothing to do with Bioshock 1 & 2 besides the Lighthouse, rapture in one cutscene and the DLC. so if you're going through reviews for Infinite after having played 1 & 2. Just go back to Bioshock 2 because this game is a  sack of shit. I bought this game fully knowing what to expect when i bought the Bioshock Bundle even though having finished Bioshock Infinite on PS3 and my first impression was. Mediocre. but now i speak from experience with the franchise having experienced both previous tittles. and man there is so much wrong with this game there are a few things i can list as good so let me get that out of the way.\n+ Music\n+ Visuals\nThese are the only two things this game does well. like i love the music and setting and its kinda what sold me in the first place i enjoyed the first part of the game where you were just walking around not shooting shit yet. speaking of shooting shit there was so much missed potentional in this First Person Shooter. \n[Warning some spoilers up ahead but nothing game changing]\nHow do you think you would throw a ball at someone in an FPS? Because Infinite clearly thinks you're to fucking stupid to know how to aim so here is a QTE. honestly it would've been a fun tutorial to throw a fucking baseball at someone buuuut no QTE it is. Anyway enough of that of me renting about that segment.\n- You're locked to a 2 weapon system like in every generic FPS around the time unlike the take what you cna carry system and fucking keep it in previous tittles.\n- The game hands you choices on a silver platter with no impact on the story. Previous tittles did it hell i could even skip those choices most of the time, even though in previous tittles you would most likely make the same choice every time. wouldve been nice to have all choices have made an impact, like come on guys even Black Ops 2 did this to some degree.\n-Regenerating Health and Shield. Because the game thinks you're to dumb to use enviroment as cover or use first aid kids like previous tittles and thus comes Elizabeth. (More on her later.)\n-Remember cutscenes throughout the game Bioshock 1 & 2 players? better turn around cuz this one is full of them.\n-Remember vigors? different and cool power ups and you had a lot and could switch them up? uhm yeah you now have only 8, 4 of which are a stun.\n-Minigames for hacking? well there is no hacking here but lockpicking? nope thats where your companion Elizabeth comes in!\n-Exploration that is rewarding? This game is more linear then me buying clothes at the mall, there is some nice things on the side but its not as rewarding as my main goal.\n-Various and special enemies thrown away for as i like to call them. 'Target Practice'.\n-You know what has a high Variety? The guns. There is 2 versions of every gun with the ones you find later in the game being fucking god afwul trash.\n-Elizabeth. yup she's a problem on this list and before you say 'she's a strong independent woman' yeah no i agree but its for the wrong reason and btw [HEAVIER SPOILER WARNING]. So this game is gonna tell me a woman who was locked up in a fucking tower all her life, experimented on, only had a giant bird man as friend, made first contact with a strange man she just met, helped escape with him, saw she was experimented on and watched, sees her home get destroyed. But all is good and well a bit later when you're looking for her and she is just dancing like nothing ever happend? Her life twisted upside down but instead she ditches you and goes dancing? WHAT?! but she's still usefull right? yeah if by usefull you mean give me shit i could find on the ground then yes, but she opens locked doors because STORY. But you gotta escort her right? then why give her god mode and make all enemies want to kill me when she is their main goal, also why not rush over to her when she is reviving booker when you die, just saying.\n-Speaking of Songbird a while ago. Bioshock and its final levels were always a bit of a mess. Bioshock 1 had terrible boss whom we shall not continue on any further and Bioshock 2 well it didnt really have a final boss but i didnt mind, i got to dumb led into people while solving problems with bees. Bioshock Infinite though? beautifull dark night, thunder in the distance and you're going from zeplin to zeplin when suddenly Songbird.... is your fucking ally and you command him to take down zeplins only to lose control of him and have Elizabeth #OnlyThereForPlotReasonsLikeThese to kill him. IN FUCKING RAPTURE.\nAnd i know what you're thinking. ''what should i play instead of this game?''\nWant a game with a strong message? Abe's Oddysey\nWant a game in which you just shoot at stuff and the rest is unimportant? Space Invaders.\nWant a good Bioshock game? Bioshock 2\nWhat if i buy The Bioshock Bundle? Play Bioshock 1 > 2 > Burial at Sea DLC.\nAllright now this shit is over i can go yell ''Ya'll need more bees'' at big sisters in Bioshock 2.  \nAnd if you still need convincing to why this game is bad then i highly recommend you watch this video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdNhwb7iuI4\n this review was mostly ment to prevent people from buying the game (duh) but if i can convince any fans of Bioshock Infinite that this game is trash compared to Bioshock 1 and 2 then i would do so kindly.","timestamp_created":1540076705,"timestamp_updated":1540076769,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513529717922210693","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45363935","author":{"steamid":"76561198114691169","num_games_owned":256,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":1753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1753,"last_played":1590337677},"language":"english","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1540067594,"timestamp_updated":1540067594,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45362540","author":{"steamid":"76561198262947389","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":953,"last_played":1540060995},"language":"turkish","review":"Bir
