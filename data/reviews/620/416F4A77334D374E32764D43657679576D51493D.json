2 ingeniously combines its series of devious test chambers with a hilariously engrossing story that will persuade many to immediately place a portal at the start and end of the game, commencing an infinite loop of perfection.\n\nWHAT I LIKED:\n+ \"I've been really busy being dead. You know, after you murdered me\". GLaDOS returns, and she is taking no prisoners this time. The test chambers are more difficult, more arduous and more addictive than ever. Each room of the plot's first third offers a new technique for you to master, whether that be laser beams that can be refracted or aerial faith plates catapulting you across the dilapidated facility, making each chamber uniquely memorable and gradually increasing that balanced puzzling difficulty. \n+ \"OK, I've got an idea, but it is bloody dangerous. OK, here we go... AUGH!!! Huh? Oh for God's... They told me that if I ever turned on this flashlight, I would die!\". Wheatley, a bumbling yet somewhat helpful core, is the game's secret weapon. Voiced by the ever gleeful Stephen Merchant, he is undeniably the greatest asset. How? Well, just his dialogue alone makes strolling through the dark corridors ridiculously entertaining, and as the story progresses, his integral position makes for some humorous character development. Wheatley also allows you to explore the space in between test chambers, mixing up the gameplay even further by expanding the usual imprisonment and expanding the backstory of the series.\n+ \"All right, I've been thinking. When life gives you lemons? Don't make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these?! Demand to see life's manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am?! I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down! With the lemons! I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!\". Cave Johnson, voiced by J.K. Simmons, ladies and gentlemen. Nothing else to add.\n+ \"Those of you helping us test the Repulsion Gel today, just follow the blue line on the floor\". New puzzle mechanics are gradually implemented during the second third, including repulsion gel, which again enhances the usage of portals allowing you to experiment as you progress. Zipping across the floor and into a portal? It's way more fun than it sounds!\n+ \"Orange now has a Portal Device. Finally\". Portal 2 doesn't just offer an exceptional single-player campaign, it also offers an absurdly co-operative experience with its additional multi-player facility. Five different courses, each packed with various test chambers, that will challenge both minds simultaneously. The ability to utilise four portals between two players opens up the potential solutions to new heights, and many frustrating lows, yet constantly revolving around communication. Hopefully no partners will be slaughtered in the process...\n+ \"This next test may involve trace amounts of time travel. So, word of advice: If you meet yourself on the testing track, don't make eye contact\". Considerably longer than its predecessor, yet never outstays its welcome. The single-player campaign can be completed in approximately six hours, whilst the co-operative campaign expels roughly two to three hours. Still short, but ever so sweet like a cake.\n+ 'The Part Where He Kills You' and the sequences leading up to the final boss encounter were suitably epic, boasted by an electrifying score.\n+ Everything. Just everything. \n\nWHAT I DISLIKED:\n- Nothing.\n\nVERDICT:\n10/10 space cores, in what is simply one of the greatest video games to ever be developed.","timestamp_created":1596547488,"timestamp_updated":1596547488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73749454","author":{"steamid":"76561198079503362","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":287,"last_played":1594269267},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1596547027,"timestamp_updated":1596547027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73749215","author":{"steamid":"76561198005383547","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1280,"last_played":1629652702},"language":"german","review":"einfach genial\n","timestamp_created":1596546763,"timestamp_updated":1596546763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73749149","author":{"steamid":"76561198912738650","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1642699633},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1596546686,"timestamp_updated":1596546686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73748296","author":{"steamid":"76561198960784325","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":590,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":479,"last_played":1645032366},"language":"russian","review":"Сперва исследования оказались под угрозой.

The levels we could play together were great fun and I decided that I wanted to have the game myself. \n\nAs I dived into the singleplayer, I put the game down fairly fast. The puzzles became too complicated for my 13-year-old brain and as I wasn’t a native English speaker, the story and the majority of the jokes wouldn’t get to me.\n\n8 years later, I decided to revisit the game (87 cents, come on) and I got to experience a game that I only can label as a masterpiece.\n\n\nIn Portal 2, you wake up in a giant building as imprisoned test subject Chell, whose job is to run tests for the science lab Aperture Laboratories. You don’t get to know a whole lot about the protagonist, but one thing is certain, you want to get out. Fortunately, a robot that introduces himself as Wheatley oversees your waking and decides to help you out on your great escape. \n\n\nWhile you make your way through the mostly ruined test rooms, the player will come across a futuristic gadget called the Portal Gun. This nifty device enables you to shoot two different colors of portals. When Chell steps into one, she will emerge from the other. \n\nThe Portal Gun forms the basis for the puzzle experience, and it works wonderful. The device expands your movement options, can be used for combat and let’s you pull of all sorts of stunts when combined with objects from the test rooms.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are ingenious and rewarding. Some of them are hard and I got stuck in a number of rooms, but the game doesn’t feel unfair. In my case, I always got to the “eureka” moment right before I started to get annoyed.\n\nThere are some rather far fetched solutions present, but solving those mostly comes down to out of the box thinking when you got a little too comfortable with a thinking pattern.\n\n\nThe most admirable thing however, is the way the game seamlessly merges the gameplay with the story. Puzzles can suddenly be put to a halt by the villain, who I will not spoil in this review, and all sorts of plot twists are in favor of the gameplay. The game even manages to make the puzzles fit to the personality of your enemy, which is an amazing feed in itself. \n\nThe characters, which will mostly consist of Wheatley and other robots, are a delight. Wheatley’s humor, british accent and expressive movements will bring a smile on your face.\n\nThe overall quality of the voice acting is admirable and it really gets the player into the story.\nAs far as a simple “escape the building” story can go, the narrative is masterful.\n\n\nGraphically, the game has aged pretty well. The clean looking test rooms of Aperture Laboratories still have their charm and wouldn’t actually need a lot more detail. I could even state that the simplicity of the geometry works in the game’s favor, as it helps the player determine what is interactable and what is not. The only times you will be reminded of game’s age, is when you enter the more “organic” levels, in which foliage, liquids and bended, destroyed structures look outdated. \n\n\nAs I reached the ending credits of the game, a felt a sense of accomplishment and I was constantly smiling at my monitor. Portal 2 delivers you a short and sweet experience that nails to balance gameplay and storytelling. My best 87 cents ever spent.","timestamp_created":1596532755,"timestamp_updated":1596532818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73739767","author":{"steamid":"76561198096321759","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":897,"last_played":1583762898},"language":"english","review":"Quit scrolling through the reviews and just buy the game already.","timestamp_created":1596532700,"timestamp_updated":1596532700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73739700","author":{"steamid":"76561198110474457","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1108,"last_played":1596539730},"language":"russian","review":"Не смотря, на то что первый Портал проходил еще на релизе из оранжевой коробки, до второй части добрался только в 20 году.
