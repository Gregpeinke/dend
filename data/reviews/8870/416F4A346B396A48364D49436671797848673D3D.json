If you're a melee fighter, you can equipt yourself with the proper items and you're a moster in close range. The only down side is that you can only carry 2 guns at the same time, which gets you into an uncomfortable situations at times, such as facing 4 snipers with a shotgun and a pistol. It sucks, but you'll love it.\n\nStory: With a great narrative by Troy Baker, the voice of Booker DeWitt, the story unfolds itself with many twists and turns that you will not expect. The theme of religious beliefs and human nature is smoothly told with this amazing story. The characters are solid. They don't go againts their beliefs and do random s***.\n\nVisuals: You don't need a lot of detail on this as you have seen the magic on the trailer. The city looks amazing as it should. How can you possible make floating cities look bad?\n\nOverall, it is the best RPG/First person shooter i've played since Half Life 1.","timestamp_created":1386567018,"timestamp_updated":1386567018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498084306716918945","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7978885","author":{"steamid":"76561197998849959","num_games_owned":1954,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":639,"last_played":1494624493},"language":"english","review":"Love++  I have said that the original Bioshock was my favorite game of all time.

Like an addict, I've now purchased the Season Pass and will soon embark on that bit of story.  As I think about it, I'm still in love with this game.

Exploring EVERYWHERE gave real depth  to the world with the aid of voxaphones, conversations and general background. Don't just blitz through the game if you want full storyline value as I imagine you will quickly become confused by what is happening. Note: This isn't a completely 'open' world, so you won't get too sidetracked going through all the doors on your journey forward. I found myself making sure I went everywhere the game was NOT trying to get me to go before I would move forward.\n\nThe graphics were well polished for the most part - I had them set on high which caused a bit of stuttering upon entering some new areas, but overall very smooth despite my system being on the old side.\n\nThe actual gameplay which was interspersed with the story was relatively generic FPS. Set the difficulty higher for a greater challenge and use of strategy, or lower if you want to have fun messing around with vigor/combat combos. Doesn't matter as the storyline was really the main focus for me in this game.\n\nA note on autosaving: I have seen a few comments complaining about the lack of save feature in this game. I get what the game is going for here though: They want you to face the consequences of death (loss of a bit of money and small health regen of enemies) rather than have you quicksave right before facing a harder battle. It's a bit annoying for real world timing trying to figure out if you will be able to quit the game in the next 5 minutes or not, but as long as you pay attention to when it is saving (rotating circle in the corner) or when it tells you the time your last quicksave was before you quit, there shouldn't be any nasty surprises when you log in again to find you lost 20 minutes of progress.\n\nLots of fun - will definitely have to play again in 1999 mode once I've worked my way through other games =/.","timestamp_created":1386549734,"timestamp_updated":1424542138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7976733","author":{"steamid":"76561198005804899","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":266,"last_played":1409149528},"language":"german","review":"Die Geschichte lässt einen durchdrehen !","timestamp_created":1386548853,"timestamp_updated":1386548853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7976315","author":{"steamid":"76561198072730468","num_games_owned":325,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":1098,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":471,"last_played":1562423995},"language":"english","review":"I'm afraid my vocabulary is not broad enought to recommend this game hard enough, the first thing you notice stepping into the sky city of columbia is the grahpics, sweet jesus the graphics.

Mistake.\n\nThis game is NOT bad, it is a downright overhyped dissapointment. It looks great and works generally fine, there is no amazing soundtrack (not that big a deal), but where it falls short is the content.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Gameplay is horribly repetitive. The false sense of open space is actually more confining than the actual confined space found in the first two games. Gameplay consists of pathetic \"vigors\" that have no taste and all have trap versions. The guns are underpowered generally, don't seem cool, and the removal of the weapon wheel is a bust as ammo is no longer conserved. The sky-hook is insanely broken. What could have been the selling point of the game (and kinda was) was boring, repetitive, and screwed up your objective beacon. The Elizabeth tears were alright but anoyying and the constant backtracking was a strain.\n\nENVIRONMENT: The environment is dirt. At first, the environment is cool; walking around a steampunk 1900s racist city and all, seeing the magical tech at work. As soon as the tears start happening and you start running around, you realize how boring it all is. The game doesn't feel like a fight for survival and freedom on a floating city - it feels like MMO quests in first-person on a bunch of blimps. The best level when a \"scare\"-factor is actually involved comes too few and too late.\n\nSTORY: The story is linear and bland. The main story is fairly guessable and not fleshed out. Voxophones, which are like the audiorecorders of old Bioshock, offer little and are too hard to get too. The DLC storylines are too blatant in their fit to the paradoxy of Infinite, getting those weak fools who enjoy this game to drool over the worst dialogue ever.\n\nCONCLUSION: A total buchery of one of the best games I've ever played. Removes all the good elements of bioshock 1 & 2, has a ridiculous story, awful environment, and the vigors (the point of bioshock) are extremely underplayed and have no story implementation. What was once a survival horror game is now the posterchild of absurd MetaCritic scores.\n\nA good game, not what it should have been. Kind of like a Halo 4 but even more dissapointing. 75/100","timestamp_created":1386524483,"timestamp_updated":1386524483,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476467281579971313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7971804","author":{"steamid":"76561198000233511","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1044,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":575,"last_played":1436043171},"language":"czech","review":"Vymakana grafika, skvely pribeh a nadherna Elizabeth.","timestamp_created":1386524018,"timestamp_updated":1386524018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7971616","author":{"steamid":"76561197996984107","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":710,"last_played":1387478630},"language":"english","review":"Love the BioShock series. 10/10","timestamp_created":1386523276,"timestamp_updated":1386523276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7971573","author":{"steamid":"76561198022583815","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1653120385},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра.

Now I am glad I just bought it on Steam Autumn Sale for less than 10 €...\n\nBioshock 3 is a shooter, quite different from the previous titles. By the setting in a town, floating in the sky, it lost all of it's dark and terrifying atmosphere which made Bioshock once so great.\n\nSo let's start by the good things:\nBioshock 3 isn't bad at all. \n\nTechnical:\nGraphically fitting you walk through a shiny world, see scyscrapers and go by the sky-line railsystem from platform to the other. I played the game with highest graphics, but it is only mediocre. Sound is ok, but not overwhelming.\n\nFighting:\nWeapons are varying and for every taste you get some weapons. In my case the huntsman carbine and the pig flak volley gun... *cough*\nEnemies act not too stupid. Only few enemy types.\nThe vigors, Jedi-like forces that support in quite funny ways, are quite different and function quite good. \n\nStory:\nThe story seems easy at the start, but gets very twisted later. You might need more than playthrough to get everything of the story. Some few hidden places you can find while playing, giving you special equipment like hats and stuff.\n\n\nNow the bad things:\nI am totally disappointed. Forget the trailers...\n\nTechnical:\nGraphically it is ok, but that's it. Nothing special.\nAnother nuisance is the \"invisible wall\". In games from the 1990's an invisible wall as level-border can be accepted. In games from 2012/2013 NOT. Dear programmers, do me a favour: stop creating the illusion I could walk somewhere when I CAN'T!\n\nFighting:\nFights are mostly too chaotic. And the enemies can see through walls (in some cases also SHOOT through walls...).\nA lot of vigors, the half of it would have been already enough. I just used shock jockey, possession (only at the last airship level) and devil's kiss (which traps didn't work sometimes....). The rest is a nice idea. I missed a freezing power. Oh wait... THAT you get in a dlc. Amazing..............................\n\nStory:\nI enjoyed the story, it was pushing you forward, wanting to know what happens next. I really didn't expect the turns, ups and downs of the story. But the end: At first I was irritated, then thought of it all. Remebered the game.... and uninstalled. Seriously? After all these hours? Dear writers, I love good written stories. You did a pretty good job there, but this ending is the most stupid I have ever seen in a game. Ok, maybe not THE worst, but it is very close to that rank.\n\nThings that COULD have made Bioshock Infinite better:\nThere could have been so many possibilities to play with the fear of heights of the players, but this chance was missed.\nI have a fear of heights, but wasn't one time afraid of falling down somewhere.\nBugs like waving textures (really annoying in ingame-cutscenes), missing textures or missing sounds should be fixed before selling a game.\nOnly three persons are consistant in this game, the player, Elizabeth, and the prophet. The other persons stay quite faceless.\nThe enemies act ok, but they are all exchangable.\n\nIf I hadn't bought the game on a Steam Sale, I would be now quite vexed.","timestamp_created":1386504754,"timestamp_updated":1388603733,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491014182567596436","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7967771","author":{"steamid":"76561197995493248","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":783,"last_played":1401985939},"language":"english","review":"The last hour of this game is fantastic, so touching.","timestamp_created":1386503592,"timestamp_updated":1386503592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7967752","author":{"steamid":"76561198073600808","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":669,"last_played":1386453705},"language":"italian","review":"Ken Levine dice tutto.

Graficamente \"datato\", offre il meglio di se nella storia e nel gameplay. Raramente si vedono giochi che coinvolgono il giocatore in questo modo. \n\nLa trama: E' il 1912, sei un detective (Booker DeWitt) pieno di debiti e un giorno ti si presenta un occasione per saldarli. \"Portaci la ragazza e annulla il debito!\". Ciò che dobbiamo fare è prendere una ragazza (Elizabeth) imprigionata nella città volante di Columbia. Tutto qui. Non vi sto a fare spoiler o a dire cosa può o non può accadere, giocatelo.\n\nIl gameplay invece è quello di un classico FPS, con una variabile: i Vigor. I Vigor non sono altro che dei \"poteri\" che aiutano il giocatore in diverse situazioni, tipo quello di rendere i nemici amici per un periodo limitato di tempo. \n\nIl gioco dura circa 8-9 ore, senza contare fasi esplorative (\"esplorative\"... il gioco è molto lineare), la ricerca dei collezionabili, ecc..\n\nIl gioco lo consiglio, pagato 7.49€ durante i saldi, e ne sono pienamente soddisfatto.","timestamp_created":1386494640,"timestamp_updated":1386494640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52170640230178833","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7966028","author":{"steamid":"76561198059169447","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2222,"last_played":1396215567},"language":"russian","review":"Эту игру Вы точно никогда не забудете!!!Обязательно к прохождению, причем со всеми дополнениями!!!","timestamp_created":1386492471,"timestamp_updated":1480345345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7966008","author":{"steamid":"76561197974495151","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":1381,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":854,"last_played":1416909876},"language":"english","review":"YIIIAAOOOZA'}","timestamp_created":1386492344,"timestamp_updated":1386492344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462046205997467041","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7965919","author":{"steamid":"76561198017197205","num_games_owned":525,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":957,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":956,"last_played":1376897340},"language":"russian","review":"Что такое BioShock Infinite?
