Through-out the game you play Booker Dewitt who is tasked in finding Elizabeth in the city in the clouds, Columbia, and bringing her back.  The game constantly fantasizes with the idea of utopia, all while glamorizing gruesome violence and horrendous philosophies of racial superiority.  The storyline is clever, difficult at times to follow, but truly offers some very deep plot points that offers a great way to tell a story.  While I don't think I can ruin the story by saying too much as the story can be confusing if you don't play the game directly through, it would definitely give away some of the aha moments that the game does have from time to time, including a great twist at the end.\n\nI did play both Burial at Sea DLCs which has you return from Columbia back into Rapture under the ocean, and both those DLCs continued the storyline quite well and offered to fill certain plot holes that may still have been questionable or confusing.  Both were fun.  The first one has you again as Booker Dewitt, while the second one has you playing as Elizabeth.\n\nThe action of the game is great.  With the right hand you carry a weapon, two at a time maximum.  The range of weapons go from RPG, to hand cannon, to pistol, and more.  Nothing too out of the ordinary, but each one presents a different way of taking on the battles and the fights, and eventually you'll find the two that you prefer to hold on to for the gameplay style you prefer.  With the left hand, you can use plasmids to pretty much cast spells.  The plasmids you can use range from freezing things, to throwing fire, and electricty, or befriending enemies to fight on your side.  It is rather fun to find a good groove of shooting casting plasmids, and moving around a huge area to fight off the enemies.  You can even use your metal arm to ride the rails and jump from the rails to land on your enemies and more.  The action is fun, quite satisfying, and also not too difficult.  I haven't played the game on 1999 mode, I played it on hard, but it did not stop me from feeling like I was ever held back due to the difficulty.  In the 2nd DLC, the gameplay is slightly different in the sense that Elizabeth takes on a stealth approach to the action.  Sneaking up on people and knocking them out or shooting loud darts to distract enemies are what gets you around enemies.  The stealth gameplay is actually well done where walking on water, glass, or making too much noise will alert the enemy as they come looking for you.\n\nThe graphics in this game are gorgeous.  This is not an OLD game, but it is quite dated as far as video games go, but the art style of this game and the vivid colors of Columbia still make for a beautiful game to play.  The details are great with added publicity here and there to push the message of the game such as finding signs that say, \"Never trust a slacker.\"  The game is tough on humanity as the leaders of Bioshock games seek to find their own utopia.  Here in Bioshock Infinite you seek to find and destroy Comstock who is almost seen as God to the world of Columbia.\n\nThe music, the sounds, the voice overs, everything is just right on and immerse you into the world of Columbia.  And while the the vivid colors and the sound make it so beautiful, the action glorifies absolute gore.  With your metal arm, you can tear right into people's guts, or faces with blood splattering everywhere.  The action is not dulled down at all as the intensity of the graphics continue but in a dark way.\n\nI have not yet played the Clash in the Clouds DLC yet, and I have not yet unlocked all of the achievements for both the main games and DLCs, but I will gladly try to get 100% on this game.  Playing this game feels like I need to replay the original Bioshock games as I feel like I will better understand the entire overarching storyline that I didn't expect would be connected when I started this last iteration in the series.\n\nIf you have not yet taken the time to play this game, you should do yourself a favor and give it a shot.  Again, while it's somewhat old in gaming years, I still feel like it offers a very unique experience that I have not seen in any other game.

I enjoyed my playthrough, but if you've played the game's predecessors, you'll find that the storytelling is more rigid this time around; the game's Disneyland-like world is less atmospheric than Rapture; and the gameplay has been dumbed-down and simplified. Combat in particular is much less strategic and dangerous--you now cannot use medkits in combat as they're used on pickup, so death is sometimes unavoidable but also unpunished as you respawn in combat with no loss of progress, so you'll spend most of your time standing in the face of enemies unloading your guns. Be aware that where the previous games were both story- and gameplay-driven, this is primarily and almost wholly story-driven and cinematic.","timestamp_created":1585446535,"timestamp_updated":1585446535,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66049244","author":{"steamid":"76561198066487662","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":599,"last_played":1585438520},"language":"english","review":"mindbendingly cool","timestamp_created":1585440393,"timestamp_updated":1585440393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66048709","author":{"steamid":"76561198002362592","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":445,"last_played":1585439596},"language":"english","review":"guess, the best game ive ever played in such a wonderful world","timestamp_created":1585439687,"timestamp_updated":1585439687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66046578","author":{"steamid":"76561198876635899","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":356,"last_played":1584822322},"language":"spanish","review":"Visually too busy but overall a good game.

The interactivity of Columbia and Elizabeth, your relevance to the plot, and your emotional stakes in the story gradually become diluted the further in you go. This game has some capital-F Flaws.\nAnd yet, it's still so much fun. The tanky, brutal gameplay is Fun! Falling in love with the neat cast of NPCs is Fun! Realising the sheer amount of potential this concept had and definitely tried to achieve is Fun! Getting into long arguments with your friends about the game's flaws and how they could've improved it is… weirdly Fun!\n\nBuy it! Play it! Enjoy yourself! Lose yourself in the world of 2013 where Troy Baker was king and steampunk was still cool enough that people actually thought Victorian women wore their corsets on the outside of their clothes.\n\nJust, maybe skip Burial at Sea Pt. 1. Trying to play as a built around being able to punch, shoot, and zap people hard and fast with ammunition for your guns or magic is kinda painful. Booker probably needed a bit more re-engineering for the new mechanics than he got, but it's fine; Burial at Sea Pt. 2 is a cohesive and enjoyable, story-based stealth game, just do her instead.
