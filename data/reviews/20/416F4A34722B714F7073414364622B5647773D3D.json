TFC follows the same rules as before, 9 classes, two teams, hundreds of maps, and a lot of killing. TF2 I never liked due to the serious unbalancing of the game, and yes TFC is a tad unbalanced too, but TF2 took it too far. That being said, It's nice to play TFC because I feel as if newcomers have a slighter chance of getting kills, BUT, if you are a newcomer, YOU WILL BE CRUSHED because this game is a tad dead meaning many experienced players do play this. As far as I know, there are about only 5 dedicated servers left for REAL players only, no bots. Drippy's 2fort is one of them that always seem populated, but I hope you don't mind playing 2fort for awhile since that seems to be the only popular real server left.\n\nThe graphics are from Half Life 1, sooo you should get an idea of what it looks like. As for sound, nothing really, just explosions, guns being shot off, turrents, doors opening, grunts from jumping, ETC.\n\nThe gameplay in this does require a bit more skill so mastering it is really hard. Snipers will pick you off instantly, Soldiers will destroy you, ETC. Haha, the gameplay is quite fun though, but remember, each class isn't for everybody, so you may need to experiment some if you wanna figure out what's best for you. My favorite is the Scout and Engineer. My only complaint in this game...are the grenades. As much as I love TFC, the grenades are absolutely overpowered and spammed to hell. The thing about grenades are that their blast radius is HUGE and people spam them everywhere. In 2fort, I have been killed too much by opening a door and having a grenade thrown at me and having me killed. Grenade spamfest is almost the name of the game, but once you get used to it, this game is downright fun and awesome.\n\nSure, this game is sadly dying, but there are still some servers left for real players, there is a server that hosts Dustbowl 24/7 for real players too and it's the second most popular server so if you get bored of 2fort from Drippy's, there is always that server. So help us TFC lovers bring this classic back to life by buying it. It's only $5.00, and it will offer you hours of fun on end. Many sleepless night I've had on TFC, trust me. I have almost 50 hours in this game and I know that I will still keep playing more in the future. So buy TFC today! You have nothing to lose other than your social life.","timestamp_created":1389519684,"timestamp_updated":1389519731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523592054843902588","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8667050","author":{"steamid":"76561198083413093","num_games_owned":3005,"num_reviews":1907,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1494496853},"language":"turkish","review":"░░░░░░░░░░░████\n░░░░░░░░░░░█░░█\n░░░░░░░░░░█░░░█\n░░░░░░░░░█░░░░█\n██████▄▄█░░░░░███▄\n▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░█\n▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░█\n▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░█\n▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░█\n▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░█\n▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░","timestamp_created":1389469236,"timestamp_updated":1389469236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498640060424804688","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8657189","author":{"steamid":"76561198116226332","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":97,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":92,"last_played":1403237484},"language":"english","review":"dope","timestamp_created":1389417638,"timestamp_updated":1389417638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499393075704574585","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8604175","author":{"steamid":"76561198099953751","num_games_owned":373,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":725,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28,"last_played":1587583790},"language":"english","review":"very
