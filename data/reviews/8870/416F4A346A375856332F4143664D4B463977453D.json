Как и первая часть Bioshock, Infinite просто и невольно побуждает тебя идти на просторы интернета или в книжные магазины на поиски информации по теме художественных направлений в архитектуре, в частности, если говорить о данной серии игр, ар-деко и модерна. И это касается не только визуального инструмента донесения информации, но и нарративного, исторического, остросоциального контекста, философии и драматургии. Мир проработан великолепно. Веришь! Величайшее (или одной из) достижение любого интеллектуального произведения искусства, приневолить среднестатистического (и не только) обывателя, который \"нишарит\", полюбить тебя, начать интересоваться тобой, восхищаться, изучать; донести до него мысль и красоту, при этом помочь ему самому стать чуточку лучше. Редкость в наши дни, когда видеоигра (а видеоигры - это искусство, напоминаю), помогает своему игроку стать в чём-то более эрудированным. А серия Bioshock, на мой взгляд, является такой редкостью. Даже спустя 7+ лет после её релиза. Побольше бы таких стимпанковских антиутопий.","timestamp_created":1584015090,"timestamp_updated":1587024799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64909017","author":{"steamid":"76561198309018442","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":556,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":469,"last_played":1584714067},"language":"english","review":"8.5/10","timestamp_created":1584013882,"timestamp_updated":1584013882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64908078","author":{"steamid":"76561198852333023","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":163,"last_played":1591256182},"language":"schinese","review":"wonderful!!!！！！！！","timestamp_created":1584012589,"timestamp_updated":1584012589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64901353","author":{"steamid":"76561198220168211","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":780,"last_played":1584001031},"language":"english","review":"One of my all time favourite shooters, I think this is the game that really got me into gaming as a whole.","timestamp_created":1584001079,"timestamp_updated":1584001079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64900502","author":{"steamid":"76561198338060036","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":736,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":336,"last_played":1604287614},"language":"schinese","review":"大家都说这是第九艺术，so do I","timestamp_created":1583999493,"timestamp_updated":1583999493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64898844","author":{"steamid":"76561198371316730","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":938,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":918,"last_played":1586188324},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情神作，震撼人心。","timestamp_created":1583996470,"timestamp_updated":1583996470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64898610","author":{"steamid":"76561198080204326","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":353,"last_played":1427074919},"language":"english","review":"I grew up in an abusive household with a father who didn't care. For me, I used to wonder what life would have been like if he and I could've had a different path in life where he was present and loving. This game ended up really hitting home as I could identify with Elizabeth. She's every bit inspirational and strong, beautiful and driven by the ideals of youth and adventure. The protagonist, Booker DeWitt, is a well-intentioned man plagued by bad decisions. The journey that the two go on holds a special place in my heart that makes me wonder about my own life and the what-if's. \n\nI think this game is beautiful despite its technical flaws like low resolution textures and the lack of continued development post DLC. Games today require constant development and nurturing post full-release. I truly hope that there's more that gets added to the Bioshock universe despite the fallout with the development team.\n\nThis game has my fullest recommendation. If you're not sure, just wait till one of the major sales when this game is less than $10. It's worth it regardless.","timestamp_created":1583996028,"timestamp_updated":1583996028,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64897081","author":{"steamid":"76561198397296069","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":723,"last_played":1583588299},"language":"schinese","review":"结局太牛逼了","timestamp_created":1583993044,"timestamp_updated":1583993044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64896652","author":{"steamid":"76561198810970897","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1383,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1120,"last_played":1656858585},"language":"english","review":"Confusing and Addicting\nyes","timestamp_created":1583992253,"timestamp_updated":1583992253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64895795","author":{"steamid":"76561198339784947","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1134,"last_played":1583990325},"language":"schinese","review":"再见了，伊丽莎白   希望在无限的世界中有一个你和布克好好生活在一起的世界，不，我确信如此！\n                                                                                                                                                  \n\n希望能再相见","timestamp_created":1583990487,"timestamp_updated":1583990487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64890899","author":{"steamid":"76561198403758261","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1979,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1609389363},"language":"schinese","review":"没啥可说的 都给我买！\n手残的可以点个简单模式，先不说游戏体验，光是感受剧情就很赞了，fps大神就打开困难跟我一起砰砰砰就完事儿了","timestamp_created":1583980624,"timestamp_updated":1583980624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64888731","author":{"steamid":"76561198439834856","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1588681292},"language":"schinese","review":"有简中就好了","timestamp_created":1583976607,"timestamp_updated":1583976607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64886341","author":{"steamid":"76561198068558726","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1854,"last_played":1649304916},"language":"brazilian","review":"Esse jogo é simplesmente sensacional e a história é absurda de imersiva.

Then, Bioshock Infinite came along, maintaining the same narrative brilliance, adding to it incredible characters to connect to, and changed the setting to a world that's bright and, while still dark and disturbing, also enjoyable to explore and  play in. Finally, years later I got to play the Burial at Sea DLC, and amazingly enough it lived up to the original, and managed to build on it even further.

Normally I am not a huge Ego Shooter Fan, but I wanted to take a look at the BioShock Series and this game is the newest. If you want to play a different kind of Shooter with a stirring and deeper story this game is a good choice. Try it, you might love it.\n\nPros:\n\n- Nice animation in a world of the 1920s. It is lovely.\n- Deep and baffling story.\n- Combat is really challenging and you are always in fear to run out of Ammo, which makes things more thrilling.\n- The game is very affordable, It gives you a decent return for a low investment.\n\nCons:\n\n- It is pretty short. I finished the game in about 25 hours of gameplay. Very, very short somehow.\n- Not an incredible amout of weapons or extra skills.\n- Game saving is not self-determined. This is something I dont really like usually. You have to play until the next saving spot is reached, disregarding if you have the time to play or not.\n\nOverall it is good game. If you get it for a low price, try it.
