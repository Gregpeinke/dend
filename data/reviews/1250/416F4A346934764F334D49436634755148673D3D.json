Controls are different and there is a language to be learned in them, but it isn't to the point that it isn't uplayable to newer players. Some degree of strategy does exist for the ultimate and most efficient team and loadout for each class, but teamwork and skill can overcome almost any odds. Like most horde games, map knowledge is important and unfortunetly, even with constant ingame help on the HUD, maps are very dark and a little convoluted making it hard to navigate through. While this helps create more of a world and feeling, it does create a barrier to entry which isn't player based but more time based, as only experience and knowledge can overcome map design. Also, the enemies while diverse enough to make gameplay constant and \"fresh\", there are some where it isn't clear on what the threat level is. Though this didn't really matter as almost every game I was in, I got to \"exerience\" each enemy type through my commrades deaths and reactions, it is still something to reintroduceeach enemies to all the players. I think that restateing important information is always welcomed as long as it isn't too obstructive. Either way, its a fun game, though I think the official skins and weapons which are purely cosmetic are a bit pricy.","timestamp_created":1386270517,"timestamp_updated":1386270517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7928466","author":{"steamid":"76561198045559514","num_games_owned":648,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":20263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8417,"last_played":1616788624},"language":"english","review":"This is a classic survival horror game that needs great cooperation to beat higher level maps.

While I'm not a huge fan of leveling systems in FPS games, it works here because you don't have to fight against people who've already unlocked everything (and who could likely wipe the floor with you). But don't think the game is easy just because of that. It's not uncommon for even an experienced team to get overwhelmed in later rounds.\n\nThe game's buying-between-rounds system lets you really change how you play and adapt to the skill level of your teammates. If you're playing with a lot of good people, you could pick up less-effective weapons and just have fun. If your team is struggling, you can go for your bread-and-butter weapons and mop up. You can switch roles between rounds as well, so maybe you're not helping out so much as a Firebug and your team is taking too much damage. You could switch to medic and see a huge turnaround in your team's performance.\n\nThe aiming is as accurate as you are, and that's a seriously refereshing reward. No artificial inaccuracy or auto-aiming here. There's also no bullet-drop, so it's really a blend of realism and arcadish fun. You have to balance weapon load out with movement speed. The more you carry, the slower you go. Also, you have to be proficient at switching to the right weapon for the job. If you think you can pick any class and one weapon and just mow down every specimen in the game, think again. A support specialist with the right shotgun can solo a flesh pound with little practice. However, a commando with a bullpup should probably just switch to their knife and run away (like CS, you have to switch to your knife if you want to run).\n\nOne of the few downsides to the game is that there is a lack of variety in enemies on any given map. You'll see the exact same set of enemies over and over again. If you don't absolutely fall in love with the game mechanics, I suspect this will be the aspect of the game that destroys replayability the fastest. It'd be nice to see a couple different models or skins for the same enemy type (like how the plain zombies in L4D1 & 2 don't all look the same). It'd also be nice to see a new enemy type (something I don't think we've ever seen from TripWire Interactive).\n\nHowever, you do get variety in the form of seasonal events which TWI is very good about putting on every year. Often they'll release new content (new map, new character, new weapons, balance tweaks, etc.), and they also reskin all enemies for these events. The graphics may be starting to show their age, but the gameplay is still unique and fun. It's a game that may not have the strongest foundation when it was released, but its content, stability, and overall quality has grown over the years. It's still played by many and easy to pick up at a great price during a steam sale.\n\nIf you like challenging FPSs and enjoy co-op, definitely give this game a try.","timestamp_created":1386267645,"timestamp_updated":1386267645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503923535346984863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7927845","author":{"steamid":"76561198055067884","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":541,"last_played":1406399568},"language":"english","review":"The best possible co-op zombie killing game for you and you'r friends to play when you're drunk, bored or just 100% sugar high.
