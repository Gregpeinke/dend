My experience hasn't been good enough for me to leave a recommendation though. For one, there are very, VERY few servers left for this game (I mean approximately 3). If you want a game where you can join a server to play and joke around, maybe find some new friends - good luck. I joined my first server and heard a guy say, \"i don't care to have my salad tossed\". Okay, i wasn't even talking to this guy before this, but i said, \"lucky you if i toss your salad.\" Instant ban. So, i thought, okay, there are still like 2 other servers worth playing in (good luck finding one because it seems that they are SERIOUSLY lacking, i am sad to say). I got banned from the next server by simply stating \"it's sad to see people going so fast on servers when this seems like such a good game.\" Then, boom - autobanned??? FOR THAT?\n\nBought it for fun. Quit for the lack of servers and admin abuse. Sad day. I have literally never been banned from any server on ANY game until this day. I have also only left ONE review out of all of the games i own. So do not take it lightly when i say new players do not seem welcome (admins favor people who have already been playing). Saw a ton of people banned for both legitimate and illigitemate reasons.

Counter Strike, this game is made tactical, were as health does not regenerate unlike Call of Dooty, but also like Counterstrike, the pace and unrealism of the game is on par with Unreal Tournament with all the fun craziness of the deranged weaponry of Unreal removed, making the game very unvaried, unless one counts the inaccuracy of the weapon of choice.\n\nYour head is apparently fixed to the length of the gun you pick, since when you fire your view goes up with the gun, like it's glued there, and there is no ADS to fine tune your shot with, again, ordinary bullet firing or anti tank rocket firing weapons of WWII which makes about as much sense as adding ADS to Unreal Tournament weapons since some of them don't fire in a straight line...but in Day of Defeat (source) it's abit like they want to make a choir out of the weapons and in the end the pistol is the best gun since it doesn't swing your head up to pray to god no one is going to shoot back or be smart enough to use a device... that can be programmed to slide the aim down or lock the view in place by aiming down when you hold a button or so forth.... otherwise firing the guns is SUPER ANNOYING and a choir to do, taking away from the fun of any weapon.\n\nThe pace of the game makes no sense, when it's literally a cross between Counter Strike's health and arcadey damage with running and gunning with guns attached to your chin like you eat them for breakfast, kick and all. Which of course cannot be fired while jumping making bullet dodging from Unreal nearly impossible, and to make matters more strange, the fast pace and clunky movement doesn't really build up to add to the fun of the game as a whole, so there is no point in the pace or the strange restriction of falling/jumping and firing. There is no 360 no scope falls, death from aboves on a crowd of soldiers one should be able to easily suprise and mow down, or other fun stunts\n\nThankfully the game isn't bullet spongey, but the weapons all have an arcadey sense of damage, for instance the M1 Grand does LESS damage then the Springfield bolt action, even though they both have the same calibure, moving away from a naturally expected realism when you shoot some poor bastard.\n\nAND THERE IS NO CAMPAIGN OR OFFLINE BOTS, so if you have bad internet, this game is almost not for you, however the game does use very very little bandwidth and can run smoothly like that, if you live in rural America with a ping of 500+ and stuck in an ISP monopoly where you have only 2 or less choices for net connection and all options are bad, this is not for you.\n\nApparently you can however run your own server, so the game can only die if you cannot find anyone to play with and thus it really cannot suffer the same fate as Dark Spore or Titan fall where the devs or publisher can drop the support for the only mode available (Multiplayer) leaving you with alotta useless 1s and 0s sitting on your hard drive. Thus it's somewhat safe to buy unlike Titan fall, Dark Spore and Overwatch which I recommend be free to play so no one is getting ripped off. But stupid people tend to buy stupid things without thinking about it, and here I am trying to inform what a bad game is so Day of Defeat stops being so badddddddd","timestamp_created":1512460368,"timestamp_updated":1512510663,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.397737801074981689","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38066444","author":{"steamid":"76561198346668254","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":36799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21155,"last_played":1648755030},"language":"german","review":"Super Spiel !!!!!!","timestamp_created":1512425801,"timestamp_updated":1512425801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38061142","author":{"steamid":"76561198372064220","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":12428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":385,"last_played":1537563073},"language":"turkish","review":"Arkadaşlar eski olmasına bakmayın muhteşem bir oyun bağımlılık yapıyor ve hile denen bişey yok kafamız rahat en azından. \nOLD BUT GOLDD 👍👍👍","timestamp_created":1512407010,"timestamp_updated":1512407010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38055354","author":{"steamid":"76561198349797122","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50,"last_played":1516021166},"language":"russian","review":"В отличие от C-S, павшие\nбойцы в DoD не скучают до\nокончания раунда, а возрождаются\nчерез несколько секунд и опять\nмчатся к месту битвы.
