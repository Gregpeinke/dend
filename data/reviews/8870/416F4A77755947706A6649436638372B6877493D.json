What begins as a fresh new endeavor of hope turns drastically wrong as the city soon disappears into the clouds to whereabouts unknown. The player takes on the role of former Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt, sent to the lost city to rescue Elizabeth, a young lady imprisoned there since her childhood. He develops a relationship with Elizabeth, enhancing his abilities with hers so the pair may escape from a city that is literally falling from the sky. DeWitt has to learn to fight foes in high-speed Sky-Line battles, engage in combat both indoors and amongst the clouds, and harness the power of a myriad of new weapons and abilities.","timestamp_created":1589907404,"timestamp_updated":1589907404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578215956687927246","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69429243","author":{"steamid":"76561198380199204","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":738,"last_played":1589915831},"language":"russian","review":"Игра классная, но ошибка d3d11 задолбала...","timestamp_created":1589905801,"timestamp_updated":1589905801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69425949","author":{"steamid":"76561198075696048","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1015,"last_played":1605378267},"language":"english","review":"bioshock infinite is by far the best game i have ever played. i didn't like the storyline of the franchise at first. but after picking it back up a couple of years. i played the entire franchise in a week or 2. every game tearing me up and kept me longing for more. but this part of the franchise is so incredibly good that i think everyone must play it atleast once in their life. the story is so rich you can't even imagine it.  the gameplay is solid aswell which makes the experience everlasting for me. this game changed my way of thinking and life. buy this game and play the game but most importantly focus on the storyline since that will blow your mind!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1589901669,"timestamp_updated":1589901669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69424076","author":{"steamid":"76561198336568280","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":999,"last_played":1624529308},"language":"german","review":"beste story seit langem, nur leider etwas kurz finde ich. \nDie DLCs sollte man sich auch unbedingt mit dazu hollen!\nGrafisch ist das spiel zwar etwas in die Jahre gekommen, trotzdem ist es bis heute noch sehr schöne anzusehen.\n\nWird auf jeden Fall für immer ein Platz in meinem Herzen haben!\n\nALSO EGAL OB SALE ODER NICHT, KAUFENNNNNNNNN!","timestamp_created":1589899350,"timestamp_updated":1590334002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69422762","author":{"steamid":"76561198352126008","num_games_owned":450,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":81,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":81,"last_played":1581742013},"language":"schinese","review":"这视角真的醉了，一玩就晕，制作组在过山车上开发的游戏？","timestamp_created":1589897644,"timestamp_updated":1589897644,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.439973384141921997","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69422122","author":{"steamid":"76561198139344076","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":953,"last_played":1478818496},"language":"turkish","review":"İlk 2 oyunun karanlık havası sizi sarmadıysa buna göz atın.

However, this one is just terrible. This has nothing to do with Bioshock except trying to ruin previous two games. It makes hardly any sense. Its a corridor shoot them all, again nothing like previous two. Steath or getting into position is not a thing either. Elizabeth is fine, but talks over everything you dont get to expirience anything but her. Story is weird and you need a video to understand the ending, which doesnt make sense (I am not going to spoil, but the mechanics dont work the way the ending makes them seem. Therefore the ending makes no sense, to make it worse in dlc it is shown that ending didnt make sense). Dlc I didnt have the will power to play part 2. Part one is good while exploring the Rapture (i.e. first 10-15 mins) after that its awful. Ending is another weird thing that is just weird for sake of being weird. The dlc also makes Rapture seem very different but in bad way, disregards Bioshock 2 locations and overall leaves a bad taste for players of previous two games. If you want a generic shooter, play this, unless you are lagging like crazy or new to fps you will not die. Elizabeth makes combat boring bcs its so easy but dependent on her. I cant recommend this, its just bad. People who didnt play previous two will probably like it because its \"unique\", but it quite frankly isnt, its just badly written.

There are few other game creators who are as highly imaginative and inventive as Ken Levine. Fewer who believe in telling wildly incredulous stories and weaving them together with tight controlled narratives that grip players and pull them into the very game worlds in which they reside. KL's games always felt like they were striving to better connect with the player through the mechanics, the story, and art, but often felt limited by technology or by the creator's own setbacks at the time. Bioshock Infinite and its DLC feel like the capstone--the apex, crowning achievement-- to a long career in service of the player and in sacrifice of self and everything else. A game, whose story and plot is among the best of films, and whose glorious panoramic views and detailed scenery are among the best set designs and photographic work. The various combat elements synergize flawlessly, like a well choreographed ballet. An unraveling and seemingly obtuse plot weaves together effortlessly into an ending that takes your breath away. You've never played a game like this before, and you probably never will again. \n\nFrom a starship, to a city underwater, and now a city in the sky. No wonder KL is hanging up his keyboard and mouse, he's most certainly running out of creative places to stage his dystopian nightmares. I was skeptical of my own ability to suspend my sense of disbelief in the idea of a flying city, and even so after it's all explained by sciences. But it's the fantastic art direction that slathers on a thick sheen of verisimilitude on everything. Other than a few moments your character jokes about \"not looking down,\" (a har) you almost don't even realize. Everything is fully fleshed out and just makes sense. One welcomed change in this game is that you don't end up doing what I refer to as the \"grand custodial tour,\" -- a lot of busy work in service of advancing the plot. See in both Bio and System shock, you had to go to engineering and medical and hydroponics, and basically none of the fun places. Who wants to spend time in the geothermal plant of an an underwater city? I mean as part of a game. Obviously it would be a grand achievement otherwise, BUT an entire underwater city and we go to the hospital and the power plant. It makes more sense on a starship, but still I'm glad we didn't spend time wondering around the sewerage plant of Columbia.

Only once i had to restart from a checkpoint because a glitch stopped me from progressing, but it didn't bug me that much. I also think that the vigors you get are all unique and fun to use, but near the end i feel like there were so many that i didn't have a chance to use all of them, and i would usually not use any of them because there were so many options to choose from which was overwhelming mid fight.

Творческий подход Кена Левина породил уникальное произведение, сравнимое разве что с прошлыми работами автора. Bioshock Infinite - это эталон качественного произведения в видеоиграх. Настолько комплексную, проработанную во всех аспектах игру получается создать далеко не всегда. Сюжет игры не просто запоминается и удивляет, он заставляет перевернуть головной мозг и выйти за грань реальности, по-настоящему задуматься над тем, что происходит на экране. Арт-дизайн и волшебная атмосфера сказочного города Колумбии зачаровывает. Визуальный стиль у игры прекрасен, картинка радует глаз. Но за приятным и притягательным внешним видом города прячется противная изнанка, показывающая утопию во всей красе. Любители жанра оценят. Город дышит жизнью, и если вы хотите узнать всю его подноготную, то простор для исследования открыт. Множественные плакаты, развешанные на улицах, кинетоскопы, аудиодневники, тайные комнаты и закоулки города раскроют дополнительные детали сюжета и мира игры. Разнообразие геймплейных элементов не заставит игрока скучать. Различных способов для умерщвления противников у игры множество: разнообразный арсенал оружия, плазмидов, каждый из которых, по сути, является отдельной геймплейной механикой, различное снаряжение (тоники), которое позволяет выбрать свой собственный стиль боя и, конечно, Элизабет, которая не просто помогает в бою, подкидывая аптечки и соли, но даёт возможность использовать некоторые тактические преимущества окружения и не только в борьбе с противниками. Кстати, о персонажах. События, которые разворачиваются с главными героями и их растущая связь по мере прохождения не могут оставить равнодушным ни одного игрока, а самых впечатлительных людей может довести до слез. Главные герои игры - это проработанные личности, которые открываются с новой стороны по мере развития сюжета. Поэтому в них реально веришь и проникаешься. В общем, я не вижу ни одного повода не поиграть в эту игру. Если вы по какой-то неведомой причине не поиграли в эту игру или не знаете о существовании оной и сомневаетесь, стоит ли играть в продукт семилетней давности, то просто отбросьте все сомнения и бегом наверстывать упущенное. Bioshock Infinite - это авторское, обладающее особым шармом произведение, подобным которому нет и, возможно, уже больше не будет. Не упускайте такую возможность и не лишайте себя прикосновения к великому. Как говорится, не одной гениальностью Кодзимы единой. Откройте для себя гениальность Кена Левина.","timestamp_created":1589632301,"timestamp_updated":1589632301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69233371","author":{"steamid":"76561198105249024","num_games_owned":344,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":1666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1666,"last_played":1589630513},"language":"koreana","review":"안샀다고? 사라 당장","timestamp_created":1589631930,"timestamp_updated":1604391116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69233013","author":{"steamid":"76561198099078873","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":542,"last_played":1563831150},"language":"schinese","review":"这是我感觉NPC最生动的一款游戏了","timestamp_created":1589631523,"timestamp_updated":1589631523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69231454","author":{"steamid":"76561197989326254","num_games_owned":358,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1948,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":897,"last_played":1590069083},"language":"french","review":"Les plus :\n\n-La direction artistique.\n-Le scénario.\n-Les personnages.\n-La version française.\n\nLes moins :\n\n-Devoir sans cesse ramasser des objets.\n-Champ de vision faible par défaut, il faut aller dans les fichiers du jeu pour l'augmenter.\n-Séquence d'introduction un peu trop longue.\n-Gros bug en prenant l'ascenseur pour atteindre le niveau \"Main du Prophète\".
