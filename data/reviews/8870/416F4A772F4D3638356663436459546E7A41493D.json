Some recognizable from previous games, and some new and fun asf.\n-Exploring is more restricted than previous titles in the series but that does not mean there is no exploration at all. There are buildings, and rooms you can access through the lock picking mechanic.\n\nOnly thing I found upsetting was the performance. Old games sometimes do not hold up with modern software and it sucks because you will run into some problems while trying to replay this gem. \nSo if you have a gtx 1080ti and above (rtx series) you're going to run into some camera stuttering. \nA fix I found is disabling shadow cache through nvidia control panel and turning vsync onto adaptive. \n\nEven for a few camera stutters, I believe

I didn't find the gunplay to be anything special, and I feel like vigors just don't belong here. Weapon upgrades are also a very bad. Applying this system with the two weapon system isn't a good idea. And the upgrades are useless. Compare that to the first game where it always feels great to get a new upgrade. And the guns all feel the same. And multiple ammo types have been removed. And why are there RPG's in a game set in 1912? Also, I really don't like Elizabeth. And the game is relying on her to hold itself up. That's a problem. I've been NPC blocked more times than I can count. This happened a little in the first Bioshock, but it's ridiculous here. And NPC blocking is something I expect a sequel to improve on. I literally got stuck in a doorway for over 5 minutes and that was only the first time this happened. Speaking of Elizabeth being annoying, she talks over the audio diaries. Why? The autosave is a really bad idea. I don't like relying on it to get me through the game. I had a situation where I couldn't get the auto save to work and there's no manual save, meaning that every time I turned the game on I had to start all over again from the beginning, regardless of my progress. I don't know if that was a glitch or what, but it still sucked.\n\nThe vigors absolutely suck in this game. First off, why are they even here? How did these people discover Adam? Was it found inside a flying pig? And why did Columbia develop vigors anyway? Ratpure was all about the development of science at the expense of morality. Why the hell would a hyper religious society of Christians be playing god like this? And they don't even make any practical sense. Combat plasmids made sense in Rapture because there was a civil war. Why are vigors being developed for combat? And why don't the military use it? Outside of one or two with either the fire or crow vigor that rarely show up? Vigors are so illogical and stupid in this society.\nIn gameply, I really don't like these. In the first Bioshock, the massive amount of plasmids allowed for customization of the player's style and allowed for a variety of approaches and strategies. Here, they cut the max vigors down to 8. That wouldn't be a problem, and the fact I can hold all 8 at once as opposed to the previous 5 makes sense for the faster paced style of this game. And being able to use vigors and guns at the same time is a good improvement (one that Bioshock 2 already made)\nUnfortunately, the vigors suck. Aside from the possession, they all either function exactly the same or they're so useless you'd never use them. Inevitably, I just ended up switching between possession and electricity. They also try to diversify the vigors with a charge, but that just makes them bleed together even more. The charges all just boil down to \"place land mine with vigor effect on the ground\". Something I never used anyway. I find it amazing that Bioshock 2 gets so much hatred, even from people like the Completionist, for not adding new plasmids, but this game gets rewarded for reducing the plasmids and diluting the remaining ones till they're unrecognizable. Maybe id the levels were designed to compensate, the Devil's kiss would be more useful because of the arching, like the grenades in Infamous, or maybe the vigor traps would be a useful way to prepare for enemy encounters, like the cyclone traps. But the game design doesn't really make use of it.\n\nI found the possession vigor to have a lot of bad ideas. Enemies are supposed to commit suicide once the vigor stops, but many enemies commit suicide by shooting a rocket launcher at their feet, but the blast radius can also hurt the player if you're not careful. That's bad game design. And it happens a lot. I also noticed that if an enemy, like a gun turret, doesn't kill itself, then you have to wait for the possession to wear off before you can shoot it. I noticed this issue at the very beginning of my first play through. How did this not come up in play testing? I discovered it at the very beginning of my first playthrough. I cannot believe this problem somehow made it into the game.\n\nAlso, the bullet sponge ghost bosses are insufferable to deal with.\n\nThe story is really not good either. The first act of the game is literally just a single event (finding Elizabeth) being recycled 3 separate times and ironically, for as much hate as Ken Levine seems to have for Bioshock 2 (even though he didn't bother to help the relatively much smaller dev team that made Bioshock even once throughout the relatively tiny development time it had) this game copies a lot from that one. Even down to Elizabeth basically just being Eleanor but less good. The story it self is really shallow, trying to throw all kinds of pretentious bullshit at you.\nRacism = bad. Wow. Such an amazing idea. I never thought of that before.\nWait a minute...\nWhy are black people even living in Columbia? It's not exactly easy to get onto a flying city and they obviously weren't natives there.\nAnd why don't the black people actually use vigors? It's not like they're hard to find\n\nAnd the manipulative attempts to spotlight choices to the player, only to lie and have them mean nothing is so dishonest and insulting. Which pendant should Elizabeth choose? No one cares. Should you shoot or spare the bald guy with the electric vigor? No one cares.\nNothing matters. The game lied to you about your choices. None of it mattered.\nAlso, Booker is an idiot.\nSo much of the dialogue reads like a bad fanfiction you'd find on Wattpad.\nThe ending is also just stupid. Just banging pots and pans together to make people think it's good. What a lazy copout that ending was.How did Booker in the alternate timeline become Comstock?\nBy the time the Comstock death scene happened, I was so thoroughly done that I started listening to podcasts and stuff in the background. God, that monologue just went on and on and on. I hate games with several hours of unskippable cutscenes and this game is no exception.\nWhy is Columbia a flying city? Rapture was put under water because to hide it from the world. Why was Columbia flying?\nAnd Elizabeth's powers are extremely nebulous, poorly explained, and just dumb\nThey hyped up the songbird boss only to pull a lazy copout and throw it away in favor of that stupid blimp horde mode.\nHonestly, this game shouldn't be a Bioshock game. And many of the mechanics that we dragged in from other Bioshock games and crudely stapled onto this one hurt it the most. Especially the plot. And yeah, this story doesn't belong in Bioshock. Although, even on it's own terms, this story is dumb and the dimension jumping is really dumb.\n\nHere's a video I found about infinite\n\nhttps://youtu.be/u7q4beWV4Kc\n\nThis one also talks about infinite's terrible

Loved the museum, though, especially the music and Art Director painting.\n\nI'm not discussing plot twists not to spoil anything - the game had a few unexpected turns for me, even though I played quite a lot of games and gotten used to the usual plot twists. This game had a couple of surprises!\n\nAdvice: don't play on 1999 mode as first play-through.

Shooting feels good. AI is good but ofc like in 90% of game it's falwed so for experienced players  I'd suggest hard difficulty but even on normal I had many torubles and challenging fights (you can change difficulty at any time).\nGame is decently long (especially if you explore to find coins, lockpicks, secrets and such, and listen to lore).\nPerformance seems fine. there is not a lot of bug or glitches. Runs good. No problems with technicalities or bugs. And visually it is nice enough. Controls are good too. Everything is great tbh.\nThe skyline system isn't as big of a gameplay elemtn as trailer might let you to believe but that's nothing in comparison to waht rest of game has to offer. Old but Gold. Definetly worth it (even the full price).\nFirst DLC is sorta short but okay-ish. Second one is all about sneak and also okay but the main/base game is the thing you want.\nSorry about wall of typos and mistake and grammatical errors and so on.\n\n9/10\nAmazing game.
