Bioshock was great because plasmids were a novel thing, and there was a variety of ways you could take out enemies, from freezing, to fire, to goddamn BEES. Infinite drops the ball here, you have multiple generic stuns, a fireball, and a shield. they really aren't functionally different from one another enough to warrant including them.\n\nThe enemies aren't any better. Yeah, we saw the Motorized Patriot, the Boys of Silence, The Handymen and Firemen from the previews, but most of the time you face waves of boring guys with guns. And instead of facing off with Songbird (as was foreshadowed) you get a few waves of generic enemies as an anticlimax.\n\nOn top of that, you're made to believe your choices matter throughout the game. If you believed that, you were suckered. After scrapping the game and delaying it a few times, they decided that multiple endings (in a game with an ending involving multiple universes) was too much time.\nA two-gun carrying limit (wholly unnecessary) means that you won't get to try out a variety of weapons (half of which are useless), it means that you'll carry around the most common weapons so you won't run out of ammo.\n\nOh, and Elizabeth is pointless. Resident Evil 4 at least made protecting Ashley matter, Infinite just removes that part of the equation. All she does is dispense money or ammo you might have missed (removing the reason to explore), and pickpockets you after she revives you. She might be able to open tears, but that's only in certain situations and is useless 90% of the time. She can only pick locks if you find her a lockpick (which you can't re-use, despite it being a HAIR PIN), just making them glorified keys.\n\nProblem 2, The Story:\nPossibly the most overrated part of this game, the story shows promise through the game. It shows themes of lampooning American Exceptionalism and Americna Ideals, and condenses the Hypocrices of American history in a little can and delivers it neatly.\nFink, entrepenur extrordinare and representing freedom of enterprise, stole most of his inventions, treats his workers like shit, and snuffs out competition.\nThe society and government of Columbia, representative of American ideas of civic nationalism, free expression, and separation of powers espouses xenophobia and racism, is blatantly theocratic, places all the power in a single man, and supresses any political dissent with force.\nAll of this could have made an excellent game.\n\nInstead we got some bullshit about \"constants and variables\" to justify some alternate-worlds time-travel plot that doesn't make sense under scrutiny, pointless wankery over how special Elizabeth is, constant brooding by Booker in-between gleefully slaughtering dozens, and scripted events that are supposed to make us care about other characters that don't stay in the story for very long. Then it ends after going through Rapture (reminding you that you're NOT playing an altogether better game), with the biggest anticlimax ever (desparately trying to create a \"mindfuck\").\n\nThe gmae blatantly takes you through a place like Finktown, showing the state of working conditions in 1912 and the attitude of management towards them (They allude to the Pinkertons firing on striking wokers), they say Booker was a retired Pinkerton for god's sake, they show the beginnings of Socialist movements in the U.S., and even give a taste of totalitarian rule brought about by some of the revolutions that followed (like in the U.S.S.R.). The game then blueballs you by going back to the \"Elizabeth is speshul\" plot.\n\nThe game drags you through multiple places where blacks are segregated and treated like shit, then takes you through some abolitionists house (included with an actual historical abolitionist poster), then goes back to \"Elizabeth is speshul\"\n\nIt drags you through various technological laboratories and shows how Handymen and their counterparts are created, then goes back to \"Elizabeth is speshul\" No mention of ethical concerns, apparently too high-brow for the consumer.\n\nAll of the potential of the story was wasted, and coupled with the gameplay which feels like a dumbed-down version of Bioshock, just means I can't recommend this game to anyone. \n\nSave your money, buy Bioshock.","timestamp_created":1473383717,"timestamp_updated":1479960600,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.418963968753814697","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25414145","author":{"steamid":"76561197998839200","num_games_owned":1039,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3678,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2246,"last_played":1624294540},"language":"english","review":"A fascinating masterpiece with mind-blowing storyline, and the soundtrack is really awesome.

You're only alotted two weapons at a time for no reason other than arbitrary limitations that serve no reasonable purpose and can't be rationally explained. Then there's the level design, which is....ehhh. \n\nI don't dislike linear design if it's to create an experience that is carefully crafted and exhilirating which otherwise isn't possible if you allow the player to traverse the world freely. The linearity of the game is understandable in the very beginning, when the developers want you to walk through set pieces displaying the game's world and its citizenry. Long after that introductions over the developers kept the linearity to the game's detriment. There's no reason why the actual shooting should take place in long hallways with items as cover strewn about where you always enter from one corridor and exit out of the opposite end. Lienarity in the maps where you're actually playing the game is fine if you're creating set pieces and a particular experience (boss battles, escape sequences, etc), but that's not the case here. \n\nA few maps allowed you to traverse onto rooftops and on balconies which presented some variety, and there was an area that took place in a fun house, which was really intriguing, but for the most part everything was uninteresting and in-doors. If you're going to make the actual battle areas linear then make it look varied and/or allow me to jump around the place, otherwise I just get bored. You would think that a city in the sky would involve more areas and fun with suspension in the air and jumping across buildings. Guess not.\n\nThis isn't to say the maps are awful or the experience was excruciatingly painful, it's to say that I don't understand why such a....luke-warm experience merits 90's. Especially when a game released years BEFORE this one had maps whereby you can sneak around and essentially take over the area by setting up traps or just go in guns blazing. It's like a HUGE step back, honestly...but not entirely. Since it's just a different experience...just limited and with one way to play it.\n\n''But Moist, the story more than makes up for it!''\n\nOr so the argument goes, which is a fair argument. Problem is there are many games where this argument comes up and they do a much better job at keeping me entertained between story segments. Binary Domain comes immediately to mind (do yourself a favor and play it). \n\nBut what of the plot? \n\nIt's pretty good. I can't delve into details as it would spoil it, since the entire plot is pretty much a plot twist. What I can say is that it's pretty odd for a shooter and not a topic typically encountered in shooters. At the same time if you're going to play this for the plot: be warned that this isn't....this isn't a plot heavy game. Binary Domain had more plot to it since you would get story development and progression throughout the game, even during gameplay. Infinite on the other hand has what is essentially a running back and forth sequence mid-way through the game, and the plot comes to fruition at the end. In other words the plot progression sequences are quick and get to the point, which is fantastic if you want to have a developed plot whilst maintaining the game focused on shooting. At the same time you should keep in mind that while this has a thought out narrative, it isn't narrative heavy. So if you're going to play it for the plot, think again.\n\nIt's an alright game, what saves it is the plot, mostly. Otherwise the gameplay doesn't have me stocked enough to recommend it. In the simplest of terms: the plot and art direction save this game and make it passable.

I have a bit of Love/Hate relationship with the franchise,  so I think I can provide insight with a degree of objetivity, keeping in mind that ths just my personal opinion and many thing I dislike you might aswell enjoy so , with that in mind, so let`s gets started\n\n**SPOILER ALERT**\n\nTHE BAD: While the Bioshock Franchise is lauded as aseries of game with strong storytelling and an appelliang story that tackles very sensitive themes (In Infinite said themes are absically religion and racism) but well...It always suffer with bit a convoluted plot, nowhere is more evident that in the End of Bioshock Infinite, which basically boils down to you ae the bad Guy and the \"Good\" Guy at the same time. With a story that throws in your way some quantum physics magic and an Afro-irish Revolt against their Extremly Religious Overlords while you jump through space and time.\n\nIt`s...sorta confusing and at points feels unnecesary, whereas the two previous Bioschock entries had their crazy tech deparment, I cannot feel that infinite is nothing but pretentious. I think would have made way more sense if they stayed with the Genetic Gimmicks as the main plot device rather than throwing thsi barely explained thing about time travel, quantum physics and reality manipulation.\n\nThere is no moral choices and multiple endings, with lowers the replay value. There some choices but they are all but inconsecuential  \n\nTHE UGLY: I will probably get lots of flaks for this but the enver the less I must that many of the game problems, storywise, are due to Elizabeth: as the plot lives and dies around her, being instrumental for the space-time thingy, but the reasons about WHY this happens are never really explained and her centrality practically obliterates any link to the previous Bioshock games: I haed that some DLC provides SOME connections but it isn`t really satisfactory for me. This feels more like an entire New Game in which they slapped the Bioshock brand for PR sake      \n\nAlso, while Columbia`s enviroments are beatifully crafted, this is probably the least atmosphreic of all Biosohck entires: Sure , The centrality of the American Way of Life is well stablished, but THAT`S IT, I couldnpt feel any of that 60s air that both Fallout and the original Bioshocks gave me (which somehow evoked nostalgia for a time in which I didn`t even exist) I think I would ahve worked better if it had more of an stablisshed theme BEYOND the cult for America`s Culture: Since they were doing the whole racist Utopia I think a Confederate/Southern theme would ahve worked well and would have provided the game with lil`bit of personality of his own\n\nTHE GOOD: Where bioshock infinite truly shines for my is in it`s vastly improved Gameplay, Combat is still fast and dynamic (with still the Plasmids providing inteesting gameplay option) but ammo is more plentiful which in turn means that uou will die considerably less which is a relief coming from the almsot insta-death situation in which the other Bioshocks put you in. All Guns feel satisfactory to use but couldn`t help but feeling the Carbine might be overpoweed (and I beat the game using nohing but one Plasmid and that gun) \n\nThe fact that we got rid of the Big Daddy grinding and ADAM based upgrades means that game is more streamlined and less frustrating, but also feels that some options are being taken away: Tonics are repalced with clothing that provide similar effects and finding the appropiate sinergy is more imporant. hower since the gameplay and shooting is more fluid it think is change for the best        \n\nTHE CONCLUSION: Despite my critics and the fact this probably the most braindead and confusing of all Bioshock games, it`s tons of fun as a shooter, the story whill probably appeal to the majority and people.   i recommend for people who liked the original Bioshocks and like shooters with RPG elements, but do not seek the same type of game the first two Bioshocks were. They are completly different beasts, a nice good polished beast, but a diffeent beast none the less\n\nMY SCORE: 7/10","timestamp_created":1472805747,"timestamp_updated":1472805747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504517197608947754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25300749","author":{"steamid":"76561198046644205","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":613,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":458,"last_played":1490986861},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego de 10, merece la pena completamente, una historia que te enganchará hasta acabarlo.","timestamp_created":1472804961,"timestamp_updated":1472804961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25300573","author":{"steamid":"76561198125699441","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":693,"last_played":1472803566},"language":"english","review":"What an AMAZING game. 9 outta 10.

You get different weapons which all handle different, but you can only carry 2 at a time. Some special abilities add the salt into it (maybe that's why the \"mana\" is called \"salt\").\nMy favorite are the skyrails which let you move quickly inside a level. Sadly, there aren't too many parts where you can really use them. Also, spawning gimmicks (but only 1 at a time) with elizabeth is really nice and adds a small tactical notion to it.\nBut the enemies either are cannon fudder (which are more or less fun to play against) or terrible bulletsponges, which are just really annoying.\nI'd rate this rather fast-paced.\n\nStory: After the great Bioshock stories in Raputre I was hoping for something similar - and got disappointed. Rapture had it's great morality and ideology sidenotes and it was really fun to follow the story. Here, I've caught myself being eager more for fights than story, which should be a bad sign for a story driven game like this. I would talk about the randomness of the story here, but I won't to not spoil the story for anybody here.\nThe multiple endings could provide replayability, but honestly: It's really boring to play the game because of it's ridiculous backtracking, so I don't know if it's worth it.\n\nWorld: The developers tried to create the illusion of a living world, but in the end, it's all really linear. I've run through parts of the game only mashing the n key to show the route to the next objective. In the beginning, they say \"Don't shoot at everything, maybe it's not even necessary\", yet in most cases, it won't make any difference (well, to the ending maybe, not really for the gameplay). \n\nGraphics: Ok-ish. They certainly aren't bad, and the comic style mitigates some of its flaws, but the lack of detail (and polygons from time to time) is really dreadful. Effects are nice sometimes, especially smoke is very ugly. Nothing gamebreaking though.\n\nSound: Really nice, nothing to complain about. The voices match the characters.\n\n\nConclusion: The special abilities are rather boring and many of them do vaguely the same thing, but I liked using them. I just couldn't help to be reminded of Dishonored, which just had more intriguing abilities.\nThe game claims to be living from its story, but really, unless you like your story streched paperthin over the playtime, I can't really second that. It's not a bad story, hell no, but it's not the godlike experience some claim this game has.\n\nAll in all, I just barely recommend the game. At lacks at all aspects (except for the sound), nothing is great, but nothing is bad either. For less than 20 bucks, you should risk entering a very fantasy world. I just don't think it's worth more than that.","timestamp_created":1472749672,"timestamp_updated":1472749672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25285098","author":{"steamid":"76561198099725491","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":9000,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5535,"last_played":1599057865},"language":"english","review":"full philosophy game","timestamp_created":1472734735,"timestamp_updated":1482675025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25281403","author":{"steamid":"76561198060159892","num_games_owned":363,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1361,"last_played":1602031860},"language":"english","review":"one of the most beautiful plot tiwsted game ever","timestamp_created":1472715150,"timestamp_updated":1472715150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25280966","author":{"steamid":"76561198263782098","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":454,"last_played":1484643853},"language":"schinese","review":"以前打过盗版的，为了情怀入了一波正，重新来了一遍剧情。海葬2打完，Paid in Full的成就出来时几乎快哭了。确实整个生化奇兵无限的故事都是在讲“还债”这个话题。无论是Booker救Elizabeth，或者是Elizabeth救Sally。\n游戏的模式其实我个人不是很喜欢，我还是更习惯COD现代战争系列那种现代战争的枪械感觉。对各种能力我的使用也比较差==不过剧情真的是神作，这39块钱绝对值得花。","timestamp_created":1472711778,"timestamp_updated":1472711778,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25279274","author":{"steamid":"76561198121184380","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1439,"last_played":1522534997},"language":"spanish","review":"juego kl pa weno wn una obra de arte <3 mas de 5 estrellas la wea","timestamp_created":1472699096,"timestamp_updated":1511679768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25278512","author":{"steamid":"76561198173066035","num_games_owned":314,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":639,"last_played":1472660650},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏挺好玩~~可是感觉是不是短了点，十个小时就通关了。。。哈哈！","timestamp_created":1472694271,"timestamp_updated":1472694271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25277885","author":{"steamid":"76561198010635337","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1556,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1490571241},"language":"english","review":"not playable , you cannnot customize the keybindings to your confirmed habits . \nyou cannot use tab , backspace , enter , nor try to adapt to a num-pad because same buttons cant be assigned .\n\nmaybe try to learn writing with your feet .\n","timestamp_created":1472690401,"timestamp_updated":1472690401,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.433749198913574219","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25276417","author":{"steamid":"76561198022754076","num_games_owned":1263,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":703,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":568,"last_played":1478885392},"language":"spanish","review":"Probablemente uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado en mi vida.
