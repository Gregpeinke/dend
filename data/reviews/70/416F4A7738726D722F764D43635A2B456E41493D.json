I enjoyed the first hour or two of the game, seeing the infamous black mesa that is referenced so often in newer half life games. But over time the gameplay gets stale and frustrating. It gets progressively more difficult, to a point at which you have to reload saves continuously in order to perfect your play. health is so scarce that if you complete an area but lose a tiny amount of health, chances are you are going to restart it in order to do it without losing health. From the exceptional reviews i was assuming the game would still hold up, even for a new player in 2020. And it did, for a little while. Older games typically revolve around the save and reload mechanic, allowing them to make exceptionally difficult levels that you can brute force your way through, but its just not fun or immersive when compared with the modern style of game. The graphics aren't great but when i finished the game the graphics were not what left a sour taste in my mouth. Instead, the slippery movement and the bullet sink enemies left me feeling frustrated and bored. Levels which involved platforming were so annoying because whenever gordon moves it feels like he is sliding about an ice rink. Enemies took so many bullets to kill it just felt boring to hold down the trigger and wait for them to die, wasting all my ammunition in the process. The level design is slightly worse than ok, its easy to get confused with the number of crossroads but in the end you get through it. Overall, you may enjoy it if you wear a pair of nostalgia glasses as you play but personally, as a new player i drew more frustration from it than i did enjoyment.","timestamp_created":1597965411,"timestamp_updated":1598531151,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74638577","author":{"steamid":"76561198058044061","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1397,"last_played":1597964861},"language":"english","review":"its classic shooter action. you have to use you head sometimes too. all the guns feel good to shoot even the pistol.","timestamp_created":1597964955,"timestamp_updated":1597964955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74636358","author":{"steamid":"76561197989918910","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":558,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":558,"last_played":1597903158},"language":"english","review":"A classic FPS that is still fun nearly 20 years after its original release.","timestamp_created":1597961167,"timestamp_updated":1597961167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74635636","author":{"steamid":"76561197971758991","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":60,"playtime_at_review":1078,"last_played":1660497310},"language":"english","review":"good classic","timestamp_created":1597959903,"timestamp_updated":1597959903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74634415","author":{"steamid":"76561198969128382","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":1021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":324,"last_played":1655588512},"language":"english","review":"my game broke","timestamp_created":1597957950,"timestamp_updated":1597957950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74630991","author":{"steamid":"76561198362189662","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":4530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1655070471},"language":"english","review":"this is epic, what else can i say?","timestamp_created":1597952825,"timestamp_updated":1597952825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74629826","author":{"steamid":"76561198322235775","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":169,"last_played":1645464566},"language":"english","review":"There's a reason for Freeman being a theoretical physicist, unlike Doom, Quake and other games where you're rewarded for killing every enemy, finding every secret, etc, Half-Life is more puzzle focused and it becomes apparent that you can't (low ammo, low health, overwhelming) or shouldn't (losing ammo, potentially losing health) win every fight, so you must traverse through trying to outsmart or avoid a lot of them.\n\nThe deathmatch is great, I thought I would suck at it but I only mildly do so therefore it's great.

in 1998 for the PC, Half-Life runs on the GoldSrc engine, which is a heavily modified version of the Quake engine. This game is well known for pioneering story-telling in video games. Video games before Half-Life had very simple stories, usually written at the back of the box. Games like DOOM focused mainly on the gameplay, leaving story as an after thought. Half-Life aimed to change this, and it succeeded tenfold. \n\nGameplay: \n\nHalf-Life is a typical late 90's shooter. You have your roster of guns and can carry all of them (as soon as you obtain them), you move quickly and therefore, combat is very fast paced. If you aren't an old-school FPS player, then I recommend playing the game on Easy if you've never played it before, as the higher difficulties can prove to be quite brutal. \nThe gunplay feels great, with a wide variety of weapons to choose from, and almost all of them serving some sort of purpose throughout the campaign. (i.e. pistol for picking off headcrabs and barnicles, shotgun for tankier enemies, magnum and crossbow for long range etc.). There is also a wide variety of enemies. Early on, you will be fighting aliens and zombies,  but later in the game there will be marines and assassins, as well as more difficult alien enemies, each with their own quirks to spice up gameplay. In the end, it feels like a game of chess, as each gun serves a different purpose and is good against different enemy types. One issue I have with the gunplay is that it this game has no bullets, but instead, hitscan weapons, meaning there is no way to dodge the projectiles fired by marines and some aliens like the vortigaunts. Overall though, gameplay is very satisfying. \n\nLevel Design: \n\nLevel design, for the most part, is fantastic. The game has 18 chapters total, and each chapter is split into multiple levels. The transitions between levels are smooth and fast on modern machines, and hardly break the immersion of gameplay. Some levels also have very well designed arenas to combat enemies in. \nThat said, this game is extremely linear, but I'd say this works in its favor, as it aims to tell a story in a fully interactive environment. Control is never taken away from the player, and the introductory 2 chapters are completely devoid of combat. This makes for an extremely memorable experience, not seen in many games nowadays, which tend to overuse cutscenes and feel more like movies than actual games. \nThe only part of the level design I did not enjoy, were the Xen levels (During the last quarter of the game), which feel very rushed and barren compared to the rest of the game. If you don't particularly care about the story, I might go as far as suggesting you skip these levels, as they are mostly just platforming, with small combat sections in between. (The first Xen chapter can literally be beaten in about 5 minutes during normal play)\n\nStory: \n\nThe story follows Gordon Freeman, a young theoretical physicist who works in the Black Mesa research facility. One day however, an experiment he is a part of goes horribly wrong, opening an inter-dimensional portal to a border world known as \"Xen\". Aliens from said world start flooding our world, and soon the entire research facility is overrun by them, and it is up to Gordon and his fellow scientist to find a way to close the dimensional rift before it is too late.\nThroughout the entire plot, Gordon does not utter a single word, nor does he have any background other than the theoretical physicist part, meaning he is the perfect vessel for the player. Want to be a complete psychopath and slaughter everyone in your path, including your fellow scientists? The game lets you do that. This is one huge advantage that other games of this time period or later don't have, be it due to essential NPC's or morality in-game choices.  \nI will not spoil the ending (though most people most likely already know it by now), but I will say that for newcomers to the series, the story becomes very interesting the further you go, mostly because of a mysterious figure you will be seeing throughout the game known as the \"G-Man\". \nThe story itself isn't anything groundbreaking, but it's the way it is presented to the player which makes it memorable. As mentioned before, you are always in control, and therefore, feel like a part of the game world. \n\nGraphics: \n\nGraphically, this is the game's weakest aspect. The graphics have aged horribly, and textures are upscaled and heavily pixelated. Models are also quite low-poly, especially if you aren't using the HD models (can be toggled inside the options). Some people may enjoy the graphics style due to its retro charm, but most may be put off by it. On the bright side, the game  fully supports modern resolutions and can be played in 1080p (And I think even 4K, but I was unable to test it) and at 60 FPS. \n\nSound: \n\nThis game has brilliant sound design. From environmental echoes, to amazing gun sounds and the occasional music that plays during combat, fitting perfectly with both the atmosphere of the game and rythm of the combat. Voice acting on the other hand, however, isn't that great, and some voice lines are quite low quality. \n\nVerdict/Conclusion: \n\nHalf-Life pioneered story-telling in video games. Not only does it perfectly incorporate its story into the gameplay, never even once taking control away from the player, but it is also extremely satisfying with its gunplay. The story, although nothing spectacular, is strengthened by the fact mentioned above. Graphics have a neat retro feel to them, but may be off-putting for most. Level design is stellar, and outside of the few ending chapters, it has great pacing and combat sequences, as well as memorable set-pieces. Sound design suffers only from poorly recorded voice lines here and there, but overall does a great job to immerse the player and have guns sound like they truly pack a punch. Overall, this game gets a 10/10 for me, as it is one of the most influential games of all time, and should be in any FPS enthusiast's library.","timestamp_created":1597789944,"timestamp_updated":1597792005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74528517","author":{"steamid":"76561198857352713","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":4506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4337,"last_played":1653844483},"language":"english","review":"as a gordon freeman simp i approve","timestamp_created":1597787883,"timestamp_updated":1597787883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74527959","author":{"steamid":"76561198297906836","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2057,"last_played":1600706157},"language":"english","review":"Play it, suffer.","timestamp_created":1597787057,"timestamp_updated":1597787057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74527322","author":{"steamid":"76561198155350531","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":769,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1616118294},"language":"english","review":"I played this because it is a piece of video game history, with the difficulty on normal. As somebody that grew up on hand me down style PS2 generation games, games that were inherently broken in some parts and limited technically by a controller, I can say playing this was incredibly frustrating. The game is not inherently difficult, but lots of the issues provided with the base game and limitations of the time make it so it doesn't quite hold up in terms of quality. \n\nMovement is like sliding on butter, the game tries to autoaim your gun for you and fails miserably, some enemies will happily one shot you, some enemies are unkillable, movement in the air is nearly impossible and incredibly inconsistent, environmental cues trigger without warning and will one shot you. Put these all together, and you get every level in the game, the final boss with this is amplified to such an aggravating extent. Games that are hard to be difficult, like Cuphead and Dark Souls have fleshed out systems that only sometimes toss you for no reason. This game, a normal game, tosses you every few minutes. I attribute most of this to how old it is, and that's okay - it just was not a fun game for me.\n\n3/10","timestamp_created":1597786046,"timestamp_updated":1597786426,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.421847760677337646","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74523612","author":{"steamid":"76561199022357184","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":33789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1655176637},"language":"english","review":"i
