I finished the game on hard my first time through and I found it too easy. I'm a lazy gamer, you have to force me to use spells and abilities otherwise I won't use them. The game was easy enough on hard that I just shot everything in sight, making my first run through the game not that interesting. But the characters, OMG. Elizabeth and Booker have amazing chemistry, and the voice acting is off the chains! \n\nSo after my not that interesting first run, I played through the DLC in 1999 mode (hardest difficulty in the game, unlocked after finishing it once) and I LOVED IT! Now I couldn't just sit on my ass and shoot everything, I had to use every power at my disposal, I had to lay traps and lure enemies into them, I had to use the skylines (never really used them the first time around). The game truly came alive. \n\nBut really the meat of this game is the story and characters. There are some issues; the game has some pretty racist undertones in the main game. They tried to rectify it in the second DLC but it felt kind of forced. Personally though it didn't really affect my enjoyment, I was just totally engrossed by the two main characters. I highly recommend Bioshock Infinite. Just make sure you play the game on the hardest setting you can handle!\n\n","timestamp_created":1427511562,"timestamp_updated":1427511562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15084675","author":{"steamid":"76561198068149223","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1405,"last_played":1432262723},"language":"english","review":"One of the best single player experiences I have had.","timestamp_created":1427510227,"timestamp_updated":1427510227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15083853","author":{"steamid":"76561197991607332","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":883,"last_played":1608069282},"language":"english","review":"Probably the best single-player game I've ever played.","timestamp_created":1427505255,"timestamp_updated":1427505255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15083842","author":{"steamid":"76561198049610814","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":718,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":679,"last_played":1436578304},"language":"spanish","review":"el mejor fps de disparo una de las mejorees sagas y historia excelente 10/10","timestamp_created":1427505132,"timestamp_updated":1427505132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15083824","author":{"steamid":"76561198075527022","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":822,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":804,"last_played":1439121191},"language":"brazilian","review":"bioshok infinite é um jogo simplesmente lindo e vale cada centavo gasto\n","timestamp_created":1427505040,"timestamp_updated":1427505040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15083705","author":{"steamid":"76561198086744896","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":904,"last_played":1478247683},"language":"koreana","review":"전편 이야기를 하지 않을수가 없는 열화된 게임\n\n없어진 퍼즐, 선형전인 게임, 그런 본편 보다 더 완성도가 떨어지는 DLC","timestamp_created":1427504385,"timestamp_updated":1427504385,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15083621","author":{"steamid":"76561198038403552","num_games_owned":871,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":981,"last_played":1615809814},"language":"turkish","review":"konu ve atmosfer muazzam. roman gibi oyun","timestamp_created":1427503897,"timestamp_updated":1427503897,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519841313362121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15083318","author":{"steamid":"76561198055740888","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":283,"last_played":1432606989},"language":"english","review":"10/10\n\nSometimes when a game has great gameplay you end up sacrificing a good story and vice-versa, but BioShock: Infinite has a great blend of both. Thought-provoking and interesting all the way through, this game is a must-play. The selection of weapons isn't extremely vast in this FPS, but is extensive enough to provide options without making the player feel overwhelmed. Vigors are a fun way to add magic to the game without making it seem like a mage-type feature similar to many RPG's. Elizabeth is a really well-balanced character that players will really feel attached to. Also, she is almost never in your way during a fight and instead actually makes herself useful by finding money and items like health and ammo throughout the game. She's definitely one of, if not my favorite sidekick. There are choices in the game which is always appreciated although they don't make a huge difference in the end. The ending is shocking, thought-provoking, and feels conclusive. +6 extra hours unrecorded offline.","timestamp_created":1427502045,"timestamp_updated":1522316990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15083098","author":{"steamid":"76561198097575049","num_games_owned":367,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1427500274},"language":"english","review":"BioShock Infinite, wow.

У него была дочь, Анна, о которой он не помнил. И вот появились те люди, которые могли избавить его от этого долга. Для этого Букер должен отправиться в \"Колумбию\" и доставить этим людям девушку взамен на возврат долга. В Колумбии Букеру предлагают переродиться, на что он соглашается. Он находит эту девчонку. Элизабет, так звали девчонку, умеет делать так называемые \"разрывы\" - что-то вроде окон в будущее. Девит замечает, что у Элизабет нет пальца. Она говорит, что не знает, что случилось с ним. Элизабет ненавидит своего отца за то, что он запер ее в башне, которую охраняет огромный железный \"соловей\". Дальше Девит и Элизабет пробираются к Комстоку, тому самому отцу, через разрывы преодолевая смерти нужных им людей. По ходу игры у Букера временами идет кровь из носа, когда он заходит в какой-либо разрыв. Тоже самое происходит с теми, кто умирал в реальном мире, а не в разрыве. При встрече Комсток говорит Элизабет, что Букер знает, что случилось с ее пальцем. Девит говорит, что вообще не имеет понятия о том, что говорит Комсток и убивает его. У Букера начинает течь кровь из носа. Затем он вместе с Элизабет убивает того железного соловья. Затем Элизабет хочет добиться правды и водит главного героя по разрывам разного времени. В одном из них они наблюдают картину, как Комсток отдает маленького ребенка неким людям в другой разрыв, Букер пытается остановить его, зная, что этот ребенок, его дочь - Анна. Но он не успевает и ребенку разывом отрубает палец.. Тут Букер понимает, что Элизабет его дочь. Он говорит Элизабет, чтобы та открыла разрыв туда, где Комсток еще не родился, чтобы не дать произойти всему, что уже произошло. Попадая в тот разрыв, он видит священника, который предлагает ему переродиться. Тут Девит понимает, что он и есть тот самый Комсток. Элизабет замечает это и топит его... Вообщем весь смысл игры - убить самого себя, о чем говорит Букеру еще живой Комсток из Колумбии.

The nature of this game is such that almost any discussion of the story is going to result in spoilers.  The late Roger Ebert was famous (or infamous) for stating that video games could never be art because the direct influence of the player on the game itself undercuts what, for him, was the most important criterion of art--that there is an artist (or group of artists) who strives to communicate a specific idea to others through the artists exclusive manipulation of some medium (film, paint, clay, etc.).  BS:I proves him wrong as it conveys a very meaningful (and somewhat sad) story and it does so without eliminating all meaningful player interaction, as some games like Dear Esther had done.   BI:S may not be the best game-as-game (there are some minor issues with the combat mechanics, and, like all fps games, a certain amount of repetitiveness in battles), but it may be the best example of game-as-art or game-as-literature ever created.   While the game's head-on frankness in dealing with uncomfortable issues of race, religion, and 19th century jingoism have been widely discussed, and the subject of some controversy, these are essentially backdrop to the story of the protagonist/player, Booker DeWitt, and the most remarkable AI character ever created:  Elizabeth.  To say more of their relationship would be to give away too much.  I cannot think of any other game where you wind up emotionally invested in an AI character as much as in this game (Black and White is somewhat different because you yourself create the character).

Банальность прохождения с лихвой компенсируется классным сюжетом, харизматичность главных героев настолько высока что хочется просто удалить сохранения и начать игру заново. Очень был расстроен когда прошёл до конца, так как в игру хочется возвращаться снова и снова. От меня - 10 из 10.
