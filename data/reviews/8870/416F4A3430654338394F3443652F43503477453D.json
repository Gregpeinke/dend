It's a wonderful parody of fanatism may it be religious, patriotic or economic. It's a wonderful drama of conflict between caring and not caring, knowing and not knowing, making a change or don't. And finaly it's a philosophical dicussion about reality, dimensions, connectivity... well, see for yourself.\n\nThe gameplay finally is decent, quite similar to other BioShock titles. You get several weapons (and variations of them between wich you eventually have to chose) and several special abilities that can be upgraded by collecting permanent boosts, hidden in the world. Technically the levels are rather linear, though not in a boring way and periodically there are several optional interceptions. Plus the rich detail invites to explore. Recommendation: keep your weapons down until a fight starts - there are several moments to experience the daily life of Columbia that you'll miss if you scare the people.\n\nThis game combines aspects of horror, action, drama and even a decent amount of festivity. I didn't grew fond to the characters as in an rpg, but I really grew fond of Columbia with all it's tragic, wonders, perversions and horrors.\n\nOh, I recommend you to experience BioShock 1 before this (for some reference moments and a deeper unterstanding). The second one is great too, but by no means necessary.","timestamp_created":1576094836,"timestamp_updated":1576094932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59678182","author":{"steamid":"76561198130699910","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":3324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1033,"last_played":1588043687},"language":"brazilian","review":"   O que é \"Bioshock Infinite\" para mim?\n   Essa é a minha franquia favorita de todos os tempos, nenhum enredo e level design me deslumbram tanto como a dessa franquia. Apesar de não ser o meu favorito da trilogia tenho que reconhecer a grandiosidade desse projeto. \"Infinite\" é sim, incrível em vários aspectos. Bioshock é um desses jogos profundos, aborda questões filosóficas, reflexões morais, críticas ao fanatismo e a alienação, que vão muito além de seu gameplay. Engana-se quem pensa ser apenas um FPS com elementos RPG. Esteja disposto a explorar o mapa e absorver a história.\n  Primeiramente, acabo de zerar pela terceira vez o modo história (primeira vez no pc) e é incrível como sempre tem uma história que passa batido ou que não tinha entendido da ultima vez. A campanha não é muito grande (uma pena), levei 13h nessa ultima jogatina, más ela é fenomenal. Simplesmente, manteve o padrão da série.\n  Sou mais fã de Rapture, más a cidade nesse jogo é bem mais viva que nos outros, com vários NPCs, áudios e trechos cinemáticos. Muito recorrentes para evidenciar as hipocrisias e falsos moralismos, sejam tanto por parte dos que estão no poder, quanto dos oprimidos. O que quero dizer é que: \"Columbia\" é muito sólida, você não tem dúvidas de quem ela seja, nem de como ela dialoga com a nossa realidade. O próprio ambiente sabe como contar e conduzir sua história , e seu viés a explorar.\n  Além disso, os protagonistas são incríveis e eram mais do que necessários para desenvolver a história. Ambos são Marcantes, complexos e apresentam progressões excepcionais, nada acontece por acaso entre eles, e tudo se encaminha lentamente, achei bem orgânico. Quanto a trilha não há o que reclamar, músicas de épocas , ótimas orquestras e referências a músicas famosas e até atuais, da nossa realidade (algo que se esclarece perto do final do jogo).\n  Mesmo assim o jogo não é perfeito, por exemplo: senti falta de uma reposição à altura dos BIG DADDYS, tenho um grande carinho pelo Songbird, porém, ela aparece poucas vezes e de forma muito breve, sem contar que faltou um combate memorável. Os \"minions\" são totalmente \"esquecíveis\". No entanto o que mais me revoltou foi o fato de ter final único. O jogo te ofereces um sistema de escolhas durante a campanha, só que esquece de desenvolver as consequências (algo meio desnecessário, essa falsa sensação de poder de escolha), justo um dos pontos fortes dos outros jogos. Você que decidia, o mal compensa? É justo? No que isso prova meu valor? O que isso traz para a cidade?\n  Gostaria muito q tivessem finais múltiplos, e oportunidades não faltaram. Caberia bem oferecer narrativas diferenciadas de \"jogador a jogador\", e adotar um final como verdadeiro para desenvolver na sequência (assim como fizeram entre o \"Bioshock 1\" e 2, em que o final \"Do bem\" era o verdadeiro.\n  Sem contar que o jogo é muito fácil (até mesmo no hard), e a dificuldade, racionamento, e a estratégia (até mesmo o clima tenso), que eram aspectos que me agradavam nos antecessores, praticamente não existem mais. De certa forma ele é muito mais FPS do que os outros, muitos mais fácil e dinâmico (corre, atira e \"spamma\" vigores, pula por trilhos, tudo sem pensar muito). Cabe a você, decidir se isso é bom ou ruim. Talvez por isso eu recomende você iniciar a trilogia pelo \"Infinite\". Mesmo assim não jogue as DLCs desse jogo antes de jogar os jogos passados, são um grande ponto forte do jogo, talvez até  melhor que a campanha principal e de certa forma o encerramento da trilogia (DlCs serão analisadas separadamente).\n   \"Bioshock Infinite\" perdeu um pouco da essência dos anteriores? Talvez, más só um pouco. Faz valer cada centavo até o final. Concluindo, faltam palavras para descrever como esse jogo é incrível, profundo e universal. Só jogando mesmo para entender. Tem diversas frases e filosofias marcantes nesse jogo, em que tudo é muito rico. Vai jogar e depois precisar de vídeos que expliquem a história e suas teorias, e ainda assim sentir-se gratificado. Mas se quer jogar apenas pelo \"tiro e ação\", vai fundo, não vai se arrepender, más saiba o que esta deixando para trás. Por fim, esse é o mais diferente da trilogia e um verdadeiro MUST. Não decepciona. Isso é \"Bioshock Infinite\" uma experiência além do próprio jogo.

Cry 5一般，随之而来屎一样的剧情体验将这种第一印象撕了个粉碎。在结束主线剧情之后，另外买的3个DLC我已经没什么兴趣了，直接退出来删游戏。或许我讨厌它的剧情是因为我没有玩过前几部，不了解BioShock背后的世界观，但我作为一个刚开始体验这个系列的新玩家，我觉得就这一部Infinite而言，它的剧情实在是不足以支撑起它“门面作品”这样的称号。\n\n本作的剧情不算是特别冗长无聊，但它零散的故事背景和差强人意的结构安排，让整部游戏玩起来就像是在一个乱七八糟的房间里找散落的珠宝，这里一颗，那里一颗，找到头疼还没找完，全程没有一丝愉快的体验，反而有一种“我的天啊赶紧结束吧，我实在是不想听这些NPC耍嘴皮子了”这样的感觉。尤其是玩到后面的时候，它本身的构想是不错的（平行宇宙），但作为一款剧情导向而不是开放世界导向的游戏，让玩家一遍又一遍地打类似的敌人，听一句又一句差不多意思的陈词滥调，真的是作者的本意吗？如果不是，那么这是一个严重的编剧失误；如果是，那么作者可能脑子被海水灌了。\n\n[b]电子游戏向来被称为继文学、绘画、音乐、舞蹈、电影、戏剧、雕塑和建筑之后的“第九艺术”，而且本作经常被拿来当做“第九艺术”的代名词，在全球玩家中享有极高的知名度。但当我体验完本作之后，我发现它除了画风之外一无是处，配不上“第九艺术”这样的称号，只是徒有虚名。[/b]\n\n[h1]购买建议：三思。[/h1]","timestamp_created":1575979491,"timestamp_updated":1638624648,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.426882624626159668","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59599302","author":{"steamid":"76561198200676913","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":867,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":840,"last_played":1576062646},"language":"schinese","review":"

2周末结束后截了2558张截图，如果平均每张截图8MB，只怕截的图一共比游戏还大。\n\n[strike]另外说一点这个游戏可能是因为画质太好，杀起人来竟然比耻辱还血腥。[/strike]\n游戏的枪都可以当艺术搜藏品来欣赏了。\n\n[b]氛围渲染[/b]：前期完美，后期闹鬼。剧情过渡自然，配乐、海报、场景内演出还有可以得奖品的小游戏和很多种食物让我觉得我是来哥伦比亚旅游的。而后期就令人毛骨悚然了。\n\n[b]配乐/配音/音效[/b]：完美，上个世纪风格的配乐，身临其境的配音，浑厚而不刺耳的枪械音效，这一点我打满分。\n\n[b]背景设定[/b]：背景设定有很多，只玩不挖掘是看不到什么的。游戏里的哥伦比亚是一座天空之城，于1893年建成，在同年的芝加哥世界博览会上展出，1902年独立于美国，虽然是架空背景，但和真实历史息息相关。比如士兵公园的英烈殿里有中国的义和团运动和美国的伤膝河战役的展览。我在这里就不多讲了，玩的时候也玩不太懂，去B乎或者我在季票测评发的网站上看解读吧，内容很长的。\n剧情也相当出色，但是由于分辨率兼容性影响，无法看清录音和录影里的台词。\n\n[b]游戏教学/引导[/b]：极为用心。很少卡关。一开始主角通过参加嘉年华学习放技能和开枪。前期期就算你没卡关稍微停留看看风景主角也会碎碎念比如说这个空轨好像可以搭乘了什么什么的，手柄下键也可以引导。而且主角不是一上来就有大量让人头晕眼花的技能，而是通过打败精英怪并搜刮其药水或根据流程获得技能。\n\n[b]游戏战斗[/b]：\n游戏回血回蓝不是靠呼吸，而是靠吃东西和搜刮（只有回盾是靠脱战呼吸回复），或在自动售卖机那买，这一点我不是很适应，但游戏每打完一波敌人总回有一段路程休整，不存在像地牢游戏那样死前仰天长叹：“血~瓶~呢！”那种情况（就算你没血没蓝没弹药，游戏史上最有用的NPC也会时不时丢给你你急需的物资）\n\n游戏枪械手感一流，只是子弹太少，一把手枪或机枪（冲锋枪？）的初始后备弹药上限为100余，打一个敌人就掉几个弹药，地图搜刮出来的弹药全靠脸，而可能十几发弹药还打不死一个人，所以这个游戏不能像其他普通射击游戏那样射个痛快了。\n而技能虽然玩法无可挑剔，但是技能升级是要去自动售卖机那购买，而且升级花费老贵了，我直到通关还只买了几个升级项，还有枪械升级和物资抢着手中的少得可怜的预算。\n\n[b]游戏史上教科书式的NPC队友：[/b]想必大家都经历过坑爹没毛用成事不足败事有余的NPC队友（想起贴吧上战地四那个两NPC贴脸对射半小时谁都没死就像笑），而本游戏的伊丽莎白在设计上另辟蹊径，既不抢人头也不坑爹，专心打辅助，（你是天使我是法鸡，你是科塔娜我是士官长，我们合作无间），你倒下了她还会急救（英雄不朽）。如果你认为你无需辅助，正好游戏有一段时间伊丽莎白要和你分离，真是应了制作人那一句话：只有失去了才懂得珍惜。\n\n剧情分支：是的，这个游戏有轻微的剧情分支选项，比如（剧透）[spoiler]在主角抽中77号棒球时，主角可以选择将棒球丢向夫妻，丢向主持人，也可以不丢（我选了不丢，然后条子来抓我）[/spoiler]。\n\n[h1]游戏缺点：[/h1]\n[b]保存机制[/b]：不能手动保存，自动保存点又少，我都不太敢随意退出游戏了。\n[b]读取/选关机制[/b]：受保存机制影响，游戏读档机制十分薄弱，选关界面说明不行，如果你想回顾一下某一关，对不起，你很难看出来你要读哪一个档。\n\n[b]太线性化：[/b]虽然游戏有充实的收集，解密元素，但是游戏过于线性，让人玩起来感觉压力山大，希望游戏至少能学习狙击精英3或古墓丽影这样的半开放关卡设计，这样才给人感觉轻松一些。\n\n[b]字幕/游戏内汉化支持[/b]：字幕字体比蚊子还小（这说明游戏不是4K原生开发的），比龙腾世纪起源的还小，看字幕使我眼花，而且当游戏同时有多个人讲话时，字幕会切换，而不是保留并新增一条字幕。(求求伊丽莎白不要有事没事哼一下了，你不说话没人把你当哑巴，你这样哼使得一个“哼”字挤掉了别人的字幕。)\n而游戏内有大量英文海报，浮雕，说明等物品，而且游戏没有像泰坦陨落2/命运2那样汉化到内饰，中国玩家看得一脸懵逼，游戏镜头对准部分英文海报时，会看到字幕，而字幕又太小，要求视角也谜，所以很多情况我无法知道其英文的内容。\n\nUI：无法自动缩放的不止是字幕，还有UI。\n游戏内置影片/录音等收集内容：影片无法自动缩放，录音播放时没有字幕。\n装备/收集回顾系统：游戏有装备系统和收集系统，按O键查看一切，但其界面一样的无法自动缩放，所以界面大小大概只有我4K屏的1/16，可能连720的像素大小都没有，这一点就不如普通游戏了。\n\n[b]氛围把控[/b]：恐怖/诡异元素占比太大，制作者*改不了吃*。我知道你前作恐怖氛围塑造很成功，可你到了新的一作应该已经改头换面了，还抓着恐怖元素不放，你知道我玩这个游戏时有多怕吗？游戏最恐怖的地方是喇叭头那，还有一个喇叭头回头杀。\n\n[b]阴影贴图优化和在二周末的体验[/b]：我在二周目开了一个DX11专属优化选项，然后游戏明显比一周目平均低了10-20帧，阴影贴图也出现了马脚，即同一个贴图的远处和近处出现了明显的分界线。\n\n[h1]其他要点：[/h1]\n游戏宣传不给力，相信很多不懂英语的玩家看到纯英文宣传介绍都没什么动力了解这个游戏，宣传截图更是让人感觉莫名其妙，但是相信我，这一个游戏背景和我们的世界息息相关，不是纯架空背景。\n\n还有，给了海葬DLC差评，我很抱歉，因为其DLC回归恐怖，我无法接受。\n\n建不建议开修改器：不开，我纯手打都打得过普通(困难？可能是游戏内部翻译bug)，死的次数才个位数，但是二周目可以刷刷钱和钥匙和盐，体验一下技能的魅力。（如果想速通也可以作弊）\n\n~$~$~$~$~$~$~$~$~$~$~$~$超级神作标签~$~$~$~$~$~$~$~$~$~$~$~$~","timestamp_created":1575961066,"timestamp_updated":1616662128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59594375","author":{"steamid":"76561198102922967","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":417,"last_played":1577178323},"language":"schinese","review":"它的水准还用说吗？","timestamp_created":1575959443,"timestamp_updated":1575959443,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59594183","author":{"steamid":"76561198327580399","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2096,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1962,"last_played":1599889018},"language":"schinese","review":"惊闻Cloud
