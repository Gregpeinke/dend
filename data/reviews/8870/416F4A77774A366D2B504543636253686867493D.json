Ты боишься Бога? — Нет. Но тебя — боюсь.\" [/h1]\nНачну сразу с того, что это одна из моих самых любимых игр в целом, но все же постараюсь быть объективным, вынося вердикт.\n\nНачнем с [b]геймплея[/b]. Да, он крепок, имеет ряд интересных фишек (разрывы, воздушные трассы, разнообразные энергетики и т.д.), но к середине игры он приедается, на тот момент раскрыв уже себя полностью и не имея уже ничего, чем можно удивить или развлечь игрока. Пусть он и выполнен качественно и держит свою планку, но, если вас интересует исключительно игровой процесс, то эта игра не для вас. У нее другие сильные стороны, которые оставлю напоследок.\n[b]Дизайн и мир[/b]. Колумбия прекрасна. Когда только Букер (ГГ) прибывает сюда, кажется, что человечество наконец нашло мифическое Эльдорадо. С первых минут нам пытаются показать, что, мол, это рай (символично, ведь Колумбия находится в облаках). Но не все в раю так просто, а за занавесом \"сцены\" идиллия улетучивается. Вскоре мы узнаем вещи, которые заставят нас ужаснуться, и на фоне прекрасного мира контраст от происходящего усиливается в сто крат. Дизайнерам серии нужно отдать должное - они умеют в атмосферу: когда подводный \"Восторг\" давил на игрока своей гнетущей обстановкой, город над облаками прям излучает свою воздушность и легкость. Чему сильно способствует используемая при создании дизайна мира карикатурность. Но есть в дизайне и минусы. Персонажи выглядят до жути \"пластиковыми\". Временами, на них и вовсе неприятно смотреть (пастырь, что \"крестит\" ГГ в начале игры яркий тому пример). Даже \"живая\" и детально прописанная Элизабет превращается в восковую фигурку (при этом, не лучшего качества), когда на лице перестают действовать рукотворные анимации, призванные олицетворять палитру эмоций героини. Деревянность проявляется непосредственно в \"мертвых\" глазах персонажей, но, к счастью, с другими персонажами вблизи мы контактируем не так часто, а в Элизабет отсутствие эмоций на лице за всю игру довольно редкое явление (но, к сожалению, в глаза это неизбежно кидается).\nНу и главное, самая сильная сторона игры - [b]сюжет[/b]. Он здесь интересен, очень интригующий и не менее запутанный. Играя в игру, нужно понять одну вещь: вам расскажут интересную историю, но по полочкам разложить ее придется вам самим, додумав и связав все ниточки воедино. Но, благо, все эти ниточки в игре есть, нужно лишь проявить внимание (что, в принципе, не проблема для игроков, в первую очередь ценящих сюжеты, а не геймплей). В игре сюжетных поворотов, наверное, больше, чем во всех играх последних лет вместе взятых. Да что там, последние полчаса-час вас просто засыплют ими, не давая челюсти успевать подыматься. И все эти повороты качественные и непредсказуемые, что делает эту историю еще более качественной и интересной. Нет, конечно, нельзя сказать, что сюжетное построение абсолютно уникально - некоторые идеи были взяты из других игр (игравшие в серию Half-Life сразу увидят, что при создании Роберта и Розалинды Лютес творцы вдохновились G-man'ом из \"Полураспада\", правда, здесь они ушли в комичность образа брата и сестры, хотя основную фишку образа мистических \"серых кардиналов\"они сохранили.\n\n[b]Плюсы[/b]:\n- интересный сюжет; великолепный дизайн; качественно прописанные образы персонажей.\n[b]Минусы[/b]: геймплей, который способен довольно быстро приесться; деревянные лица, временами вызывающие даже отвращение.\n\n[b]Вердикт[/b]: если вам важен исключительно игровой процесс, то я бы не взялся рекомендовать игру, так как геймплейно это далеко не лучший представитель жанра, способный вскоре приесться. Но если вы любитель интересных рассказов и историй, то пропустить Bioshock Infinite - преступление, ведь это один из лучших сюжетов не только в играх (если и вовсе не лучший), но и среди кинематографа и литературы.","timestamp_created":1589203672,"timestamp_updated":1589204745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68951017","author":{"steamid":"76561197982962419","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1561,"last_played":1590501974},"language":"english","review":"Must play, love it","timestamp_created":1589196180,"timestamp_updated":1589196180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68950286","author":{"steamid":"76561198852150550","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2756,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2756,"last_played":1589145344},"language":"english","review":"Great and deep story that will make you always think about it ..

Solid gunplay, entertaining magic, a decent plot, cute graphics, wonderful setting, etc. etc. I recommend a playthrough of it if you're in need of a solidly put together FPS game.\n\nHowever, I would like to take umbrage for the hype that BioShock Infinite received for its much lauded plotline. Maybe I just went in with high expectations, but I heard time and again that the ending was confusing and mind-blowing and some kind of theatrical triumph of storytelling and twist endings.\n\nWhile playing, I felt pretty comfortable with my understanding of the plotline. I kept waiting for completely weird and jarring things to happen that would really throw me for a loop, but nothing ever arrived. I reached the end, watched the finishing cinematics and sat back to think. Full disclosure, I'd enjoyed it and it was good ending, yet it had seemed very straightforward so I assumed I MUST have missed something. There must've been some super obscure message I'd missed or not appreciated - after all this was the game that was hyped and hyped for its superb confusing ending - so I took to the internet to look up a plot explanation.\n\nIt was exactly what I'd thought had happened.\n\nLike, really? This is what passes for \"confusing\" and \"difficult to understand\" endings? I'm no genius but I knew exactly what had happened the whole way through, ending and all. Don't get me wrong, it's a good ending, but highfalutin it ain't.\n\nSo, I recommend BioShock Infinite because it's a solidly put together game, but if you're playing because you've heard tell of its befuddling and complex ending then maybe tone down those expectations a touch.","timestamp_created":1589066906,"timestamp_updated":1590450800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68868881","author":{"steamid":"76561198859783058","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1589506878},"language":"english","review":"It's a gerd un!","timestamp_created":1589059707,"timestamp_updated":1589059707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68863299","author":{"steamid":"76561198380359269","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":632,"last_played":1498907386},"language":"turkish","review":"çok iyi çook","timestamp_created":1589051925,"timestamp_updated":1589051925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68863032","author":{"steamid":"76561198807925195","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":995,"last_played":1615598558},"language":"english","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1589051535,"timestamp_updated":1589051535,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68862880","author":{"steamid":"76561198004999250","num_games_owned":357,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":493,"last_played":1589051296},"language":"english","review":"A terrible port of a terrible game.","timestamp_created":1589051332,"timestamp_updated":1589051332,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479942679405212402","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68859477","author":{"steamid":"76561198206863380","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1205,"last_played":1588991746},"language":"schinese","review":"生化奇兵无限完美的诠释了游戏是第九艺术+1\n我个人是一个不是很关注游戏时代背景和思想背景的纯路人观光玩家\n想告诉大家这游戏即使是过一遍流程看美术也绝对值得（虽然之后我花了好几个小时去梳理了一下剧情）如果愿意深入了解一下剧情的话会有更上一层的游戏体验\n\n顺便不用担心游戏的难度，即使是平时不怎么玩fps的人也可以很轻松的通关\n","timestamp_created":1589046824,"timestamp_updated":1589046824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68856995","author":{"steamid":"76561198340536574","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1249,"last_played":1645089609},"language":"english","review":"10/10\nBest game forever.","timestamp_created":1589043650,"timestamp_updated":1655823093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68856258","author":{"steamid":"76561198101614847","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":921,"last_played":1589041460},"language":"english","review":"Best Bioshock game!

It is adding at least 5-6 hours and makes a lot of things clear.\n\nThe replayability is pretty low if you are not looking to try harder difficulties, so maybe this is a reason to wait for a discount for this game and the others.\n\nIn the end, I strongly recommend it alongside it's amazing DLC's.\n\n","timestamp_created":1589028515,"timestamp_updated":1589028515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68844403","author":{"steamid":"76561198145516235","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1589052012},"language":"english","review":"10/10 Great Storytelling","timestamp_created":1589028081,"timestamp_updated":1589028081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68843039","author":{"steamid":"76561198087804879","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":825,"last_played":1588344690},"language":"polish","review":"OCENA 8.5/10\nŚwietna zagmatwana, zakręcona opowieść i dobry gameplay.

This storyline totally fucks your brain. Alright, I'll try so organize myself.\n1) Atmosphere\nInstead of dark and sometimes terrible areas of underwater Rapture we have light sky city - Columbia. It's really amazing, when you see all these buildings and characters. But you will get some terrifying experience when game comes to end.\n2) Gameplay\nThere are some arguable decisions: you can only carry 2 weapons, and that's not what you want to get from FPS game. But tbh, you have rather big weapon choice for almost every playstyle. Plasmids are good though, as in previous games.\n3) Characters\nElizabeth....she's charming. After this review I will look for rule 34 (you know, what I mean, huh?)\nWhat? Other characters? C'mon, there is Elizabeth and \"no one gives a damn about you\" characters.\nAAAAAND\n4) Storyline.\nThe last part of Bioshock....or the first? Almost every work of art that deals with parallel universes is great (there are some exeptions though, nvm)\nAnd this story is amazing. This story touches your heart, this story challenges your brains, this story makes you read some additional materials and fan theories. Aren't that all parts of perfect storyline?\n10/10 despite some arguable gameplay decisions.\nP.S. I know that I haven't said anything about graphics and some other game parts - but who cares? Graphics are great, other things - great.
