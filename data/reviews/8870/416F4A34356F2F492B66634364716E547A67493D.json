You can't even call it flavor, but it's definitely not nothing. That's the thing about La Croix - it's more the MEMORY of a taste than the taste itself. Much like the memory of me, d3f3cat1ng my pants as I cross a bridge over the Charles River in Boston. I've disconnected from that portion of my past enough to avoid retrospective embarrassment, but I can never truly escape a slight hint of unbearable cringiness when I am reminded of it. Never present, but never absent. Not unlike some fathers.

Ama yine de tatmin olmadım diyemeyeceğim çünkü Burial at Sea dlc'lerinde kısmen ilk oyunu iyi anlatmışlar.\nElizabeth ise çok güzel olmuş. Bazı oyunlardaki ergen ve hep başını beladan kurtarmak zorunda kaldığımız yardımcılardan değil.\nAyrıca Burial at Sea 2'de duygulandıran yerler de var özellikle sonu.\nMesela ''Would You Kindly'' sözünün nereden geldiğini öğreniyoruz.\n\n!!!BURADA SPOILER VAR!!!\n[spoiler]Burial at Sea 2'de Elizabeth öldükten sonra Atlas p*çine ağır küfürler ettim ve çok üzüldüm. Gerçekten kendini sevdiren bir karakterdi.[/spoiler]\n(BU ARADA ATLAS TAM BİR OR*SPU ÇOCUĞUDUR)\nAma oyunun ana senaryoyu anlatması kıt.\nKötü karakter iyi olmamış.\n\n[h1]GRAFİKLER VE ATMOSFER[/h1]\nGrafikler muazzam.\n8 yıl önce çıkan bir oyun ama şuan açtığımda hala muazzam görünüyor, özellikle o manzaralar harikaydı.\nOnun dışında Burial at Sea Bölüm 2'nin başı Paris'te geçiyordu çok kısa bir bölüm olsa da içimde bir mutluluk doldu. Aynı olay Columbia'da da olmuştu.\nGerçekten geliştirici ekip muazzam bir iş çıkarmış, Rapture'de geçen bir oyun daha olsaydı oynamak istemezdim bunalmıştım çünkü karanlık atmosferden. Dlcler de Rapture'da geçiyor büyük çoğunluğu ama ana oyunda cıvıl cıvıl ortamda oynadıktan sonra oynayınca fena olmadı.\nOyun bittikten sonra sırf atmosfer için keşke daha uzun olsaydı dedim.\n\n[h1]OYNANIŞ[/h1]\nİlk iki BioShock oyununa göre daha akıcı bir oynanış var.\n2. oyunda olduğu gibi bir elde silah diğer elde plazmid var gerçi bu oyunda isimler vigor ama aynı işlevdeler.\nİlk oyunda ingiliz anahtarı, 2. oyunda Big Daddy matkabı ve burda da Sky-Hook isimli yakın dövüş silahı var.\nBenim en sevdiğim bu oyundaki oldu. Hem seyahat için de kullanıyoruz. Ayrıca finisher animasyonları da eklenmiş artık kafa kopartabiliyoruz. Ama sadece kafa.\nVuruş hissi çok iyi olmuş, düşmana nereden vurursak oradan tepki veriyor.\nSilah tipleri ilk iki oyunla aynı sadece görüntüleri farklı ama bu oyunda iki tip silah taşıyabiliyoruz.\nAma en azından vigorlar için yuva açmamıza gerek yok, bulduğunuz gibi kullanabiliyorsunuz.\nİlk iki oyunda olduğu gibi bu oyunda silah ve vigorları geliştirebiliyoruz ama buradaki silah geliştirme stantları tek kullanımlık değil. Üstünüzde para varsa geliştirebilirsiniz ve artık 4 defa geliştirebiliyorlar.\nAma artık geliştirme yaptıkça görüntü olarak bir şey değişmiyor, aynı kalıyor keşke gelişseydi.\nBu oyundaki vigorlar diğer oyunlara göre bence daha eğlenceli en sevdiğim düşmanları havaya uçurduğumuz vigor oldu.\nYapay zekaya gelirsek çok iyi bir yapay zeka yok hatta bazen mala bağlayabiliyorlar.\nElizabeth'in oynanışa katkısı ise bence gayet iyi olmuş.\nSize bazen para getiriyor veya bir yeri ararken kaçırdığınız şeyleri söylüyor, savaş sırasında can, mana ve mühimmat getiriyor ve korumamız gerekmiyor. Ayrıca savaş sırasında yarıklar açarak size yardımcı olabilecek şeyler getiriyor.\nAncak sevmediğim kısmı oyun üstünüze durmadan düşman gönderiyor keşke arada bulmacalar falan da olsaydı. Ve bulmaca koymak için oyunun yapısı gerçekten çok müsait Elizabeth'in yarıklar açması, Sky-Hook, vigorlar falan derken gerçekten çok ilginç ve yaratıcı bulmacalar olabilirdi.\n\n[h1]SES VE SESLENDİRME[/h1]\nOyundaki sesler çok iyi sıkıntı çıkarmadı, müzikleri de iyi.\nSeslendirme kısmında ise artık ana karakterimizin bir sesi var ve seslendirmen olarak Troy Baker yine çok iyi iş çıkarmış.\n\n[h1]BUG VE OYUN HATALARI[/h1]\nOyunu oynarken hiçbir hata ile karşılaşmadım ama oyunu ilk yüklediğimde bilgisayarımda çalışmadı.\nOyunu başlattım ve hiçbir şey olmadı.\nMecburen bilgisayarı sıfırladım ve düzeldi.\nNeredeyse 800GB'lık oyun-dosya-müzik gitti ama pişman değilim iyiki de yapmışım.\n\n[h1]SONUÇ[/h1]\nSonuç olarak çok memnun kaldığım bir oyun oldu, sırf dünyası için açıp tekrar tekrar oynarım.\n\n[h1]MADALYAM[/h1]\nELMAS","timestamp_created":1614817037,"timestamp_updated":1627920866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87808962","author":{"steamid":"76561198370230056","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":592,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":577,"last_played":1618348485},"language":"english","review":"Very good story.

I think maybe they wanted to make her character appear childish but still its not a good reason because its not consistent at all. i dont know what to say about booker because he is not either interesting or a good character overall. my favorite characters are probably the Lutece twins and Cornelius Slate.\nVigors in this game are cool but dont make sense, the plasmids in bioshock where actually something that people could use (expect for some of them) and they didn't seem just to be made for combat , but vigors are just that. It seems that vigors are just made for being used in combat so i dont know why normal people should have access to them.not a big problem but seems disconnected form the rest of the bioshock games. and tbh some vigors are actual garbage and only 2 of them felt really useful. you can only carry 2 weapons at once which is really frustrating because the amount of ammunition you can actually carry for them. it is also a problem in an endgame fight with lady comstock ghost which is the worst enemy in the whole game . these series of minibosses that you have to fight 3 times are so fucking retarded and i think its the worst game design in the whole game. lady comstock ghost has shit ton of hp and has infinite enemy spawning, so you have to waste the little ammunition you have for each weapon on both the infinite enemies spawning and the ghost herself. \nand at last the most disappointing part of the game was the final boss, which sometimes felt unfair, but thats not even my problem. there is no way anyone who played the game didn't think songbird is gonna be a fight somewhere in the game, but no , instead they make songbird your ally to destroy airships and stop enemies from destroying an object , this could've been handled way better, for example maybe making songbird part of the gameplay instead of just pressing a button and sending songbird to destroy everything. it could've been 10 times better if it was actually a fight with songbird not rather than \"protect objective and wait for ability cooldown to finish\". and after this long fight we have the ending, this ending was really goofy and stupid. it felt really forced just to connect with the other bioshock games. and the game actually sometimes count magic as Quantum physics. There is a scene with elizabeth trying to open the lighthouse door and they a key magically appears in her hands,[Booker: What is that? Elizabeth: It's a key. Booker: Where did it come from? Elizabeth: It's always been there, I just...I just couldn't see it.]. this part was just moronic and could've been handled way better than this harry potter shit.  elizabeth seems like immune to everything ,she is just there to sometimes maybe give you health or ammo,  thats it. there is no need to be worried if she is taking damage or being in danger overall because she is like a ghost, which was really dumb because the purpose of character in the fights seemed really useless. you can tell her to lockpick which i dont know why is not like a minigame or something like in the other bioshocks.and one last thing, this game was too linear. don't get me wrong, the other bioshock games were linear to depending on how you play it, but there was sub areas you could explore to get more loot and upgrades and you could encounter cool things and pick some new audio logs to learn more about the lore and the story of rapture, but exploring seemed pretty non existent in this game.\n\n[h1] the best part [/h1]\n\nVISUALS.   i can't describe how beautiful this game is. 80% of this game looks like a piece of painting or a photograph, it is so well designed and the lighting just makes it 10 times better. the best examples are the hall of heroes which was the best part of the game, the opening to the columbia, and entering the city for the first time. The soundtrack is amazing just like the other bioshock games, the spawning resources and turrets or things like that made the combat more interesting and was not just a boring shoot them and go to the next fight. every fight had a unique thing that you could spawn and take advantage of. they are not too overpowered and not to weak.but i really hoped that maybe they had consequences which i think it was going to be a part of the game but was removed like a lot of things.choosing vigors has become much easier and less chaotic unlike the other games which you would slam your keyboard to finally equip the right plasmid. the passive upgrades where decent but not as good as the tonics in the other bioshocks, still not a bad thing.\n\n\n[h1] DLC [/h1]\n\nThere are two dlc for this game. Burial at the sea part 1 and part 2. part 1 is absolutely the worst bioshock content i have ever played. The comeback to rapture was really good and tbh i always wanted to see rapture before everything getting. but that was the one of the good parts about this dlc. also the stores and market inside of rapture felt extremley empty and was unrealistic. the elizabeth we are introduced too is just a shitty version of the original elizabeth and just like the original elizabeth seems useless in combat. Fortunately the elements of exploring has returned in the dlc and splicers are back! which are again good enemies just like in the previous games, there are new tears to use in combat too which where good, we can have more than 2 weapons which should've been in the main game too, but this time , the ammunition is just ridiculously limited and bullshit. vigors from the main game are in this game too but they are just called plasmid which was retarded and i dont know why they did use the vigors from infinite , call them plasmids , its like the developers completely forgot that how plasmids were in the other games. the salt model is reused for eve which is again just retarded. the big daddy fight was cool at the end but because of the lack of ammunition as i mentioned, i had to finish this guy with melee attacks at the end. and about the ending, elizabeth kills you then you find out that you were the last comstock for some reason and then it just destroys the point of the infinite ending.\nbut  then we have part 2 which actually introduced a new gameplay and new weapons , and the ending was more interesting and some parts where really intense story wise. this dlc also adds some explanation for some things that remained unsolved in the previous games. part 1 5/10 part 2 8/10","timestamp_created":1614803856,"timestamp_updated":1614803856,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.434782594442367554","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87800823","author":{"steamid":"76561198314526337","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":367,"last_played":1590017103},"language":"english","review":"The original Bioshock was an excellent shooter. Set in the dark underwater city of Rapture, it was also a journey far into unknown waters, a place where psychopaths ruled, little girls were in focus and huge men in diving suits ravaged freely. Behind it all stood one visionary who more than anything else would do the impossible. As a result, Rapture was a completely unique place, and Bioshock was also a completely unique game.\n\nWith Bioshock Infinite, the transition from a dystopian underwater city to a utopia in the clouds is a fact, and in the same way as almost six years ago, it is with equal parts joy, shock and awe that I have put everyday life aside and completely lived in a fantastic universe.\nWelcome to Columbia\n\nWe take on the role of Booker DeWitt, a war veteran who has a debt to pay, and thus finds himself forced to shoot to heaven to make up for it. The mission is really quite simple: We're going to get a special girl from the celestial city of Columbia, and then we'll get back to New York fast as shit.\nNo pressure...\nNo pressure...\n\nIt all begins when you arrive at a lighthouse on the coast of the US state of Maine in 1912. A short flight later and before we know it, we are in Columbia, a city located high in the clouds. How Columbia came to be and how the city manages to stay in the air at all, we will never fully understand, but this is not important either. The city is a utopia, a society where the sun always shines, the streets never get dirty, and the people smile and laugh day in and day out.\n\nThis is a vibrant, dynamic place, and wherever you go, there are people talking to each other about current topics, selling items at a bargain price or just enjoying a day in the sun. It's hard not to be impressed by the sheer amount of things to explore, and the fact that it's all presented so dynamically, effortlessly and genuinely is just even more impressive. There is also nothing that feels superfluous or out of place in this universe: A couple gossiping over a cup of coffee lets you learn more about the rebels lurking in secret, marble statues placed along the street show different people important to the story later in the game, and huge posters proclaim the good news of the Prophet.\nWho cares about the police?\nWho cares about the police?\n\nThere is, of course, a head of power in place, and the city lives and breathes for the Prophet, a man who pretends to see the future, and thus has come to terms with the people. It is in his custody that we find the girl we are going to take to New York, a mission that immediately turns out to be far more complicated than first thought.\n\nColumbia is not as perfect a society as it seems, and when Booker is branded a false shepherd, plague and general evil, the city, the prophet and the people show their true intentions.\nNatural learning\n\nWhat awaits are exchanges of fire with the police and special forces who seem obsessed with taking me by surprise, all in the name of the Prophet. It is becoming increasingly difficult for enemies to crack, but at the same time Booker is growing stronger as a game character in step with me as a player, so that the degree of difficulty always stays in the perfect middle layer.\n\nThe game does an exceptionally good job of gradually guiding you through the increasingly rougher combat mechanics. You go from a simple and carefree round of sniping at the local amusement park at the very beginning of the game, to neck kicks when things go to the dogs, and all the way to shotguns and rockets as you meet deadly robots and worse.\n\nColumbia's so-called \"skylines\" work in the same way: When you for the very first time try to throw yourself down one of the many metal pipes that carry you across the city, it is never so little confusing, but this is a function you learn to control surprisingly fast. It did not take long before I began to look at the lines as more than just transport options, but in fact also as invaluable aids in the toughest bridal oils.\nA crow in hand?\nA crow in hand?\n\nThen you are introduced to the game's little twist, namely \"vigors\". These are basically strength drinks that give you extreme powers, such as the ability to send a flock of crows towards an enemy or to shoot electricity out of your hands. They play exactly the same role as \"plasmids\" did in the two original Bioshock games, but there are not quite as many here. This is far from a bad thing, because it quickly became chaotic and confusing with so many different forces in the previous games.\n\nInfinite gives you access to a total of eight pieces that can be pulled out on the rap with the various numbers on the keyboard. It's a bit messy at first, but after a while you throw exploding fireballs and angry tentacles at each other, while you shoot and ask Elizabeth, the girl we were to take to New York, for help.\nReady for battle\n\nYou find Elizabeth early in the game, and she has some very special powers that can be set in motion at the touch of a button. By opening doors to other dimensions, she can summon various aids in battle. Do you have dangerously poor health? Ask her to pick up a box of first aid kits that you throw on the go. Could you need coverage? Just ask nicely if she could not call on a bunch of boxes that you can throw yourself behind.\nYou can throw yourself from one of the city's many \"skylines\" to kill weaker enemies instantly.\nYou can throw yourself from one of the city's many \"skylines\" to kill weaker enemies instantly.\n\nThis is a surprisingly well-functioning system, and often Elizabeth can be the difference between death and life. She also gives you resources in the middle of the heat of battle, such as ammunition and refills for your various \"vigor\" forces.\n\nThis is a good example of artificial intelligence done right. She rarely runs in the road, helps you when needed and it never feels like you have to babysit. The fact that she can not get hurt in battle is a bit strange as she actually ends up in the firing line from time to time, but the developers have made it work in a convincing way as well.\n\nIn this way you roam through the streets, nooks and crannies of Columbia, with weapons in one hand, \"vigors\" in the other and Elizabeth pawing next to, behind or in front of you. It's a wonderful feeling, and as a result you throw yourself playfully and with both legs first into all the matches, matches that are equally dynamic, fluid and lavishly spectacular. It can get a little chaotic at times, with so many different types of enemies, explosions everywhere and constantly new bullies with enemies that are let in via airships, but it gets never boring.\nGame magic\n\nThe same can be said for the game's story. The game lasts for just over ten hours, and during that time it is rarely a quiet moment. The road you take through Columbia is strongly marked by the fact that the developers will lead you down one particular path, but you will never be held back or guided in any way. It is linear, but in a good way, and you always have the freedom to explore areas in the city to look for hidden diaries, secrets and upgrades that you want.\nElizabeth is a powerful figure.\nElizabeth is a powerful figure.\n\nIt's a joy to find these things, but where the first Bioshock games were almost dependent on various radio recordings and conversations in the absence of real people to interact with, one now has Elizabeth, and all these things become more voluntary activities.\n\nElizabeth is Booker's partner throughout most of the adventure, and the relationship between the two develops in very exciting ways before everything is said and done. The credit for this goes first and foremost to screenwriters who have done a solid job of building lively dialogues and an exciting course of action, but at the same time also to Troy Baker and Courtnee Raper, as Booker and Elizabeth respectively.\n\nThe acting performance is particularly good from everyone involved, but it is especially Elizabeth, with her","timestamp_created":1614803514,"timestamp_updated":1614803514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487612605094909668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87800202","author":{"steamid":"76561198169118944","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1378,"last_played":1614802561},"language":"russian","review":"Pizdec...","timestamp_created":1614802591,"timestamp_updated":1614802591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87798064","author":{"steamid":"76561198068225164","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":973,"last_played":1614807403},"language":"russian","review":"Классика. \n\nТут есть в меру сложные шутерные элементы, весьма мозголомный, но очень и очень интересный сюжет, великолепная работа дизайнеров и неплохие дополнения.\n\nРекомендую к покупке, а уж если по скидке - то вообще брать, не думая.","timestamp_created":1614799572,"timestamp_updated":1614799572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87796030","author":{"steamid":"76561198034760508","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":910,"last_played":1650473466},"language":"english","review":"I'm happy to note after the crash fest that was Bioshock 1 and the lesser crash fest that was Bioshock 2, Bioshock Infinite was, almost, flawless...

went back and forth a lot on this one.  The shooting is a lot better than its predecessors, but you can only carry 2 guns at a time.  You get all of the magic automatically, but I found it even less useful than before.  The game is even more linear then BioShock 2, because there is next to no exploration for 90% of the game.  The setting of a city in the sky was a great idea, but it turned out to be a lot less visually interesting than I'd thought it would be.  1912 is also an interesting setting, but you didn't get as immersed in the culture as you might've been, especially with the main characters talking just like people from 2012, instead.\n\nThe story starts off pretty rough, too; you're not in Columbia (the sky city; not South America) long before you realize what's going on.  The racism going on is so blatant that it actually goes does more harm than good toward the anti-racist movement of today; when you paint racism as the over-the-top caricature of white hoods goose-stepping while clubbing minorities and spewing slurs, it makes today's more subtle racism seem like not such a big deal.  \"Oh boy,\" I thought, \"this is even less subtle than the first game's message.  Well, at least I know what it is that's been bothering me about BioShock's writing for the last few games.\"  From there, you have a \"twist\" that's very poorly explored, the characters reach a conclusion before you do without any real evidence, and it's \"proven\" by actions so out-of-character they might as well have been ripped from Legend of Kyrandia 3.  Uhh... kids, ask your parents.  The writing is worse than ever, and my cynicism has built an entire labyrinth of walls between myself and immersion, and lit them on fire.\n\nAnd then, the story goes all WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT, and all of a sudden, I'm interested again.  It wasn't exactly deep, but it was [b]weird[/b], and I was SO invested in what was going on.  It brushed it off like nothing, and we were back to boring again.  AND THEN, IT CAME BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!  I was prepared to write this off as another pedantic installment that elicited a number of unearned gasps, and the ending still blew me away.  Plot twists are so often a lazy writing device used to attempt to inject some intrigue into a story that's nothing special to begin with, but Bioshock Infinite understands the one thing that really matters: it [i]does something[/i] with it.  It isn't perfect, and I hate to be [i]that[/i] person, but stay with it until the very end; you'll likely find a worthwhile payoff for it all.","timestamp_created":1614752889,"timestamp_updated":1614752889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526749014854431152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87764582","author":{"steamid":"76561198247425338","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":802,"last_played":1614693996},"language":"english","review":"This is one of the best games I ever played.

Non-linear maps, exploration, hacking, resource management, alternate ammo types and a lot more that I could list: all gone. Infinite is a game made by a marketing team, someone who only saw 5 minutes of gameplay of Bioshock 1 and figured the entire series can be boiled down to three things: shooting, superpowers and cool looking cities. And it does get these things right, somewhat. The gunplay feels like a Borderlands game, most of the vigors look cool but are ultimately pointless, and Columbia isn't as open as you'd expect a floating city in the sky to be. This game is so far removed from the previous two entries it really doesn't make sense to call it a Bioshock game, there is no coherence here. If this were an original title, or even a spinoff it could pass, but to follow up Bioshock 2 with this? Genuinely insulting.\nDumbed down gameplay, pretty looking artstyle and a story that's so far up its own a** it makes Andrew Ryan seem as modest as a nun. This is early 2010s console gaming at its finest, and a truly sad end to an otherwise fantastic series. Bioshock Infinite is not a good game.","timestamp_created":1614744277,"timestamp_updated":1614744277,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87758700","author":{"steamid":"76561198339267460","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":600,"last_played":1658450574},"language":"english","review":"mind blown\n","timestamp_created":1614737802,"timestamp_updated":1614737802,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87758637","author":{"steamid":"76561198027539350","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":347,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1625973517},"language":"english","review":"Wait a minute.
