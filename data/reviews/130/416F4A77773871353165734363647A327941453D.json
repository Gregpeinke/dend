No new concepts, weapons, aliens, or really anything. It feels like a small addition to Half Life that really doesn't bring anything new to the table. Its also considerably shorter than Half Life or Opposing Force. To hardcore Half Life fans, not much lore wise is even brought up other than stuff you would've assumed. The $.99 price tag isn't that bad, but you get more out of OF. But the expansion it self isn't bad. Same fun arcadey shooter with a unique world. \n\n\n\nValve please add a mixed recommendation","timestamp_created":1562495583,"timestamp_updated":1562495583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53876368","author":{"steamid":"76561198080433024","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":98,"last_played":1586813991},"language":"english","review":"I guess it could be a fun companion to the first game but it's been super glitchy and I can't play for more than 5 minutes before something stops working.\n\nEDIT: I'm not really sure what was different this time, but I was able to complete the game with minimal glitching. Every time a save loads from death I would be unstoppably discharging whichever weapon I had, but I found a workaround (selecting crowbar and then re-loading, for whatever reason, worked).
