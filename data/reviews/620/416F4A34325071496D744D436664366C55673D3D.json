Plot twists are practically sitting behind every corner, and you never know where the story is going to go next. It has amazing pacing, very memorable and lovable characters, and an overall great atmosphere.\n\nThe score adds a certain ambiance to the levels that completely enhanced the experience of the game. In fast-paced chase sections, the soft, futuristic music transforms into a high tempo chase theme matching the gameplay. The composers definitely stepped up the game in this department.\n\nWhere the game falls short, however, is the gameplay. Unlike the first game where it's just you, the portal gun, cubes and buttons, this game tried too hard with the gimmicks, whether it be the light walls, gels, or the gravity fields. Sure, some of the rooms had me stuck for a couple of minutes, but none of the new mechanics introduce puzzles truly challenging.\n\nBetween the memorable storyline / characeters, Co-op mode, and the workshop allowing the creation of your own  levels and testing others' levels, I would still highly recommend this game to just about anyone. 7.5/10","timestamp_created":1457045525,"timestamp_updated":1457045525,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21610148","author":{"steamid":"76561198257823536","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24,"last_played":1610149312},"language":"english","review":"Here we are again, it's always such a pleasure.","timestamp_created":1457041768,"timestamp_updated":1457041768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21608802","author":{"steamid":"76561198118108948","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":1028,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1517572320},"language":"russian","review":"Ну короч.\n400р. - нет. ~70р. - да\nБыстро прошли с другом всю сюжетку.\nМиссии не слодные как на мой взгляд (я не понимаю почему говорят что она сложнее ЕГЭ)\nНу побегать и поржать с другом можно\n6,1\\10","timestamp_created":1457036560,"timestamp_updated":1457036560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505470454692840576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21608453","author":{"steamid":"76561198093435391","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1575142807},"language":"english","review":"10/10 game.. almost more of a comedy than a puzzle","timestamp_created":1457035220,"timestamp_updated":1457035220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21607859","author":{"steamid":"76561198116876867","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":984,"last_played":1516825094},"language":"spanish","review":"Para mi este juego es mucho mejor que el primero, para empezar es más largo y tiene mas elementos que utilizar en las pruebas.

The original stands as one of the cleverest and most revered games ever made and so the pressure is on for the return visit to Aperture Laboratories.\n\nAs before, you play a human lab rat subjected to the experimental challenges dreamt up by the evil computer GLaDOS. The goal is to exit ever more puzzling rooms with the aid of a Portal Gun that lets you shoot up to two virtual doorways onto walls coated with a special substance. Once you've got two portals in place you can walk through one and come out of the other.\n\nInitially the challenges thrown at you are straightforward: zap one portal onto the wall next to you, put the other onto the wall next to the inaccessible exit and then simply walk through the portal. But after a few gentle introductory tests to familiarise you with the concept, Portal 2 starts presenting you with brain-aching challenge after brain-aching challenge.\n\nYou might need to open an exit by placing a block on a pressure pad, but the block is located on an inaccessible ledge high above you with no obvious route up. To reach it might involve using portals to reach a high walkway before firing a portal into the floor below and the other into the wall opposite the ledge with the block, so that when you jump down into the portal on the floor you are sent flying out of the other portal and onto the ledge with the block.\n\nAnd soon the complexity is cranked up with the addition of other elements to the puzzles such as tractor beams, gels that alter the properties of surfaces and bridges made out of light.\n\nLike many puzzle games the description often sounds more intimidating than the reality, but Portal 2's environmental conundrums are truly challenging: requiring lateral thinking and dissolving notions of up, down, left, right, forward and back. But while the challenges can be bewildering, the sense of achievement you get from solving a challenge that had you stumped is immense with confusion melting away into a thrilling Eureka! moment.\n\nPortal 2's fiendish puzzles would make a great game on their own, but the game doesn't compromise on setting either, moulding a captivating story out of its puzzling action. The script and voice acting is nothing short of fantastic: the acidic wit of superb*tch GLaDOS balanced by the bumbling Bristolian tones of Stephen Merchant, who plays an equally amusing rival AI.\n\nBeyond the single-player mode there's a set of co-operative two-player challenges that can be played in split screen or online. The two-player challenges are even tougher than the single player so the need to discuss with each other how to tackle each puzzle is paramount. While this means it works best when players are in the same room, Valve have done a sterling job of providing players with tools to indicate their ideas to other players so that the online mode works almost as well.\n\nThe only possible criticism you could level at the game is that once a room is solved, there's little reason to go back. But when a game delivers as many moments of joy and satisfaction as Portal 2, you'll need to be a rather sour soul to make such a charge.\n\nIngenious, engrossing puzzler and a worthy sequel to one of the greatest games ever!","timestamp_created":1456962037,"timestamp_updated":1456962176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":28,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.74089205265045166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21593256","author":{"steamid":"76561197960342636","num_games_owned":452,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1370,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":965,"last_played":1582238148},"language":"german","review":"super spiel mit noch besserem coop!","timestamp_created":1456961576,"timestamp_updated":1456961576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21590824","author":{"steamid":"76561198219730233","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":362,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1501727420},"language":"spanish","review":"muy buen juego muy recomendado","timestamp_created":1456951667,"timestamp_updated":1456951667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21589479","author":{"steamid":"76561198202911473","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":23144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6482,"last_played":1626194836},"language":"russian","review":"Одна из лучших игр!

There is no excuse as to why someone should not wish to play it, other than perhaps that they have not played the first game. It is witty, funny, story-rich, beautiful, atmospheric, with phenomenal art and amazing game mechanics. It is a puzzle game, however the main focus of the game isn't to challenge you so hard that the puzzles are near-impossible. While they somewhat increase in difficulty as the game progresses, the focus of the game continues to be the story it is telling. And the beautifully crafted dialogue along with the subtleties and easter eggs peppered along the game deliver a story that is both deep and not obvious. The theories and ideas that spring from what you find make you realise that the Portal story is a lot more than what you can scrape off of the surface of the game.\n\nThe game mechanics themselves work wonderfully - most first person shooters which lack a 'run' button would be infuriating and tedious, however the speed at which Chell moves and the context in which she is moving do not leave you annoyed at the lack of such a function. The simplicity of operating the gun is unmatched to the wonderful things you can do with it. The handling feels comfortable, and the sound design to go along with it makes the whole experience feel just right.\n\nThe soundtrack alone is enough to convince someone to want to play it. Sometimes electronic, sometimes glitchy, sometimes heavy with percussion, sometimes orchestral.. Whatever it is at the specific moment in the game, it sounds good. It sounds epic and immersive, and it gives you exactly what feelings you need to have to suit the part of the game you're playing.\n\nThe co-operative campaign is fun as well, and despite not being particularly 'story rich' (which, really, co-op doesn't need to be), the context of the co-op campaign is related to the single player story, which makes it feel relevant, as opposed to a random add-on just for the sake of it.

Single player tested only!\n\nAs a great fan of Portal 1 this game was a bit of a disapointment for me. The puzzles are no challenge if you are familiar with thinking in portals and all in all the level design is often spoiling the solution. Sometimes I solved rooms only by shooting a portal on the only spot the game let me without me even seeing the consequences beforehand. Thus the most difficult rooms were those where i thought \"Finally, this seems like the first difficult one\" with me ending up overthinking the dullest solution. During the finally the game even limits your camera movement pushing your face right into the solution of the only real puzzle of the whole boss fight.\nI was seeing forward to the steam workshop levels but this is ruined by the weak rating system as it is only possible to rate a level \"good\" or \"bad\" resulting in average levels having a maximum rating. I ended up downrating quite lovely levels only because they were a bit to easy.\n\nThe story and enviromental design feels a bit rushed and often does not make sense. Infact it often feels like a alternative version of the original Portal's story, no twist beeing really surprising. The strength of Portal 1 was its atmosphere delivered by a few objects and wallpaintings here and there which had nothing to do with the actual test chambers and had to be discovered by the player himself. In Portal 2 you do not feel near as isolated while the game constantly tries to make you feel that way.\n\nAll in all Portal 2 ends up spoiling it's own puzzles and poorly trying to mimic the esthetics of the original Portal.
