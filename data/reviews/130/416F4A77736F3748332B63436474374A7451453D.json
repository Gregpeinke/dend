Like where did Barney come from? Why is he and the rest of the main scientists in 2 working together? It tells an interesting take on the first Half-Life game (though I feel that some aspects didn't make sence.) and answers those previous questions. Definitely a game to look into. The quality wasn't a good as HL1 but the game play is all the same.\n\nThe only complain I have is that some of the puzzles weren't so obviouse, and you had to really look around in order to solve things. Sometimes I would get lost on a map and have no clue what to do next. Combined with some light backtracking and you have a set of some really confusing puzzles.\n\nAll-in-all it was fun, the pace was nice and it doesn't take all to long to complete. I recomend this to the fans of the series who would like a little bit more half-life. Serriously I'm playing this for the first time in 2019 and and it sort of takes away the sting that we may never have an end to the original story.","timestamp_created":1548632922,"timestamp_updated":1548632922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48577256","author":{"steamid":"76561198361011213","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":492,"last_played":1612279314},"language":"english","review":"Boi oh boi, this game.

Well...\nFirst of all, there is no new weapons, wich sucks, couldnt they come up with something creative? not even the meele weapon?\nSo, the game goes as a meh for me on the story, the final part was a... boring one. Replaybility? A little bit, after finding the chumtoad secret and playing the game on hard and finishing it in 2 days, I could say it has a little bit. One thing that sucks too is that you cant kill as much things as half life, some enemies dont appear and the scientists cant be killed (they \"fire\" you for that, wich makes sense, but what about Gordon?), oh right.\nThere is no final boss, welp, thats great. Tbh, the game its ok if you play first half life 1, this game and then Oppsing Force, trust me, you arent gonna regret it, the game does have nods and references to half life 1 and opposing force too, so that makes a reason to stay alert on things.

There are no new mechanics or weapons, the puzzles and gameplay are very similar to HL, but what I do like is the interaction between Barney and the other characters as you experience a little more of the HL story around the time of Gordon Freemans appearance at Black Mesa. \n\nIt is not as clean or as graphically impressive as today’s FPS, but remember it is just under 20 years old, was made as an expansion pack for the vintage FPS game changer HL and forms part of the original HL releases with some updated elements/patches to run on current OS.\n\nOverall it is worth picking this up in a sale for your collection and go back in time for a nostalgic trip down memory lane and how HL began. \n\nAlso worth checking out the walktrough:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233166473","timestamp_created":1547495156,"timestamp_updated":1547495667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48332471","author":{"steamid":"76561198799697454","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":162,"last_played":1558781693},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bom zerei 3 vezes","timestamp_created":1547490145,"timestamp_updated":1547490145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48321181","author":{"steamid":"76561198878766897","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":159,"playtime_forever":4706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1556542555},"language":"russian","review":"Проведено в игре время не жалко на такую игру! \nХорошая игра с приятной графикой.\nПростой и понятный геймплей.\nРекомендую всем.\n10/10","timestamp_created":1547441393,"timestamp_updated":1547441438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48317995","author":{"steamid":"76561197995246701","num_games_owned":1050,"num_reviews":654,"playtime_forever":149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1453939260},"language":"french","review":"Bien qu'étant l'addon le moins bien de Half-Life, il reste tout de même très bon et un classique à faire.","timestamp_created":1547425672,"timestamp_updated":1547425672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48312586","author":{"steamid":"76561198042663821","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":247,"last_played":1547405561},"language":"english","review":"The game is decent.

The game is also pretty short compared to Half-Life.\n\nI'd say it's worth a shot if you happen to have it (either already, or you got it in something like the Valve complete pack).

The game centres around the average everyday life of a mall cop/security guard and the challenges and grievances of such a mundane and taxing job and the toll it takes on the human psyche.  So naturally, Aliens invade and the protagonist racks up a human kill-count that rivals that of a Sylvester Stallone movie.  And since the protagonist is played by Arnold Schwartzenegger, Blue Shift can carry upwards of 10+ weapons of varying size and weight without the use of Power Armour or Military Training.\n\nHalf-Life: Blue Shift is a wonderful coming of age tale that combines elements of Commando, Falling Down, DOOM and Dora the Explorer to create this magnificent story-driven gem of a game, and for that I give it a big fat perfect score.

My expectations were pretty low knowing it is a half canon game which is made by another developer. I can not tell It was a very good game but i can say that, that it was way better than what i was expecting with some really cool level puzzle ideas which requires you to be aware of environment so it is not just an straightforward expansion. Making player being able to witness the effects of Black Mesa incident from another perspective, it has some very enjoyable moments. Knowing that Calhoun is a character in HL2 it also adds some side stories to the experience.\n\nThe game is short but as someone who played both Half-Life and Blue Shift in Hard Mode I must warn you: this game kicks ass of the original in terms of level difficulty: That cool ideas sometimes make you die on and on until you memorize what you gotta do. I don't reccomend to but this game seperately, there are better games to play for sure. But it is like a small extra future in Valve pack and I recommend you to play the game if you have it but if you hate headcrabs you shouldn't play this game.

Half Life Blue Shift was launched in 2001 two years later than Opposing Force, and to be honest it is quite dissapointing. First of all there is no new content, everything is recycled from previous games, the only new content he had in this game are a few new models for the scientists like Dr Rosenberg's or the HQ model pack which was later on implemented in both Opposing Force and Half Life, followed by Decay in the PS2 version. Blue Shift can be finished in 2 hours playing on hard mode, so its quite short, however some parts of the game are quite interesting and fun to play, like Xen or the last Chapter \"A Leap of Faith\". In general this DLC is quite mediocre, but it's still worth playing if you like the original Half Life and want to see the Black Mesa desaster from another point of view.\n\nFinal Score: 6","timestamp_created":1546216211,"timestamp_updated":1546216211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47953257","author":{"steamid":"76561198101839707","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":211,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":211,"last_played":1492172385},"language":"english","review":"Great expansion.
