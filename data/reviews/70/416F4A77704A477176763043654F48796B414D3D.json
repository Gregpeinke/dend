I bought the Valve Collection recently and playing this game again, its quite fun. There are quite a few differences but I want to state why this game feels so good to play.\n\nThe engine and the weapons play with each other really well. Just smacking head crabs with a crowbar feels fluid in some sort of way and running around shooting things is just plain fun.\n\nI've not really been a big fan of N64 era graphics and the first steps into 3D but the game has some weird charm to it that I can look through. When characters talk though you can tell the game is dated.\n\nThe story is ehh.. alright. Its exciting and more action packed than most games but it's completely lacking compared to the other games in the series. In my opinion.\n\nOverall, get it. Its still a fun game and there's so much replayability that you can see why its one of Valve's most prominent game series'.

I have a list of points on which I'd like to remark upon:\n\nGAMEPLAY\nHaving already played several Source games, and having no experience with non-Source FPS games, I was excited to see how Half-Life really worked... which is rather good, actually (with some notable exceptions)! I very much like how your character moves noticeably faster than in the Source games, and it definitely makes the game more fast-paced. This, I believe, is similar to older games such as those from the Doom or Quake series, which came out somewhere around the same time (and the games are obviously related, and it's nice to get a feel for how games of that era played). Generally speaking, Half-Life is also very pleasant to control.\n\nThe shooting worked mostly well, although sometimes it's hard to tell whether or not you're hitting an enemy. The Hivehand weapon was especially confusing to use. I was also surprised to see the physics (such as the gibs from smashed boxes), which I wasn't even aware was possible back in 1998.\n\nA significant problem was getting stuck on objects, and an even greater problem was the completely broken nature of pulling objects, done by pressing the USE key and moving backwards. This always sent the object careening away by what amounts to several metres to the left or right with teriffic speed, and I suspect that it's a bug.\n\nSOUND\nThe sound design, apart from the mostly very poor quality, adds to the gritty yet incidentally humorous and exaggerated atmosphere along with the flawless soundtrack, a great portion of which you will recognise from Half-Life 2. During my very first time playing I found myself walking continuously back and forth on the metal grates of the training course, then stopping and absorbing it along with the look of the map, as it turned to total silence... strangely amazing feeling.\n\nHearing complete and utter silence only interrupted by footsteps I also found quite fascinating, for some reason. This atmosphere of outdatedness and simplicity, even desolation, is something I can appreciate. With regards to the soundtrack, I especially enjoyed hearing \"Drums and Riffs\" during the rocket scene (I'm of course being vague to avoid spoiling it completely, but hey, this game is literally decades old), which had a particularly defiant and bold feel to it, so to say.\n\nOne genuine complaint one could make is the lack of consistency with the general sound quality, as well as the overuse of \"stingers\", the socalled short, suspenseful pieces of music meant to highlight the dark nature of a certain scene, also featured in Half-Life 2 (I believe I heard the same stinger at least 3 times). I also noticed that the music keeps going after you die or load a save file, which was quite awkward.\n\nSETTING\nBy far one of Half-Life's biggest strengths is its setting and atmosphere. With tons of intriguing and wildly different maps, Half-Life is full of variety. The Black Mesa Research Facility, with its incomprehensible size, gives off a feeling of openness, and not once did the world feel boxy, claustrophobic or awkward. It felt very natural, with virtually no invisible walls to speak of. I enjoy the setting being in a barren canyon-type environment, conveying the sense that you're somewhere important to be held secret. Getting to explore it further and journeying down the deadly cliffs was also fantastic. I think it's a great setting for a secret lab, and a game in general because of the lack of anything important aside from ourselves and the characters and action immediately before us.\nIt does hurt the setting that the quality of the skyboxes is so extremely low.\n\nThe main setting also contrasts very well with the chaotic and macabre Xen. Overall, I think the environments and the game itself is very memorable and unique in terms of design.\nThe setting in the final scene is also a great callback to the beginning, in several ways, and its bizarre nature adds up to a great ending.\n\nSTORY\nI appreciate the kind of story that poses questions and unsolved mysteries, and especially stories that don't need a backstory or long-winded introductory cutscene, but instead throws you right into it. Again, the datedness and simplicity of Half-Life works in favour of the game here. It's a very subtle way of introducting the player to the world of the game, and it's a recurring theme with a lot of Valve's games, especially the first Portal game, where it's done masterfully. In Half-Life, you get to piece the story together yourself without any metanarrative interruptions. It makes you feel like you're really there, in a way. Simplicity is the key here. Half-Life shows and basically never tells, which is what makes the universe of the game so captivating.\n\nHalf-Life can tell a story with a lot of mystique using very little, and the best example of this is the G-Man and his supposed associates. I would say that his puppetmaster-esque role and the power dynamic it poses is maybe the most interesting thing about the Half-Life universe. It also makes us ask even more questions about who your character, Gordon Freeman, actually is, considering his interactions with the G-Man.\n\nOVERALL\nAs someone who originally played Half-Life 2 about 8 years ago, I'm glad to have played Half-Life 1. I look forward to play the extra levels from Opposing Force and Blue Shift next, and I'm very happy to have gotten all of these on sale! Half-Life is very much worth experiencing in spite of its age and I completely understand why it has had such an impact. It's been a pleasure to experience such a big part of video game/software history and I strongly recommend it.","timestamp_created":1638569816,"timestamp_updated":1638569816,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105168357","author":{"steamid":"76561199045825123","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":542,"last_played":1638568922},"language":"russian","review":"Эту игру я прошёл уже 2 раза зная все фишки и секреты, но всё  равно мне игра не наскучила.

I did have a couple issues while playing through it though. The game crashed to desktop many times, as well as my character getting stuck into the environment.  I even had an issue where a boss encounter near the end of the game didn't work properly; i actually had to consult a walkthrough on how to bypass it because it was
