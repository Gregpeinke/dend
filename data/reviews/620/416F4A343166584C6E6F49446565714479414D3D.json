I am a single farther to my Son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories","timestamp_created":1658946242,"timestamp_updated":1658946242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51171875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119591400","author":{"steamid":"76561199243425282","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":120,"playtime_at_review":1318,"last_played":1660306777},"language":"polish","review":"Idealna

I remember liking the game quite a lot at the time that I was playing it, but for the life of me I couldn't pin down what exactly it was that made me like it so much. Of course there were the funny ramblings of Glados and Cave Johnson that I remember, and I remember how the game played, but it never occurred to me that this game was truly a special piece of media until I decided to replay it last year.\n\nI hadn't played played the original Portal before I played Portal 2, and did not play it until years afterward when I got the Orange Box (a criminally underpriced collection of Valve's greatest games, and Half-Life Source) which had the Portal games in it. I decided to revisit Portal 2 after playing through Portal for the first time, and, even on revisit, a more mature me finally understood more of the writing qualities of the game while simultaneously feeling like I was being welcomed home by the gameplay, while still having it offer up a challenge due to my years of absence, and while I liked Portal 2 the first time, replaying it felt magical. \n\nI wasn't too keen on the story of the Half-Life games (and those games are still really good, don't get me wrong), but the snappy writing of Portal 2, the environment to compliment it, and the themes that tie it all together combined to make not only a good story, but also a good way of telling it. The gameplay is surprisingly simple, with changes coming sparingly, yet the game still has a progressively challenging and fun cycle that tests the limits you have with your portal gun. It is a superb single player experience whether you are a casual or hardcore gamer, and whether you prefer gameplay or story. Wheatley, Glados, and Cave Johnson were all hysterical to listen to, yet endearing in their own ways.\n\nFurthermore, Portal 2 not only stands alone as a fantastic game, but also as a sequel that improves upon its series. It puts many story beats of the original Portal into a new context, turning what was a funny little puzzle game with a creepy twist into a riveting story that wraps itself up in a satisfying way. Unlike some of Valve's other titles, you don't really see an outcry for Portal 3, because Portal 2 sufficiently ends its story and caps it off with the most fire breakup song known to man, which is one of the best endings to a series that anyone could ask for.\n\nHowever, what truly makes Portal 2 a special game is in its versatility. This is a game that is easily recommendable to everyone, (unless you are allergic to puzzles or terrified of robots, I guess). \n\nIt's campaign provides fun on all fronts, and the singleplayer experience alone is worth the 10 dollars, even though the campaign only takes 5-7 hours to go through. However, its nature as a precision puzzle game with numerous quirks in the physics engine allows for a very fun speedrunning experience that's easy to learn, but hard to master.\n\nAll of this doesn't even begin to introduce the multiplayer aspects of Portal 2. You can choose to team up with a friend and tackle the co-op game mode, which itself holds hilarious writing and fun gameplay that requires coordination between you two that can improve your teamwork for other multiplayer games, or result in sabotage that leaves you both laughing by the end. Furthermore, you can flex your creative muscles by designing your own levels for others to enjoy, and enjoy the levels of others when the base game tires you out, by proxy.\n\nI tend not to recommend games based on my own personal enjoyment of them, but by how much they can be enjoyed by others, and the scope of who is likely to enjoy it. Some of my favorite games of all time are slow-burning, turn-based JRPGs, but oftentimes they can only really be recommended to a particular demographic. Portal 2 is one of the few games that, I feel, can be recommended to just about anyone. Whether they are picking up a controller for the first time or a seasoned veteran of a variety of genres, Whether they play games for laid-back fun or top notch competition, whether they enjoy a slow burning story or complex and fast-paced gameplay, or whether they wish to consume the work of others or showcase their own creations, Portal 2 is a game that can scratch any itch, all at an affordable price with content that can last as long as you need it to.\n\nI understand that another positive review on Portal 2 is just a drop in the bucket for a game that receives near-universal praise, but these were thoughts I just wanted to put into words for a game that I think warrants all of the praise it gets, and sometimes I think people need to step back and remember what makes games like Portal 2 so special.\n\nThis game is (at most) 10 dollars, you'd be foolish to even consider not buying it, if you somehow don't have it already.\n\ntl;dr: funny potato half-life spinoff belongs in everyone's library. get it now. 10/10","timestamp_created":1658895647,"timestamp_updated":1658902470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119555152","author":{"steamid":"76561198166235821","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":638,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":620,"last_played":1658932290},"language":"koreana","review":"리뷰를 남기지 않았었다니...과거의 나 반성해\n\n\n\n포탈은 그냥 명작입니다.\n\n아직도 플레이를 하지 않았다면 오래된 게임이라고 넘어가지 말고 당장 플레이 하러 떠나세요.\n스토리 보는 게임을 그리 선호하지 않는데 포탈 스토리엔 미쳐있었습니다.\n쉽게 풀리는 듯 하면서도 머리를 쓰게 만드는 플레이, 적으로 나오는 인공지능 글라도스의 매력적인 목소리,\n기계음의 목소리지만 때론 무섭고 때론 어이없는 대사들, 점차 흥미롭게 진행되는 스토리, 엔딩곡까지\n정말 뭐 하나 빠지지 않는 게임입니다.\n수 없이 많은 게임을 보고, 듣고, 플레이 해오면서 그 많은 게임들 다 제치고 포탈 시리즈는 가장 애정하는 게임입니다.\n포탈2를 마지막으로 넘버링 타이틀로 신작 소식은 오랜 기간 들려오지 않아서 너무 슬프지만\n언젠가 포탈 시리즈의 마지막 타이틀이라고 한 번만 더 나왔으면 좋겠다는 생각은 늘 가지고 있습니다.\n\n포탈은 1과 2, 둘 다 직접 플레이 하는 걸 적극 추천 드립니다.\n1편의 경우 워낙 오래됐다보니 그래픽이 많이 견디기 힘들 수 있지만 개인적으론 1편을 직접 플레이 하고 2편까지 하는게\n스토리의 진행과 플레이할 때 몰입도가 높아지기 때문에 훨씬 재밌습니다.\n\n모두 포탈 하세요\n두 번 하세요\n무조건 하세요","timestamp_created":1658895508,"timestamp_updated":1658895508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119554553","author":{"steamid":"76561198167075419","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1475,"last_played":1645380320},"language":"english","review":"every pc gamer should play","timestamp_created":1658894637,"timestamp_updated":1658894637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119553785","author":{"steamid":"76561198867789090","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":719,"last_played":1659196267},"language":"turkish","review":"Yine harika...
