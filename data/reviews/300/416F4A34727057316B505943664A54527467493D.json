É um jogo justo, tirando o macete que fazem na bazuca, pra recarregar/atirar mais rápido (não adianta disfarçar, nós sabemos espertinhos), mas vai muito da sua habilidade e estratégia.\n\n Realmente é muito fácil de morrer ai, alguns tiros e caixão, mas como o respawn é rápido (dependendo do modo de jogo, que alguns demoram mais), você tá em campo pra lutar rapidão. Ele é muito simples e fácil de aprender, e nem tão difícil para dominar. Escolha sua classe e lance-se na segunda guerra mundial entre os Aliados e o Eixo\n\n Os modos de jogo são muito divertidos também, tem:\n - Capture a bandeira, onde o exército que dominar todas vence / ou aquele que manter mais bandeiras por mais tempo vence por acúmulo de pontos;\n - Mata-mata, os dois exércitos surgem e vão pra guerra, ganha aquele que tiver mais vítimas quando o tempo acabar;\n - Defenda/ataque o tanque, onde dependendo do exército, vai ter um veículo em movimento que precisa chegar até a base inimiga, ganha o exército que cumprir seu objetivo, levar ou impedir o veículo de chegar na base até o final do tempo;\n - Defesa/ataque de acampamento, funciona como o capture a bandeira, mas um exército vai defender as bandeiras e o outro vai tentar dominar todas, também com contagem regressiva;\n (São os que eu lembro agora, provavelmente tem outros mas... esqueci hehe)\n\n Companheiro, esse jogo é legal, a comunidade ativa é bem amigável também, a maioria são jogadores antigos, que estão ai pra passar o tempo numa noite tranquila... e você pode fazer o mesmo, Day of Defeat: Source cumpre muito bem seu papel como passatempo. Divirta-se, chame amigos, brinque, morra, morra de novo, mate, morra, experimente classes e armas diferentes, seja morto repetidas vezes pela mesma pessoa e grite \"P. QUE PARIU!\" kkkkkk...\n\n Te desejo um bom jogo soldado! :)

These were very fun but included no multiplayer and the ones that did... well the servers are far from alive to say the least. So what if you want a WW2 shooter with graphics and sound effects reek of those simpler times, one where the multiplayer is alive and offers hours of fun. Well, look no further than Day Of Defeat.\n\nDay Of Defeat is a WW2 FPS Shooter with no story but a massive multiplayer scene which has plenty of servers for you to play on. On standard servers you either play as America or Germany and have to take control of 5 different points to win a game. Alternatively you can play a bomb mode in which your team and the enemy team has 2 bombsites in which you have to stop the enemy team from coming onto and planting said bomb. You can do this with a variety of classes which boast their own weaponry and skills meaning there's always something new to try if the previous wasn't working for you. If none of this sounds remotely interesting to you then why not try a modded server instead? DOD has many servers made by the community offering alternate game modes, classes and maps! \n\nThe graphics still hold up quite well in  my opinion but maybe that's because I'm a dork for this early 2000s/ late 90s graphic style that the game throws at you but it's not ugly to look at and buildings, guns character models and everything look great! In fact, it's quite aesthetically pleasing. Oh and a last note, the rag-doll physics in this game are absolutely hilarious. \n\nSounds in this game are phenomenal! Guns blazing left, right and centre, explosions as you charge up to capture a point, footsteps and even more are all just fantastic and a super high quality I cannot express how much I love these. \n\nBut with all that sad there are some cons. Some games contain a lot of BOTS, the recoil on these guns is absolutely insane and takes a long while to master, you have less health than somebody on life support it's like you have 1HP and on the majority of servers it's impossible to heal. \n\nTo conclude Day Of Defeat satisfies the WW2 style multiplayer shooter many of us crave but if that's not what you want/crave it's still a very good fps and I highly recommend it despite it's few drawbacks. \n\n9.2/10 ~ Neppy
