Set in an old and destroyed science facility, former test subject Chell must escape back to the surface, using her trusty Portal Gun.\n\nPortal 2 is beyond impressive, creating a player-narrative experience that never forgets to be a video game. It's filled to the brim with portal-centric tests, but with various new mechanics added to the mix, such as catapults, tractor beams, lasers, and a variety of paints you can use to change the physical structure of walls and floors. All of these new mechanics however always tie back into the portal gun, giving the game focus, and leaving it uncluttered feeling.\n\nThe writing is also spot-on in terms of brilliance. With delightful tangents and jabs, given out by your mechanical warden Glados. Alongside some charming improv by british comedian Steven Merchant, in his role as Wheatley. JK Simmons even makes an appearance as a billionare who's almost patriotic for science.\n\nWhen you finish the main campaign, there's also some other goodies left to have fun with. Most interesting is a co-operative campaign, with it's own seperate plot and gameplay structure. And a level editor allowing the player to try their hand at puzzle creating. And also an interactive teaser for JJ Abrams' Super 8, for some reason..\n\nThe point is, Portal 2 is a great game.
