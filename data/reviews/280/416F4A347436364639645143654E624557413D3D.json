Zum großartigen Klassiker, zum Genrekönig seiner Zeit, zum Meilenstein der Spielgeschichte?\n\nEigentlich nicht, und doch versuche ich es. \"Half-Life\" ist ein linearer, storygetriebener First-Person-Shooter. Wir sind Gordon Freeman, theoretischer Physiker und Mitarbeiter im Labor für anomale Materie des geheimen Forschungskomplexes Black Mesa. Ein Experiment läuft gehörig schief und ein Portal zu einer anderen Welt wird geöffnet. Die Wesen, die in unsere Welt eindringen sind andersartig und feindlich...\n\nAllein schon der Anfang ist unvergeßlich. Wir werden in einer Art Schwebebahn durch die riesige Forschungsanlage gefahren. Wir schauen uns um, sehen riesige Gänge, andere Mitarbeiter, Sicherheitspersonal, arbeitende Lastenroboter, einen merkwürdigen Mann im dunklen Anzug mit Aktenkoffer. Durchsagen geleiten unseren Weg. Ein Vorratscontainer verliert radioaktive Flüssigkeit. Die Welt um uns lebt, auch ohne uns. Sie ist wahr. Diese etwa fünfminütige Sequenz gehört zu den großen Passagen der Spielegeschichte.\n\nDie Welt, die \"Half-Life\" (zu deutsch: Halbwertszeit) erschafft ist erstaunlich real, die dadurch erzeugte Atmosphäre herausragend. Und das auch heute noch, auch wenn die Grafik nun klobig und verwaschen wirkt, auch wenn die Sprachausgabe quäkt und die Sprecher manchmal schwach sind. Und dabei vergißt \"Half-Life\" auch nicht die Ironie, den weisen Blick auf sich selbst, die Reflektion über das eigene Produkt. Soviel Souveränität ist selten.\n\nNeben diesem Wesentlichen funktioniert (fast) alles perfekt. Die Bedienbarkeit ist extrem gut und flüssig, die Waffenauswahl vielseitig, insbesondere die faszinierend designeten Alienwaffen überraschen und das Brecheisen ist schlichtweg legendär. Auch Rätsel- und Jumppassagen sind richtig gut gebaut. \n\nÜberhaupt das Leveldesign. Derart viel Abwechslung vermißt man heute fast in allen AAA-Titeln. Die Stupidität der meisten heutigen Main-Stream-Shooter sind ein deutlicher Rückschritt im Vergleich zu \"Half-Life\". \n\nGibt es auch Negatives? Kaum. Lediglich die letzten Passagen, die Alienwelt, wird, trotzdem das Design klasse ist, gameplaytechnisch merkwürdig und teils auch nervig. \n\nDie Grafik war 1998 herausragend, die Musik grandios atmosphärisch. Auch der Umfang überzeugt, 10 Stunden und mehr ist man leicht in dieser außergewöhnlichen Welt gefangen.\n\nDie Source-Version von \"Half-Life\" ist praktisch gleich dem Original. Lediglich ein paar Grafiken wurden wie etwa das Wasser wurden leicht verbessert.

Don't waste your time on this one unless you want it that badly.  Black Mesa is another viable option[/h1]\n\nSo!  Half-Life: Source.  Valve's attempt at porting the original Half-Life from the old GoldSrc engine to the newer Source engine.  A lot of the reviews I had read said it was basically the same old Half-Life with some slightly new physics, ragdolls spawned on an NPC's death, and better lighting and water.  I was expecting almost the [i]exact[/i] same as Half-Life, but there were a few differences here and there.  Also, there's almost no mod support, unlike Half-Life.  Still being an older game, I was able to crank up graphical settings to get maximum enjoyment.\n\n[h1]Better Lighting[/h1]\nThis is what I was most pleased by.  The original Half-Life had static lighting.  It was just a bubble of light placed in the map, and it changed the brightness of that area.  In Half-Life: Source, however, the lighting is much improved.  \n\nFirst of all, the flashlight was akin to that of Half-Life 2's flashlight, not a magical spot of light that pastes itself to a wall.\n\nThe ambient lighting is actually coming from a light source in this game!  Some rooms look very different with this new lighting.  Most of the time, these rooms were a lot darker than they were in Half-Life.  But this gives a pleasant ambient effect to the game that isn't in the original.  Plus, NPCs have real shadows.\n\n[h1]Source engine physics[/h1]\nUnfortunately, due to Valve not wanting to completely redo Half-Life, there's nothing you can pick up and throw.  The boxes still function the same way: You walk into them to push them, and hold \"E\" to pull them.  But they don't spaz out and fly against a wall when pulling them (which I somewhat missed).\n\nPlayer physics are literally almost the same as the original.  I can still bunny-hop the way I used to, and I can do Schrodinger's Crouch.  But one thing I found odd is that the jump height is increased.  When in Half-Life, I could jump and zip straight into a pipe, in Half-Life: Source, I smacked my head on the top of the pipe, ruining my perfectly executed move.  While this might not affect average players, those who have a routine for the entire game will likely get screwed up by this.\n\nRagdolls are also a thing now.  Instead of playing an animation when dying, NPCs drop as ragdolls instead.  I will say that it is pretty satisfying to see a HECU Marine fall dead in his tracks with a right-click of my shotgun.\n\nSource's new water effects have greatly improved sight into the water, but given the rest of the outdated graphics, the better water feels out of place.\n\n[h1]Level design[/h1]\nThe levels are almost the exact same as those in Half-Life...  [i]Almost[/i].  Valve actually did change a few things.  I noticed that tubes at least in the beginning weren't octogons, and had a higher amount of polygons.  Some terrain was made slighly more realistic, instead of a ramp of sand, there was more of a \"bumpy\" or \"hilly\" look to it.  (after 80 hours of trying to speedrun Half-Life, you notice little details like this).  And of course, the canyon scene is very much fixed.  The pipes no longer end spontaneously in an abyss, and the skybox is much improved.  A clear bottom to the canyon can be seen, and you can watch the water ripple.  Other than aesthetic improvements, not much was made to the actual maps.\n\nEnemies, however, I believe have been changed.  Vortigaunts seem to lightning you faster, as if the difficulty was set on \"Hard\".  I also feel like the HECU Marines do more damage, but maybe they're just a little bit more accurate (or because they actually turn around before you double blast them with the shotgun).  Some HECU vehicles take more hits than they did in Half-Life.  One example would be the HECU chopper that comes in after getting the RPG on the cliffside.  In Half-Life, it usually took one rocket, and it was done.  Now, I used all my rockets (granted I missed half of my shots) and all the Tau Cannon ammo, and it still didn't go down.  The tank after the cliffs also either doesn't take damage from satchel charges beneath it, or takes more than two (satchel charges is how I always dispose of the tank in that level).  Rockets did the trick, though.\n\n[h1]Bug fixes and new bugs found[/h1]\nValve fixed some of my favorite glitches from Half-Life in this game.  The infinite health door is what really hit me hard.  I could no longer beat the game with over 9000 health.  Other fixes include not being able to push buttons through walls (which I missed greatly from my playthrough), and the ability to push friendly NPCs around, so I could skip those talk sequences in the beginning or skip almost the entirety of Office Complex by pushing Barney through a door, or riding the elevator from the outside.\n\nUnfortunately, new bugs have found their way into the game.  Elevators make no sound when you ride them (which isn't terrible, it just ruins the atmosphere).  When I tried to turn on the HD textures pack, few of the weapons would make any sound.  Not my own weapons, not the HECU's weapons, no weapons made any sound.  I switched back and tried to load the save, but it froze and had to restart my Mac.  Started a new game from that chapter (Yes!  You can select a chapter now!) with the HD pack disabled, and it worked fine.  Speaking of textures, the conveyor belt rides in [i]Residue Processing[/i] had a serious problem.  I don't know how to explain it, but be wary of a graphical glitch in that chapter (might be my Mac.  I have no idea).\n\n[h1]Final evaluation: 6/10[/h1]\nHalf-Life: Source is an attempt at porting a GoldSrc game to the Source engine.  Granted it wasn't a very worthy attempt, but at least it's a start.  If this had been better, I don't think Black Mesa would have existed, and Valve would be raking in all the cash.  But I think the Black Mesa team did a swell job at completely recreating Half-Life, perhaps even better than Valve could've done.  Definitely better than what Valve has actually done.  Sure, I'd recommend it, but only if you need to complete your Half-Life collection.  If you want Half-Life, buy the original.  If you want Half-Life in the Source engine, go for Black Mesa.  Half-Life: Source isn't worth your time.","timestamp_created":1466818007,"timestamp_updated":1466818055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23768750","author":{"steamid":"76561198127930999","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":887,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":95,"last_played":1590052984},"language":"english","review":"The only reason I am giving this a reccomendation is because I love half-life.

I bought this with a package so it was worth it in terms of price.  \n\nThe game crashed a fair amount and on one level the textures bled everywhere to the point where I couldn't see anything.  I had to search for a fix and it worked but that was really annoying.  Also the skyboxes on some levels are lacking in textures.  I also don't understand why your character moves so freakin' fast.   It's awkward when you're trying to complete the game's numerous jumping puzzles.  \n\nHowever, this game is a classic that has influenced numerous subsequent FPSes, so if you buy this game you're owning a piece of gaming history.  I just think you should try to get the original version if you can, though Black Mesa looks interesting, too.  \n\nUpdate:  I played HL2 again recently.  I changed my mind about HL1 not standing the test of time as much as the sequel.  The more complex levels that you find in older shooters remain fun to play, and though I love HL2 its linearity makes multiple playthroughs less appealing.
