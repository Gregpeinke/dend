Yeah they give you an advantage over enemies but other then that a lot of the time this game consists of the same boring and tedious pattern. Which is, get a gun, shoot guys, get on grappling hook, use Elizabeth for items etc. I wouldn't have an issue with this game if their was more variety, but I can't say their is. It hurts too because the story in this game is cinematic like a good movie, engaging, endearing, and captivating and intriguing.

On the other, it isn't really Bioshock, it feels like it's building up to something that never happens, and there's a lot of sections where you just watch things play out instead of actually playing them.\n\nThe other Bioshock games were about the player finding themselves in the aftermath of 'science gone wrong'. You wander about, collecting Plasmids/ADAM/EVE/Guns, fight off the deranged, mutated remnants of society, and try to avoid getting a Big Daddy arm through the chest.\n\nThis game puts you in before anything has gone wrong, and then your presence makes it go wrong. You spend the rest of the game with things going wrong and that's it. You don't get to wander around what you've done after it's happened. You never get the same feeling of loneliness or fear that Bioshock gave. You're in the middle of a civil war and getting shot at by both sides all the time.\n\nThere's also the problem of character development. Usually, a game is great when characters are fully worked out. But in this, it feels weird. You're playing a guy saying things you weren't thinking of saying, or not even agreeing with. They're telling you what you should be feeling, instead of letting you soak it up from others. I never got caught up in the whole Booker/Elizabeth thing, so she just came off as an annoying character you can't shake off. Where Half-life 2 succeeded, Bioshock 3 seemed to struggle.\n\nEven the names of things are just replaced. Plasmids are now 'Vigours'. EVE is now 'salts'. ADAM is gone entirely, relying instead on coins for all upgrades. And no hacking machines, you just get to temporarily turn them to your side. It felt like they were making a game and relying entirely on the success of Bioshock to market it. It really should have been called 'Physhock', because it really is about physics over biology, and is based in an entirely different world to Rapture.\n\nThere also comes a point where you only really need a Hand-cannon and the Bucking Bronco vigour for the little enemies. Throw them in the air and them pick them off one by one. Even the Patriots aren't much if you can just keep shooting then ducking behind cover. The only time you need to keep your wits about you is when a Handyman appears. Those things soak up damage like it's going out of style. And they're fast. Faster than you are.\n\nBut despite that, it holds up. If they had just not tried to piggyback on Bioshock, I'd probably not have any criticism of it. It's a good game. The ending feels like it fizzles out a bit but other than that the gameplay is good. It keeps you entertained. Well worth a purchase, though I wouldn't say £20 is it's worth. A 75% off sale (which seems to be a regular occurence for Bioshock in the sale periods) would suit it nicely.","timestamp_created":1441209068,"timestamp_updated":1441209068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17847771","author":{"steamid":"76561198045675365","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1247,"last_played":1476121607},"language":"english","review":"Just play it and experience an amazing world unfold.\n","timestamp_created":1441205689,"timestamp_updated":1441205689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17845299","author":{"steamid":"76561198145862425","num_games_owned":320,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":2147,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":721,"last_played":1542402169},"language":"english","review":"that ending is a mindfuck\n\nI much prefer the atmosphere of bioshock 1 to this game, but Infinite is fine when not compared to the predecessors.\n\nIt's also very short - could be good or bad for some but it wasn't a massive complaint, the length makes the game more replayable imo","timestamp_created":1441193863,"timestamp_updated":1637425941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17844999","author":{"steamid":"76561198066288971","num_games_owned":286,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":393,"last_played":1441191656},"language":"english","review":"\"Bring us the girl, wipe away the debt. \"\n\nBioshock Infinite is one hell of a ride... The game is a masterpiece in my opinion and is a game anyone should play. ANYONE. The story is extrmely interesting and the gameplay is fun as well. Though, the game is a bit short. I could finish it in seven and a half hours. \n\nThe gameplay focuses on the shooting which is very good, there are a small variety of guns and you can only carry any two at a time. The fighting really comes out when you start to use vigors. What are vigors? They are these powers you can aquire through machines or bottles all throughout the world. They give you an extra edge in a fight and makes it stand out from most other FPS games out there. \n\nThe story... Ooooh, the story. Holy hell. All I can say is that you if you play games for the story and such, play this. It has a great one which left me astonished and amazed at the end of the game. If you are lucky and haven't had the story spoiled for you, get it and just play. Hell, even if it has been spoiled, play it anyone, it is a ton of fun.\n\nThe characters in the game are rather lovable- Well, it's really just your character, Booker, and his companion, Elizabeth. But you start to feel a bond as you go through the game, getting more and more attached tot he characters which only seems to make the game all the more fun. \n\nOh, and did I mention that you don't even need to take care of Elizabeth when you're fighting and she even throws you salts [ In a sense, mana for your vigors ], health, ammo, and even money? It's like a giant escort missionw here the escort can handle themselves and they even help you out. She doesn't fight though, BUT STILL.

A good mix of stealth-based (or not, you can totally just go in there guns blazing) combat and story-driven gameplay. The expansion packs add a good substory to it, however having not ever played Bioshock 1 I felt like I was missing a good many references. Like fake laughing at a joke that was a little funny to you, but funnier to everyone else who were present for the story behind it. Very well-made, no glitches or bugs that come to mind. The cornerpiece of this particular game, however, is the story. It truly is a masterpiece. *mini spoilers* When you start this game, you may think you have some inkling of how it will end. Listen to me carefully. You have absolutely no idea what you are in for. Accept it. I paced my room for a good seven to ten minutes just contemplating the ending, trying to figure it out.

Damn good. But there are a lot of things about it that holds it back from being one of last generation's most definitive FPS games.\n\nFor starters, it's a standard two-weapon inventory shooter. It has a few issues inherent to this style in that you're forced to tediously pick up new weapons every few moments. For [i]Infinite[/i], this felt restrictive and unnecessary. Vigors, while bog standard in utility and imagination, are okay, but forgettable. I found myself making use of weapons far more than the Vigors, never feeling encouraged to make them a core part of my game plan. The weapon and vigor upgrades also never felt like they amounted to anything worthwhile. Different outfits/clothing items also give you different buffs, but don't really enhance a formula that's little more than \"get gun, get ammo, hit enemies.\" The raw gunplay itself at least feels competent, but given the original [i]Bioshock[/i]'s diversity of approaches and options, [i]Infinite[/i]'s overall gameplay feels like a step backwards.\n\nThis wouldn't be a problem if the game didn't emphasize action at the expense of the world-building. Booker and Elizabeth have worthwhile conversations and there are a lot of great dystopian themes at work, but the focus on run-of-the-mill quality gunfights really stifled the way this world came to life. The game shoves dystopian commentary in your face (in the spirit of the series) and many of the world's themes and politics (e.g. Jim Crow, intense nationalism, religious fanaticism) come from some of the most toxic corners of American history and culture. Modern players could have a relevant personal or moral stake in the game's universe, but the lack of any meaningful choices or directions to take bars you from feeling like you're a compelling part of the world.\n\nThe game actually does do a great job with world-building in the early game and I absolutely praise how well these worlds are first presented. Like the iconic descent sequence into the original [i]Bioshock[/i]'s Rapture, your ascent to Columbia is borderline heavenly. Its blue skies, lively colors, and active populace mirror Rapture's dim, deteriorating setting. It makes it all the more heartbreaking that the game revolves around average gunplay and drawn-out action sequences, preventing players from establishing a better relationship with Columbia.\n\nI will also give the game credit for being pretty and running well. I ran this on a laptop from 2011 (i7-2000 series, Mobility Radeon 6570) and while I couldn't run it on maximum settings, I could still fully appreciate what they've done. The Sky-Line system is also exhilarating, albeit underused, and the voice acting's spot-on. For all of the game's faults, I still had a good time. It just wasn't a special time.\n\nIf [i]Infinite[/i] took some lessons from the Deus Ex School of Game Design (e.g. hub worlds for pacing, side quests for organic world-building, being able to make decisions that actually matter)... or even just the first two [i]Bioshock[/i] games, [i]Bioshock Infinite[/i] could have been something truly spectacular. It didn't have play like generic shooters, especially since it's plausible that people would look to this series to get away from those. Instead, it's a prettier version of what we've already seen and felt in other shooters, but without actually playing much better than them.\n\nI don't think I can really recommend [i]Bioshock Infinite[/i] to the same extent of its praise at launch, especially considering that we now live in a world with [i]Wolfenstein: The New Order[/i] (a campy yet sophisticated alt-history slaughterfest that excels in high-octane action, flexible playstyles, and great worldbuilding. In essence, a game that fulfills its commitment to its mechanics and its setting without sacrificing one for the other.) If you walk into [i]Infinite[/i] with the same expectations you have for average-at-best shooters, you'll be fine. It's a good romp through an intriguing world and worth playing once.\n\nBut the problem is that this is [i]Bioshock[/i], and my expectations for [i]Bioshock[/i] are far higher than my expectations for other shooters. Yours should be, too.","timestamp_created":1440990582,"timestamp_updated":1441077138,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17805887","author":{"steamid":"76561198012854670","num_games_owned":514,"num_reviews":118,"playtime_forever":1090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1090,"last_played":1420020196},"language":"english","review":"IMO the best of the shock series, at least the latest run of them.
