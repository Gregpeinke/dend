(Also, to get the Steam Awards badge).  With maybe 2 or 3 exceptions, this is the best-written game I have ever seen or played.  Elizabeth is, in my opinion, one of the most if not the most realistic and engaging character in gaming – especially considering she is solidly a secondary character.\nApart from that, everything about Infinite is just beautiful.  The atmosphere, the combat, the graphics; everything.  \n\"Will The Circle Be Unbroken?\" is one of the most emotional renditions of a song I've heard yet; I cried hearing it before I even knew what happened in the game.
