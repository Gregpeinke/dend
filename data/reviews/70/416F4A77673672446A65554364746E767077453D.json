For example, the controls of this game are crap. You slide on every surface and have to deal with an awkward momentum system that is unintuitive when modern games often feature snappy controls with point-to-point input. But of course, Half-Life was built upon foundations set by games like DOOM, Quake, and Unreal and, to gamers who grew up with those titles, the controls will feel just fine. However, unless they never touched a game released since 2004, even they, when coming back to this game, will have to deal with refamiliarizing with the washy movement.\n\nThe textures are quite horrendous by today's standards, though I can't take off many points for that when reviewing a game that's two decades old. Still, they ugly. \n\nAnd as for what made this game great in the first place, narrative through gameplay is simply something taken for granted by gamers nowadays; it's hardly a selling-point anymore. When the gameplay isn't trying to tell a story, it's often either tedious due to bad controls and surprisingly plentiful bugs, or it's frustrating because the game can't decide whether it wants to be a fast-paced run-and-gun or a slower paced puzzle-set. Unfortunately, the merger of these two gameplay styles is not seamless and the switch is often jarring and punishing for a first-time player. And the AI can be quite awful: forgetting what they're supposed to be doing, not seeing the player, getting stuck on loops and objects, etc... Not a pervasive problem in such a linear and scripted game but the bad AI often took me out of the experience. \n\nI recognize that this game was great and innovative for its time and I appreciate all the contributions it made to gaming but the fact is, the gaming industry has taken a lot of the innovations and made them into gaming staples or evolved them. My appreciation for this game's legacy did very little to make the game itself fun.","timestamp_created":1534996624,"timestamp_updated":1534996654,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.422303467988967896","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44321279","author":{"steamid":"76561198157473012","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":58819,"playtime_last_two_weeks":217,"playtime_at_review":6378,"last_played":1660556907},"language":"turkish","review":"Bir fps oyununda sınırları ne kadar zorlayabilirsiniz, bunun cevabı Half-Life'ta.","timestamp_created":1534979883,"timestamp_updated":1608987078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44320001","author":{"steamid":"76561198155431708","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":29,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29,"last_played":1524549117},"language":"english","review":"Its as  old as i am and it holds up and its cheep sooooooooooooooooooooooooo\nget it i like being born when this game came out\n\nI got it with portal so yer i have not played it a lot but i like i can get the mas from this in portal im going to play the hold game with the portal gun \n\nNOTE: Portal has all  the same files s half-lafe so the game works \nportal has the same units and peoples speech unused in the game thats fun thay just got HF and put all the portal this on to HF so yer i dont have the \"time\" in this because im playing this in portal so get HF for the files and play it in portal","timestamp_created":1534973544,"timestamp_updated":1534973544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467185765504837036","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44313051","author":{"steamid":"76561198167377814","num_games_owned":297,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":855,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":758,"last_played":1535100896},"language":"russian","review":"Классика и всё такое.

This review is based on a complete blind playthrough.  I'll split my reviews into 5 parts: Gameplay, Story, Characters/World, Music, and Art.\n\nGameplay: Half life has extremely fluid gameplay which gives the player constant rushes of adrenaline as they zoom through corners, dodging bullets, etc. Half life also has various interesting mechanics throughout that lead to wonderful physics-based puzzles. You will also encounter a variety of enemies and interesting game mechanics throughout the game. Despite a few times getting stuck, which was annoying (broke immersion), and a dissapointing final boss imo, Half life has a great variety of game mechanics and enemies which, combined with fluid gameplay, lead to a wonderful experience that further immerses you into the world. \n\nStory: Half life begins with a simple premise: You are Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who works at a company called Black Mesa who accidentally allows alien invaders called Xen to invade Black mesa. Half life is a very unique game because it never has a single cutscene or forces you to wait around for characters to finish dialogue. This option allows for total player freedom for how they want to approach the story. I can't stress enough how much I love this approach to narrative and I personally tried to intake as much of this world as I possibly could. Ultimately, the narrative of Half life 1 gives the player complete freedom in how much they want to learn about the narrative that valve is trying to create.  \n\nCharacters/World: Half life has an incredibly immersive world, mostly experienced through fluid gameplay, silent protagonist, etc. Like was previously stated, half life gives you complete freedom in how much you wish to learn about your enviorment. Little details and great guards/scientist interactions are scattered all throughout the game, but they can be glossed over if wished by some. While the only memorable character besides Gordon is Barney, there isnt much of an emphasis on deep, emotional sidekicks. There is only Gordon, who doesn't speak which is good because it lets the player feel as though they are the theoretical physicist himself.  \n\nMusic: Half life 1's soundtrack isn't that particularly memorable, besides the hazardous enviroments theme (Valve's theme) ofc. The soundtrack is only there to add layers into the immersive atmosphere and adrenaline pumping gameplay. On face value, the soundtrack is still pretty well thought out and does add an atmospheric tone to half life. \n\nArt: Probably the weakest part of half life, because it hasn't aged well. For 1998, I'm sure that half life looked revolutionary especially with the wonderfully various set pieces that are presented throughout the game. However, modern gamers might be personally taken aback by the outdated graphics and blocky textures. I personally was completely fine with the blocky character models and pixelated set pieces, and I still was incredibly immersed in the world so graphics made no difference. \n\nOverall: In the end, I personally really enjoyed my playthrough of half life. From the minute I started, I was immersed into a wonderfully-detailed world where I truly felt like I belonged. The fluid gameplay, suprising level of detail, and complete freedom to exploring the narrative and world of black mesa all culminate into a wonderful experience that I'd recommend to anyone. Can't wait to continue this series with half life 2 and dlc in order to see where this critically-acclaimed series will go narrative-wise. \n\nScore: 9.5/10\nOutstanding\nWorth Full Price","timestamp_created":1534751430,"timestamp_updated":1548047170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44263921","author":{"steamid":"76561198048695648","num_games_owned":442,"num_reviews":94,"playtime_forever":493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":493,"last_played":1534723567},"language":"latam","review":"Half-Life.\n\nEl comienzo de todo, el comienzo de los videojuegos con profundidad narrativa, la evolución de los first-person shooters...\nTodo esto comenzó allá por 1998.\n\nEn unos meses van a hacer 20 años desde que Half-Life llegó para quedarse y revolucionarlo todo.

Пройдена неоднократно с обоими дополнениями.\nРассказывать про плюсы и минусы я не буду, ибо о них рассказали до меня. Я хочу рассказать конкретно про Steam-версию.\nЭта версия просто вынуждает играть с OpenGL рендером. В Sotfware режиме невозможна адекватная навигация по меню. Кнопки, окна и сами пункты меню можно нажать только если переместить курсор ниже кнопки. Крестик на кнопке \"закрыть окно\" вырвиглазен. Настройка игрока для мультиплеера загублена. Цвета модели на изображении не меняются. Плюс с Software рендером нельзя поставить разрешение экрана 1600x900.\nOpenGL рендер исправляет косяки с меню и разрешением. Но появляется другая проблема, которая не нравится лично мне: с OpenGL рендером модели оружия уезжают куда-то вниз. Не целиком конечно, но уже достаточно для того чтобы мозолить глаза.\n\nЕдинственные плюсы Steam-версии это: Возможность играть на серверах (на пиратке тоже можно, но всё же...) и возможность запустить без каких-либо танцев с бубном на современных ПК.","timestamp_created":1534122506,"timestamp_updated":1534175182,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565352916717529297","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44104809","author":{"steamid":"76561198377999537","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":174,"last_played":1574441617},"language":"english","review":"9/10","timestamp_created":1534107984,"timestamp_updated":1534107984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44098557","author":{"steamid":"76561198154952759","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1065,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":561,"last_played":1660167847},"language":"russian","review":"Типо лучшая игра в 98 году , не так-ли ?","timestamp_created":1534089235,"timestamp_updated":1534089235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44097650","author":{"steamid":"76561198337655106","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3015,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":58,"last_played":1636658891},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever :)","timestamp_created":1534087083,"timestamp_updated":1534087083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44097266","author":{"steamid":"76561198361074479","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50,"last_played":1515217438},"language":"koreana","review":"모든 FPS 게임들의 원조","timestamp_created":1534086266,"timestamp_updated":1534086266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54237288236618042","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44088362","author":{"steamid":"76561198046184958","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":11,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1534091530},"language":"english","review":"This is a cult classic \nno matter how many times you play\nawsome storyline\ngood puzzles\nreplay value is highest\nyou would be living under a rock if u never played this game","timestamp_created":1534061625,"timestamp_updated":1534061625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44079838","author":{"steamid":"76561198425776357","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1004,"last_played":1516091785},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego la verdad :v debes tenerlo en tu coleccion y gracias este juego me di cuenta de 2 cosas: si da miedo y te llevas un buen susto de vez en cuando y 2: las graficas y la historia son muy buenas :D.

Стоп, но её же нет в Steam... И на PC...[/h1]\n\n[i]«Господа, нам нужно подготовить план... Доктор Розенберг отправится на поверхность. Помогите ему вызвать подкрепление!»\n— Доктор Ричард Келлер[/i]\n\nДа, да, вы не ослышались. Сейчас будет краткое ревью на [b]Half-Life: Decay[/b]. Просто потому, что игра официально не издавалась на [b]PC[/b], обзор на сам [b]Half-Life[/b] я писал в [b]Source-версии[/b], а хоть как-то осветить эту часть серии тоже стоит. Поэтому, как мне кажется, здесь для [b]Decay[/b] самое место.\n\n[b]Gearbox Software[/b], поняв, что [b]Blue Shift[/b] был сильно вторичен, пусть и являлся неплохим образчиком, принимают смелое решение - сделать из [b]Half-Life[/b] кооператив (да, это было задолго до [b]Portal 2[/b]). Одному, правда, игру пройти невозможно (на [b]PC-версии[/b] можно переключаться между персонажами). Вдобавок к этому главными героями, точнее героинями, впервые в серии стали девушками - [b]Джина Кросс[/b] и [b]Колетт Грин[/b]. \n\nПо сюжету учёные (да, они обе - коллеги [b]Фримена[/b]) пытаются выбраться с территории [b]Чёрной Мезы[/b] (как оригинально) под руководством [b]доктора Келлера[/b] и [b]доктора Розенберга[/b]. И... Всё... Сказать больше нечего. На этом рассказ об аспекте истории можно и закончить. Ничего интересного, увлекательного здесь нет.\n\nПо динамике эта часть является максимально быстрой из всех ([b]Portal[/b] не в счёт) в серии. Атмосфера куда-то ушла на второй, а то и третий план. Сама игра стала представлять из себя скорее прямой тир с небольшими развилками. Всё это появилось в угоду кооператива, который даёт определённый вызов в некоторых ситуациях (особенно, если ты играешь один на [b]PC[/b], переключаясь между персонажами, чтобы они не вымерли раньше времени). Сохранения отсутствуют по понятной причине. Проект просто не предназначен для одного игрока. Последнее, что убеждает тебя в том, что это обычный тир - оценки за прохождение уровней. Да, да, каждому персонажу по итогу выдаются оценки. \n\nТем, кто любит кооператив, кто обожает мир [b]Half-Life[/b], не стоит проходить мимо этой части.
