I'd like to offer some valid reasons why I can't recommend this game. Of course they're my personal observations, and the issues won't affect everyone, but they could affect *you*.\n\n[u]Major Issue: Bugs[/u]\n\nBugs in over 35% of the wretched puzzle rooms. Whether it was pixel hunting for the correct atom of usable wall to pop a portal on, or the game presenting busted mechanics you cannot work around as there is only one solution to everything. Sometimes repeating the same action five times would result in four failures and one success. Most of the time I had to reload an older save to start that area all over again, hoping that this time the puzzle would be functional. In a puzzle game, these bugs are not so much game-breaking as fun-breaking. I only realised something was amiss when I consulted a YouTube walkthrough, and found out I was doing the right thing but the game was bugged. \n\nI'm now stuck on (what feels like) the nadir of the game. I'm in a glitched puzzle where Stephen Merchant keeps yammering at me in an attempt to be funny. This room (Wheatley puzzle 17 I think, blue tunnel of light going horizontally) has murdered the game for me. I just don't have the interest in it to bother completing this room. Tried the video walkthroughs, but guess what? The wall others can use, I can't!  To play a game where I can't tell when it's bugged or not is literally gaming torture. \n\nSecond smaller gripe: Stephen Merchant's voice acting. Holy flurking schnit, who thought this was a good idea?! I'm English, but this man's voice gets on my nerves, let alone his awful attempt at jokes and ad-libbing. With all the reloading I've had to do, I've heard his rotten material probably sixty times more than other players.\n\nMultiplayer wasn't free of bugs either, and after trying it once I didn't return to it for a very good reason. Whether it was lag or bugs/glitches, bits of these puzzles didn't work either. Marvellous! \n\n[i]Summation[/i]\n\nIf you are intent on getting the game, I'd heartily recommend getting it discounted. Of course, you may not experience these bugs. My friends didn't - their run through was completely fine. Nor can I explain why over 50% of the game bugged out. The faulty turret puzzle was the first major issue that halted progress for days, as the only cure was reloading old saves before I had entered a 'bugged' area. Can you imagine how much of a pain that was, having to reload whole areas because one room's puzzle wouldn't let me through? There are no backdoors or workarounds, so when something goes wrong, it completely blocks your progress.\n\nI really wanted to enjoy this game, as there are some really good elements. I loved controlling the liquid so I could make new portals. I didn't have a problem with this element at all, and it was lovely to experience it working properly. The super-bouncy areas were a lot of fun too. I also enjoyed seeing the roots of Aperture Science, and GLAdOS's history. \n\nThe bugs utterly ruined it for me. You can't afford to have bugs in a puzzle game that requires precision, timing, and thought from the player: It's like performing surgery with a carrot instead of a scalpel.\n","timestamp_created":1398393137,"timestamp_updated":1398393137,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.293830245733261108","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9924769","author":{"steamid":"76561198044860607","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1454514747},"language":"japanese","review":"これが、欲しがった　ポータルガン　使ってみたいです。","timestamp_created":1398392540,"timestamp_updated":1398392540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541982531547546387","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9924649","author":{"steamid":"76561198011800729","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2140,"last_played":1640735109},"language":"english","review":"hard and funny\n","timestamp_created":1398391354,"timestamp_updated":1398391354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9924628","author":{"steamid":"76561198097868707","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":898,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":619,"last_played":1463435979},"language":"spanish","review":"gente del mundo del mundo soy un caballo rosado asi que obedescanme cuando les digo que este juego es bueno,muy bueno","timestamp_created":1398391236,"timestamp_updated":1398391236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9924432","author":{"steamid":"76561198134287937","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":239,"last_played":1452963001},"language":"english","review":"I freaking love this game it's amazing got stuck on some hard maps but i figured it out!\n\n10/10 From me, i would definately play this again.","timestamp_created":1398389573,"timestamp_updated":1398389573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9924370","author":{"steamid":"76561198113601428","num_games_owned":404,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":671,"last_played":1490213411},"language":"spanish","review":"Es de los mejores juegos que he probado en muuuuucho tiempo, sinceramente bastante entretenido y exige un buen ingenio","timestamp_created":1398388868,"timestamp_updated":1398388868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9924369","author":{"steamid":"76561198062392647","num_games_owned":514,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":727,"last_played":1492537261},"language":"english","review":"This game has given me hours of fun and in my opinion is one of the best games out there even until this day- contains everything you need, action, amazing physics, humour and an amazing story line!!
