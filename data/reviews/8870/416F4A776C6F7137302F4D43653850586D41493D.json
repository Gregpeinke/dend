Players impersonate private detective and war veteran Booker DeWitt, which is forced to accept a dangerous assignment in order to pay off his debts. Such mission entails finding and retrieving a young woman named Elizabeth from a hidden, flying city called Columbia. Booker's intrusion isn't taken too well, and himself along with Elizabeth will have to go through many dangers in order to escape.\n\n🟩 The Good Side\nA Jewel in the Skies\nThe aesthetics of Infinite and in particular Columbia itself, are nothing short of amazing. Each environment, street, room and plaza is rich with details, while the landscapes and vistas coupled with high-end light effects create true magic. This title nails the representation of an apparently utopistic city (such as Rapture was, at a first glance) which then the player discovers to be plagued by massive problems: in the case of Columbia racism, inequality and borderline slavery are just some. Effects, weapons and animations complete the picture and as well contribute in delivering stunning visuals at all times.\n\nIt might be a good shooter...\nGameplay-wise, the game offers fluid and satisfying FPS combat, with each weapon having a distinct feel and good kick behind shots, impacts. The inclusion of the series' iconic powers, this time named Vigors, adds some variety of approach to each fight. There are new gameplay systems not seen before in the series, such as the use of a hook to traverse ziplines, and having a companion that regularly supplies you with ammo and resources. The pacing of combat as well is more action-oriented than in the previous entries with quick-witted enemies and less forgiving shooting.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2228008459\n\n🟥 The Bad Side\n...but not a good Bioshock\nDespite a solid combat system, this third installment takes away everything else that made Bioshock... Bioshock. Level design is far less complex and more linear, secrets and secondary locations streamlined and cut away to a fraction of what was seen in the previous entries. Crafting is gone, powers have been reduced to a mere eight (some of which are borderline useless too), enemies feel more generic than ever. Character building possibilities and variety of approaches to situations are massively reduced as well, streamlining each area to little more than a shooting gallery as in any other regular FPS.\n\nTime Travel? QUANTUM MECHANICS?! 300 IQ Story!\nInfinite starts out admittedly well, to then become an increasingly complicated (quantum?) entanglement of events that by the end of it, straight out crash into conflicting paradoxes. This game takes into account concepts such as time traveling, alternate realities, Einstein-Rosen bridges (wormholes) and mashes them together in the most casual way possible... almost as if adding QUANTUM to anything instantly makes it \"deeper\". That is the strong impression the writing left to me. INFINITE-ly worse than the previous two games' well-thought out narratives.\n\nSeriously, who are these guys?\nThe characters encompassing Infinite's storyline are as generic as they can be, including the two protagonists. There is your stereotypical industrialist hell-bent to justify legal slavery with moralist concepts, your run-of-the-mill anarchist that wants revolution but doesn't have a plan to actually run the country any better. Then we have Booker, more automaton than man, managing to utter around twelve complete sentences in the whole game, and appearing dull as ever with each. Forget the previous games' well thought out and deep characters.\n\nRating: Above Average\nIt took me 10 hours to complete the game on Hard, taking my time to find secrets in each area. For the current price of 30€, decent overall quality yet several issues, I would suggest waiting a good sale before buying - especially for fans of the series.\n\n\nIn-Depth Breakdown\n🎮 Gameplay Analysis\nGameplay is divided into Exploration and Combat.\n\nExploration\nIs performed mostly on foot, and on occasion by using your Hook tool to traverse metal rails or jump on cargo holding platforms. There isn't any map to consult to get a sense of direction, but the linearity of levels doesn't warrant that anyway. Each location is filled to the brim with containers such as barrels, crates, purses and more - not to mention corpses at times. Looting everything you can find will give you cash, health, salts, ammo and sometimes more rare resources like lockpicks.\n\nThere are secrets to find such as secondary rooms a little off the main path, and in a few cases code ciphers to decipher after finding the relative book, usually in another part of the level. Vendors are uncommon and usually offer upgrades for your weapons, powers other than ammunition or health. Hacking is gone entirely, so no discounts this time! Infusions are rare items boosting Booker's stats permanently, and often are located behind lockpick-able doors or cipher rooms.\n\nCombat\nPlays out in an FPS fashion, and is admittedly solid at that: satisfying fluidity of actions, good animations, plenty of gore, weight behind shots and deadly enemies. As the adventure goes on, you'll access a good variety of weapons and powers, all with their relative upgrades that however will almost never feel unique. Gear is an important part of combat, granting Booker passive abilities, it can be changed at any time to better suit a specific situation but in general, the really 'good' pieces of gear are few.\n\nEnemy variety is not very good, and most foes will feel too similar to each other. Most of all combat disappoints because it has a rather narrow amount of ways to play out, especially considering what the previous titles offered in this regard. It's still solid, though. Death will mean losing some money but being revived on the spot, enemies will get back Full Hp though - still rather cheesy. The level of interaction with the environment is much less than in the other series entries, and is a letdown.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2228759258\n\nTechnical Breakdown\nPC Specs: RTX2080Ti, Ryzen 3900X, 32GB RAM DDR4\n\nCritical Problems\nNone.\n\nOptimization\nNot good.

The audiologs gave you insight into the people's lives and thoughts there, and piece by piece you puzzled together what happened there and what lead to it; among other things. Items were satisfying to find, combat was also satisfying and sufficiently interspersed, and plasmids were new and their reason for existing was a fundamental part of the story.\n\nBioshock 2 was \"more of the same\" with improved mechanics. Some people loved it, some people hated it; for me the story was worse, but the mechanics were better so gameplay-wise it was more fun to play (and the story itself wasn't bad either, it just didn't live up to the masterpiece-level of Bioshock 1).\n\nAnd then comes Bioshock Infinite. I played this game to completion when it first came out 7 years ago (pirated), and before it was released I followed it closely and with hype. There's 1 word that can describe this entire game: \"forced\". They tried to create a new Bioshock from thin air, but in the sky. Instead of creating a game from scratch, one that is cohesive, they forced a template (the Bioshock template), then built a game around it that didn't fit. The result was this strange \"Frankenstein\" monster. For example; there's vigors in this game (the plasmid equivalent), which make ZERO sense story-wise and are completely superfluous and an \"after-thought\"; simply shoved in because it's a Bioshock gameplay staple. Given the setting, they are not believable; and the setting itself is also unbelievable. A city under the sea? Sure. A floating city? Nope, especially not the way it's set up; as a kind of dissociated building archipelago, and much less in its time period. Also, while Rapture is enthralling due to its setting and you are constantly reminded of where you are due to the windows etc.; most of the time in Columbia you couldn't even tell that you're actually \"floating in the sky\", it looks like a regular city. You can see sky above you, so it's not as obvious a reminder as seeing water above you.\nThe story, related to the \"tears\" (won't spoil anything), is not that great; it's bombastic and overblown, and you are also force-fed it throughout the game. The rest of the story the setting justifies itself with is generic garbage as far as I can tell, as is the clichéd revolutionary side-arc and the reminders that \"racism bad\"; the audiologs are boring and completely unappealing. While in Bioshock 1 I loved seeing an audiolog at any point, here these were a drag. About finding items, as opposed to Bioshock 1 where the city was in shambles and you could just go taking the few items you could find with the \"justification\" of someone who takes something from a building in ruins as nobody will claim it and those who will are either way all trying to kill you, in this game the city is NOT in shambles and yet you take everything (which is MUCH more than you could even find in previous games) you can find, even steal it right in front of people's faces with no consequence (there's a couple of instances in the game where if you steal you will be attacked, but they are the minority). Petty theft simulator 2013.\nThe game is overlong. Most of it is combat, and despite the vigors and sky-lines, the combat is very boring and repetitive. The AI is dumb as a rock, barely has any moves at all (not pretty for a game that relies so heavily on combat). Weapons aren't that many, and you can only hold 2 at the same time; which wouldn't be that big of a deal if combat weren't CENTRAL to the game.\nThis might be a nitpick, but: Elizabeth can find money for you. When she does, you can accept it by pressing E (you must eventually accept it). Every time you do, an animation showing her throwing you a coin and you looking at it, is triggered. It's not skippable. If this animation were triggered once, it would be no problem (it lasts about 2 seconds). But you see it so many times during the game, that you can feel the time-waste. It's too long. The game should play it in full the 1st time, then give you a shortened or sped up version of it afterwards.\n\nTo end on a positive note, the positives of this game in my view are the sky-lines; they are very fun to use during combat. And also the tears during combat: Essentially, Elizabeth can bring forth specific items (RPG barrels, medkit crates, flying turrets to shoot enemies, rocket launcher automatons, etc.), etc; but only one at a time. It's \"resource-management\" during the combat, and it spices up the fight.\nAlso, Elizabeth as a companion is pretty useful. She will look for things in the map that you might need; if you run low on salts (which you need to use the powers, called vigors), and she sees salts somewhere, she will get them and call your attention, after which you can press E so she throws the item at you for instant use. Same for medkits, ammo, and money.\nIf you feel attached to Elizabeth and her plight, you will like the story. The Elizabeth-related story isn't too bad, it's just overblown.\nThe game is a \"bad good game\". A game that makes you wanna play it, yet doesn't live up to its potential. Buy Bioshock 1 and 2 instead of this one, and maybe also play this one once if you liked the previous ones; but if you expect the same level of quality or engagement, you'll probably be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1596314942,"timestamp_updated":1597018807,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.415094316005706787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73624091","author":{"steamid":"76561198181161746","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":471,"last_played":1596314047},"language":"schinese","review":"名字改了把我忽悠到了，\n生化奇兵：完全版\n结果只是英文名变中文名字了而已和普通版没区别。\nDLC还是得单独买我当时还以为这么便宜。","timestamp_created":1596314293,"timestamp_updated":1596314293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73622493","author":{"steamid":"76561198090838881","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":705,"last_played":1596311156},"language":"russian","review":"Здарова чуваки.\nВобщем прошёл я эту игру.\nРаньше, в начале нулевых, было много мемов по этой игре, я не знал, чем она так цепляет людей.

El juego cumple desde el punto de vista tecnico, grafico, narrativo y argumental. No digo nada que no se haya dicho ya realmente, un excelente juego, incluso si no eres amante de los shooter como yo, lo terminaras disfruntando bastante.
