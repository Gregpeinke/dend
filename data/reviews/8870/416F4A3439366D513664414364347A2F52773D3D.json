You will see a scene for 2 mins that is like past ones but that is it. It comes off like buying an orange and being given a grapefruit. This game has nice graphics and what comes off as much more fun to play (sliding along zipline stuff), at the cost of the less detailed, more horror type environment the previous ones are known for.\n \nThe game itself however is very good with the combat being a lot more fun and the adventure more lively. It has a steampunk and future like feel while keeping many classic settings and music that the previous versions had. One big change for combat is the magic skills and only being able to carry 2 weapons at once, but at least there are no ammo issues this time. The game itself is a bit easier than previous ones even on hardest difficulty since there is more balance, but now death has a penalty (lose some money and enemies regen some hp).\n\nBest deal is get it on sale around the 10$ mark, unless you believe companies should receive 50+ for a 10 hour adventure.\n\nPersonal experience score: 10/10\n\nStory: 9/10 - Pretty interesting. Comes off a bit as the prince saving a princess type scenario but with a lot more depth\n\nSound: 10/10 - Good sound throughout\n\nGraphics: 10/10 - Very nice looking and the scenery and locations are enjoyable\n\nControls: 10/10 - Easy to use but the default is different from previous Bioshocks, recommended to use retro for old style\n\nGame Length: 6.5/10 - Only about 12 hours without any DLC.

Ты боишься Бога?\n — Нет. Но тебя — боюсь.\"\nЦитата из игры[/i]\n\nЕсли честно, я садился за эту игру с мыслью просто пострелять по противникам, и посмотреть что же изменилось в серии BioShock со времен первой игры (в которую я играл , но сюжет меня не впечатлил)  Ушел в слезах. Честно. Ибо сюжет и механика этого шедевра в хорошем смысле слова , заставляет включить свою эмпатию, и начать сопереживать персонажам. Точнее не просто сопереживать, а ставить себя на их место. Причем делается это достаточно простыми, но очень эффективными способами. Вы думали Элизабет просто так вам патроны и аптечки кидает, когда совсем плохо становится? Нет! Именно из-за этой особенности игры, вам потом самим неосознанно захочется бежать и спасать её. \n\nИ таких примеров множество, все элементы игровой механики и сюжета в Bioshock Infinite направлены на то, чтобы эмоционально затянуть не индивидуума, который тыкает по кнопочкам, а то что у него в голове и за её пределами, проще говоря личность. Такие игры встречаются очень редко и их можно пересчитать по пальцам одной руки.\n\nИз-за этого трудно жаловаться на проблемы с игровой механикой, ибо постоянная нехватка патронов, денег и местного аналога маны под названием Salts, является не багом а фичей. Также, как графическая и звуковая составляющая, которые придали переживаемой истории, как ярких, так и мрачных красок. Хорошо что игра переведена субтитрами, ибо использование русской озвучки убило бы всю атмосферу напрочь.\n\nНу и напоследок скажу, что на Linux эта игра работает очень стабильно (вылетела всего один раз). Настоятельно рекомендуется тем, кто воспринимает игровую индустрию не как развлечение, а как искусство. Искусство, которое вызывает эмоции.","timestamp_created":1446792066,"timestamp_updated":1480027393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520134210586547852","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18903090","author":{"steamid":"76561198180320042","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":912,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":477,"last_played":1454888462},"language":"english","review":"I extremly recommend this game.It was amazing!The voiceacting,characters,graphics,artstyle and story.I can also never give away the ending.It's that good!!!\n","timestamp_created":1446790316,"timestamp_updated":1446790316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18902267","author":{"steamid":"76561198164069920","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":879,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":606,"last_played":1557118935},"language":"english","review":"the best in the series.","timestamp_created":1446785108,"timestamp_updated":1446785108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505494534969329834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18902162","author":{"steamid":"76561198081753936","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":460,"last_played":1446784317},"language":"english","review":"8/10 | Strong story yet it feels drawn out.

The world and characters are such that i would like to keep exploring it forever. Shooting (which there is plenty) is good enough. It's not the best but it gets the job done. While there is a lot of killing there is also a lot of just wandering around with or without story elements.\n\nThe gameplay elements don't always mix with story and sometimes it's hard to take seriously a cutscene where a little wound takes a big role when you just before got shot 20 times. Or when you walk around town and steal everything from everyone and no one really cares. Gameplay elements (like the looting) and story (people reacting) are different parts and are kept separate in a way that sometimes is just weird. Enemy AI is also a bit on the passive side and the enemies give way too much breathing space. This meant that on hard difficulty i died less than ten times during the story mode. These are minor issues especially if you come for the story and atmosphere since those are unmatched in gaming.\n\nI rarely want to play a game again after finishing it. Bioshock Infinite is one that i want to replay immediately.\n\nUpdate: And i did! Though before that i completed Burial at Sea 1&2, which twist, bend and ultimately wrap up the storyline so that you can better enjoy the main story again. This time i completed on the 1999 mode which is the hardest of hard modes. This mode offered atleast some challenge at times but also brought out some of the flaws. For example the controls are a bit of a hit and miss at times especially when grinding on rails. On other difficulties this was not an issue since the enemies were not as deadly.\n\nWhat also was brought up was the absolute marvel that this game is story-wise and with the setting. Elizabeth and Booker are an exellent duo and the city is such a visual treat. The story has lots of twists but talking about them would ruin the experience. I recommend Bioshock Infinite to just about anyone. If you are new to shooters just play on easy and soak up the story and atmosphere. Just play it. You won't regret it.","timestamp_created":1446757335,"timestamp_updated":1447505428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18896816","author":{"steamid":"76561198035979984","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":663,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":558,"last_played":1637414821},"language":"english","review":"[b]\"Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt\"[/b]\n\nNever suspected that this sentence at the beginning of the game could\nbring forth such a marvellous story.\n\nBe warned, after finishing the song you will suffer a major\nbrain-ache.\n\nWhat game could I possibly start after a this one?\n[spoiler]If only I could go to a lighthouse to go to a universe where I haven't played  this game yet and start over...[/spoiler]\n\n","timestamp_created":1446756407,"timestamp_updated":1446756407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18896049","author":{"steamid":"76561198101057026","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1224,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1054,"last_played":1509634669},"language":"russian","review":" После всего проведённого времени в Bioshock Infinite я понял, насколько это прекрасная игра..

But, in any single aspect of that realm, I never felt such overwhelming, giant, depressing insanity as the one I experienced while playing this game. This whole thing would have suited Sheogorath much better than the Isles - one big, huge, multidimensional asylum that would be best cured with a nuclear blast. It was so mentally exhausting that I'm strongly tempted to click the \"Don't Recommend\" button.\n\nStill, I have some understanding of why there was so much fuss about this game when it was released. My first hours in it were almost fabulous - pure enjoyment, utmost pleasure. I have no doubt that most of the reviewers in game magazines and journals never made it any further and reflected those good feelings in their reviews. If I stopped playing after 3 or 4 hours, I would also have written a review consisting of excited, positive emotions only.\n\nI also find it probable that the game is just executed in a tradition which is quite alien to me. I never played any of the Bioshock titles, so I never knew what to expect and how it all should be in general. But still, getting to the conclusion was feeling like carrying a heavy burden, I just wanted to get over with it and close the game. Some hours ago, when I was starting it to play the final chapters, my only thoughts were \"okay, let's just end this\".\n\nThat's what I have to say about the plot and the atmosphere. Awesome beginning, terrible ending, and a slowly developing gradient from the first to the second in the middle.\n\nGraphically it's good but not exciting. I was rather surprised to find some long forgotten graphical methods in a 2012 game. Still, it's generally pleasant to the eye.\n\nCombat is good, diverse and also generally entertaining despite some poor design choices (like where you have a selection of spells but constantly stick to one of those you found first because it's the most useful anyway).\n\nPlayer-to-ally relations were already desribed in good detail by various reviewers, so I'll just say that we got our little cute Alyx Vance here along with a set of features that make her quite useful.\n\nMy conclusion would be this: the game is good, and it's worthy of a try, especially if you like Bioshock titles in general, but it did not entirely come up with my expectations, and I'm personally more disappointed than satisfied. I can only choose between \"Recommend\" and \"Don't Recommend\", but if there was a \"Mixed\" verdict in addition, I would certainly had chosen this one.","timestamp_created":1446709745,"timestamp_updated":1446709745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506053268909454346","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18886296","author":{"steamid":"76561198174658153","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":524,"last_played":1447260825},"language":"tchinese","review":"令人印象 深刻的剧情和操作，非常推荐","timestamp_created":1446702066,"timestamp_updated":1446702066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18885312","author":{"steamid":"76561198061875436","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":297,"last_played":1418174185},"language":"english","review":"Really aweosme story line.\n\nOne of the best single player games I've played so far, right up there with Metro 2033 and Last Light, The Last of Us, etc.\n\nCombat can be a little too predictable from time to time but it can be quite challenging in high difficulties non the less. \n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1446694917,"timestamp_updated":1446694917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18885170","author":{"steamid":"76561198065249542","num_games_owned":835,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":944,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":944,"last_played":1409181463},"language":"english","review":"Another solid game in the Bioshock series, but this one has a bit of a different feel to it.\n\nColumbia is like some place out of a dream, as opposed to Rapture which is more of a nightmare. You are never really alone in Columbia because it is a living, breathing city, from the bright city streets to the slums. There really is alot to take in and the gameplay really has you explore it fully.\n\nThe gameplay and combat mechanics are really fun with all the guns and vigors at your disposal. Cycling through all the different strategies to killing enemies really keeps the game fresh.\n\nThe story unfolds itself at a good pace and takes some huge turns at some points. Like, I mean HUGE turns. That being said the plot is very good and well conveyed to the player, plus it's definitely long enough suit the needs of someone after a true, fully fleshed out narrative.\n\nThe biggest difference from Bioshock 1 and 2 to Infinite is the atmosphere. The atmosphere to this game is very bright and beautiful, but much of its beauty comes to be seen in a negative light.\n\nI really enjoyed this game and I hope you do, too.","timestamp_created":1446694014,"timestamp_updated":1446694014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18884361","author":{"steamid":"76561198019804093","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":571,"last_played":1454645819},"language":"english","review":"Fucking amazing game.
