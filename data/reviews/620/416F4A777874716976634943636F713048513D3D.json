Introduce y utilizima muchísimas mecánicas nuevas con respecto a Portal, a parte de darle un nuevo giro a una historia muy bien llevada. El humor ácido de GLaDOS nos acompañará durante la mayor parte del recorrido y por fin descubriremos quién es y porque se comporta asi. La campaña es bastante larga, aunque merece la pena desacelerar un poco y disfrutar del juego relajadamente, alargando asi un par de hora el gameplay. De todas maneras es bastante rejugable, y aun sabiendonos la historia, el juego es capaz de ponernos en situación y hacernos sentir cosas mediante empatía con los personajes del juego. Por si fuera poco, en caso de que la campaña nos haya parecido corta, el modo coop nos puede dar otro montón de horas de diversión (mejor si es con un conocido).

Portal 2 is a fun puzzle game that has interest visuals and characters. As with most Valve games, the levels are extremely detailed and well designed. It comes great as a sequel to portal: it contains great puzzles that will take time to think over to even a player who was replayed portal over and over hoping to breeze through it, new and interest puzzle elements, and an interesting environment. I always find myself looking at the self-reconstructing panels with awe, it gives you a sense that place is alive and self-aware which sets a nice threatning atmosphere, even moreso with GLaDOS's lines. \n\nHowever, there are a few problems with it. Such as the parts inbetween levels which can drag out for awhile because you have to look around large detailed rooms to find a way just to get to the next puzzle. Which are NOT puzzles themselves for the most part, since the problem usually is just finding a portable surface, and from there its almost simple. Thus it makes the game really long to where it loses replay value compared to the first portal. Co-op is a fun and interesting idea and introduces new challenges, however the only real problem with Co-op is the people playing co-op. Its usually one guy doing all the work and the other guy snapping because he didn't let him figure it out for himself. So I recommend Co-op with people you know rather than  matchmaking.\n\nOverall and TL;DR: Its a GREAT game and I recommend it if you like puzzles or not. +there is custom level designs that create new experiences and challenges, making it an never-ending game of puzzles to enjoy for a long long time.","timestamp_created":1385309973,"timestamp_updated":1385309973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569089889526367188","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7731537","author":{"steamid":"76561198006653405","num_games_owned":1013,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2064,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":787,"last_played":1532980566},"language":"german","review":"Geniale Story, sehr gutes Gameplay, witzige Dialoge, einfach ein must have Titel\nDanke Valve ;)","timestamp_created":1385294944,"timestamp_updated":1385294944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7730157","author":{"steamid":"76561198047581416","num_games_owned":358,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":892,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":892,"last_played":1384758778},"language":"english","review":"Not only is this a moderately challenging puzzle game, but it's one of the funniest things I've ever experienced!

Если так - то эта игра для вас. Увлекательный сюжет захватит вас и не отпустит до самого конца, вы побываете в таких местах Apperture Science, о которых даже не подозревали, а элементы головоломки и целая туча пасхальных яиц не дадут вам заскучать даже на самом сложном уровне(что вряд ли, уровни в этой игре идут постепенно, от простого к сложному, так что у вас вряд ли получится забросить игру на середине). Также один из огромнейших плюсов - это цена. 200(а иногда, во время скидок, и 100, и 50) рублей за игру - смешная цена. Итак, если вы хотите поиграть во что-то необыкновенное - скорее хватайте ваш кошелёк и покупайте эту игру. Клянусь, вы не разочаруетесь.
