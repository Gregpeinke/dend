owning but never playing the Half-Life games for over five years, I finally went through and played through the series. What I found were games that not only just introduced fun and amazing mechanics but incorporated them in such a way that demonstrates absolute mastery for a craft. Each chapter and corresponding puzzles were designed with the perfect amount of difficulty and walked the line between hard and easy. They were hard enough to where I had to really think and account for the resources available in each unique scenario, but easy enough so I didn't get lost and frustrated.

2 is more than just a fun game with an unreleased meme of a sequel. Half-Life 2 is one of the greatest achievements in video game history.  Its innovations in technology, gameplay, and storytelling put it leagues above the competition at the time, and over 15 years later, the game is as fun as ever to play from beginning to end.  This game's first playthrough is something purely magical that every gamer should experience.  Getting sucked into the thick atmosphere and world is just so enjoyable in Half-Life 2.

Felizmente, 6 anos depois, após muita prática e com a nova Source Engine, eles finalmente alcançaram o que queriam. Modelos e texturas de NPCs e armas estão muito mais detalhados, possibilitando maior imersão no jogo. A dublagem e design de som também são muito superiores do que da última vez, mas a melhor adição sem sombra de dúvidas é a incorporação de físicas ao jogo.\n\n\"Se algo se parece com madeira, então soa como madeira, arranha como madeira, flutua como madeira e se você atirar, vai se quebrar como madeira.\" Essas palavras foram ditas na E3 de 2003 e o jogo segue essa regra estritamente. Múltiplos puzzles são focados na utilização de físicas para serem resolvidos, o combate é focado em físicas e não podemos nos esquecer da lendária Gravity Gun, cujo o foco é, você adivinhou, físicas. Isso faz com que todo o jogo dê a sensação de ser uma tech demo, mas não no sentido ruim. Você sente que sempre está jogando um cenário produzido manualmente para ser o mais imersivo e inesquecível possível. Isso sem comentar a quantidade de cenários e momentos diferentes e criativos que o jogo possui.\n\nEm resumo, Half-Life 2 corrige todos os erros do primeiro, e melhora tudo de bom do original. Sem sombra de dúvidas, esse é um dos melhores jogos de PC (ou até de todas as plataformas) de todos os tempos.","timestamp_created":1615771631,"timestamp_updated":1615771631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88455829","author":{"steamid":"76561198870404811","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":764,"last_played":1614657618},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1615768599,"timestamp_updated":1615768599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88450886","author":{"steamid":"76561198284698862","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":344,"last_played":1657633218},"language":"english","review":"Disregard the playtime, this is the thing that shifted me towards PC gaming.\nNot many things I can name had the same effect.","timestamp_created":1615760240,"timestamp_updated":1615760240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88450435","author":{"steamid":"76561199029995577","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":5297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":313,"last_played":1651524240},"language":"brazilian","review":"half-life 2 e um jogo otimo, a aventura de gordon freeman nas ruinas da humanidade faz voce pensar: oque aconteceu naquele quarto, oque aconteceu naquele corredor?\na experiencia é incrivel\nos graficos sao bons\nnao laga nem em pc da xuxa\ne tem uma otima historia\neu recomendo","timestamp_created":1615759516,"timestamp_updated":1615759516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88450312","author":{"steamid":"76561199149917630","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":171,"last_played":1619965823},"language":"english","review":"half-life 3!
