Portal 2 is just like that, except with more plot development.\n\nReturn to Aperture yet again, this time guided by a talking blue-eyed personality core who happens to have the same goal as you, all while solving new (and old) tests in your quest to get to the surface.\n\nA great game; I absolutely loved the graphics, soundtrack, storyline, and the two new features: Co-op and Community test chambers! Portal was cool, but the sequel is something else altogether. [b] 9/10 [/b]: I strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles, first-person shooters, plot-twists, and witty humor.\n\nEdit: It's been 5 years since this sequel came out, and in that time, its fanbase has created some of the most amazing, inspiring, heartwrenching, and innovative fanart, test chambers, mods, and fanfiction surrounding a game that I have ever seen (i.e. Blue Sky, Portal Stories: Mel). If you have not played this game by now: do yourself a favor and play. Even if you don't enjoy it, this game is well worth the experience.
