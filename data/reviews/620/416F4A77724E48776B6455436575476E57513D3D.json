NOT THIS TIME!!!!\n\nPortal 2, as a direct sequel, doesn' change much in the base formula, so the game is still based on a more polished version of the Source Engine, is still a First Person Puzzle game but adds a lot of innovations and elements that grant this sequel the status of \"Epic\".\n\nAfter the end of the first Portal we're once again in the Aperture Science Labs, but we're in a different section of the facility and the first thing that can be noticed is that the structures decay and some vocal messages hint that an indefinite but consistent amount of years have passed, and thanks to a Personality Core named Wheatley we try to escape the falling facility. Unfortunately We'll have to pass through the remains of GLaDos, causing her awakening and forcing us to become again Her Guinea Pig. You think this is a spoiler? FOOLS! From here the game will show it's improvement as there actually is a HUGE story plot, with plot twists and revelations that will amaze you room by room making you eager to finish the game to see the end and forgetting I've ever revealed you that (predictable) detail.\n\nThe innovations won't stop with just a (GREAT) plot, but the gameplay is incredibly improved as well. You won't have to deal with just portal related riddles, but you will face gels and funnels, where blue gel will make you bounce high, orange will accelerate your walking speed, white will allow you to spawn portal on every tainted surface and funnels are transport streams that will make you float in their direction the moment you cross them. You can't even imagine the combinations of all these elements, no to mention the events in the story.\n\nLevel design is improved far beyond the first chapter's standards. There will always be minimalistic design test chambers, but we'll have to walk beyond interspaces, factories, dismantled rooms, and immense areas that will make you wonder how big is this Aperture Science supposed to be. You will end up digging so much that you will end up in one of the very first sections of Aperture Science realized at the time of its founder Cave Johnson.\n\nAnd here comes another aspect of Portal 2. They went so far with the game that hired English (obviously) Writer and actor Stephen Merchant to voice Wheatley and American (obviously) Actor J.K. Simmons to Voice the 'Murican Cave Johnson... And their accent and characterization is definitely great.\n\nSoundtrack is a greatly appreciated news this time because even though it is subtle and thin during most of the gameplay it has some dynamics so you'll hear little flashes of melody when you're solving parts of puzzles, but most importantly there are more studied melodies especially during scenes or scripts.\n\nThe last improvement is the other section of the game... Because portal 2 has a single player campaign... AND a Cooperative campaign. We can invite a friend to play via internet and solve 6 sets of chambers precisely studied for cooperative gameplay.\n\n[h1]+++PROs+++[/h1][list]\n[*][b] STORY. [/b] Unbelievable, but portal 2 has a great story showing you the origins of the Aperture Science Labs, GLADos and more, and it somehow has little links to Half-Life 2 as well! Great Final, totally love it.\n[*][b] CHARACTERS. [/b] This time there are more characters, besides GLADos. All her sarcasm always makes me laugh as well as Wheatley's stupidity, and Cave Johnson's 'murican attitude.\n[*][b] GAMEPLAY. [/b] In Portal you use portals. In portal 2 you have Gels, Funnels and the hallucinating combination of these 3.\n[*][b] COOP CAMPAIGN. [/b] Great Coop campaign, perfect game to play with a friend.\n[*][b] SOUNDTRACK. [/b] Seriously this game has a very nice electronic soundtrack, this was unexpected.\n[/list]\n[h1]---CONs---[/h1][list]\n[*][b] LENGTH. [/b] This time the Single player campaign lasts significantly more compared to Portal and the Cooperative campaign is quite consistent as well, but I still believe they could have lasted a bit more... MOAR!!\n[*][b] SEQUEL.

It is certainly the one for which I have the most logged hours. If I could give awards to my catalogue, Portal 2 would definitely by up on the podium. \n\nTo call the Portal franchise 'great puzzle games' is really selling them short on several fronts. And I'm not just talking about the fact that with \"first person puzzler\" the Portal franchise invented it's own genre. They did it in a way that makes you wonder why nobody ever thought of doing this before. Sure, the puzzle elements like, well, the portals of course, and the cubes and the buttons and the different kinds of gells may be the most easily recognizable elements of the game, but it is so much more than that. The campaign is absolutely great and mind-blowing. And if you didn't think they could do a much better job after the first Portal game, well then Portal 2 is the evidence. The voice acting is top notch again, as is the soundtrack. The gorgeous environments were some of my favorite parts of the game. The whole combination of things makes it an immersive experience that makes you want to see every bit of the world that they are not showing you.\n\nAnd, oh yes, the Steam workshop for Portal 2 with loads of user created content is an absolutely valuable addition to the game. I'm not always such an addicted consumer of user created content; most of the times I'm like, eh... I've played the official campaign that was made by people who knew 100% what they were doing AND had the resources, so why would I bother plowing throught the piles of stuff of varying quality that other people made? But the Steam workshop makes it very easy to search and select (for instance) the top rated puzzle chambers of all time, and easily import them into Portal 2 with one click. Some of the top rated ones are actually series of multiple puzzle chambers that really are mini-campaigns in their own right, both in length and in quality. Great respect for those creators, and great thanks to Valve for making it so easily accessible and selectable.\n\nAnd, oh yeah, another oh yeah, I would almost forget the Coop campaign for 2 players, which is an extremely fun way to enjoy Portal 2, and yet another complete campaign to get you hooked on the game. The two robot characters that you'll be playing together with a friend, Atlas and P-body, and the fun and easy sign-based interaction system that they implemented in the game, will help you communicate to enjoy the game and solve the puzzles together.\n\nThis is not a game that you will spend, say 20 hours on and then never touch again. I've spent a total of 200+ hours on this game as of now, and I think I am no more than an average Portal 2 addict. But that's just one of the reasons why this game is an absolute must-have.
