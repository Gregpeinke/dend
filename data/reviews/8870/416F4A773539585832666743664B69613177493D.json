Букер поднимается на вершину маяка, где обнаруживает устройство, которое доставляет его в Колумбию, утопический летающий город. История Infinite вращается вокруг девушки, закручиваясь в сжимающуюся спираль и выстреливая с невероятной силой в самом финале.\n\nАтмосфера Америки начала века передана в BioShock Infinite ничуть не хуже, чем начало 1960-х в прошлых частях. Соответствует все: плакаты, архитектура, интерьеры, музыка, оформление элементов меню и даже дизайн игрушек в магазинах.\n\nСначала все странности окружающего мира списываешь на чувство юмора разработчиков, но потом, во время очередного сюжетного витка, все переворачивается с ног на голову, и юмор кажется уже не таким смешным. Познакомив нас с диспозицией, игра плавно переходит к процессу формулирования вопросов. Почему Элизабет заперли в «башне»? Кто ее родители? Почему и когда она потеряла мизинец? Что за Анна, у которой Девитт просит прощения в бреду? Почему ему так легко убивать людей? Иногда вперемежку с вопросами игра подкидывает ответы, но надо быть морально готовым к тому, что некоторые из них окажутся обманкой, а со временем стройная картина мира Infinite изменится до неузнаваемости.\n\nОтдельная победа сценаристов — грандиозный финал. После непростой последней битвы, когда ожидаешь увидеть коротенький итоговый ролик с намеком на продолжение, разработчики выкладывают свой главный козырь — нас еще минут двадцать водят по разным местам и, подобно Морфеусу из «Матрицы», прямым текстом сообщают все, на что раньше лишь намекали. Когда на экране начинают мелькать титры, игрок остается сидеть с трещащей головой и вывихнутой от удивления челюстью. Концовка срежиссирована настолько здорово, что мы не удивимся целому валу подражателей.\n\nВ Infinite особую роль играет музыка - она сближает Элизабет с главным героем, помогает прочувствовать моменты духовного подъема Девитта. Когда звучит музыка, оба героя ведут себя немножечко иначе и все вокруг будто бы становится добрее.\n\nЕщё есть свое особое развлечение - поездки на рельсах, протянутых прямо под открытым небом. Зацепившись крюком за аэротрассу, герой может быстро добраться от одного дома к другому, да еще и с ветерком. Враги тоже обучены пользоваться аэротрассой, так что крюк очень важен в сражениях.\n\nBioShock Infinite сделана так, чтобы понравиться всем, но при этом ни на миг не опускается до уровня игр-жвачек. Любители сложных историй получили потрясающий сюжет, кажущийся вначале обманчиво простым. Поклонникам качественного боевика подарили простую систему развития и бешеную динамику.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tOrNC3FBDAA","timestamp_created":1618182143,"timestamp_updated":1618182143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583755791187286377","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90158342","author":{"steamid":"76561198151090161","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":860,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":746,"last_played":1618242086},"language":"spanish","review":"tabueno","timestamp_created":1618179607,"timestamp_updated":1618179607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90157740","author":{"steamid":"76561198110735877","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":872,"last_played":1618178322},"language":"latam","review":"Sullivan!

Columbus is a nice change of pace from Rapture in the previous games. The characters are some of the most interesting I've ever seen period. Elizabeth is my favorite overall, being a character that I actually cared about and I found myself wanting to hear more of her story. Also for once in a game I actually liked having a companion following me around, in games like fallout and skyrim I always traveled alone because I find companions to be annoying however Elizabeth actually helps and doesn't get stuck in a doorway or something. Lastly, the story is very interesting however towards the end it can get a little hard to follow unless you easily understand stories about multiple timelines/dimensions.
