Columbia itself was very nice looking, but after about an hour, it seemed to lose its charm. It doesn't relally matter, though, because for the majority of the game, you're indoors. Atmosphere was the best thing about BioShock 1 and 2 (in my opinion), and this game just doesn't seem to have it. I also didn't like how they made it so you can only hold two guns. The last thing I want to complain about are the firemen, or Infinite's Big Daddies. In BioShock, the big daddies were intimidating. They were slow, strong brutes who made creepy noises, yet they would quickly dash towards you and attack. Everytime I heard they heavy footsteps and the low groan, my heart started racing. The Firemen, on the other hand, aren't intimidating in the least. They're just big bullet sponges, nothing more. Overall, BioShock Infinite is a well made game, with great characters, and a really great story.

In diesem Spiel ist nun wirklich einiges anders, angefangen von dem Setting (es spielt nun nicht mehr unter dem Meer) bis hin zu den fehlenden Plasmiden. Letztere wurden ersetzt durch \"Salz-Skills\", von denen es deutlich weniger Auswahl gibt, als noch zu Zeiten von Plasmiden. Das Spiel ist insgesamt sehr linear gehalten. Jedoch hat mir die Story sehr zugesagt! Schon lange hatte ein Spiel für mich keine so verschickte Story wie dieses. Vor Allem das Ende hat es storytechnisch sehr, sehr in sich! Mich hat es umgehauen, so psychisch durchgeknallt, wie das Spiel ist =)\nWas mir noch gut gefiel ist die Tatsache, dass man fast das ganze Spiel zu zweit spielt, ein NPC Charakter in Form eines ansprechenden Mädchens rennt fast die ganze Zeit mir einem herum und versorgt einen im Kampf mit Nachschub, wie zB Munition.\nAchja, ich hab es sehr vermisst, dass die Verkaufsautomaten nicht mehr \"Willkommen im Zirkus der Werte\" sagen...\n\nFazit:\nFür mich ist es kein \"echtes\" BioShock Spiel, weil doch schon einiges anders ist, aber es lohnt sich aufgrund der Story dennoch durchzuzocken!
