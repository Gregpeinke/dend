The first was born from a prototype made by some students, while the second is a full fledged AAA release. Portal 2 is just the next step, if you're contemplating playing it then you should have already played Portal. This isn't an either/or situation.\n\nPortal 2 has it all, clever game play, terrific dark humor, an engaging atmosphere (Act II really excels in this aspect), a strong single player story, fun co-op multiplayer, and Steam Workshop support for almost endless content. This is a game that's hard to review in much detail as you quickly run out of synonyms for \"good\". This really is a masterpiece, building on everything Portal did right without diluting the experience with forced innovations yet feeling fresh and new.\n\nThis is one of those few games that I can easily recommend at full price. If you haven't played the original then look for a bundle that contains it and invest the 2-3 hours in it before jumping into this.","timestamp_created":1404142261,"timestamp_updated":1404142261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10976800","author":{"steamid":"76561198142544124","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":343,"last_played":1500958494},"language":"english","review":"This is an amazing sequel to the first one.","timestamp_created":1404141720,"timestamp_updated":1451538393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10976567","author":{"steamid":"76561198071175383","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1004,"last_played":1610386850},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego buenisimo, largo y entretenido, con cierta dificultad para tener que pensar y darle al coco, horas de juego muy bien aprovechado","timestamp_created":1404141233,"timestamp_updated":1404141233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10976449","author":{"steamid":"76561198082255781","num_games_owned":292,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":846,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":845,"last_played":1479925794},"language":"italian","review":"Portal è sempre portal\nspettacolo!","timestamp_created":1404140953,"timestamp_updated":1404140953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10976293","author":{"steamid":"76561198085852981","num_games_owned":291,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":801,"last_played":1496597064},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 iz gud","timestamp_created":1404140605,"timestamp_updated":1404140605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504727602005004883","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10975605","author":{"steamid":"76561198037542324","num_games_owned":324,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":438,"last_played":1529769807},"language":"tchinese","review":"好玩...\n\n最喜歡動腦的遊戲..\n\n\n只是有些卡的很嚴重=ˇ=","timestamp_created":1404138936,"timestamp_updated":1404138936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10975446","author":{"steamid":"76561198036001657","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":53,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1404138454},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2?
