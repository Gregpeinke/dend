What more is there to know? Well, for one thing, it is the ghetto of multiplayer FPS'. Meaning, functions such as objective mechanics and pre-round/round time are map-based, and time is not shown on the HUD, it's generally shown through a server-side command. Other than that, it's quite fun, if not unfogiving, but what fun is there in a game if it offers you little challenge and doesn't punish you for not meeting said challenge?\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fast-paced team-centric gameplay, unfortunately it's not exactally bursting with players every day. Most servers are full of bots, and the one that don't have mods that, while not always detering from the gameplay, tend to not retain the original gameplay fully.\n\nNeeds Steam Trading Cards.

Оглушающая граната намного мощнее.\n- Нет обреза, есть только слабый одноствольный дробовик и гвоздомёт, который эффективен только против турелей (сентри) и медленных противников.\n- Имеет проволочные ежи, которые замедляют противников, наступивших на них.\n- Может разоблачить вражеского Шпиона, сбросив его маскировку, прикоснувшись к нему.\n- Может обезвредить взрывпакет вражеского Подрывника.\n\nСолдат (Soldier, Solly):\n- У него есть обычная граната и гвоздевая граната, которая стреляет гвоздями на 360 градусов и потом взрывается, нанося серьёзный урон.\n- Владеет одноствольным дробовиком, как у Скаута и двуствольным, который намного мощнее.\n\nПоджигатель (Пайро, Pyro):\n- Нет сжатого воздуха.\n- Огнемёт наносит урон в зависимости, сколько у противника брони.\n- Владеет поджигающим ракетомётом, выглядит как обычный ракетомёт, поджигает противников, не требует перезарядки.\n- Имеет обычную гранату и напалмовую, которая поджигает противников попавших в радиус действия.\n\nПодрывник (Демоман, Demoman):\n- Взрывающиеся по нажатию гранаты не липнут к поверхности.\n- Оба гранатомёта делят один магазин.\n- Имеет одноствольный дробовик.\n- Может устанавливать взрывпакет, который подрывает дополнительные вспомогательные проходы, а так-же наносит критический урон всем противникам, которые находились в радиусе действия.\n- У него есть обычные гранаты и кластерные, из которых после основного, более мощного взрыва вылетают маленькие гранаты и через секунду взрываются.\n\nПулемётчик (Хэви, Хэвик, HWGuy, HW, Heavy Weapons Guy):\n- Имеет при себе 2 дробовика.\n- Есть кластерные гранаты помимо обычных.\n\nИнженер (Инж, Engineer, Engy, Engie):\n- Не может переносить постройки.\n- Имеет весьма мощные EMP-гранаты, взрывающие патроны. Его мощность зависит от количества взрываемых патронов - может разом взорвать до ~6-и противников и может нанести мизерный урон, если патронов очень мало.\n- Может чинить броню тиммейта ударами по нему гаечным ключём, этим может полностью восстановить его броню нескольими ударами. (нужен металл)\n\nМедик (Мед, Доктор, Врач, Medic, Combat Medic):\n- Медик так же используется в основном для захвата флагов, потому что у него вторая скорость по эффективности после Скаута и у него есть оглушающая граната, но он более мощный, нежели Скаут.\n- Может заражать противников с помощью аптечки, зараза передаётся всем противникам, которые стояли рядом с заражённым во время стона и получения урона.\n- Нет лечeбной пушки и убер-заряда.\n- Имеет 2 дробовика.\n- Его супер-гвоздомёт очень эффективен против турелей и медленных классов.\n\nСнайпер (Sniper):\n- TF2 Снайпер с Классикой, гранатами и автоматическим режимом винтовки, делит с обычной магазин.\n\nШпион (Спай, Spy):\n- Имеет транквилизатор.\n- Есть двуствольный дробовик.\n- Может имитировать смерть.\n- Может снять маскировку вражеского шпиона, прикоснувшись к нему.\n- Владеет галлюциногенными (газовыми) гранатами.\n\nГражданский (Civilian) - последний класс, который используется в специальных игровых режимах.\n\nИгровых режимов много и на каждый приходится от 20-и до 200-от различных карт, каждый может найти себе по вкусу.\n\nИгра имеет тёплое и дружелюбное сообщество, есть минимум 8 серверов, которые становятся полными или набирают 24 игрока хотя-бы по часу-2 в сутки.","timestamp_created":1342271417,"timestamp_updated":1508999037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.688295960426330566","comment_count":11,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2526634","author":{"steamid":"76561198008784874","num_games_owned":341,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":21251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19435,"last_played":1656879400},"language":"english","review":"Too many hours on this game.

first, for those who compares to TF2 : CUT THE CRAP. Seriously dudes, of course it's not the same game at all, this one is from 99. Do you even remember how video games were in 99 ? TFC was a fucking revolution still active today with 100+ servers. It deserves respect, at least. Then, we can talk about the fucking veterans of TFC who still play today, after like 10 years, grenade spamming... The type of guy who annoys you to death because he kills you EVERY TIME calling you noob. Well, i'm this guy, and yeah, totally : you're a giant noob and it's fun to piss you off. We don't really need new players and it's always funny to see your Ragequit. If you have the good attitude, asking how basically grenades works and stuff, people will help you indeed, but 99,9% of time, people thought they will rek everyone ingame with their awesome skills and get frustrated. That's life, get over it. Now, I understand that TF2 originally people will not love this game, but still : don't criticize such a piece of art.","timestamp_created":1320214099,"timestamp_updated":1418177271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2683687","author":{"steamid":"76561198011022863","num_games_owned":565,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":42851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":15,"playtime_at_review":1141,"last_played":1660512816},"language":"english","review":"The best FPS ever created.  This was my first online gaming experience and still ranks as the best.  Quality gameplay and solidity that is lacking in today's modern FPS games.  This was one of the first games to incorporate a multi-class system (besides the original Quake version of course).  There are no hats, unlockable items, powerups, killstreaks, or other gimmicks included to compensate for lack of gameplay quality.  \n\nA true gem.  I have had more fun with this game than anything I ever played.  To most people TFC would be considered a dinosaur of a game in 2011 (graphics and engine wise) many of the servers are now desolate or filled with bots.  But if you are a lover of old school shooters or want to feel some serious gaming nostalgia from the 90's I highly suggest this game, worth the $5 price it costs.","timestamp_created":1320206096,"timestamp_updated":1320206096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5086518","author":{"steamid":"76561198044902354","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":55,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":55,"last_played":1318143600},"language":"english","review":"EPIC & HARDCORE (WITHOUT BLOOD)","timestamp_created":1319212220,"timestamp_updated":1319212220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"142216","author":{"steamid":"76561197963213349","num_games_owned":302,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":84,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41,"last_played":1417360209},"language":"japanese","review":"rock2でkeyを挿した時と、cz2でコントロールセンターにdetpackを仕掛けた時の興奮は異常。","timestamp_created":1318790475,"timestamp_updated":1318790475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z7WCh7MCeLhF"}
