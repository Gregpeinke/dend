This one I picked up in the Steam sale.\n\nIn terms of what  does this game give you that isn't in the others, well not alot. It's more of the same. But when that is EXTREMELY FUN then what does that matter!\n\nControls were beautiful and you will struggle to find a glitch in the game. Wow, I was expecting it to be a hell of a lot more buggier than it was. I've done 25 hours and found only 2 bugs. One was a loss of sound if you rush into a door. And the other is where I was trapped. Believe me I searched high and low on this game.\n\nThe Story is just phenominal! Personally. I just loved every moment of it. The new combat is fantastic. The interaction with your partner is amazing. I LOVE the  fact that even the tutorials are like 'Yeah don't worry about her!'. It just lets you enjoy the story and the game. And the story is worth enjoying. I loved the attention to detail like Elizibeths clothes tearing as you play through.\n\nThe voice recordings as good as ever. The graphics were spot on. You'd be hard pressed to criticise. The guns were diverse enough to give a sense of variety. Upgrades good, Hidden items great. I really can't fault it.\n\nMy only criticism, and it's not even that big, maybe too easy. I done it on Hard the first time round and then the new unlocked hardest setting without breaking a sweat. In it's defence the respawning, again for me, works. I like this featue in Bioshock. I wish I played this on release. It's worth full price any day. If you like Bioshock and you like story driven action and searching for stuff then this is a cracking game.\n\nThey know they done an excellent job and I encourage anyone to buy it, full or sale price. It's worth it.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI've come back around to play this time and time again. Also to note the DLC is excellent and provides a new take on the genre when you play on the hardest setting.

Разработчики игры BioShock Infinite постарались на славу, и выложились на все 100%. \nХотелось бы начать с сюжетной линии.Игра закрученна так,что если вы будите всякий раз отвлетаться от неё,вы потеряете линюю смысла всех диалогов и действий, и в дальнейшем,вам будет уже сложно понять что там вообще происходит. Сюжет на самом деле очень интересный и умопомрачительный. В BioShock Infinite продумали не только сюжетную линюю, но и в ходе игры, мы узнаем о героях все больше и больше, что дает игре только положительный отзыв. Игрок может развлечь себя поисками аудио - и видеозаписями,что помогает ему узнать о Колумбии все больше и больше.Тебе даются дополнительные задания,с помощью которых ты тоже узнаешь об истории данного места. ТЫ сам делаешь свой выбора, ТЫ сам отвечаешь за свои действия. Отдельным пунктом хочется отметить искусственный интеллект. Здесь представлена девушка, Элизабет, в отличии от других игр,девушка достаточно самостоятельна, и, мало того что может сама за себя постоять, так ещё и тебе помогает.Это подача вовремя патронов во во время боя,и здоровье и, когда надо, деньги подкидывает\nОтдельное спасибо можно сказать разработчикам за то,что сделали дополнительный контент-\"Burial at Sea\". Здесь мы возвращаемся в так хорошо знакомый по первым двум частям игры Восторг.Где нам дают возможность поиграть как за мужчину,так и за женщину.Да, во втором эпизоде можно играть за Элизабет. Все два эпизода мы находимся под водой в поисках маленькой сестрички.На мой взгляд,игра оправдала свою цену.

It's a bioshock game of course so there's something to be said about it being the third look at another form of extremism as an evil. But at the same time you have to actually look at the game and realize that it's a giant steaming pile of shite.\n\nGameplay:\nAt its core Bioshock Infinite uses Bioshock gunplay, which by the way is slow clunky, and the iron sights are hindrances more than they're helpful. The assorted vigors are for the most part very samey in the feel, you have hurty spell, stunny spell, hurty stunny spell then minor variations of that. Oh yeah, and every enemy has a gun, which if you played the first few games you'd know means the enemy is dangerous. Obviously they had to have guns because it's a far more open environment, however they didn't make the gun enemies any less dangerous. Rather than fix the numbers they slapped on a bandage of a regenerating power shield which feels both out of place, and serves to make your actual health stat a rather useless secondary feature that makes no sense to include. There's a reason the later halo games removed HP.\n\nLevel Design:\nHow an open air environment feels more corridor-shooter than a literal corridor shooter like in the other games is nothing more than a modern miracle. The clunky implementation of the sky hook as an attempt to add a third dimension to the fighting areas merely puts the game into awkward stages rather than naturally formed \"Yeah a staircase there makes sense\". However the environments are indeed very pretty and do have a sort of cartoony American feel to them which was most of the time rather enjoyable to watch.\n\nArt:\nHonestly it's just bad in my opinion. I can understand lanky arms and weird features in the other games because it's supposed to seem dark, but in this game they try to make these dark characters in a bright environment and while the message comes through it feels hamfisted and forced. The characters for the most part feel very out of place and some of the enemies just look overdone.\n\nStory:\nIgnoring all of the *spoiler* stuff, which doesn't make a damn lick of sense because they continue to string you along giving you false information about how it works and making it seemingly inconsistent (I give them the benefit of the doubt and assume there's a bible somewhere that has all their rules in it), there's an actually engaging storyline. I very much so only continued to play it because I wanted to know the end of the story, Elizabeth and Booker became characters I really wanted to see how their story played out.\n\nReplayability:\nFor the love of god never will I touch such abysmal gameplay again.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nDespite all of my bitching and moaning, I really do mean it when I say that Elizabeth and Booker were incredibly compelling characters. Comstock and his ilk were just as compelling and I wanted to know the story gameplay be damned.

Schön und gut, die inszenierung der fliegenden Stadt ist super gelungen, ähnlich wie am Anfang der anderen Bioshock teile in denen man am Anfang eine Uboot fahrt hinlegt. In diesem Fall mit dem Zeppelin, SUPER gelungen. Jetzt kommt der negative Aspekt, die Sky Rails und der Sky hook waren am Anfang bombastisch WOW noch nie gemacht, nach dem dritten LVL im selben Baukasten design ohne besondere Vorkommnisse oder ohne großartige abwechslung wirds Langweilig. Die ganze Zeit warte ich das etwas passiert. Die Gegner sind wenig herausfordernd. Nutzt man die Kräfte ist es das alte \"Junge mit Lupe gegen Ameise\". Wer gewinnt wohl. Des weiteren gibts keine Überraschenden Momente mehr, es ist sehr linear, die LVL sugerieren eine gewisse Freiheit und trotzdem ist das Spiel komplett linear. Die Story ist vorhanden. Ist aber auch alles , sie ist weder spannend noch besonders logisch. Mann geht in eine fliegende Stadt um Mädchen zu holen, womit er seine Spielschulden begleichen will. Sorry aber unser Protagonist ist ein Gangster/Auftragskiller was weiss ich mit überragendem Überlebenswillen und Schützentalent, warum zum Teufel muss er sich auf so einen Deal einlassen? Wer kann so gefährlich sein, dass man dafür eine solche Reise unternimmt trotz einer 1a Auftragskillerkarriere? Lassen wir das , die Story ist tierisch unlogisch, klar das Ende gibt wie üblich in Bioshock eine Wende auf aber trotzdem bleibt die Story etwas lasch. Das können andere Spiele wie Metro 2033 deutlich besser. Des weiteren fehlt ein Moment der Herausforderung, mal ein Gegner der nicht mit drei kombinierten kräften und 2 Schüssen erledigt ist. Ansonsten ist es ein guter Shooter in Comic artiger Darstellung mit gängigem Waffenarsenal, die Kräfte bringen was Abwechslung rein und die Architektur ist Interessant , das 20iger Jahre Feeling ist auch gelungen.

Whilst some things were taken out and new things were chucked in (by what I have seen die hard fans did not appreciate) I for one found it to be refreshing and new.\n\nThis game graphically is an absolute pleasure, beautiful scenery from start to finish - the whole steampunk feel to the game is such a treat. The game makes you rely on scavenging for ammo and other tools which is something you will find yourself doing quite a lot. There are a fair range of weapons to use at your will, the only thing I found personally is that you get into the habit of using the same weapons - but don't be fooled, every weapon has it's own different advantage! Above all that you are never usually short of upgrades, you will find yourself constantly trying to save for the more expensive upgrades to help you. There are also many more features and things you will find to keep you entertained (like listening to tainted love in a pub in shanty town).\n\nYou may find the story at first to be a little off-balance (especially if you're new to franchise) but trust me, the longer you delve into the story the more it all makes sense. I found the story personally to be gripping right from the start, it keeps you interested and I didn't find anything to be boring in this game. \n\nAs a whole I recommend this game, it is a load of fun and you will be pleased. 8/10","timestamp_created":1404666091,"timestamp_updated":1404666091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11103168","author":{"steamid":"76561198114796569","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":6527,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3902,"last_played":1506984969},"language":"spanish","review":"Y de repente ...

Compered to the other endings from Bioshock and Bioshock 2 where in the end you got to choose your ending and feel a bit \"in control\" of what you decide (i think), in Bioshock: Infinite you're just forced to follow the main plot with a couple of side quests involving the Vox Poluli and the only choices you make won't do anything to the final outcome.\n\nSome parts of the game give the feel of it being a survival game, scavanging dead bodies and geting rescources (Health, salt, ammo) to keep you going.. [spoiler] You can't always put the burden to Elizabeth to supply you with ammo, salts and health.. [/spoiler]There is also a hint of open world since you're able to revisit locations provided you have visited before, but that becomes sort of cumbersome because there are no means of transport, teleportation so it takes a reeealy long time to get there.. [strike] Just going back for money and ammo sounds right but you might realise it's not worth it. [/strike]\n\nIf you're a fan of FPS i'd definetly reccomend this due to the immense and frequent engages in battles, the interesting selection of weapons and the sky-hook along with the vigors which give a positive twist onto how the battle will progress. Although the enemies gradually grow tougher and smarter, your arsenal does too. They have also incorporated a logical upgrade shop for your guns and vigors. I thought that the prices were really expensive, I could have just not scavanged everything enough- I'll leave the conclusions to you. There was also clothing involved in gameplay (hat, top, pants etc.) that gave you a certain power from igniting your enemy in fire when you melee him to creating \"ghostly friends\" that fight for you when you switch guns(the gun is the \"ghostly ally\"). Pretty overpowered if you use them right, that's what i think of it.\nWhat i found annoying about the weapon system is that you are only able to hold 2 weapons. Even though it IS logical/ realistic , I believe that due to the wide range of weapons there should be at least 3 slots, but that's just me. \n\n\nIf I rated this out of 10 it would ba a 9/10 [strike], just personal dislikes from the plot that's all [/strike]\n\n\n[spoiler] (If you get the season pass you'll get a golden pistol and machine gun along with a full gear kit, really helpful if you're planning to do 1999 mode which is the hardest mode Bioshock: Infinite can offer; The Rupture episodes also are a awesome bonus which is why i bought the season pass in the first place.)

We're here to deliver the Halo shooter experience to PC, complete with a two weapon rule and glowing gold bullet shield! \n\nThose meaningful plasmids I asked about? Those are gone, There are three useful plasmids in this, murder of crows, posession, and windblast. Every other plasmid has done nothing to the enemy other than make them an angry person with a tentacle wrapped around them instead of just an angry person. Every secondary plasmid power is a landmine. Because fuck variety. \n\nThe storyline is something ripped out of the 90s (See \"TimeCop\") and very similar to a few other games who have implemented it much better. (Amnesia the Dark Descent has similar twists, as well as the playstation exclusive inFAMOUS 1)\n\nThe nonsensical storyline attempts to hide behind multiverse theories (You know, the thing that everyone groans about when DC comics tries it) but then throws in time travel whenever it feels like without ever bothering to explain it in the slightest. Mulltiverse and time travel are two different things. You cant just throw one in and expect it to cover both.\n\nWhile the game warrants a second playthrough just so you can see how blatant the foreshadowing was the first go around, and how nonsensical the lighthouse scene is in general, it is nonetheless a solid shoot em up, adhereing very closely to the Halo Combat Evolved formula. Not much you can mess up there.\n\nThe racism in this game is unbelievably blind to itself. It portrays a powerful black woman who becomes a heartless cruel animal just like the white masters said they would if left to their own devices.

Hiermit werden schon sehr viele Fragen aufgeworfen. Wieso war man auf diesem Boot, welches Mädchen, wieso dieses Mädchen, …?\nDie Geschichte war einfach nur umwerfend. Von Anfang bis Ende spannend, es kommen immer neue Fragen auf, welche zum Teil geklärt werden, jedoch man immer noch nicht den kompletten Hintergrund kennt. Jedoch ist die Story sehr schwer zu verstehen. Nicht, dass sie unverständlich ist, sie ist einfach nur sehr komplex und man muss wirklich gut auspassen wie alles zusammenhängt.\nUm die Story besser zu verstehen lohnt es sich auch hier die Voxaphone zu sammeln und sie sich anzuhören. Diese enthalten wirklich interessante Storyelemente.\n [*][b]Charaktere[/b]\nDie Charaktere sind alle wirklich gut geworden. Die Charaktere haben sehr viele Handlungen die aus der Sicht der Charaktere richtig nachvollziehbar sind. Dazu machen die Hauptcharaktere eine starke Entwicklung durch, welche sehr spannend und verständlich ist. Ich persönlich finde die zwei Hauptcharaktere einfach nur klasse, besonders Elizabeth.\nEin paar kleine Details fand ich persönlich auch sehr schön. Während man Elizabeth umherschlendert und man sucht oder sammelt in einem Raum wartet sie auf einen. Hierbei steht sie nicht einfach nur dumm rum, sondern sie lehnt sich zum Beispiel auf einen Stuhl, lehnt sich an die Wand oder schaut sich irgendwas interessant aus.\n [*][b]Spielwelt[/b]\nMan spielt in der Stadt Columbia, welche über den Wolken liegt. Die Karten sind ein wenig mehr eingeschränkt als in den Teilen davor, jedoch immer noch sehr offen und man hat viele Möglichkeiten den Kampf zu bestreiten. Die Stadt sieht einfach nur wundervoll aus. Parks, Gebäude, Läden, Schlösser, Zepeline, usw. sind Bestandteile der Map und werden auch im Kampf verwendet und wurden auch wirklich gut eingebracht.\n [*][b]Gameplay[/b]\nIm Grunde hat man immer noch das gleiche Kampfsystem wie in den Vorgängern, jedoch wurden hier einige Sachen entfernt und andere Sachen stark verbessert. Das Kämpfen mit Waffen ist sehr viel besser. Das Waffenhandling ist sehr gut gelungen und es macht wirklich Spaß über den Wolken rumzuballern. Natürlich gibt es auch wieder Plasmide, jedoch heißen sie hier anders als in den Vorgängern, auch wenn sie die gleichen Fähigkeiten haben. Auch hier kann man sie simultan zur Waffe verwenden, wie im zweiten Teil. Im Vergleich zu den Vorgängern gibt es hier keine Zusatzfähigkeiten mehr, welche Adam gekostet haben. Alle Upgrades für Plasmide und Waffen kosten Silver Eagle. Als Ersatz für die Zusatzfähigkeiten kann man Tränke sammeln, welche sein Schild, Lebenspunkte oder Salzkapazität erhöhen.\nDazu kann man auch über die Skyline gleiten um schnell von A nach B zu kommen. Dazu kann man von der Skyline aus Schießen oder auch direkt Leute angreifen.\nKampfsystem und Movement sind einfach nur spitze.\n [*][b]Grafik[/b]\nDas Game ist ein reiner Augenschmaus. Die Texturen sind einfach nur super schön, die Charaktere sehen super aus und die Effekte von Plasmiden und ähnlichem sieht auch einfach nur spitze aus.\n[*][b]Sound[/b]\nIch hab das Spiel sowohl auf Deutsch als auch auf Englisch gespielt. Ich finde die englischen Stimmen viel passender und viel besser als die Deutschen, jedoch möchte ich hiermit nicht sagen, dass die deutschen Stimmen schlecht sind. Mir persönlich gefallen einfach die Englischen besser. Die deutschen Stimmen sind nämlich auch wirklich gut gemacht.\nDie Dialoge zwischen Elizabeth und Booker während man kämpft oder Sachen untersucht sind wirklich gut und enthalten sogar wirklich gute Storyelemte. Hierrüber erfährt man wie sich einer der Beiden fühlt in einem Frage Antwort Dialog.\nDie Soundtracks sind auch hier, wie im Vorgänger, wirklich gut geworden und untermalen die Stimmung und Emotionen die ausgelöst werden vorzüglich.\n[/list]\n[h1]Con[/h1]\n[*]\n[/list]\n[h1]Zusammenfassung[/h1]\nIch kann „BioShock Infinite“ nur weiterempfehlen.

Expectacular en ese sentido, pero si vamos a la jugabilidad, se hace repetido. Las misiones consisten en ir de A a B, saqueando TODOS los barriles que encuentres por el camino si quieres tener munición o similares. Aparte, no tenemos misiones secundarias, es solo misión de historia todo el rato, lo cual hace que el juego sepa a poco.\nEventualmente llegas al final, (en unas 8 horas) y ya está. No hay nada con lo que te entretegas en el juego una vez acabada la historia, porque  no hay nada más. Por otro lado, el final es uno de los mejores finales que he visto en mucho tiempo.\nEl final de un juego es uno de los elementos más importatnes, que pueden subir de categoría un juego regular, o destruir a un juego bueno. En este caso, le salva del desastre.\nAparte de estos elementos, hay que ponderar también si me lo pasé bien jugando, y la verdad es que no me aburrí jugandolo, se me quedó corto, pero no me aburrí.\n\nTras ponderar todo lo anterior por un proceso largo y tedioso, el juego obtiene una nota de 6.97/10 y una recomendación de  jugarlo si un amigo lo tiene en su biblioteca de steam, pero me parece mucho pagar por él a menos que sea una GRAN oferta de steam.","timestamp_created":1404636137,"timestamp_updated":1404636137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11096437","author":{"steamid":"76561198053675822","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1050,"last_played":1391073250},"language":"spanish","review":"los detalles y trama es lo mejor de este juego, muy recomendable :)","timestamp_created":1404626026,"timestamp_updated":1404626026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11096316","author":{"steamid":"76561198029126609","num_games_owned":345,"num_reviews":124,"playtime_forever":1816,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":846,"last_played":1534999179},"language":"english","review":"Would you kindly buy this game?
