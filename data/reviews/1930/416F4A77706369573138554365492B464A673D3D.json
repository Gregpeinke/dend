Why won't it turn where I want to go? Why can't I cast a spell on a moving horse? How do the skill shortcuts work? Why can't I reassign them? Why only 3 spells at a time? Why this botched and weird alchemy system? Why did I keep playing? So many questions, a couple of laughs, and a good amount of frustration later I did actually finish this game, in a most shameful binge. That's one thing this game has over Skyrim/Oblivion I suppose... I bothered to finish it. Towards the end I skipped most quests and hated the ones I had to do and I am very glad I am finished with this game.\n\nOnce you figure it out (and you will have to, and make allowances for bugs and glitchiness, etc), this game opens up and is pleasant enough to play despite the annoyingly slow animations, dumb plot and characters, general uninspiredness, useless and bugged and bizarre skills, and general laughability. It reminds me a lot of Dungeon Siege if it was mixed with Morrowind and made in eastern Europe, which I guess is why it spoke to me more than Skyrim/Oblivion did. Permanent +stat potions make alchemy necessary and briefly interesting as you seek new ingredients and wonder how/if they'll work. If this game had been allowed to gestate another 6 to 8 months it would've been pretty good, possibly better than the games it was competing with. As it stands, it's a large mostly empty world filled with nothing but annoying chained fetchquests, and it will give you the sense it's a rush job. \n\nThe little teleport stones (as in Divine Divinity) are brilliant and make up for some of the annoyances of travel - more games need that or at least Mark/Recall ability. Swimming is ridiculously bad and that they made it skillbased was a really bad choice - there are some major design issues with this game. It only crashed once when I played it, and there were no game-breaking bugs, but some of the quests are a little wonky. There is almost no replay value here, but on sale it should cost less than 2 bucks, which is roughly a fair price for the enjoyment you should be able to eke out of it. I don't think I'll return for Game 2, but I had my fun and laughed pretty hard at some of the oddities of this game. +1 for Taint Shoots. \n\n(If you really want to have a laugh after you finish this, check out youtube user 'ProJared's' review, in which he, the babylike pro, admits to having problems playing an incredibly simple and generally unchallenging game and cheating to defeat it because it's unfair. This game was many things as well as being poorly designed, but only blatantly unfair at the very end.)","timestamp_created":1407470276,"timestamp_updated":1407470276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499769717454910278","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11568392","author":{"steamid":"76561198063859259","num_games_owned":645,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":3401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2948,"last_played":1445210761},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego esta buggueado hubo una mision que en realidad no pude terminar (debido al bug)\nTiene problemas para jugarlo pues necesitas una configuracion especial *La cual les dare un metodo para conseguirla al final de la reseña*\nEl final se corta no importa que haga (a mi y a unos cuantos les pasa) *no pude arreglarlo pero puedes ver los videos en tu carpeta de instalacion*\nLa IA es muy predecible despues de un  combate\nEl personaje se vuelve totalemnte poderoso haciendo que el jeugo (si es que jugaste un par de misiones secundarias) sea muy sencillo realmente SENCILLO\n\nSin embargo...\nEl juego es bueno es entretenido y a pesar de que tiene bugs hasta en las animaciones logro capturarme\nTiene un buen soundtrack\nLos graficos si no son perfectos son buenos\nTiene una pequeña seccion de mods que vale la pena ver\nLa historia es relativamente entretenida y las submisiones tambien\n\nEn resumen el juego puede ser un desastre ya que algunas veces me derrotaban por un par de bugs del juego\nPero si estas interesado en un juego semilinear de \"mundo abierto\" con estilo RPG este es un buen titulo y TE LO RECOMIENDO\n\nSi buscas perfeccion total NO TE RECOMIENDO ESTE JUEGO\n\nTambien si esta reseña logra tener una puntuacion larga aclarare algunas dudas del juego o bugs y como arreglarlos \n\nAca les dejo la SOLUCION GENERAL DE PROBLEMAS COMUNES:\n\nDescarga \"Two worlds control panel\" para esto necesitas ir a la pagina de www.insidetwoworlds.com pero simplemente googlea \"Two worlds control panel\" y en el primer resultado te saldra\nUna vez configurado ve a donde dice \"Tweaks\" y de ahi \"disable intros\" algunos tienen problemas al iniciar por esto\n\nDe ahi si tienes problemas con lag grafico ve a la sub-pestaña de \"tweaks\"\n\"Graphics\">\"Disable High quality shadows\" eso te ayudara en gran parte a solucionar el lag grafico\nabajo de esta opcion ajusta tu resolucion a la del monitor o pantalla que uses y dale en \"Set\" es de suma importancia\nY te vas a la ultima pestaña que dice \"launch game\"\n\nAca esta la segunda solucional lag grafico aunque tambien puede que tengas lag por el problema que se soluciona anteriormente\nUna vez seleccionada la opcion \"Launch game\"\nSelecciona la segunda pestaña llamada \"Advanced\" y de ahi selecciona la prioridad que desees *Vease las especificaciones de tu maquina si lo requiere o no\n\nY lo mas importante abajo las opciones que determinan el como se comporta el juego (en cuanto a desempeño) dependiendo de tu equipo seleccionas la que te convenga pero la solucion que a mi y a varios les funciono es:\n\nHigh Priority\n\nUse Tick Count\n\nLaunch w/Exit\n\nEspero esto les funcione si no manden un mensaje a mi perfil\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1407286726,"timestamp_updated":1407286726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11555488","author":{"steamid":"76561198124717900","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1411301790},"language":"german","review":"das spiel hab ich gekauft geht nicht da kommt immer fehler oder fuktioniert nicht brauch hilfe.....","timestamp_created":1407205125,"timestamp_updated":1407205125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11555085","author":{"steamid":"76561198047866376","num_games_owned":403,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":24,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1423091983},"language":"english","review":"I so want to give this a good review.

Но при этом есть и много плюсов: интересная система прокачки; много магических заклинаний, которые к тому же разделены на школы (некромантия, магия огня, воды и т.д.); много брони, разделенной на штаны, ботинки, нагрудник, перчатки и шлем (согласитесь, не во многих играх такое увидишь); большое количество оружия, щитов. Так же в игре есть неплохо проработанная алхимия (везде растут грибы и травка на любой вкус, эксперементируйте); есть в игре и враги, которых кстати немало; тут нашлось место и интересным квестам (в некоторых местах даже с юмором).

Es un buen juego,pero lo disfrutarán más jugadores avezados en rol, para novatos se puede hacer un poco dificultoso y es fácil que lo abandonen,por la trama y el manejo.","timestamp_created":1405244016,"timestamp_updated":1405244016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11200329","author":{"steamid":"76561198110093220","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":10382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":315,"last_played":1645213713},"language":"brazilian","review":"Como que faz pra ativar este jogo, aqui esta dando que meu codigo de ativação e invalido.","timestamp_created":1405175914,"timestamp_updated":1405175914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11188338","author":{"steamid":"76561198032362815","num_games_owned":443,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":699,"last_played":1486315374},"language":"italian","review":"Underrated Game!!","timestamp_created":1405109826,"timestamp_updated":1405109826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11158278","author":{"steamid":"76561198040365711","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48,"last_played":1502568873},"language":"french","review":"Je vous déconseille particulièrement ce jeu, en premier lieu de par l'attention que les développeur lui porte. \nCe jeu crashera SYSTEMATIQUEMENT lors de ses démarrages: il faudra installer un driver pour que celui-ci marche, (les dévelopeurs n'ont pas jugé utile de faire une uptdate),\nensuite, une fois le jeu lancé, ceux-ci se permettent de vous bloquer l'accés au jeu tant que vous leurs donnerez pas quelques informations (code postale, nom, prénom [après l'achat je précise] mais il est possible de passer outre)\nEnsuite, le jeu lui-même à des graphismes plutôt moche, les combats sont mous et pénible, les bruitages de certaines créatures sont horibles, les visages sont mal fait... \nVous n'entrerez jamais dans l'histoire avec des tenants et aboutissant aussi vus et revus.\nfinalement c'est un jeu à déconseiller : testez plutôt la série des gothics dans le même style en plus réussi.","timestamp_created":1404949637,"timestamp_updated":1404949637,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11157194","author":{"steamid":"76561198028833555","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":34,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1404944596},"language":"english","review":"Great game, totally reccomend it","timestamp_created":1404943693,"timestamp_updated":1404943693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.450548321008682251","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11075556","author":{"steamid":"76561198113592761","num_games_owned":306,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":3083,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3003,"last_played":1518390963},"language":"english","review":"Probably best Game ever, having played two worlds 1&2 in my honest opinion i think this one is by far the better version, would play again 10/10","timestamp_created":1404513044,"timestamp_updated":1404513044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491472929716110229","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11045477","author":{"steamid":"76561198097888972","num_games_owned":663,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1461076716},"language":"english","review":"This game is one of the best games, and one of the worst.

They have to be managed differently, and archery is actually very usefull especialy when facing large number of archers who can disarm you and do decent levels of damage.\n\nThe first 30 minutes of the game is a grind but get past that and the game becomes very enjoyable.\n\nOne of the really enjoyable things about the game is that the guards of towns are no stronger than they should be. So if you are able to take down a cyclops or slay a dragon you don't get the sillyness of guards being able to bash you up.
