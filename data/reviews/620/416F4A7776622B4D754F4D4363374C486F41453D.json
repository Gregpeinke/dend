To my surprise, I really enjoyed it and found my self-wanting to play the second which I did several years later on a PC that I had just got. For the life of me, I can't seem to remember why I stopped playing it half way through as the game is amazing in its own right.  I believe I might have been distracted during that time by many other games that I couldn't have played since I didn't have a PC up till that point. None the less I managed to get back to it and oh boy was it just as good as when I started it. \n\nThe story is very well done especially for a puzzle game since trying to attach a story to a puzzle game leads it to being jarring, boring and stretched out. Valve somehow did the impossible. They made the progression seamless with each puzzle only being slightly more challenging after the last one and adding new elements like turrets, gels etc. at the appropriate times that helps the player learn them correctly so that they can figure out the corresponding puzzles with ease. The fact that the progression is flawless is key for how good the story is since the player needs to finish each puzzle in a reasonable amount of time. If the puzzle is to difficult then the player becomes disinterested in the story and if the puzzles are too easy then it wouldn't be a good puzzle game. Striking this balance is almost impossible and you have to have a match made in heaven for both the writer and level designer for this to work. The story even adds forth wall breaking elements when you go outside the test chambers to explore the world in Portal. This is extremely clever by Valve as it allows players a different set of puzzles to solve, at the same time developing the world further then if they were stuck at developing the story in just the test chambers, a literal \"think outside the box\" moment for Valve. \n\nThe characters are very well done and GLaDOS to this day remains one of my favorite characters of all time. The voice actors are what really bring these characters to life, with Ellen Mclain  (starring GLaDOS) and Stephen Merchant (starring Wheatley ) fitting their characters so well and are really talented VA's, to begin with. It's absolutely necessary when writing characters to have a voice actor to match them well so that they can reach their full potential and really bring with their personality, in Portal's case I couldn't ask for better VA's. The comedy also deserves a node in this regard as well because it's hilarious and fits the game so well with its light-hearted atmosphere and helps the player relax when they get frustrated with any puzzles, making for some great comedic relief. \n\nThe Multiplayer was very solid and with the writer for Left 4 dead returning for this I can't be surprised, also it's valve do we need to question the multiplayer? It had an interesting side story and I'm glad it's a separate story as it's rare these days for games to have two separate stories for the multiplayer and singleplayer. It's arguable that the multiplayer levels are better then the singleplayer and for me I find that true, its a must for anyone to play the multiplayer because of how fun it is with friends and would be a shame to not. The music was again on spot for the game and did what it needed to do, worked really well to bring the game's atmosphere into the spotlight with the overall techy feel. \n\nAt the end of the day Portal is one of a kind and I can't stress enough how great of a game this is. The Talos principle and Antichamber are the only two puzzle games of recent years to match the level of Portal 2 and no way are able to exceed it. Portal 2 has done something that is incredibly hard to replicate and goes far beyond a simple puzzle game with it's deep story, rich chararters and complex but simple level design. It truly could be a game that will overshadow the genre of puzzle for many years to come.","timestamp_created":1526794113,"timestamp_updated":1531710623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42133692","author":{"steamid":"76561198062554648","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":609,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1609058795},"language":"koreana","review":"[h1] 코옵모드가 진리입니다.\t[/h1]\n[b] 아 죄송합니다. 친구가 없으시군요.ㅋ\t[/b]\n\n어느 어두컴컴한 저녁 뭐 할게 없나 등을 긁으면서 스팀에서 이것 저것 찾아보고 있던 날이였습니다.\n포탈2의 스토리 모드를 끝내고 코옵모드를 친구가 없어서 못해본것이\n생각 나 전화로 같이 게임을 할 친구를 찾아서 불렀습니다.\n\n[b] 이 친구가 엄청난 길치에 머리 속에는 스파게티 면빨만 가득한 오스트랄로 피테쿠스가 퇴화한 듯한 인간이란것을 까먹고요.\t[/b]\n\n이친구가 과연 포탈 엔딩을 끝까지 깬것이 맞는지 의심스러울 정도로 못하더군요.\n\n[b]여기 포탈좀 열어줘[/b]\n[b] XXX:여기?(내가 설치한 포탈위에 자기 포탈을 설치하며)\t[/b]\n[b] 아오 시발\t[/b]\n\n제 평생 욕설이나 비속어란 것이 왜 존재하고 왜 사용할까 라는 의문점을 고작 10분만에 타파 해준 친구에게 존경심이 들었습니다. \n이친구와 원활한 게임 진행을 위해서 과연 '여기'란 무엇일까 라는 논문 한페이지를 작성하고 난뒤에 게임을 했어야 했나 봅니다.\n여차 저차 해서 결국 포탈2 코옵모드도 깨고 난뒤에 한가지 의문점이 들더군요.\n\n[b] 야 너 포탈1이랑 포탈2 스토리 다깬거 맞냐?\t[/b]\n[b] XXX:엉 당빠지\t[/b]\n[b] 얼마나 걸렸냐?\t[/b]\n[b] XXX:한 30?[/b]\n[b] 30시간? 조금 오래했네\t[/b]\n[h1] XXX:아니 30일\t[/h1]\n[b] 시발\t[/b]\n\n네... 저는 얼마 없는 친구지만 이친구도 이제 보내주기로 했습니다.\n[h1] 저는 친구가 없습니다.\t[/h1]","timestamp_created":1526791845,"timestamp_updated":1526791845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":20,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552772998809814453","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42133588","author":{"steamid":"76561198378564994","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":701,"last_played":1570612380},"language":"schinese","review":"好游戏","timestamp_created":1526791326,"timestamp_updated":1526791326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42133127","author":{"steamid":"76561198274205495","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":5792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1314,"last_played":1648344122},"language":"english","review":"This is one of my favorite game ever!
