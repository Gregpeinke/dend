It is, by far, the best game FPS I have ever played! I could go on for hours telling you about all the things that make Infinite such a ridiculously amazing game, so I will leave the body of my review down below. I would recommend this game to everyone I know. I love the game, the world of Columbia, and I am most impressed with Infinite.\n\nFluid game mechanics, excellent character development and a solid virtual environment all serve to transport the gamer into the world of Columbia. In contrast to the original two Bioshock games, Infinite maintains a more light-hearted and less stygian atmosphere throughout the game. The introduction of character-to-character interaction leads the user to understand the plot, goals, and underlying motives of each and [i]every[/i] character.\n\nThe NPC's of columbia stand out with unique personalities and attitudes during the game. They help the player comphrehend the attitudes of other game characters by presenting him/her with these multiple perspectives. For instance, the early NPC's of Columbia introduce topics, like the Vox Populi, which are not fully explained until halfway through the game. Some may argue that this is counterproductive, but I believe it holds some strategic merit. \nOh, and the Lutece Twins, my favorite side characters from Infinite, are exceptional examples of how game characters can really connect to the player! After all, they \"are where [they] are needed and needed where [they] are\"...","timestamp_created":1388386433,"timestamp_updated":1388426674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503065526485443115","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8420151","author":{"steamid":"76561198079832132","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":987,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":918,"last_played":1446889038},"language":"german","review":"Einfach nur geil","timestamp_created":1388386357,"timestamp_updated":1388386357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8420137","author":{"steamid":"76561198058249737","num_games_owned":366,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":790,"last_played":1388319332},"language":"russian","review":"Отличный шикарный паропанк-антиутопия с со своими альтернативными реальностями","timestamp_created":1388386310,"timestamp_updated":1388386310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527777791023254395","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8420108","author":{"steamid":"76561198005992308","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":688,"last_played":1395896677},"language":"english","review":"My lord.

I will admit, i got a little glassy eyed a few times as the story unfolded in the last portion of the game.  Lots a of cool references to prior BioShock games are tucked away throughout for those paying close attention.  I also enjoyed the DLC \"Burial At Sea\" and look forward to part 2.  I wonder whats next for the BioShock franchise... things could go so many directions at this point it will be interesting to see what Ken Levine has in store for the new console generation in the coming years.  SO in conclusion, if you are a BioShock fan and havent played this yet, PLAY IT NOW.  Its the best in the series thus far and should not be missed.

The storytelling, central themes, and characters (especially Elizabeth) are all a cut above what most AAA games dare to attempt, and as such this is an important and powerful game in a genre that is traditionally loaded with juvenille pap.  \n\nMild spoilers ahead.\n\nIf you're looking for a solid shooter and couldn't give a hoot about a game that attempts to tackle some tough themes, then by all means go and pick up the latest Call of Duty game, however if you're interested in seeing the Video Game Industry actually try to tackle social issues like racism and poverty, or cerebral issues like parallel universes or time loops, then the Bioshock games - and especially Bioshock Infinite - are an amazing place to start.\n\nAs far as actual game play goes, Infinite is nothing special - if you've played a previous Bioshock then you know what to expect: your characters spends 50% of his time pouring bullets or psychic powers into waves of generally brainless AI pawns, and 50% of his time scouring through trash cans looking for rotting food to eat, or ammo to restock his arsenal.  The shooting is Fine.... but it's not really the point.  (And some might argue that there is too much of it, and it gets in the way of the really interesting stuff - namely the story.)\n\nSpecial mention has to be made of Elizabeth, your \"sidekick\" in the game... she joins you a quarter of the wway into the main plot, and if you don't end up fallign in love at least a little bit with her, then you're a cold-hearted person indeed.

It's easy to get lost in the sky blues and brick oranges of the vibrant floating city. It oozes with atmosphere - Columbia is a game world unrivalled since perhaps Rapture back in the original Bioshock. Exploring every nook and cranny for supplies and audio recordings isn't something that you feel forced to do for an achievement, but rather something joyful as you soak in the game's lore. To speak too much of the story would be to venture into spoilery territory, but all that needs to be said is that it's compelling, layered and thought-provoking.\n\nThe shooting feels fast paced and frenetic, with certain encounters forcing you to think fast and utilise your arsenal as effectively as you can. Your companion, Elizabeth, helps you out by throwing you ammo and health kits when needed but don't worry, it never feels like a glorified escort mission as Elizabeth gets out of harm's way during combat. She's a help rather than a hinderence. \n\nPerhaps one of the only downsides is that compared to the original Bioshock, there isn't any sense of tension built up. Enemies such as the Crow Zealots could have perhaps created a sense of unease like the initial Splicer encounters in Bioshock did, but this is missing in Infinite.\n\nNonetheless, it's one of the best games you'll ever play.

incredible story, spectaclular visuals and with gameplay that although mimics its predocessors, offers something very new and refreshing. BioShock Infinite is a first-person shooter in it's simplist description, where you weild a weapon and a super power or \"vigor\". But it's role playing elements like upgrading weapons and your vigors keep it fresh and challenging.\n\nThe story it self is one to be marveled at without a doubt. You follow Booker DeWitt (Troy baker; voice talent of Saints Row and The Last of Us) in 1912, a war verteran turn Pinkerton thug who has been offered a chance to wipe away his gambling debts by saving a nineteen-year old girl, Elizabeth, from the floating city of Columbia. In our current times we are seeing choice based games with silent protagonist the standard, it is almost like linear stories have become a lost art of sorts. But in Infinite we see a stong and brilliant characterisation with story telling so griping and so emotive you cannot put it down until it's finished.\n\nThe Bioshock series offers is a cross between Steampunk, American exceptionalism and thought provoking religoius discussions in an political and almost perfectly accessible way.","timestamp_created":1388362743,"timestamp_updated":1388362743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8412456","author":{"steamid":"76561198089891018","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":18301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12352,"last_played":1550806025},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bioshock Infinite é um jogo FPS diferente dos demais. O jogo conta a história de Booker DeWitt, um homem contratado para viajar para uma cidade aérea e resgatar uma jovem chamada Elizabeth (apelidade de Bete por mim). Bioshock Infinite conta com gráficos MUITO bons (Quer testar? Põe tudo no máximo). Uma trilha sonora muito boa e um enredo ótimo. Antes que você diga que Bioshock Infinite é só mais um jogo de tiro, saiba que a série Bioshock conta com uma carta na manga algo chamado: Vigores. Para você que não sabe vou te explicar o que é: É MÁGICA! Os vigores te permitem lançar várias \"Magias\" nos inimigos ( e até interagir com o cenário). Você pode queimar um inimigo, lançar um choque nele, mandar um ataque de corvos homicidas nele e etc.\nHá também upgrades chamados infusões, que te permitem aumentar sua capacidade vida, escudo e sais (\"munição\" para os vigores).\n\nDLCs: O jogo conta com 5 DLCs, Early Bird Special Pack, Clash in the Clouds, Columbia's Finest e Burial At Sea Ep 1 e 2. As DLCs Early Bird e Colubia's Finest são superfluas, apenas mais upgrades e skins novas para armas. \n Clash in Clouds é basicamente 4 arenas com inimigos e objetivos a serem cumpridos. \nAgora Burial At Sea, é muito bão. O jogo se passa em Rapture (Cidade de Bioshock 1) e você é Booker detetive particular em Rapture (pois é). Certo dia uma tal de Elizabeth aparece em seu escritório, pedindo para você encontrar uma menina chamada Sally, aí o baguio fica loco. \n\nMesmo com muita gente dando notas baixas a Bioshock Infinite, acusando-o de estragar a essência da série, eu gostei muito dele.\n\nNOTA FINAL: 9.0/10.0\n\nDLCs: Clash in the Clouds: 8.5/10\n          Columbia's Finest e Early Bird: 7.0/10.0\n          Burial At Sea: 9.5/10.0","timestamp_created":1388361916,"timestamp_updated":1399468553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8412425","author":{"steamid":"76561198066675759","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":670,"last_played":1396193129},"language":"english","review":"Mind-blowingly epic.
