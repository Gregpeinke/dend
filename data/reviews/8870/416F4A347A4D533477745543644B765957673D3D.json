Третья часть известной трилогии, обладающая собственной живой атмосферой и не менее живыми персонажами, а также незаурядным, впечатляющим сюжетом. Невероятно захватывающая, вовлекающая, заставляющая погрузиться в себя с головой, на выходе она оставляет чувство волшебной сказки, которую обязательно захочется перепройти ещё раз, когда основные перепитии сюжета подзабудутся. И дело не только в огромных синих глазах Элизабет, спутницы и помощницы нашего героя, но и в главной идее. Мы это не только Мы. Нас много. Мы все разные. И в то же время похожие. Константы и Переменные.\nТак или иначе, в это надо играть. Прочитав весь сюжет или пересмотрев все летсплеи на ютубе вы никогда не проникнитесь духом и смыслом этой знаковой, думаю даже можно сказать, культовой игры. Да, на наших глазах в мире компьютерных игр появилась новая икона на которую стоит равняться некоторым студиям. Равняться не на  геймплей, который интуитивно понятен ещё со времён первых шутеров, но на персонажей, их характеры, на общую эстетику и компановку каждой составляющей.\nПодытожу: Игра - 10 из 10, глоток новых впечатлений и повод для размышлений вам обеспечены.\n[b]Брать обязательно со всеми дополнениями[/b]","timestamp_created":1466964737,"timestamp_updated":1466964908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23835983","author":{"steamid":"76561198068485041","num_games_owned":311,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":911,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":553,"last_played":1621723107},"language":"english","review":"There are People that say, the first Sequels are always worse because it's just for moneymaking etc, other People say, those are even better, because the Creators learn from Mistakes.

Пока большинство других студий - разработчиков штопают ширпотреб,призванный \"срубить\" очередную гору денег с неискушённого зрителя,Irrational Games создали нечто большее чем просто шутер.

the circle be unbroken听得要醉了，傻白配音唱的版本也超赞哒)，整个游戏的艺术性很高，剧情一开始我有点一头雾水随着游戏的慢慢发展到最后真相浮出水面的时候目瞪口呆一脸懵逼吓得我给了个好评。\n\n    在这里吹一下伊丽莎白这个ai。首先，她给我的感觉就是一个真人，不只是游戏里的一个程序，在关掉游戏以后还会想着她因为她真的是太让人心疼了，海滩上跳舞的那一段真的想就这么一直看着她跳下去。只要伊丽莎白和你一起行动的时候她都会跟着你但却保持一定距离，会对场景做出评价和动作，或者只是倚着墙看着你，她的动作和语气有一种恰到好处的夸张让你感觉她非常有吸引力。战斗中不仅不用保护她她还能给你扔补给让你不会因为太浪而duang的挂掉（当然你要是作死浪那傻白也帮不了你），而且她不会不科学的横穿战场而是自己找掩体绝对不会挡你枪口。别的游戏战斗中同伴往往都是吸引火力用的，但谁要是敢碰伊丽莎白就只能地狱见了。随着剧情看着伊丽莎白逐渐认识到事情的真相与残酷，真的很想隔着屏幕抱抱她，开着飞艇带她去巴黎再也不回头然后happily ever after，可惜现实永远不会这么美好。\n\n    对于画面配乐等等开头也说了，很棒，很美，第一次从风雨中的灯塔升上哥伦比亚的那一刻我真以为到了天堂，整个游戏就是一个艺术品。\n\n    关于剧情，因为担心剧透所以不打算多说，只能说这个剧情真的很神，也很痛心，见证又一个乌托邦的覆灭以及一个女孩人生的悲剧。肯列文又一次把游戏做到了新高度，很感谢。【到贫民窟时看见那把椅子旁边的吉他请去弹一下，伊丽莎白会唱两句歌，感觉真是游戏中最打动我的场景之一了\n\n    要说有什么美中不足就是战斗系统了！为什么我只能带两把枪啊！要说大枪只能带俩就算了，小手枪也只能带俩！左边一手枪右边一手铳背后背个rpg不行吗！不过配合异能打起来还是方便多了就也还不错啦

Beautiful to look at, smooth gameplay, fun, clever AI, no fall damage and even one-click-away-navigational-help for us with orientation difficulties.\n\nThere's a difficulty spike by the end fight though which is unwarranted and makes that fight repetetive and boring rather than challenging and thrilling. There are also some sound issues where the sound completely cuts off unless you stand exactly at the source of it which takes you out of the game a bit. Also very few character models, which makes the whole city of Columbia seems like one big bunch of inbreeds, but perhaps that can be worked into a point with the racism overtones. It can also be frustrating making out where you are being shot from at times.\n\nOverall though, the positives far outweighed the negatives. I particularly enjoy the enviromental narratives, music cues when all the enemies in a wave has been taken care of, Elizabeth as a companion being useful and invulnerable during the ingame fights, though she did block my path at a handful of times for just a short moment, but that's being extremely nitpicky. The enviroments are breathtakingly beautiful many times, and swinging on and from the sky hooks is a blast, just as is using this games versions of plasmids. Voice acting is also great, and I thought it was fun to have female enemies for variation and not only male ones, just like in the previous BioShocks.\n\n*MINOR SPOILERS* I personally had no issues with the ending, but then I usually don't have issues with leaving some things to be interpreted and/or left unsaid, though I can see why people like their endings neatly wrapped up. *SPOILERS END*","timestamp_created":1466888691,"timestamp_updated":1466976823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506946086883544922","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23804523","author":{"steamid":"76561198040430811","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":624,"last_played":1466885839},"language":"danish","review":"Best fking game ever","timestamp_created":1466887465,"timestamp_updated":1466887465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23803566","author":{"steamid":"76561198193776179","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":5275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2567,"last_played":1491331806},"language":"brazilian","review":"Excelente jogo!!!","timestamp_created":1466885423,"timestamp_updated":1466885423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23802861","author":{"steamid":"76561198120861408","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4717,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3532,"last_played":1484975619},"language":"english","review":"FANTASTIC storyline, characters, lore, and atmosphere immersion!
