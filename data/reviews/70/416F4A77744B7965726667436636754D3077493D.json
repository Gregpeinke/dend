People hate On a Rail but at least that chapter is fair and doesn't feel like endless horrible platforming and shooting without any ammo. Everything fun about the game goes out the window in this chapter, and the final boss is just boring. Overall though, highly reccommend, holds up really well.

I played a lot of the old \"2.5D\" Shooters back in their day, like the Dooms, Heretic, Hexen, Duke Nukem 3D, and Blood.  I'd even played at least one fully 3D Shooter by then, because I was [b]completely[/b] obsessed with Turok: Dinosaur Hunter in 1997, before Half-Life even came out.  Not that it has any place in a recommendation for someone just looking to get into a game, but nostalgia isn't a factor here, either; while I had at least one friend back in the day who WOULD NOT SHUT-UP about Half-Life, I was never interested enough to play it back then, and didn't get around to it until this year: 2021.  This is supposed to be one of the most influential and revolutionary games in its genre, and I thought, \"Alright; I can put myself back in 1998.  I'm totally disinterested in that upcoming Dreamcast thing, that weird 'Pocket Monsters' thing I read about a while ago is really starting to pick up some steam, and I'd finally gotten deep into that Final Fantasy 7 thing I'd wanted to play since I'd found out that my beloved 1, 2, and 3 were actually 1, 4, and 6.  Not the best days of my life, but moderately interesting times for video games, at least.\"\n\nWell, boy, am I glad to be back; I don't miss this era of Shooters AT ALL.  Half-Life throws a lot of cardinal sins of the genre at you: weird ladder controls, lots of platforming sections, tiny ledges, \"gotcha\" moments such as the floor (looking like any other) falls out from underneath you, long underwater sections with limited oxygen, AN ENTIRE MINE CART [b]CHAPTER[/b], and when that all isn't enough, they start throwing clusters of these at you simultaneously while you're being harassed by an attack helicopter.  It's also from that early 3D era, where you're not sure if borking the momentum algorithm to get onto that weird ledge was a glitch win or the intended route.  Beyond even that, this game is extremely buggy; I'd sometimes be going through a pipe and when the next area loaded, I'd be in the pipe, but spawned slightly off the ground, so I couldn't move and had to reload an old save, and this happened quite a few times.  Thankfully, this is old enough that quicksave was still a thing, because you'll be needing it, not always through any fault of your own.  Equally thankfully, this is new enough that mouselook also existed; horrid as I found the level design to be, the actual controls were pretty good.  You can look around, run, swim, and even jump relatively smoothly; I would've liked a way to zoom in while shooting with more than just one weapon, and the ability to make [i]walk[/i] the default instead of being stuck on autorun the whole game, but that might speak to my being spoiled a bit by modern convenience.  The weapons could've used a little more balance, too - a lot of guns are so useful that I'm always hurting for ammo, or so useless that their main use is wasting ammo until you can reload something better - but that wasn't bad, either; the shooting part of this Shooter was just fine.\n\nBut Mooooooom, it's all about the story!  Well, admittedly, the plot doesn't mess around; you get RIGHT into it pretty early in the game.  I was pleasantly shocked at how quickly things escalated, and then... nothing.  There was one minor twist in the middle that was very believable and well-executed - a lot of newer writing throws them at you like crazy in an attempt to mask the fact that the underlying narrative isn't all that interesting, and then just leaves them hang - but there was almost no plot other than \"go here; do this\" until the end of the game after that.  The NPCs are also often lauded as revolutionary, but the most you'll ever get out of them is very poor cover fire (they even act all triumphant when taking credit for monsters that [i]you[/i] killed) or acting as keys made of meat.  Visually, it's a lot of gray underground tunnels, which fits the scenario, but is still boring to look at; things get pretty interesting toward the end, but that's not the majority of the game.  The character models are... well, it's 1998; they're going to look a little blocky, but these are pretty good from what I remember of that era.  The sound design is mostly fine; the audio is programmed in such a way that you should be able to tell where an enemy is by where the sound is coming from, and it's [i]usually[/i] close.  There's almost no music, and I know that's supposed to be atmospheric and immersive; it wasn't for me, but it wasn't a dealbreaker, either, and when you did have music, it was usually pretty good, even if it'd stop before it should.\n\nHalf-Life does some interesting things, and there are some pretty neat moments, but for what it puts you through, it just isn't enough of a payoff.  If you're looking to get into the series, I'd recommend just watching someone else play through it.  Or don't; I've just started Half-Life 2, and even though I'm not that far, the game has done a great job of telling me everything I needed to know about the first game.","timestamp_created":1616546306,"timestamp_updated":1616546306,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496523261070251465","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88972844","author":{"steamid":"76561198121910031","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1493,"last_played":1616585361},"language":"english","review":"its half-life.....so yea you should buy and play it","timestamp_created":1616543023,"timestamp_updated":1616543023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88972658","author":{"steamid":"76561198069426940","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25424,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24362,"last_played":1617749647},"language":"turkish","review":"Multiplayer Hile kaynıyor artık eskisi gibi değil Yeni Nesil batırdı Eskiden İyiydi be ne Hile vardı Ne Hurda","timestamp_created":1616542744,"timestamp_updated":1616542744,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493128538131713867","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88971287","author":{"steamid":"76561198386952974","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":775,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":556,"last_played":1616553899},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo épico , pra quem realmente gosto de jogo  e não se importa com gráfico igual a nova geração nutela da merda do fertinate ou aquela bosta de jogo mani craft ..... \nem fim recomendo o jogo %","timestamp_created":1616540655,"timestamp_updated":1616540655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88969646","author":{"steamid":"76561199084758652","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":1065,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1040,"last_played":1649810825},"language":"spanish","review":"Ta weno.","timestamp_created":1616538094,"timestamp_updated":1635699946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88966857","author":{"steamid":"76561199094795166","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":584,"last_played":1658077382},"language":"english","review":"great game worth the money","timestamp_created":1616534106,"timestamp_updated":1616534106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88961732","author":{"steamid":"76561199062751255","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":284,"last_played":1640979469},"language":"turkish","review":"Old But Gold","timestamp_created":1616527653,"timestamp_updated":1616527653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88960574","author":{"steamid":"76561198141204680","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":54,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54,"last_played":1454103892},"language":"english","review":"do you","timestamp_created":1616526212,"timestamp_updated":1616526212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88960254","author":{"steamid":"76561198014058518","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":611,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":607,"last_played":1660489461},"language":"russian","review":"    Гордон Фримен во плоти, или, вернее сказать, в защитном костюме.
