Она рассказывает историю о наших недругах в оригинальной игре, а именно о Адриане Шепарде которому на момент игры 22 года. Который вступил в ХЕКУ ( Hazardous Environment Combat Unit — дословно «Боевое подразделение для действий в опасных условиях окружающей среды» ).\nДля меня она вызвало... Удивление что в Халф Лайфе 1 можно поиграть за недруга, который пытается убить Фримена...\nЗабавные факты о Адриане:   (статья из вики)\n1. Геймдизайнер Рэнди Питчфорд хотел, чтобы фамилия Адриана была двусложной и несла в себе дословное значение — так же, как и фамилия главного героя оригинальной Half-Life, Гордона Фримена. Рэнди понравилось слово shepard, когда они со своим коллегой обсуждали фильм «Криминальное чтиво», где персонаж Джулс Уиннфилд приводит библейскую цитату о пастыре[3] (shepard является неправильным написанием английского слова shepherd — «пастырь», «пастух»)[4]. Он решил добавить в середину слова букву «H», поскольку она придавала ему уникальное написание и образовывала во втором слоге слово hard (англ. hard — «крепкий», «жёсткий»)\n2. В игре F.E.A.R. по радио можно услышать несколько сообщений от А. Шепарда, координатора спецназа группы «Дельта».\nИ самый любимый:\n3. В 2007 году компания Valve выпустила игру Portal, действие которой происходит во вселенной серии Half-Life. До её релиза многие игроки заметили, что сокращённое название портальной пушки из этой игры — ASHPD (от Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device) — напоминает аббревиатуру от имени Адриана Шепарда (англ. Adrian Shepard). Имели место слухи, что такое сходство неслучайно, однако разработчики назвали его просто совпадением, которому они и сами удивились. Однако это натолкнуло их на идею внести в игру пасхальное яйцо: на встречающихся в игре клавиатурах цветом выделено несколько клавиш, образующих имя Адриана Шепарда.\nВ игре я не заметил баги...

It's expansion, Opposing Force, unfortunately has these exact same flaws so it's disappointing nothing was improved upon here. The first problem is that there are several sections where the difficult spikes to an insane degree, placing you in rooms with no escape surrounded by way too many enemies, many of whom are complete bullet sponges that only serve to eat up your ammo. There were several points in the game that were just exhausting to play through, as I was constantly save scumming and searching every nook and cranny desperately for just one measly med pack. Another problem in this game, like the previous entry, is that the level design can get quite confusing at times and forces you to backtrack fairly often. This is made even worse in this game by the fact that in certain sections you have a squad that you must direct through the hallways and corridors in order to advance to the next section. I'll just say that the path-finding AI was still very primitive for it's time and these sections probably should have been skipped all together. By far the worst flaw however is the fucking platforming. My god has the platforming not aged well with these games at all. There is no weight to your character and you feel like you're floating on a pocket of air or sliding on ice pretty much the whole game. Sounds like the perfect physics system to include platforming doesn't it? I was almost driven to tears in the original Half Life due to platforming bullshit rearing its ugly head in the final boss fight. Thankfully, the final boss in this game is not nearly as hair pulling, but there are still several ugly sections that require death after death until you nail the jump just right.\n\nNow to what I enjoyed. The combat in this game is still top notch and the tension is incredibly high. There are no slow moments in this game and no chance to breathe, it's an action packed thrill ride from start to finish. I'm not sure if this is one of the first games to do the multiple perspectives on an event thing (I know Resident Evil 2 did this a year earlier), but it does it well and you really feel like complete hell and chaos is happening around you through radio broadcasts and several in game cut-scenes. The game itself starts about one hour or so before the end of the original Half Life and greatly expands on the lore of the world, adding many new weapons and enemies to keep the experience fresh. Only real complaint about the story I can come up with is that I thought the build up to the final boss was quite weak. In the original you go through a ton of shit to finally get to the creature who opened the portal in the first place and it's built up as this huge powerful entity that isn't to be fucked with. In this game you just suddenly find yourself in an ammo supply room and are told \"something big is coming\". It felt pretty underwhelming.\n\nOverall it was a pretty positive experience with the same flaws as the original game. I definitely enjoyed my time with it and look forward to the next expansion, Blue Shift, to finish out the trilogy","timestamp_created":1551924938,"timestamp_updated":1551924938,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569552421569824219","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49404431","author":{"steamid":"76561197991045872","num_games_owned":750,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":74,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":74,"last_played":1544827066},"language":"english","review":"Good game.","timestamp_created":1551924202,"timestamp_updated":1638339670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49397452","author":{"steamid":"76561198871570498","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":435,"last_played":1544535988},"language":"russian","review":"В детстве ссался от радости при виде этой зеленой стилистики, наличия пулемета и винтовки казалось бы в обычной Халф-Лайф.\nМне казалось тогда, что эта игра как халф-лайф, но только круче.","timestamp_created":1551888412,"timestamp_updated":1551888412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49367817","author":{"steamid":"76561198080719916","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":284,"last_played":1658046290},"language":"english","review":"Y O U\nF U C K E D\nU P\nM Y\nF A C E . *BANG*\n","timestamp_created":1551772632,"timestamp_updated":1551772632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49328997","author":{"steamid":"76561198036806580","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":531,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":531,"last_played":1623714695},"language":"english","review":"The best Expansion of the HL series. \nGreat weapons\nChallenging new enemies\nAwesome addition to the lore\nand has a great amount of length for the price.\n10/10","timestamp_created":1551589636,"timestamp_updated":1551589636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49290323","author":{"steamid":"76561197984525567","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":2084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":716,"last_played":1551557500},"language":"english","review":"A very good game that expands on half-life's lore. you play as Shepard, a Soilder sent in to check out Black mesa for an unknown reason. soon Aliens shoot you down, and you're left to pick up the mess that Gordon left on earth well he was in Zen, Well the G-Man guides you from behind the scenes. \n\nThe game is a lot of fun, and and adds a ton of new weapons. and expands on the buddy system that the first two games had.

Balance hard mode. I have no idea who thought that was balance in any way where enemies not only do more damage but guns your guns do very less to the point where you might as well suicide and make death more quick. I thought they should just make the enemies do more damage and that's it, making the guns you have still worth something in the last remaining levels.\n\n2. Crosshair. I can barely see it at all, to where I start wondering if your even aiming or not. When the night vision is on I might as well just shoot with a blind fold on cause I can't see sh/t.\n\n3. Night vision. I think the next time night vision comes by, it should never be this bright green to the point where my eyes was going to sue my brain of making them look at bright lights that hurt. Please make sure you don't ever do what this game dose with it's night vision where is hurts when you need it to see in the bloody dark.\n\n( Now for the good parts of this game )\n\nOkay when I bought this I didn't want to play freeman cause everyone know about him already. I wanted to play someone in Half Life that is not freeman and that's what I got. \n\nFirst if you've played Half Life already then there's no point of explaining game play, so instead I like to tell how I felt in the game with shepherd the character you play as. Cause the same feeling in the first Half Life playing as freeman you will feel the same for what shepherd is feeling and thinking, that makes Half life so very good in story telling of the character you play as. You don't even need to hear them talk to know how they feel and that is just so good on allowing you to know the character with no words. Anyways here is how I felt playing as shepherd and what he was thinking in my view.\n\n(Shepherd) Our mission was very vague of what we were here for. It seem like any other mission at first. My squad won't shut up about what they were hoping this mission was. Idiots and that's why I like them. They were idiots but they were ready to take on anything. But not this. Someone is responsible for my men now being dead. They sent us out to find a man named freeman. Is he responsible for this cr/p?! And if not, then who is? I'm going to find out one way or another, and they will answer for my squad genocide.","timestamp_created":1550534559,"timestamp_updated":1550534628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.463917523622512817","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49071838","author":{"steamid":"76561198445652482","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":417,"last_played":1655519979},"language":"english","review":"A very good and very fun expansion pack for Half Life.

First of all, I had this mouse problem, but it was no big deal, five minutes later it is solved. I had no more real game-breaking issues and was happy at the variety of aliens, enemies, and I even managed to beat the final boss! But something that lets the game down is the lack of people in multiplayer servers. The servers do not even add bots, which is upsetting, so you really are forced to A. get the bots, B. play on your own until a server does eventually get popular, or C. which is messing about in offline. Just remember that I don't have the bots and it is even worse for me. However the game has a good variety of problems and puzzles which makes it more rewarding to keep your team in one piece. I always do have do say like I did during my play through the first time round, where is a medic when you need them? Luckily the Scientists can heal Adrian as well. Also there are Easter eggs, and I know quite a few myself, but I recommend doing this \"egg hunt\" when you finish the game. Also there is a really unexpected map in this expansion and so old friends of Gordon are met, and no, the grunts aren't friendly, only OPFOR grunts are friendly, the HL1 grunts are not as nice ,and if not fighting anyone else before you, would shoot you on sight. I hoped you liked my review. Also, fun fact I beat the game in under a day! Shows how short it is and I am still just waiting for Opposing Force 2, are you?\n\nP.S.

With an Laser Sight and fires slightly more faster than the Revolver .\n\nAnd the Sniper Rifle replaces the Crossbow and the Hive hand is replaced by the more useful Shock roach along with Tau Cannon and Gluon gun not appearing but replaced by the more deadly and powerful Displacer Cannon, which is this Expansion's BFG...\n\nYou also fight new enemies in this Expansion with Black Ops Assassins replacing the HECU Grunts from HL1 & Blue Shift since you're playing as an HECU Grunt. And the X-Race who are the toughest enemies who you will fight, and a new Headcrab Zombie known as the Gonomes who are tougher than regular zombies who can throw their guts at you as their ranged attack.\n\nAlong with new Allies such as some HECU Buddies such as the Engineer who can open welded doors and the Combat Medic who is a Portable Healing Station along with some HECU Grunts wielding an M249 SAW ( One of the new weapons that you can use. ) and a new Black Mesa Fat Security guard known as Otis who uses an Desert Eagle instead of an 9mm Pistol.\n\nLong Story short, you're playing as an HECU Grunt to clean up the Black Mesa incident, and things don't go to well and you're forced to fight the Black Ops and you have encountered a new Alien Race known as Race-X but you encounter your HECU Buddies and knowing that they are left behind and forced to fight the Black Ops and the Xen Aliens along with the after mentioned Race-X, you will find a lot of action in this Expansion Pack with some intense action in some chapters. But i'm leaving the important bits out of here.\n\nI have one complain though. Compared to the CD Retail version, the Menu Screen is less cooler compared to the Animated Title with Soldiers marching in the Opposing Force Title with Helicopters flying and Tanks moving to the Right.\nWhat we got is Adrian Shepard and Gordon Freeman holding Flags for the CTF Mode which i don't play ( Since play Half-Life mostly for it's Single Player Campaigns. )\n\nHowever that doesn't hurt what this Expansion Pack brings into Half-Life 1 for it's content. You got New Weapons to play with, New Enemies and Aliens to fight along with new Allies that will help you and a enjoyable single-player Campaign...\n\nAlso this Expansion pack introduces Rope Climbing which wasn't used in future Half-Life games or any other games made by Valve or Gearbox software... And also a Barnacle that you can use as an Weapon which is Opposing force's grappling

Jest to dosyć trudny dodatek, jest o wiele więcej trudnych przeciwników niż w Half-life 1. Mimo to gra jest niezwykle ciekawa. Fajnie jest się wcielić w żołnierza, który ma za zadanie wymordować wszystie złe stworzenia oraz wszystkich powiązanych naukowców, ochroniarzy z wydarzeniem kaskady rezonansowej, chociaż Adrian Shephard nie zawsze ich zabija. Moim zdaniem ten dodatek jest o wiele lepszy od Blue Shift'a, ale nieco słabszy od zwykłego Half-life 1. Serdecznie polecam tą grę.","timestamp_created":1549829168,"timestamp_updated":1589711759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48910369","author":{"steamid":"76561198410890923","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":12,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1549776693},"language":"latam","review":"Una buena expanción de Half-Life, no es nada del otro mundo pero si que es entretenida, nos da a conocer un punto de vista totalmente distinto al de Gordon Freeman, lo único malo es que no esta en español y me sorprende que no lo este, lo tuve que descargar desde Internet para poder jugarlo en mi idioma, solo es un problema no poder jugarlo en mi idioma, de ahí en mas todo esta bien","timestamp_created":1549828613,"timestamp_updated":1549828613,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48895605","author":{"steamid":"76561198253250429","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1550740546},"language":"schinese","review":"为什么我镜头移不过去而且出第一个门就闪退啊。。有点烦","timestamp_created":1549790664,"timestamp_updated":1549790664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.628378391265869141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48892510","author":{"steamid":"76561198417589473","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":72,"last_played":1601312142},"language":"english","review":"Pure classics.\nThe puzzles sometimes looks more interesting than original one.","timestamp_created":1549780119,"timestamp_updated":1549780119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48892459","author":{"steamid":"76561198400059230","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29,"last_played":1654712188},"language":"english","review":"Good game","timestamp_created":1549779944,"timestamp_updated":1633935065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.461271196603775024","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48887476","author":{"steamid":"76561198851340775","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":129,"last_played":1632019234},"language":"english","review":"Fairly good game, don't buy if your attention span is less tha- HOW LONG UNTIL I FUCKING LEAVE THIS GODDAMN PLACE","timestamp_created":1549759903,"timestamp_updated":1549759903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48876638","author":{"steamid":"76561198098583982","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1501883016},"language":"spanish","review":"COMPRE UNPAQUETE DE HALF LIFE ME VINO EL OPPOSING FORFCE PERO EN INGLES YA ESTA EN ESPAÑOL?","timestamp_created":1549728740,"timestamp_updated":1549728740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48867201","author":{"steamid":"76561198218232059","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":167,"playtime_forever":198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":105,"last_played":1546800717},"language":"turkish","review":"Serinin ikinci oyunu.
