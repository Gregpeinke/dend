While it looked great and the game was very easy to get into it never really grabbed my attention until around 1/3 of the way through when the story starts to look at Elizabeth and Booker’s backgrounds which piqued my interest. The gunplay isn’t that original but fun regardless and helped along the way by the special abilities granted by the Vigors. The biggest draw is definitely the storyline and characters and while the gameplay wasn’t amazing it was solid enough to go hand in hand with the excellent story. What an ending as well.

I am still the good guy... \n\nThis game was quite an interesting go on parallel universes. I have to admit I did not fully understand every thing but I think I got the big picture. \n\nOne of the interesting parts for me was the ego view, in which your character still talks. you don't get much of a say in it.\nYou may do some minor decisions, but still I don't think anything really changes, no matter what you do.\n\nAfter a while the battles got a little boring for me... you either are slaughtering them all in the numbers... or you are a two shot for the bigger ones. But that may be the case, because I played on the highest difficulty. Some enemies, like the \"Handyman\" are quite frustrating in the case, that even their weakspot takes more ammo than you can carry around. And if you die ones they get healed by even more. \n\nYet it stayed challenging and the enemies make the game really atmospheric. \n\nI won't compare it to the other parts, because for me the charm of Bioshock 1 & 2 was the dark, theme, everything was in some tight spot and there was no airway to the destination, while in Bioshpock infinite everything was way more open and you felt more free overall.\n\nLast to be said I really missed the Big Daddies, but the one thing that tends to satisfy me more on this game is that you finally are meeting people, instead of talking to them over the radio.\n\nTook 12 hours for the main campaign, I will play the DLCs next and refer to them in an extra review.","timestamp_created":1462715536,"timestamp_updated":1462715536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536929190158843994","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22861717","author":{"steamid":"76561198155935575","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":599,"last_played":1475600984},"language":"english","review":"stunning game, \nold but gold","timestamp_created":1462708336,"timestamp_updated":1462708336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506194651126861572","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22861497","author":{"steamid":"76561197995360601","num_games_owned":937,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":1530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1530,"last_played":1461765865},"language":"russian","review":"ХВАТИТ ,,, МЕНЯ ,,, ПОСТОЯННО ,,, УБИВАТЬ!","timestamp_created":1462707386,"timestamp_updated":1462707386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22861096","author":{"steamid":"76561198253443891","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1227,"last_played":1462985733},"language":"polish","review":"Wciągająca fabuła, niesamowita Elizabeth i piękne podniebne miasto Kolumbia.

can't believe I waited so long to play this utterly fantastic game.\n\nThe graphics are specatular, the sound is wonderful, the world is (like Bioshock 1) fully fleshed-out and immersive.  The vigors and gunplay is entertaining and challenging.  The story is a \"page turner\", with believable characters, excellent voice acting, and an ending that doesn't fall flat like so many other video games.  \n\nSome people have remarked that this game is too hard.  I tried it on \"hard\", first, and found I couldn't make it past about the 2/3rds mark without sigificant deaths.  I then restarted, kept it on \"hard,\" and completed the game finding it to be pleasantly challenging, but not \"hard.\"  The secret for me was to focus my upgrades into a few vigors and guns I found complementary my playstyle (possession, crows, and later bronco; for guns, carbine, shotgun, rpg, and later, hand cannon and machine gun), as opposed to spreading the cash around too thinly, too early.  Regular use of vigors and appropriate management of clothing perks also helps, especially the invulnerability on/off of skylines.  With this approach, I died only 3 times in the whole \"hard\" playthrough.\n\nI think this is now on my short list for possible G.O.A.T.","timestamp_created":1462566542,"timestamp_updated":1462566542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22831877","author":{"steamid":"76561198047998526","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1568,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":927,"last_played":1463224422},"language":"english","review":"This game is a disappointment in comparison to the previous ones.  If you play mainly for the combat, that might be alright, but there's a few things to note.  The game has no manual save; it just uses \"checkpoints\" and a resurrection system where you lose stuff.  Which is very annoying unless you're so good you never lose, or into frustration and tedium.  It has its supporters but there's nothign FORCING you to use a manual save if it's there, and there could be a trophy for completion entirely using checkpoints, if you're in to that sort of thing.\n\nAlso, you can only carry two weapons at a time.  More realistic perhaps, although some of the heavier ones probably weigh more than two light ones, and you have a completely separate ammo budget for each one.  And if you're going for a bit of realism, you'd have to lose the skylines with their seventy-foot leaps and drops altogether.\n\nThe plot roars along for a while, but at the end it deteriorates rapidly into a mystic muddle rather like a certain Mass Effect game I might mention, utterly unlike the exemplary plotting of Bioshock one and two.\n\nSo I would say the game is diverting, but not worth it at this price.

I cannot express with words how I feel towards this game. This game is the best example of video games as an art form, and I could not pick a better contender if I tried. I could have said any of the Galactic Cafe games, or a Souls game, but this game has lots of engaging gameplay unlike walking simulators. This game has more of a storyt than just tatters of a story strung together by vague dialogue and item descriptions like Dark Souls. This game... it's in a league of it's own. It's in a league occupied solely by Bioshock Infinte.\n\nBioshock Infinite, like its predecessors, is a FPS developed by Irrational Games. It is about a distopian theocracy where the main character is sent to retrieve a young girl by the name of Elizabeth. A lot of unimportant stuff happens, you get targeted by the police force, everyone's attacking you for a while, yadda, yadda. And then you actually meet the other half of the focal point of this game: Elizabath. I'm going to skip the rest of the plot beacause you really, REALLY need to experience the rest of the plot for yourself. All I can tell you is that the story alone is worth the price of admission. Every character has motivations, goals, personalities, social ties, morals, philosophies, purpose. The characters are amazingly fleshed out to the point of feeling real. And trust me, you'll soon wish they were.\n\nThe graphics and music in this game are absolutely marvellous. I (finally) finished the original Bioshock recently, and noticed that, compared to Infinte, which I had played before, Bioshock had a very drab and uninteresting enviroment. With pile of rubble here or there, smeared blood every five feet, whether it be on the walls, floor, ceiling, glass, table, Steve from accounting, you name it. The colors are very dark and often blend together. Both games look stylized, but the difference was that the palettes of Infinte are much brighter, and (most) areas are in sunlight and not ruined. While I still really liked Bioshock above many other games I've played, the enviroment's coloring dragged its quality down for me a lot. But this isn't a review of Bioshock, now is it? The music compliments the enviroments beautifly, and while they reuse certain 'battle music' all the time during gameply, you will probably regard it more as an enemy signal than background music.\n\nAnd now, for the gameplay. Frankly, I think this is the weakest part of the game. It's still a solid part of the game, but it gets overshadowed by a mile by its other components. I think this is the part of the game that I liked the original Bioshock for better. You can only hold two weapons at a time, and my god are there weapons. I think there are something like 15 or 16 weapons in this game, and you can only carry two. Sure, it makes more sense, but in the original Bioshock (I swear, I'll stop referencing Bioshock now) you carried a wrench, a pistol, a tommy gun, a shotgun, a grenade luancher, a camera, a flame/liquid nitrogen/electric-ooze-stuffthrower, a crossbow, AND THE AMMO FOR ALL OF THAT. I just find it wierd that they limit you to two when you have the oppurtunity to add WAY more guns to the players arsenal. The enemy AI is usually ok, leaning on the side of stupid rather than advanced. That said, even on normal, they can seriously pack a punch. This game isn't frustrating, but it is certainly hard. I'm a veteran gamer through and through, but even I died a good amount in this game. There are definetly parts that I might not have been able to get through without exploiting a few vigors and guns. Oh yeah, plasmids are still a thing, only they're called vigors now. I thought some of them are cool, but a majority of them feel useless. Also, Elizabeth helps you during battle. She isn't a liabilty, because she always seem to find cover and doesn't thow herself into enemy fire like some \"companions\" in other games. She throws you ammo, health, and salts (EVE). Like I said, gameplay's the weakest link of a adamantium chain.\n\n10/10\nAbsolutely my favorite game to date. The story is gripping, the characters feel real, and the ending will blow your mind. The enviroments are beautiful and vibrant, the music is fantastic and compliments the enviroments and story events. The gameplay is plentiful, engaging and challenging. This game certainly has flaws, but you probably won't notice as you are experiencing the game. Notice how I didn't say 'play'. \n\nI know this review will be lost under the pile of words, pictures and sounds that is the internet, but all I can ask for is that this game isn't.","timestamp_created":1462164563,"timestamp_updated":1462165062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22755842","author":{"steamid":"76561198150495876","num_games_owned":314,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":596,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":527,"last_played":1467400128},"language":"russian","review":"норм","timestamp_created":1462163051,"timestamp_updated":1462163051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629742980003356934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22754594","author":{"steamid":"76561198190354783","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":267,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":193,"last_played":1541896685},"language":"brazilian","review":"Otimoooo","timestamp_created":1462154707,"timestamp_updated":1462154707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22753719","author":{"steamid":"76561198051884799","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":700,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":700,"last_played":1460915694},"language":"english","review":"One of, if not hands down the best game I've ever played.

Eso es lo que se te viene a la mente al finalizar un juego como el que nos ocupa. Y es que, ya desde su primera entrega, la saga Bioshock supo ofrecer una experiencia que iba más allá de lo que normalmente estamos acostumbrados a encontrar en un videojuego, acercándose en mayor medida a otros medios de expresión como el cine. No obstante, las dos primeras entregas (recordemos que la segunda no fue desarrollada por Irrational Games, la desarrolladora original) seguían en gran medida atadas al \"gameplay\" y las mecánicas tradicionalmente necesarias en un videojuego. Es con esta tercera entrega cuando, a pesar de aún no haber sido capaz de superar este conflicto, Bioshock hace de la narración de los acontecimientos el eje central de su desarrollo, acercando la saga en mayor medida a lo que nos ofrece el séptimo arte.\n\nAl mismo tiempo que evoluciona en el aspecto narrativo, también Infinite lo hace en cuanto a la localización donde ésta acontece, pasando de la ciudad sumergida de Rapture de las dos primeras entregas a la ciudad sobre las nubes de Columbia. La fórmula anterior ya había sido exprimida y por ello ahora una nueva localización permite la creación de un nuevo mundo que, sin embargo, permanece siendo regido por reglas y personajes similares. La base reconocible de Bioshock queda intacta, conservándose la utopía, el abuso de poder y los conflictos morales, pero mostrándose en un nuevo escenario que añade lo necesario para que en absoluto pensemos estar repitiendo experiencias pasadas. De hecho, y es de agradecer en una industria que tiende en demasía a la repetición, Infinite parece un juego totalmente distinto que, sin embargo, no pierde las señas de identidad de la saga.\n\nComo se ha comentado, la narrativa alcanza un nuevo nivel con Infinite, gracias en gran medida a la inclusión de un personaje clave en el desarrollo de la misma: Elizabeth. Este nuevo personaje nos acompañará durante la mayor parte de la aventura y, más allá de su utilidad dentro de la jugabilidad, constituye el verdadero motivo guía de la narración. Todo gira en torno a ella y, por ende, en torno a nosotros como sus protectores, incrementando hasta el extremo nuestra empatía hacia ella y, como consecuencia, también hacia lo que se nos está contando, logrando un mayor grado de implicación jugador-videojuego que en las anteriores entregas o, incluso, que en otros videojuegos. Aunque la ciudad como ente vivo sigue siendo importante, no lo es al nivel de Bioshock 1 y 2 y ahora se profundiza más en nuestra relación con terceras personas, en la toma de conciencia de la importancia e influencia de nuestros actos para con ellas y en la moralidad de los mismos.\n\nEn cuanto a la trama en sí misma, no pretendo bajo ningún concepto estropear a base de \"spoilers\" el disfrute de semejante esfuerzo narrativo y, por tanto, sólo no puedo dejar de mencionar el apoteósico final que nos espera al terminar Bioshock Infinite y por el que merece la pena no abandonar el juego en sus fases tempranas en el caso de que no sea de vuestro agrado (si es que algo así es posible).\n\nA pesar de todo y como ya apuntaba al principio, el punto desgraciadamente más conflictivo de Infinite es que aún sigue atado a las cadenas del \"gameplay\". Soy consciente de que sigue siendo un videojuego y en ningún caso preferiría verlo convertido en un \"walking simulator\", una novela interactiva o algo similar, pero creo que no debo ser el único que, en cierta forma y en determinados momentos, vea que dicho \"gameplay\" llega a tornarse innecesario y convertirse en un lastre para la narración. No conozco la fórmula para solventar este problema, pero es algo decepcionante asistir a momentos trascendentales e impactantes que irremediablemente se ven salpicados por los requerimientos de una burda jugabilidad de \"shooter\". El final te deja maravillado, pero con la sensación de que algo ha fallado en alguna parte.\n\nLos gráficos y la dirección artística son difícilmente mejorables y muy posiblemente soporten bien el paso del tiempo. Esta vez, al contrario que ocurría con la lúgubre ambientación de las dos entregas anteriores, Columbia se muestra como una ciudad llena de luz y color que enmascara la corrupción oculta en sus entrañas. También ahora se utiliza, frente al Art Decó de los originales, un estilo arquitectónico neoclásico que magnifica e ilumina los espacios desde una monumentalidad que busca empequeñecer al jugador en su relación con la ciudad como utopía que controla y vigila las vidas de sus ciudadanos. Y para concluir con los aspectos puramente gráficos o de diseño, esta monumentalidad en los escenarios se ve apoyada por la solidez de sus modelados y que también está presente en los de los personajes y objetos, además de haberse logrado de igual manera en los efectos gráficos y texturas.\n\nLa banda sonora tampoco se queda atrás en cuanto a ambientación, haciendo esta vez que determinadas composiciones formen parte de la narrativa e incluso de la jugabilidad. Dada esta situación, tampoco en esta ocasión conviene extenderse en su análisis para no estropear la experiencia de su integración en el \"gameplay\", pero sí puede decirse que composiciones clásicas, de la época y modernas se unen para crear estímulos puntuales que al final, en su conjunto, dan mayor sentido a los acontecimientos generales. También los efectos de sonido y las voces en v.o. cumplen de sobra dada su calidad y contribuyen a enfatizar la experiencia cinematográfica.\n\nPor último, la jugabilidad, siendo uno de los aspectos que personalmente considero más controvertidos en Infinite, lo cierto es que ha sufrido un notable esfuerzo de adaptación al nuevo ritmo narrativo que en esta ocasión ha adoptado la saga. Pudiera decirse que, en los modos disponibles en un inicio, todo es más básico y fácil que en las dos entregas anteriores puesto que apenas hay penalización por morir, el sistema de recuperación de vida es más \"amigable\" y la reorganización y replanteamiento del sistema de poderes y armamento facilita en mucho nuestro avance. No obstante, todos estos cambios se entienden cuando, como ya se ha comentado en repetidas ocasiones, nos damos cuenta de que han sido reenfocados en virtud de la agilización de la narración. También en relación con esto, tal vez uno de los mayores aciertos de Infinite ha sido la inclusión de Elizabeth como personaje de apoyo pero del que únicamente deberemos preocuparnos en cuanto a su devenir narrativo, no al jugable. Se elimina así la tan tediosa y hasta aburrida y estresante labor de protección de personajes secundarios tan común en otros videojuegos hasta la fecha. Elizabeth es autosuficiente, nos ayuda dentro de sus posibilidades y no tenemos que hacer nada por ella excepto adentrarnos en su mundo y en su historia.\n\nLlegados a este punto no voy a repetir el porqué de que el gameplay llegue a parecerme algo casi irrelevante en esta entrega, pero, si nos olvidamos de ello, lo cierto es que como \"shooter\" cumple perfectamente y es entretenido, pero, sin saber qué otra cosa pudiera ser, no es lo que un juego como Infinite pide ser para poder desplegarse en todo su esplendor.\n\nPara concluir, tal vez en un videojuego de tal calibre argumental hubiera de haberse hecho un análisis más enfocado hacia la narrativa, pero es tal la experiencia de descubrirlo por uno mismo que he creído mejor no hacer prácticamente mención al respecto. Bioshock Infinite ha sabido evolucionar desde sus inicios para, conservando la personalidad que hizo exitosas a sus anteriores entregas, ofrecer una experiencia totalmente nueva y que difícilmente puede olvidarse. Por obras como esta merece la pena (iba a decir jugar) experimentar las sensaciones que puede llegar a provocarnos un videojuego.","timestamp_created":1462057241,"timestamp_updated":1462792412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614703476428985596","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22731377","author":{"steamid":"76561198177387739","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":514,"last_played":1520172672},"language":"english","review":"This was an awesome game!

I found the main game to be more fun then the DLC followed by Under the Sea Episode 1, with Episode 2 bringing up the rear in terms of fun for me.   I like to play these games on Easy or Normal settings to enjoy the setting and story, with a bit less worry about dying and redoing sections.  I enjoy clearing sections of the attackers, then spending time looking around.  The movement of people, birds, the conversations that go on around you really add depth to the world.  The games are fairly linear, but the main game feels open none the less.   The linear nature, and a helpful navigational aid, means you won't likely get very lost.  This was a plus for me. \n\nThe DLC felt more linear.  Episode 2 was a bit less enjoyable for me as I felt the \"stealth\" mechanics meant a lot more running (crouching actually) through and area and moving along quickly, without as much time to just look at the scenary (with the exception of the opening sequence).   Still they were fun to play with the links to the prior games. \n\nOverall a fairly lengthy game, with added gameplay for those who what to track down all the bonus records, films, achievements throughout.

I'd recommend it to anyone who liked the gameplay of dishonoured and the story and plot twists of movies like inception, shutter island and basically any movie that screws with your head.","timestamp_created":1461977155,"timestamp_updated":1461977155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22713594","author":{"steamid":"76561198086874038","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":937,"last_played":1595616182},"language":"english","review":"I don't think I can handle how amazing this game was. \nThe Ending is just WOW!","timestamp_created":1461975606,"timestamp_updated":1461975606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22712410","author":{"steamid":"76561198053250516","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":506,"last_played":1461957374},"language":"english","review":"WAiT WHAT tHE FuCK MY BRAIn PlEASE COME BAcK tO ME JEsUS FUCkING HEll\n\n\n\n\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1461969038,"timestamp_updated":1461969038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq6WJstQCeoXSVg=="}
