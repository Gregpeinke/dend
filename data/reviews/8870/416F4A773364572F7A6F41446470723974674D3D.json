I am not entirely sure why, but I feel very conflicted about this game;\n\nfirst of all it's a great game and I enjoyed the time I spent on beating it even a second time with the challenge of the 1999 mode! It has an interesting cast of characters that just pull you into the story, rooting for them and suffering with them. The first escort mission in all my life playing games that did not feel like a massive chore. Also it has a beautiful setting with an independant city state flying high in the skies ruled by both fate and faith deeply intertwined; fascinating as well as hecka gross. And lastly the game spoils you with a fast-paced combat system fully loaded with action and a touch of finesse to it. Or at least that's what you need when you try to get the two 1999 mode achievements.\n\nBUT, and that's what confuses me deeply, as awesome as the game is, it kinda itches me the wrong way how all parts of the game try to fit together:\n\nFor example the character of Daisy Fitzroy. i had such high hopes that she and her revolution was gonna be a great asset to the story, but after finishing the game and having met the person and heard so many voxophones about her I still feel like I don't know the character at all. And the same applies to Fink, I mean he talks to you, hires you, is obnoxious as hell and then somehow nothing becomes of it.\nAnd thinking back that is because both characters are completely overshadowed by Elizabeths opening of the rifts that always pushed the story too fast too far ahead and, and that's my point exactly here, were supposed to move the story ahead, but in the end only felt like tricks to push you right into the next battle without the proper reasoning.\n\nWhile I'm at it, I liked the battle system, but it never felt like battling your way through an actual city. In the beginning when you made your way to Monument Island over the rooftops and could actually enter some buildings it gave off such great vibes, but later on it more and more felt like moving from one arena to the other and thus it kinda unfortunately lost that feeling.\n\nAnd then there was the decision-making problem. I mean, I get why in a game that revolves around the theory that all possibilites are supposed to deliver you equally to the same end, the pure existence of choice would work against the plot. But then why give you the illusion of choice in the first place? That is just mean.\n\nLastly... multiverse, really? This might be just a personal issue, but multiverse theory is one of the three cheapest ways to explain plot. I mean, I understand that it's based on Elizabeth's powers, but it also explains Elizabeth's powers, which makes sense by not making sense, because multiverse can explain literally anything.","timestamp_created":1652227518,"timestamp_updated":1652262540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115276301","author":{"steamid":"76561198125500777","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":72,"playtime_forever":518,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":518,"last_played":1652226537},"language":"english","review":"Confusing","timestamp_created":1652226571,"timestamp_updated":1652226571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115274311","author":{"steamid":"76561198298164338","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":735,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":735,"last_played":1651828961},"language":"schinese","review":"明白为什么被称为艺术品了，见过最出色的乌托邦","timestamp_created":1652222680,"timestamp_updated":1652222680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115270674","author":{"steamid":"76561198007026924","num_games_owned":642,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":5441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5441,"last_played":1457269667},"language":"german","review":"Perfect conclusion to a selfcontained trillogy!

Honestly after playing it and the dlc over again for the third time, and after the extremely cool presentation wears off and you make your way through Columbia, it becomes a pretty average game. The combat gets old very quickly and it becomes a lot of going to various arenas to kill the baddies while Elizabeth helps out.\n\nThe story is supposed to be the strength here but personally I'm not too sure how it all is supposed to make sense, given all the parallel universes introduced later in the very end game.\n\nIt is still a fine game and the Burial at Sea dlc is definitely worth playing to see how the original Bioshock is set up. But after the initial E3 showing that I still remember all these years later, I think what we finally got was quite underwhelming.\n\nAlso the Clash in the Clouds dlc is very mediocre.

sendo sincero meu favorito de longe da trio apesar que  o jogo realmente fica excessivamente viajado e complexo comparando aos jogos anteriores aqui temos implementação de  exploração muito mais forte do que nos anteriores oque ao meu ver e algo muito positivo o level designe ainda e simples na maior parte e so andar e atirar porem sinceramente esse jogo te cativa com facilidade e a mecânica de tiro esta bem mais  polida assim como a física do jogo e a hud esta um pouco melhor sem falar nos criativos trilhos bom   parando por aqui os elogios. vamos aos pontos negativos \npouca interatividade do ambiente com os poderes coisa que nos anteriores era bem melhor \nporque diabos não ter save ou quick save e completamente estupido ainda mais que eu cheguei a ficar em preso em algum objeto em 3 ocasiões perdendo assim 1 hora de jogo facilmente  save 1000 melhor que auto save paz olha sinceramente não tenho muito a reclamar deste jogo.\nbom vamos as conclusões  o jogo tem uma historia que por mais confusa  e complexa que seja te emociona pelo menos foi assim comigo e que maneja muito bem o ar de mistério  te fazendo de fato pensar e analisar olha fico no aguardo do 4 caso ele seja lançado

believe I waited so long to play the final game in this great Trilogy!! BioShock Infinite is a short first person shooter. The story is great and takes place in the early 1900's. It does have similar elements to the first game in the series as you start as a guy who finds himself in a totally new world. The characters are great and feel very natural. The world is gorgeous! At first I was unsure how I'd feel leaving Rapture after 2 games being familiar but Columbia is soo beautiful!\nGameplay is very good. You get guns and super powers just like previous BioShocks which you can upgrade as the game progresses. Combat is great with a new element where you are able to alter your environment to suit your combat style. Tho the powers aren't too dissimilar from the first one, it definitely feels fresh. As the game progresses further, you get a companion in Elizabeth but luckily she *never* gets in the way and you don't have to babysit her. The story is great as it trickles information throughout your exploration of Columbia  and thru cut scenes. There aren't really many bosses just 'large enemies' which you see over and over again. Music is good, graphics are good, story is great, characters are great, combat is decently complex and can be played how you want to play. Short but sweet 8.5/10","timestamp_created":1651926225,"timestamp_updated":1651926225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115086890","author":{"steamid":"76561199090222850","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":464,"last_played":1651921589},"language":"koreana","review":"미쳤다","timestamp_created":1651921607,"timestamp_updated":1651921607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115083043","author":{"steamid":"76561199248738883","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1902,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":809,"last_played":1656224130},"language":"english","review":"ES MUY BUENO, Mantiene un muy buen gameplay y esta muy bien equilibrado.","timestamp_created":1651915506,"timestamp_updated":1651915506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115081761","author":{"steamid":"76561198842897822","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":315,"last_played":1651287380},"language":"schinese","review":"自从被剧透结局后，再也没敢玩到结局...","timestamp_created":1651913296,"timestamp_updated":1651913296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115078287","author":{"steamid":"76561198140143631","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204,"last_played":1652594015},"language":"tchinese","review":"One of the best in 2013","timestamp_created":1651906967,"timestamp_updated":1651906967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115076631","author":{"steamid":"76561198804086453","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":456,"last_played":1651999496},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩","timestamp_created":1651903680,"timestamp_updated":1651903680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115075494","author":{"steamid":"76561198062711436","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":341,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":341,"last_played":1598036095},"language":"koreana","review":"히로인 매력도 한몫하는 겜\n후속작 딱대.","timestamp_created":1651901378,"timestamp_updated":1651940634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3dW/zoADdpr9tgM="}
