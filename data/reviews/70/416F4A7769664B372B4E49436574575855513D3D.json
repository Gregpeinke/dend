I mean I understand its impact on gaming and the FPS genre as a whole. Like I can imagine it being 1998 and basically every shooter is just copying Doom and then this 'Half-Life' comes along and writes new conventions for the whole genre. \n\nBut playing it over 20 years later and it just doesn't feel good, the weapons don't feel good, everyone takes more bullets than you'd expect, running feels a bit too fast and walking a bit too slow.\n\nI did enjoy Surface Tension, but that's mostly just because it was a straight shot of near constant combat that felt like a war zone, it was the only part of the game (except maybe Unforeseen Consequences) where it felt like a simple succession of levels that increased in challenge without getting ridiculous with backtracking and abstract puzzles.\n\nLike, I get the influence and can appreciate the impact this game had on the cultural zeitgeist of first person shooters, but I have to be honest with how I feel about this game.\n\nI just want to end this review by saying that I do not think it is at all a bad game, but If you're new and have grown up with the last two decades of shooters innovating and borrowing from Half-Life, then save yourself the disappointment and give this one a miss, because chances are you won't see what all the fuss is about and will think the game is trash even when it isn't.","timestamp_created":1456961971,"timestamp_updated":1627780363,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21585217","author":{"steamid":"76561198079609256","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1639880435},"language":"brazilian","review":"vou resumir em uma palavra : incrivel","timestamp_created":1456932052,"timestamp_updated":1456932052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21580412","author":{"steamid":"76561198048158241","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3360,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1103,"last_played":1633552287},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games of all time, and best for it's era.

They are slippery as a man on heroin on an ice rink without skates. My second problem is that this game is one those \"where da fuck do I go?\" kinda games. It lacks direction. I get people love the fact that there are no cutscenes but if i'm given the chance to leave when an NPC is giving vital information then I'll leave. This is an action game i want action not to stop midway just to hear the same NPC say something. The puzzles are by no means hard. Neither are the enemies. What makes them hard is the fact that ammo and healthkits are scarce. The guns also have to some degree a spray pattern, which im not complaining about I just wanted to point that out. A really annoying aspect is how a lot of the times the way to leave an area is hidden or obstructed (and i get sometimes you can just brake whatever is obstructing it) but sometimes it's literally hidden and there's nothing you can do short of playing hide and seek while hunted by several mobs (a certain tentacle). \n\nI never really felt an atmosphere in this game. For me this felt more like a shoot em up with annoying controls, repeat NPCs, and the occasional pause to listen to someone.\n\nhonestly not as great many ppl led me to believe, but then agin it's from 1998 can't expect much, buuuuuuttttt Metal Gear Solid  came out in 1998 too and thats far better in my opinion. However they're two different genres can't really compare them. Point is, it's not that great. If you're feeling nostalgic get it or if you wanna get context for Half-Life 2 get it, but half life 2 is superior. \n\nInterestingly, Half-life 2 is a radically different game than Half-Life and it's respective installments.","timestamp_created":1456688115,"timestamp_updated":1467231253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21530108","author":{"steamid":"76561198019386391","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":776,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":72,"last_played":1652529285},"language":"spanish","review":"como mola","timestamp_created":1456683300,"timestamp_updated":1456683300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21529230","author":{"steamid":"76561198145842683","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":340,"last_played":1455195203},"language":"schinese","review":"感觉挺不错的，一开始几关有点被吓到，不过之后就习惯了，难度还算好吧，主要是为了考古，希望G胖快出HL3啊，这游戏太有趣了。","timestamp_created":1456681091,"timestamp_updated":1456681091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21526328","author":{"steamid":"76561198115301571","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":4066,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3035,"last_played":1628508717},"language":"russian","review":"Игра детства! 2009.

Эта игра действительно стала прорывом своего времени и прорывом в жанре шутеров, опередив свое время.\n\n  Никаких скриптованных видеозаставок, все - абсолютно все разговоры построены на игровом движке и имеют 3D модели, это было очень необычный способ повествования особенно для того времени, да чего уж говорить, даже сейчас многие игры скорее сделают видеозаставку, чем все пропишут на игровом движке с моделями персонажей. Благодаря этому игрока не кидает постоянно между видеозаставками и игровым процессом, что не портит атмосферу полноценного погружения в игру.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=634357472\n\n  В игре у ботов динамический ИИ, благодаря этому HL практически всегда будет играться свежо и незамутненно. Враги перекатываются, прячутся за укрытия, выкуривают вас из за укрытия гранатами, переговариваются - словом ведут себя очень умно (особенно на момент 1998 года). Так же HL одна из первых игр своего времени когда появились союзники. Игра в отличие от прочих старых игр не самая сложная, благодаря чему можно действительно наслаждаться игрой, а не как в первом Red Faction воевать вопреки всему и всем. \n\n  Когда создавали игру, Valve знали что в их играх главное разнообразие мест и ситуаций, ведь именно это заставляет игроков буквально жить в игре - именно поэтому даже несмотря на то что игра линейная, она все же ощущается и играется немного иначе чем другие линейные игры, вот тут мы едем на поезде рассматриваем пейзажи, деремся с монстрами, воюем с людьми, пытаемся убежать от огромного гиганского монстра, уплываем от акул, уклоняемся от гиганских щупалец, спасаем доктора что бы он нам помог припасами - словом эта игра в которую каждый сыграет по своему.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=634358496\n\n  Множества физических объектов с которыми можно взаимодействовать или даже сломать, целая гора оружия всех сортов и расцветок, а некоторые из оружий даже живые. Не стареющий движок Source который в последствии на волне популярности HL получится целую груду модов и дополнений для игры.  Много достаточно страшных моментов ох уж эти хэдкрабы выпрыгивающие из темноты, а в некоторых местах страшно даже без врагов.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=634356487\n\nПрочная сюжетная основа - это то что Half-Life сделал в жанре шутеров одним из первых, запутанная история про вышедшие из под контроля эксперименты в Черной Месе написанная Марком Лэдлоу. Великолепный дизайн уровней. Музыка за авторством Келли Бэйли которую вы не раз будете переслушивать и после прохождения игры. Очень простой и не мешающий играть интерфейс - один из самых удобных в шутерах того времени.\n\nБезусловно игр без минусов не бывает и эта игра не исключение, начнем пожалуй с того что эта игра банально старая и большинство минусов будут строится от этого - в ней уже достаточно старая графика, а ящики передвигаются слишком быстро (по какой то причине старые игры ускоряют физику внутри себя, из за чего физика в них порой слишком быстрая). Игра даже может иногда вылететь. Странная и запутанная структура уровней как и во всех старых играх.\n\nОбычно людям свойственно критиковать или строить мнение об игре, даже не поиграв в нее, что называется “не успел на волне популярности - значит буду критиковать”. Я знаю такие люди есть и их не мало и в принципе их поступки вполне нормальны и объяснимы психологией человека, но все же прежде чем критиковать я настоятельно рекомендую сыграть в игру и мысленно переместить себя в 1998 год.\n\nЭта игра действительно культовый  шедевр среди игр, как бы надуманно и банально это не звучало сейчас, я искреннее благодарен за те эмоции которые я испытал от игры, пройдя ее за один раз не отрываясь от нее. И я рад, исключительно искренне вам ее порекомендовать.\n\n10 из 10","timestamp_created":1456659477,"timestamp_updated":1456672223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598868310451507568","comment_count":29,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21516965","author":{"steamid":"76561198084657996","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":38116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":48,"playtime_at_review":10148,"last_played":1660370962},"language":"english","review":"this game is amazing, even as it ages, theres still that charm of seeing the intro with you riding a monorail, passing all these different sights, seeing other people, its amazing (also if you would like to make half life funnier, look up jamies mod, crack life campaign and scientist slaughterhouse on moddb","timestamp_created":1456640765,"timestamp_updated":1456640765,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21513793","author":{"steamid":"76561197994404698","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1274,"last_played":1454114179},"language":"english","review":"some of the sound effects in this game can be heard in teamfortress2","timestamp_created":1456625854,"timestamp_updated":1456625854,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21513134","author":{"steamid":"76561198091350928","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1062,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":547,"last_played":1465136329},"language":"english","review":"An incredible game a decade later, and in my opinion the best title in the series.

What HL managed to do was meld it's great looking (for it's time) graphics with a greatly told and engaging story. HL redefined the way we looked at FPS games and video games in general, and that should be worth enough to give it a try.\n\nOf course there are some things that don't really work to the game's advantage: Their are really wired difficulty curves constantly, since the game sometimes out of nowhere throws HUGE amounts of enemies after solving a quiet puzzle, and the save points sometimes come in bad places, so F6 is your best friend for most of the game. Boss fights are also weirdly clunky at times, and it can take a lot of patience for some of them. Also, the graphics don't hold up in any way whatsoever, so there's that.\n\nAll in all, Half-Life is a great game that you should definitely look into.

However, it was still a great experience. In my opinion, Half-Life was way better than HL2. HL2 just seems so linear, while HL seems way more open, even though it is a linear game. In HL, you know nothing. All you figure out at the beginning is \"Get to the surface!\". You have no idea how, you just have to do it. It makes it feel so much more open. Also, the puzzles where very challenging, but enjoyable. The only bad thing about this game was the graphics, and if you play games for the graphics, shame on you. It felt so realistic as well, because you play entirely from the point of view of Gordon Freeman. There are like 3 cut-seens, but in two of them you can move and look around, and the final 1 you are still in first person.
