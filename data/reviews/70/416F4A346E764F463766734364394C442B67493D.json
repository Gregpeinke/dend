So much of the video game industry was possible because of the breakthrough innovations made by this game. For god's sake, this game practically invented storytelling in a video game! Its fascinating how a 23 year old game has managed to hold up and is definitely leagues above almost all the shooters that succeeded it (Unless you're counting Half-Life 2 and Bioshock) An absolute recommend. You should probably save your money by just buying this game instead of those buggy and un-innovative, so-called AAA titles coming out in this age and use your remaining money to buy the rest of the games in the series.
