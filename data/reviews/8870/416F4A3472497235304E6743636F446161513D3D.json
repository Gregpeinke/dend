Columbia is the picturesque flying city \nthat offers stunning Palazzo architecture throughout and adorned \nwith patriotism every which way. Walking through the flying city that \nundoubtedly took its inspiration from the World's Columbian Exposition \noffers a Norman Rockwell painting around every corner. Riding the rails \nin the sky puts you in the place of the character, and shows promise for \na game that may one day pair very well with a VR headset.\n\nOther than its beauty, Bioshock Infinite also contains a very \ndiverse way of destroying the enemy, from hooks and bullets to \nshooting friggin crows out your hands! The combat is well balanced\non most difficulties and ammo can be a bit of a scarcity, so you may \nhave to plan out your actions instead of runnin' and gunnin' it. The \ngame actually encourages you to use your powers, instead of just \nhaving them there as a vanity to claim that they have diverse combat. \nBetter weapon balance on the harder difficulties, Easy difficulty \ngives out supplies like candy.\n\nHowever, this game is far deeper than simply being a pretty shooter.\nThroughout the game, a whole new world begins to unravel as you \nprogress down the rabbit hole of escaping Columbia. Connections \nare made that you may not have seen existing and the plot diverges \nto areas you didn't know were there. The game not only tempts you \nto ask who's who, but also what's what, when's when, where's where, \nwhy's why and how so? Incredibly story-driven.\n\nA damn fine game that I'd recommend to anyone. A game with little to \nno faults (some may argue that the game gets a bit preachy at some \npoints). A game that REQUIRES ALL DLC TO GET THE FULL STORY.

Es un juego con momentos grandiosos.\n¿Qué hace que no lo recomiendo? Su título. No debería llamarse Bioshock.\n\nA partir de aquí, spoilers, solo escribo esto pues al pertenecer al 5% de gente que no le gusta este juego te tildan de ignorante que no has comprendido la historia. Puede que lo que sea, quién sabe, hay infinitas realidades. Y tal vez en una de ellas yo pertenezco al 5% de gente que le ha gustado el juego, defendiéndola a capa y espada contra el 95% restante.\n\nLa primera patada que superé gracias a los increíbles cinco minutos del juego, es cuando te das cuenta (gracias a los voxófonos) que en tiempos de la revolución americana la señora Lutece inventa los portales transdimensionales. Pero en fin, la ciudad flotante mola y tiras pa' lante. Ni siquiera me molestó Intuir quien era  Zachary Hale Comstock y por tanto el final. En muchas historias intuimos el final, aún así nos llegan a sorprender y gustar. Mi teoria inicial era que al matarnos a nosotros mismos la dualidad de las partículas en la mecanica cuántica, si lo he cogido muy por los pelos, morirían todos los Dewiit en todas las realidades cerrando así cualquier futuro donde jodemos la marrana. Sí, me inventé parte de la mecánica cuántica por el camino, pero para mí tenía su lógica. Al final, el juego no es muy diferente.\nPuedo soportar esto, o que Elizabeth tenga esa clase de superpoderes porque sí (¿se expuso a un portal siendo muy pequeña? Pues vale, te lo crees). Mi principal problema es el título del juego, Bioshock.\n\nLos plásmidos o vigorizadores son lo que se llama un deus ex machina en Columbia. Su explicación es que básicamente debido al uso de los portales Columbia descubre tecnología asombrosa de otras realidades. Y por esto, un día descubren Rapture y ale, plásmidos pal cuerpo (curioso decir que si hay infinitas realidades las posibilidades de descubrir Rapture en una de ellas es bueno... infinitamente pequeña ¿Casualidad o Causalidad?). Esto, en serio, me lo puedo llegar a tragar pues al final el juego es entretenido. Pero el problema es que un título con una historia tan importante no puede fallar en algo base. En Bioshock Infinite los plásmidos dejan de ser el nucleo formador de la historia para ser un elemento que debe aparecer porque sí, porque sí no, no podría llamarse Bioshock.\n\nPara comprender tal afirmación hay que comprender como los plásmidos y el ADAM transforman Rapture. no solo su historia y trama, también su jugabilidad. Rapture se va al carajo por la lucha de poder respecto a estos y su control, y también porque su uso transforma a la gente en una especie de yonkis tarados con poderes. Los plásmidos son el núcleo de Rapture y de Bioshock, ¿Podemos decir lo mismo de Columbia y de Infinite? No. Están porque tienen que estar, nada más. O sí, claro, la explicación es que no son plásmidos normales son de una realidad diferente (imagina las posibilidades de tal cosa) en que los plásmidos no son tan peligrosos, genial. Eso tampoco explica porque la gente de Columbia pasa olímpicamente de ellos. En fin.\n\nSi has leído hasta aquí, supongo yo, que para tratar de comprender porque a alguien no le gusta este maravilloso juego, gracias. Al final, esta saga es una de mis preferidas y este broche final me ha supuesto un trago muy amargo de digerir que seguramente influencie todavía más mi percepción negativa. Esta frase, clave por cierto, para comprender el juego, no deja de resultarme irónica:\n\"La mente del sujeto luchará desesperadamente para crear recuerdos donde no los hay…\" Barreras al viaje transdimensional, R. Lutece, 1889.\nPues es gracioso que seguramente lo vuelva a jugar, prefiero pensar que estoy equivocado y no valoré el título como se merece.","timestamp_created":1480186826,"timestamp_updated":1480186826,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.452454447746276855","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27714131","author":{"steamid":"76561198101343485","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1165,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":827,"last_played":1631595318},"language":"spanish","review":"La historia es interesante y tiene buenos detalles en ella \nDan ganas de repetir el juego varias veces","timestamp_created":1480186728,"timestamp_updated":1480186728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27713050","author":{"steamid":"76561198047524615","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1480245087},"language":"russian","review":"Worthy successor of bioshock legacy!!!","timestamp_created":1480186288,"timestamp_updated":1480186288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27712750","author":{"steamid":"76561198280280726","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":2660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":176,"last_played":1621204748},"language":"english","review":"The Story and the Gameplay is just Top Notch and it just pulls you in like a Tear in the fabric of time\nRecommended Game to Play!!","timestamp_created":1480186172,"timestamp_updated":1480186172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27712510","author":{"steamid":"76561198072944267","num_games_owned":227,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3573,"last_played":1505259986},"language":"english","review":"the best god damn escort mission I have ever played","timestamp_created":1480186070,"timestamp_updated":1480186070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27712322","author":{"steamid":"76561198098034136","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2203,"last_played":1492213068},"language":"russian","review":"Прекрассное создание, не побоюсь этого слова, Великого Кена Левина привнесло в мир чуточку больше надежды, что игры не всегда создают плохо.
