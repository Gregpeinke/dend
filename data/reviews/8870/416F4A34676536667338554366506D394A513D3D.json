Für mich ist die Serie ein Meilenstein der Videospielgeschichte. Ich habe selten so ein atmosphärisch dichtes Spiel gespielt, welches mich seit dem Prolog von Teil 1 gefesselt hat. An den dritten Teil, Infinite, hatte ich daher sehr große Erwartungen.\n\nAm Anfang ist die Atmosphäre nicht ganz so das gewesen, was ich mir erhofft hatte und wie ich es aus den Vorgängern gewohnt war. Aber, mit dem Eintauchen in die Geschichte, einem hochkomplexen Beziehungsdrama, sitzt man nach jedem weiteren Story-Happen gebannter vor dem Bildschirm. Die Umgebung und die Effekte, so eine Detailverliebtheit sucht Ihresgleichen.  Die Stadt Columbia ist ein überwältigender Anblick. Warum fliegt die Stadt? Wer hat das Sagen? Wer ist Freund und wer eher nicht? Wie schließt sich der Kreis zu Rapture? Alles Fragen, die es zu beantworten gilt. Es gibt sehr emotionale Momente, Szenen die einen eintauchen und immer neugieriger werden lassen. Spannende – aber nicht zu schwere – Rätsel und rasante Action auf den Sky-Lines runden dieses Spiel ab. Absolut empfehlenswert, ich kann hier auch nach mittlerweile 2maligem Durchspielen nichts Kritisches finden.\n\nDLC – Seebestattung (Burial at Sea) Episode 1 + 2:\n\nHier schließt sich der Kreis endgültig was Columbia, die Stadt in den Wolken, mit Rapture, der Stadt am Meeresgrund, zu tun hat und umgekehrt. Das Gameplay ist hier etwas anders als im Hauptspiel – mehr zu verraten wäre aber gespoilert – dadurch setzen die DLCs ein klein wenig andere Schwerpunkte. Das was im Hauptspiel gut funktionierte, ist hier eher selten der Schlüssel zum Erfolg. Das ist von den Machern sicher so beabsichtigt, allerdings hat mich das etwas enttäuscht.\n\nEpisode 1 spielt ausschließlich in Rapture, aber der Besuch dort ist leider lächerlich kurz (die Episode ist meiner Meinung nach auch keine 15 EUR wert, was sie momentan noch einzeln kostet). Ich war ehrlich gesagt erschrocken, als der Abspann kam. Die Geschichte bleibt weiter äußerst mysteriös und sehr spannend, vor allem weil jeder seit Ende des Hauptspiels eine deutlich andere Sichtweise gegenüber der Storyline haben sollte. Aber das war es wirklich schon? Hmm.. Also musste es Episode 2 wohl rausreißen und - das vorweg - sollte sie dann auch tun. ;)\n\nEpisode 2 ist völlig anders als die Erste. Wie umschreibt man nun etwas, was man nicht spoilern will? Nun, soviel: ihr spielt nicht mehr Booker Dewitt, den Protagonisten aus Infinite und Episode 1. Ihr habt dadurch andere Fähigkeiten und müsst euch neu an das Spiel anpassen. Durch diese Umgewöhnung wird das Spiel deutlich schwieriger, es gibt nun andere Wege die zum Ziel führen. Die Episode ist gegenüber der Ersten nun auch ausreichend lang für einen DLC und es verschlägt euch hier zwischendurch auch wieder nach Columbia. Alle bisherigen Bioshock-Teile hängen irgendwie zusammen. Das ist es was hier mit brachialer Wucht auf den Spieler einschlägt. Das Ende hingegen verstehen allerdings nur diejenigen Spieler, die bisher alles von Bioshock gespielt haben. Der Mind*f*u*c*k* ist gewaltig, da das Durcheinander der Geschichten aller Bioshock-Teile nach diesem Ende sogar noch mehr Sinn ergeben als man ahnt. Für jemanden, der bisher aber nur Infinite gespielt hat, macht dieses Ende eher weniger Freude. Ich glaube sogar, dass man ohne Teil 1 und 2 zu kennen danach sogar enttäuscht sein wird.\n\nKritisch ist bei den Episoden anzumerken, dass sie nur mit englischer Audio kommen. Man kann zwar deutsche Untertitel einblenden lassen, allerdings gibt es die nicht für die Voxaphone, die man unterwegs so aufsammelt. Und wenn man das Spiel vorher auf deutsch gespielt hat, haben alle Personen nun andere Stimmen, das distanziert die Persönlichkeiten sofort, die ganze Umgebung wirkt dadurch sehr fremd. Das Verständnis und die Story-Zusammenhänge leiden dadurch auch deutlich, zumal ich oftmals keine Lust hatte die Audio-Logs 2-3 mal hintereinander abzuspielen, weil irgendjemand immer dazwischen quasselt (übers Funkgerät meldet sich jemand oder herumschleichende Splicer führen Selbstgespräche).\n\nSchade, dass sich zwischenzeitlich das Entwicklerstudio aufgelöst hat. Hätte gern noch mehr Bioshock gespielt. Aber wer weiß, die Episoden haben gegenüber dem Hauptspiel doch deutlich an Atmosphäre eingebüßt. Das lag zugegeben auch mit an der fehlenden deutschen Audio-Übersetzung, aber auch selbst damit hätte ich mich dort nicht mehr so wohl gefühlt wie in Rapture oder Columbia einst. \n\nInfinite krönt für mich jedenfalls den Abschluss der Bioshock-Reihe. Ein \"must-have\" ohne jeden Zweifel! Bei den Infinite-DLC-Episoden fehlt zwar etwas der Glanz, aber dennoch ist und bleibt Bioshock für mich ein Meilenstein der Videospielgeschichte, ähnlich wie Half-Life.\n\n„Wären Sie jetzt so freundlich“ und bewerten mein Review positiv!

The game also adds than extra layer of depth in the form of environmental hazards such as oil spills and Elizabeth's tears providing friendly covering fire or simply health/ammo points. These help the game feel fresh in an industry over populated with FPS games.\n\nThis game excels unlike any other when it comes down to its beautifully crafted world with its own unique art style. It is truly breathtaking at points. You could spend hours just wondering around it in without killing a single soul if you choose as the world is immersive.\n\nThe storyline itself is as engaging experience that needs to be experienced first hand. You learn more about both your own character and te character of Elizabeth as the game progresses but the game creates more questions than answers which enables the story to remain intense throughout.

It was creepy, had shocks, was gory, and had one of the greatest plot twists I have ever experienced in a game. Bioshock Infinite, on the other hand, has not these things.\nI will admit that melee executions are brutal and varied enough to give me satisfaction every time, but I found a distinct lack of the shocking gore that I had been led to expect from my adventures in Rapute. While this may seem like a trivial point, when it wasn't there as expected it lessened the experience for me. not only that, but there wasn't a single memorable passage of play to get my heart racing or to even make me jump in my chair the slightest bit. Enemies didn't utilise the environment particularly well, and I felt a distinct lack of grenades on their behalf, considering that I was basically a demigod who nobody bothered as long as he stayed behind cover. Turret manipulation was incosequential, but making enemies turn their guns on themselves was satisfying, and it became my personal challenge through one passage to use nothing but that ability.\nWhat Bioshock Infinite IS though, is pretty. It's very pretty. But pretty, unfortunately, doesn't make up for ambience. Where Rapture is dark and claustrophobic, Columbia is open and bright. Where Rapture forced you into close quaters combat in the dark with nothing but your best hat and a pocket watch; Columbia gave you a sniper rifle and a rocket launcher, and made hundreds of squishy little meat sacks stand in a group under the glorious sunshine 300m's away, told them to stay put while you set a bazzilion traps, and then asked them to walk towards you slowly as a group firing their guns at the passing seagulls.\n\nThe story was good enough to keep me playing, but it wasn't anywhere near as good as the first title in the franchise, and I'm glad I waited until it was very cheap because it has left me a little frustrated, and worrying whether they are going to fuck up the next one or not. Bioshock Infinite had all the ingredients of a great game, but it needed to go in a darker horror-esque direction to do so in my opinion. I still have no idea what that fucking thing was that was in the asylum, but it could have been used to great effect throughout the game. The saddest thing though, is that you could replace Elizabeth with a piece of bacon, and it wouldn't really change the outcome. I expected much more, but still worth finishing.","timestamp_created":1397699970,"timestamp_updated":1397699970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508928596973419189","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9837541","author":{"steamid":"76561198114205326","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":837,"last_played":1515197292},"language":"russian","review":"Great.

The addition of the skylines, the new \"vigors\" (which replace Bioshock's Plasmids) and Elizabeth's tear abilities to the fps template result in an incredibly fun game, however the real star of the show is the story. The story touches on themes such as racism and religion, yet it never exploits them and it creates the best story in a game I have played in a long time. Elizabeth is probably the best \"sidekick\" there has ever been. The world building in this game is also fantastic and really adds to your immersion, as you can literally spend hours listening to all the voxophones and seeing little scenes play out that you would have missed if you weren't looking for them.

The similarities to the two previous games are mainly in the combat system and structure of the game wandering around collecting various things, but there are also quite a few differences, the game taking place in a city in the clouds around 1900. It has a complicated and difficult to follow story so I think replaying it to try and understand more of what's going on is worth doing. It wasn't really the game I was expecting or hoping for. Still, it does have incredible graphics, sound, the usual high class execution and polish of a big budget game, so I do have to recommend it quite highly overall.","timestamp_created":1397599748,"timestamp_updated":1397599748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9827918","author":{"steamid":"76561198101366068","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":494,"last_played":1406474934},"language":"english","review":"This game is lots of fun and worth the money its only time taking","timestamp_created":1397597949,"timestamp_updated":1397597949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9827107","author":{"steamid":"76561198035577857","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":677,"last_played":1396023539},"language":"french","review":"Très bon jeux, histoire excellente.

I figured I'd just get that statement out of the way before I got into the actual meat of my review. There are a lot of things that Bioshock Infinite is and a lot it's not and whether you'll enjoy it really boils down to assessing what you're actually looking for in a game.\n\nSTORY\nThis is the meat and potatoes of this game and it's plenty filling. The world isn't open, but it's easy to get lost exploring little alcoves to find recordings that tell you more and more of the story. It unfolds around you as you make your way through objectives, which are easy to follow thanks to the arrows. I never felt like I didn't know what was going on with the story and even though some characters or events aren't explained right away, they come about in time. My entire first experience was more like participating in a film, rather than playing the game itself. I'd forget to shoot enemies because I was too busy staring at scenery or listening to people talk. The ending blew my mind a little, but then I'm not a philosophical scholar and I'm fairly easily surprised by plot twists even in movies.\n\nGRAPHICS\nPretty. So pretty. I don't really think there's a lot of description you need for the graphics, but the world is crafted beautifully. There is some repetition in store fronts and the residents don't have a lot of graphical differences, but you'll be too busy looking around to care that much. Or at least I was. The skies, the buildings, the Songbird, the sky rails, the gondolas - honestly everything is just so pretty. \n\nFIGHTS\nThis is about the only part that I felt was kind of lacking because fights were unimaginative. There were only a couple of instances where I felt like I was challenged, even playing on the highest level. Between chain traps and ammo everywhere and Elizabeth throwing you things, you just kind of blaze through most of the battles. But like I stated from the start - it's not about fight mechanics. They're just in the way of the storytelling.\n\nSUMMARY\nIf you like games with a good plot where you're being entertained more than fighting things, get this game. If you like games with beautiful scenery and surroundings, get this game. Just get this game in general. There's a reason it was such a runaway hit when it came out.","timestamp_created":1397583999,"timestamp_updated":1397583999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ge6fs8UCfPm9JQ=="}
