Reach the surface and try to survive the numerous alien beings and special forces soldiers sent to cover up the incident.\nHalf-Life holds up in both gameplay and storytelling.\nYou will have to maneuver Gordon through the hazardous corridors of Black Mesa, absorbing the enviroment and batteling increasingly more dangerous enemies with some of the most responsive movement and shooting controlls of the time.\nAs you explore the research facilities, you are free to absorbe as much of the story as you want. What is Xen? Who is the G-Man? How does Gordon manage to carry so many weapons while running at the speed of an olympic athlete? These are questions that might never get answered.

Your experiment goes terribly wrong, ripping a hole through earth and the alien world Xen. Then you're introduced to all these unique aliens and environments, fighting for your survival. Later on it becomes a fight with aliens and humans, who plan to wipe out all Black Mesa personnel. [spoiler]Your objective changes, when you're tasked to travel to Xen, and defeat the alien baby monster ruler, Nihilanth.[/spoiler][spoiler]Then you're introduced to the mysterious G-Man, in my opinion the most unique character in a game of all time. He gives you a choice, to work for him, or to be put in a battle you have no chance of winning.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1][Gameplay][/h1]\n\n[Aliens]\nThe first aliens you see, don't really give off a challenge especially when you pick up a pistol. It's a sense of warmup for the upcoming hostiles ahead, such as the bulky Alien Grunt, and the fast flying Controller.\n\n[HECU]\nYou're introduced to the HECU, the people who were supposedly going to save you, but instead plans to wipe out every single person involved with the Black Mesa incident. They have a ridiculously large healthpool and usually charge at you, with their high amount of damage. It gives you a challenge along the way of survival.\n\n[Movement]\nTo be honest, I felt like the movement speed was kind of speedy, and I had myself falling off ledges often, so I just had to change the friction amount using the console, but honestly it's not really much of a big problem.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[h1]Overall, Half-Life is just a highly memorable experience, and I would recommend it to everyone who hasn't played it yet.

Indeed a great and extraordinary game for its time and audience. But if you are reading this review, you are not a nostalgic who wants to play the game of his teenager years again but someone who is new to Half-Life. And I have to tell you: Don't buy it.\n\nIt doesn't compare at all to modern shooter, Sci-Fi-Games or riddle-based games. The controls are awful, the difficulty is too high to enjoy the game smoothly as a casual gamer (EDIT: I totally forgot you can choose it in the beginning - I do not remember what I chose but you will have good run with one lower than what you take in \"modern\" games I think)  and I don't think we need to discuss the graphics of a game from 1998. \n\nThe story is nice for a shooter but very railroaded and you can get lost easily because nearly nobody is talking to you for hours throughout the game.\n\nMy recommendation: If you want to relive the feeling of the changing millenium in a video game, give it a shot while it's on sale. But if you expect a good shooter to modern measures, you will be heavily disappointed.","timestamp_created":1527341973,"timestamp_updated":1527411990,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.411542773246765137","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42278926","author":{"steamid":"76561198344403649","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2987,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2092,"last_played":1655784387},"language":"turkish","review":"O BİR EFSANEeeee","timestamp_created":1527340036,"timestamp_updated":1638198533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42278543","author":{"steamid":"76561198130611133","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":20,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1527458578},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bom","timestamp_created":1527339114,"timestamp_updated":1527339114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42278187","author":{"steamid":"76561198080191424","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":576,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1630265965},"language":"russian","review":"8.11.1998","timestamp_created":1527338216,"timestamp_updated":1527338216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42275716","author":{"steamid":"76561198185439681","num_games_owned":344,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":1023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":558,"last_played":1643656726},"language":"russian","review":"Nostalgia","timestamp_created":1527332383,"timestamp_updated":1527332383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42274997","author":{"steamid":"76561198007499314","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":29,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29,"last_played":1514211558},"language":"english","review":"awesome game, nothing like an old school game","timestamp_created":1527330697,"timestamp_updated":1527330697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42274990","author":{"steamid":"76561198292341651","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":216,"last_played":1610788023},"language":"russian","review":"Игра клёвая:)))))))))))","timestamp_created":1527330669,"timestamp_updated":1567840770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42272370","author":{"steamid":"76561198452378479","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":912,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":494,"last_played":1552797084},"language":"russian","review":"это игра на прохождение, интерестный захватывающий сюжет. рекомендую всем","timestamp_created":1527324395,"timestamp_updated":1527324395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481099635362625122","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42272296","author":{"steamid":"76561198393065283","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":39549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1757,"last_played":1624116624},"language":"russian","review":"1.
