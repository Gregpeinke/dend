It also includes a single-player mode with difficulty levels and bots you can swap out as you progress through the 'tour of duty'. It's fun on Normal difficulty and below, but on Hard and above you need to be good at CS to really make progress. There's also custom campaigns available online.\n\nThe 'Deleted Scenes' are a series of single-player missions. Unlike the regular CZ, these are scripted, generally linear/cinematic in nature and put you in a wider variety of unconnected situations including bank robberies and drug busts. Some of the missions are great, some of them are average; sometimes it can get quite campy as evidenced by my original 'review' above, and there are only a handful of custom missions I found online. Almost none of them really go into the backstory of the terrorism and assorted nefarious acts on display here: you're just the tip of the spear meant to counter terrorist aggression.\n\nThe development of this game is rather storied, with four separate companies working on it before its release. It was intended to be a revamp of the original CS with a single-player mode, then it was turned into a game with single-player missions (the Deleted Scenes(. Then it was restarted again in the vein of the first version, which shipped with the missions anyway. For more details, you can read [url=http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/Development_of_Counter-Strike:_Condition_Zero]this[/url].\n\nIf you're a fan of classic CS and feel like something different, I'd say give it a shot. I'm not sure if it'll do anything for you unless you're a CS/oldschool shooter fan, but since it's an old CS game there's still plenty of people playing it online.","timestamp_created":1304714243,"timestamp_updated":1600826055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539969801902770996","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"672171","author":{"steamid":"76561197974999213","num_games_owned":681,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":1965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1923,"last_played":1455441981},"language":"english","review":"Worth getting if you like counter-strike, it comes with CS 1.6 and Condition Zero, and also has a single player mode in the deleted scenes.","timestamp_created":1304438281,"timestamp_updated":1304438281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"645670","author":{"steamid":"76561197974113256","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2119,"last_played":1595986627},"language":"english","review":"O jogo mais completo entre todas as versões.","timestamp_created":1301522527,"timestamp_updated":1301522527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1970210","author":{"steamid":"76561198000423747","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":108,"playtime_forever":1,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Its called condition zero because that is actually how many times I have wanted to play this game.","timestamp_created":1300922780,"timestamp_updated":1390692122,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447462081909179688","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"306065","author":{"steamid":"76561197968240535","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":28228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28228,"last_played":1346050800},"language":"english","review":"best online gaming.","timestamp_created":1300922757,"timestamp_updated":1300922757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2719296","author":{"steamid":"76561198011594884","num_games_owned":898,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1577570028},"language":"russian","review":"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero довольная не плохая альтернатива обычной Counter-Strike. Не много обновленный движок игры, новые текстуры и модели. Пристуствие сюжета (Deleted Scenes) и мини-миссий. Не столь популярен как Counter-Strike, но этим компенсирует почти полное отсутствие читеров на серверах. Входит в комплект Counter-Strike: Antalogy.","timestamp_created":1300078579,"timestamp_updated":1300078579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501915693283081055","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"279665","author":{"steamid":"76561197967478235","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":145474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":115580,"last_played":1609287223},"language":"english","review":"buy it or your out","timestamp_created":1299545972,"timestamp_updated":1299545972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3603553","author":{"steamid":"76561198025172062","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":9988,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9946,"last_played":1417889728},"language":"english","review":"its good :)","timestamp_created":1298840689,"timestamp_updated":1298840689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1476872","author":{"steamid":"76561197993600732","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":354,"last_played":1331708400},"language":"english","review":"nest besta spellet ever","timestamp_created":1298204719,"timestamp_updated":1298204719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"743692","author":{"steamid":"76561197977145283","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":463,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":342,"last_played":1616382129},"language":"english","review":"badass surf maps on the servers, gungames, and death match maps","timestamp_created":1297234831,"timestamp_updated":1297234831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4296926","author":{"steamid":"76561198035246461","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":148086,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":109197,"last_played":1452800075},"language":"spanish","review":"El mejor al que he jugado !!","timestamp_created":1296837943,"timestamp_updated":1394563345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4076074","author":{"steamid":"76561198031664584","num_games_owned":699,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2400,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2244,"last_played":1617019141},"language":"english","review":"IF YOU DO NOT BUY THIS GAME I'LL PERSONALLY SHIT IN YOUR MOUTH.","timestamp_created":1296242412,"timestamp_updated":1296242412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3022431","author":{"steamid":"76561198016067611","num_games_owned":973,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":4,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"When I saw this game came with \"CZ: Deleted Scenes\", I assumed it would be a neat little addon that I might spend 10 minutes watching. It is exactly the opposite. \"Deleted Scenes\" is more fun than the game itself. It's a fully-playable Counter-Strike mission-based adventure. It's almost like the CoD of Counter-Strike! I love it, and if you like the original Counter-Strike, I guarantee you will too.","timestamp_created":1294523178,"timestamp_updated":1294523178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwYPms60Cf+XDCw=="}
