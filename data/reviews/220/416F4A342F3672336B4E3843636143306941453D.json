And It's been 3 years since I updated my review so that's also why. Even tho this game is as old as me,, the game fascinates me. I mean, look at other games that came out in 2004. GTA:SA, Warcraft 3, Halo 2, these games are great, but compared to them, Half-Life 2 is absolutely brilliant. From it's graphics, physics, characters, all the way to sound design. No doubt that it was ahead of it's time.\n\n[h1] Graphics and World Design [/h1]\nMan, the fact that this game came out 17 years ago blows my mind. It looks amazing and it aged really well. The streets of City 17 are truly unnerving. There is a goddamn war, but it still feels empty and depressing. That's why I love it so much. I love to come back to these streets of City 17 that are haunting me with feeling of not being alone or to the majestic forrest and claustrophobic caves of Episode Two.  The world just keeps on giving on every corner. Half-Life 2 doesn't need to have huge open world to make you feel like you have whole world in the palm of your hand.\n\n[h1] Physics [/h1]\nMy, this is something different. the physics is one of the best parts of the gameplay. I find it way more fun to use my environment and just throw random objects with Graphity gun at enemies. Here you go, throw that barrel to blow the dude up, throw that gas tank to light 'em up, throw that saw wheel to split that mf in half! \n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nThe main game can take more than 10 hours to complete on your 1st playthrough. But with both Episodes you are going for some great adventure. Even without the episodes, it's really fun to replay the game, hunt down the achievements or just discover more locations or try out different routes. It's fun, doesn't get boring, and most importantly, it feels real. Whenever something explodes in my face, I shoot from a revolver or shotgun or the godforsaken black headcrab jumps on my goddamn face out of nowhere, it flinches with my whole body. And it doesn't have a cutscenes. You are following the whole story by your own very eyes. Things are happening to you, people are talking to you. \n\n[h1] Characters [/h1]\nI love the characters. I am going to sound like overweight redditor, but I fell in love with Alyx. I like her company, her voice and her face expressions. Talking about expressions, Half-Life 2 mastered face animation. I can't believe stretching textures can feel so natural. I can't hold myself but smile or wink back at someone. Even voice actors did a great job.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nSo here we are, Dr. Freeman. You are a scientist who got nothing to say, but has a crowbar. As Breen himself said, \"This is not some agent provocateur or highly trained assassin we are discussing. Gordon Freeman is a theoretical physicist who had hardly earned the distinction of his Ph.D. at the time of the Black Mesa Incident. - The man you have consistently failed to slow, let alone capture, is by all standards simply that--an ordinary man.\". So here we are. My man Gordon joins the Rebels to fight off Dr. Breen's administration and power of Combine - inter-dimensional organisation that wants to enslave and dominate as many species as possible. And we, scientist with crowbar and good aim and bunch of random folks are about to take these mfs down! Humans that are just tired of everyone's bullsh*t vs. mf inter-dimentional fascists. What an amazing ride. \n\nThe only bad thing is that Episode Three never arrived. Seeing how interesting story of Project Borealis could have been and what a great finale it could have become for this legendary franchise. \nBut hey, we got Half-Life: Alyx!\n\n[h1] Verdickt [/h1]\n[b]+[/b] Story\n[b]+[/b] Gameplay \n[b]+[/b] Graphics\n[b]+[/b] World/Level Design\n[b]+[/b] Physics\n[b]+[/b] Characters\n[b]+[/b] Guns, features. attention to detail...\n\n[b]-[/b] Episode Two seemed pretty buggy and crashy compared to other games of the franchise\n\n[b] 10 / 10[/b] -
