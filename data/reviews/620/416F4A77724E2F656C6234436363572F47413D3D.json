I enjoyed it just as much or more than the first Portal. It felt like the gameplay was longer and there were more puzzles involved. While it probably took me about 4 hours to finish the 1st game, it took me around 8 hours for this one. I would recommend to anyone that likes puzzle games!","timestamp_created":1366540602,"timestamp_updated":1366540602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6644316","author":{"steamid":"76561198071286308","num_games_owned":369,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":1080,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":150,"last_played":1586988409},"language":"russian","review":"Это игра просто СУПЕР!!!!","timestamp_created":1366540468,"timestamp_updated":1366540468,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6614747","author":{"steamid":"76561198070534045","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2981,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2085,"last_played":1443724918},"language":"russian","review":"Портальная Головоломка есть два режима одиночный и кооперативный.Присоединяйтесь","timestamp_created":1366540358,"timestamp_updated":1366540358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6656647","author":{"steamid":"76561198071612131","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1034,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1049,"last_played":1616710211},"language":"portuguese","review":"Portal 2 é certamente um jogo de PUZZLE espetacular, não só por causa das câmaras de teste, mas tambem por sua história e personagens carismaticos.\nExistem certas partes do jogo que são necessárias praticamente 100% de seu cérebro para serem completas, e eu afirmo, não é todo mundo que consegue afirmar que zerou Portal 2 sem nenhum tipo de guía.\n\nUma Arte 10/10","timestamp_created":1366538383,"timestamp_updated":1411411955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4276020","author":{"steamid":"76561198034917080","num_games_owned":627,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1114,"last_played":1578100089},"language":"english","review":"Great game!  + Funny :)","timestamp_created":1366535448,"timestamp_updated":1366535448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4135003","author":{"steamid":"76561198032615794","num_games_owned":298,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":179,"last_played":1548779507},"language":"czech","review":"Logika, vtip, příběh, grafika, ...","timestamp_created":1366530979,"timestamp_updated":1366530979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6421585","author":{"steamid":"76561198065943972","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15,"last_played":1568996499},"language":"english","review":":D","timestamp_created":1366529080,"timestamp_updated":1366529080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrN/elb4CccW/GA=="}
