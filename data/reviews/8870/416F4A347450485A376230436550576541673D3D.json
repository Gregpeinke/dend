This game is very colorful and aesthetically pleasing. You could randomly press your screenshot button throughout this game and have a very nice collection of wall papers (assuming you first disable the HUD). \n\nThe bad: the gameplay is as deep as an August shower's puddle. Very shallow. All upgrades are through money. The upgrade system is very uninteresting; primarily just damage buffs, reload speed increases for your guns or slight modifcations to vigors.\n\nThe combat gets pretty stale. Use your guns and vigors to kill the bad guys in the arena then move on.  Occasionally fight a bullet sponge or two. There's no real need to diversify or change up your tactics.\n\nThere are some poorly implemented features. Ammo gets scarce in some places. Lockpicks are rare as hell early game then suddenly late game you are swimming in lockpicks. Vigor upgrades are very expensive relative to gun upgrades which discourages their usage. After arguing with the protagonist or killing someone, a request to open a lock by the main character is met with a sprightly 'I'm on it' from Elizabeth. Sprightly as she was in the beginning despite the fact that her tone should reflect current emotional happenings. Really immersion breaking.\n\nThe story is ridiculous, putting it mildly. Stories should not need deep inspection of minor details of the plot to figure out what the fuck is happening and why. Inception was great. This, not so much. Fails pretty hard in this regard. Even if you do have all the details, explanations for things such as the Hummingbird are lacking or tenuously implied.\n\nThere is very little subtlety in this game. It comes off as a little preachy at times. Essentially the idea behind this game is 'Hey you! Nationalism and racism is bad! Did you get that? Racism bad! Segregation bad! Industrial management bad! Here's an example of their wrongdoing! Did you get that?'. There's no nuance in any of the ideas presented. It almost comes off like propaganda. Like the gameplay, the ideas are very shallow. \n\nIs this a 10/10 game? Hell no. The plot is obtuse, the gameplay CoD-esque, RPG elements really lacking. Just goes to show to never trust reviewers and never trust their numbers. The numbers that really matter are the numbers that line their pockets.","timestamp_created":1365280388,"timestamp_updated":1365280388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"992891","author":{"steamid":"76561197983875553","num_games_owned":533,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":3432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1582,"last_played":1463935525},"language":"english","review":"TIN MAN, TIN MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN","timestamp_created":1365279354,"timestamp_updated":1365279354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1317747","author":{"steamid":"76561197991309098","num_games_owned":525,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":1118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1073,"last_played":1397154398},"language":"english","review":"This game was great, from start to finish.

This. Game. Now....no seriously. I'll wait. \n\nOh, you haven’t bought it yet? And you want a (average) review on it? Alright then, here it goes. This is a masterpiece. People are relating it to Half Life 2, and Uncharted based on how good it is. It currently holds a meta critic score of 96/100 which is almost unseen of. The graphics and visuals in this game are absolutely stunning. You can easily get lost in this game's atmosphere looking for money, looting every corner of every place you visit, listening to the conversations between NPCs, reading the extremely well-designed advertisements located on walls, posters etc... I can go on all day. The amount of love and craftsmanship that went into this excellent piece of work is jaw-dropping. If you have the chance play this game on Ultra Settings, the graphics are almost better than life, its that good. Take the time to look at the detail on your weapon, or a poster on a wall, and I assure you, you WILL NOT see any sort of distortion or pixels (except when zooming in with a sniper). That my friends, is how detailed the world is. The gameplay pretty decent honestly, but nothing to special. You have your standard FPS gameplay, shooting your weapons, blowing off enemies’ heads and what not, but also has its own twist. Similar to the old bioshock titles, you can equip and weapon in one hand while casting lightening spells at your enemies with the other, or perhaps sending a flock of crows to eat away at your enemies flesh as you gun him down. The story as you progress is very good. You start to form a relationship with the character Elizabeth as she aids you throughout the game (also her character design is awesome, like something out of a Pixar movie). Toward the end of Bioshock Infinite the story starts to go full circle. But without spoiling, I did scratch my head for a good 5 minutes toward the last 30 seconds of the game, trying to figure out what just happened. But once I figured this interestingly beautiful (in an odd way) ending, I was satisfied. Sadly thought this game took me about 8 hours to complete on Medium, which is quite decent. I also play a lot of FPS games so there wasn’t much challenge for me. But next time I get the chance I will be doing a Hard run, just to give myself a bit more of a challenge, and to relive the atmosphere.\nTurn off all the lights in your room, put on some high quality headphones, turn the graphics on Ultra (if you can), and strap in because Bioshock Infinite, is easily going to take hours of your life away, as you explore this beautiful and extremely detailed world. \nBioshock Infinite easily earns a 9 / 10.\n","timestamp_created":1365224192,"timestamp_updated":1385421047,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538030803203582764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"441604","author":{"steamid":"76561197970641336","num_games_owned":276,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1208,"last_played":1545498334},"language":"english","review":"The most incredible game I've played in a very long time.

It is fairly linear, a real no-brainer and while I get the story, it's not really my thing. Your tag along pal is never targeted so you never have to worry about her, and she serves as more of get-out-of-jail-free mate when you screw up; she also prevents you from having to go through earlier areas of the map when she saves your ass. This game has three rinse-and-repeat bosses (Iam not a fan of boss battles) and the final battle is involved and challenging, yet much of the AI tends to stand still while you plug away at it. It's more like a shooting gallery on steroids. I found myself looking for it to end around the Comstock House. I played it on Hard, maxed everything out, averaged 74fps on the benchmark.

Siinä missä Rapturea ei nähty loistossaan, Columbia elää ja hengittää ja se on pelaaja, joka niiden utopian pistää paskaksi. Heittämällä kaunein peli mitä on nähnyt. Kauneuteen liittyy myös totaalinen bugivapaus, ts immersio ei kärsi koskaan npc:n jumittaessa juoksemassa päin seinää tms vakiokamaa. Mukana kulkeva seuralainen on toimiva - se ei osallistu taisteluun, auttaa sopivasti ja sun ei tarvitse murehtia sen terveydestä. Ja: kiihkouskovaisten rasistien lahtaaminen nyt vaan on hauskaa, outoa oikeastaan, ettei teemaa ole juurikaan hyödynnetty aikaisemmin.\n\nPaskaa taas on vahvasti retro pelaamistyyli - mikäli tota pelaa normi fps:nä. Mä en esimerkiksi muista käyttäneeni kyykkäämistä ollenkaan, koska sniikkaus ei toimi ikinä. Putket ovat kapeat, ammunta hoidetaan rambomaisen suoraselkäisesti ja healthbar on tehnyt comebackin.
