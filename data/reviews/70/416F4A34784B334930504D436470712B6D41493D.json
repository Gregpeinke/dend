If you don't like that, then you won't like this. It's also jank as fuck but it doesn't ruin the experience for me, but it might for players who don't like that. Also this game is hard as shit. I'm not exactly an expert gamer:tm: so I had to play on easy for me to get anywhere at all, so keep that in mind and even then I save-scummed alot.\n\nI like most of the weapons that aren't the shotgun since they're fun and they get their use in most situations (except the shotgun). The sound-mixing is really good at creating that atmosphere. There are also little things that I really like such as the dialogue from the npcs or the fact that the ai for the human enemies is actually pretty smart, creating a good challenge. \n\nHas a few flaws that are definitely noticeable. First is the lack of subtitles, which can be modded in, but if you do, the save files for the original game will not be compatible so you will have to start over with the mod specifically. I think that valve should've added a patch with subtitles in the game itself considering it's been over 20 years. Xen and the final boss are the jankiest of the jank in the whole game with bad platforming being a core element of these last few stages. Chapter 7 + 8 are probably my least favorite outside Xen because I think the enemy from c7 should've been slightly nerfed (not a fan of it in general) and c8 is slow as fuck and kinda boring. The fact that the guard and scientist models are mostly the exact same annoys me a bit, especially since there's no women at all in the game. These aspects didn't ruin the game for me, but I probably won't be replaying it soon, though I would still recommend it to players who like challenging shooters with 1998 jank.\n\n","timestamp_created":1596266510,"timestamp_updated":1596266510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73594247","author":{"steamid":"76561198796269946","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2770,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1955,"last_played":1624711690},"language":"russian","review":"super cool game, ya prosto v vostorge ot nee, jalko y menya problemi s ekrnanom v starih igrah :'c tak bi igral v hl.exe HL -- lu4waya game","timestamp_created":1596263327,"timestamp_updated":1596263327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543668150901794434","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73593782","author":{"steamid":"76561199044887919","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":21,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1596286780},"language":"polish","review":"super gra\n","timestamp_created":1596262276,"timestamp_updated":1596262276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73592293","author":{"steamid":"76561198087445316","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1644165402},"language":"spanish","review":"Juego de anteaño pero eso no le quita lo jugable y adictivo que puede ser en la actualidad...","timestamp_created":1596259104,"timestamp_updated":1596259104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73591910","author":{"steamid":"76561198966345376","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":603,"last_played":1621108978},"language":"english","review":"horrendous","timestamp_created":1596258192,"timestamp_updated":1596258192,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73590347","author":{"steamid":"76561198977471850","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":387,"last_played":1636996758},"language":"english","review":"[h1]Absolute garbage.[/h1]\nTerrible level design that goes in circles and has no indication whatsoever of where to go.\nBoring as hell, to think that I've still got FIVE CHAPTERS ahead of me makes me want to die.\nOh, and it's almost impossibly difficult.

Every new FPS had the same formula, with its own stylistic changes, Doom was a Sci Fi game with light horror elements, Duke Nukem 3D was a ode to 80s action flicks, and Quake, while being in 3D, was just Doom with a darker tone. That is in no means a diss to these games, they are all great games from this time period, and my profile picture is Duke Nukem right now for crying out loud, but it was the truth. FPS games hadn't had a real major change in terms of gameplay, and by 1998 it was getting old. You can only go so far rehashing the same type of game before it gets old, and it was very true for the Doom type shooters. \n\nAnd this is where our savior GabeN steps in.\n\nBack in 1996 two former Microsoft developers Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington formed their own Game studio in Valve, and quickly  began work on Half-Life. Releasing in 1998 it was a huge success, surpassing anyone's expectations.  Critics praised it to the sun, and the consumers came out in droves to buy it. Very few game developers can make as big an impact with their first game as Valve did with Half-Life. For example iD software,  the developers of the father of FPS games Doom, started out with the mediocre Commander Keen, a Mario clone for PC, and the successful, but not majorly so Wolfenstein 3D before they got to Doom. Even Nintendo, the most iconic game company of them all, took over a decade to release a hit game, and that is without mentioning the near 90 years before they were making Video Games. But what made this game so huge?\n\nIt may seem hard to believe now, but Half-Life was mind blowing in 1998. This was a FPS game with a great story, great graphics (at the time), and groundbreaking gameplay. The games story seems rather simple today, but back in 1998 this was revolutionary. Remember that this was a time before stories were common in games. Most games, especially first person shooters, would have only the bare minimum of a story, for example Doom's story is basically just Demons break through a portal from hell to a human colony on Mars, and to even know that you would need to read the manual Doom shipped with. I still don't even know what Quake 1's story is supposed to be about, if there even is one. Half-Life did things completely different, by opening the game with a bit of a slow burn tram ride into your work, the Black Mesa Research Facility. Once you get off the train you are met by a Security guard, who may or may not be Barney Calhoun who brings up your running late. You soon run into a scientist who tells you that they are waiting for you in the test chamber in perhaps one of the most unsettling ways possible, which is an excellent use of foreshadowing. Before you head there you must go to your Locker room and grab your HEV suit, and maybe blow up some guys microwave casserole on the way. You arrive at the test chamber shove some alien rock into a machine and then everything goes to utter shit, with you briefly teleporting into an alien world, and return with Black Mesa overrun with aliens, and utter carnage. I won't spoil anymore, as there are a few more twists throughout the campaign that it is best you don't know about if you don't know already. \n\nThe gameplay in Half Life is pretty standard, with a collection of your standard FPS weapons, such as the Pistol, Revolver, Shotgun, Assault Rifle (complete with a scarface style grenade launcher attachment), and a somewhat unique weapon in the crossbow. But before you get any of these, you start with a trusty Crowbar, which has in turn became an iconic part of not just half-life, but Valve as a whole. It's a slow burn to get these weapons, and you don't want to overuse them when you do get them as ammo is limited, so it is best to use the right weapons for the right enemies. There are some more unique weapons in the game as well, but it is best to let you discover those yourself in my opinion. \n\nThe enemies in Half Life are all quite iconic now, with the Headcrab, Valves own version of the Alien Facehuggers, the 'Zombies' which are human corpses take over by said headcrabs, Vortigaunts, which are a really unique alien who can shoot orbs and teleport and an array of others, many of which are best encountered going in blind. \n\nAs you progress through Black Mesa you will come across many scripted events that allow the game to tell its story without forcing you out of the gameplay once which is something that even to this day is unique and quite awesome. \n\nThe graphics were great at the time, but didn't age very well looking back, which is too be expected when returning to a game from over 20 years ago. \n\nAnd if that isn't enough to sell how damn important this game is, release this is the game that the original Counter-Strike was a mod for, and also the game that Team Fortress Classic was a mod for. Both games Valve scooped up and started selling physically with Half-Life in a bundle that lead to this very platform, Steam, created so Valve could keep Counter-Strike and any other games they make up to date easily. \n\nNow no game is perfect and let me get this clear to end this review their are some decently large flaws with this game which boils down to 2 things. The platforming sections, which aren't terrible, but don't really fit in either, and the elephant in the room, the last 2 hours of the game. The platforming is easy to excuse as at the time it wasn't bad and was pretty decent, but it is the section of the game that has aged the worst, the last 2 hours of the game on the other hand, were lackluster even for 1998 standards, and Gabe Newell himself has stated it is the one thing he wish he could change in a Valve game. There are also a few other sections that haven't aged well, most notably the section on a rail, where you need to take an annoying raid on a kart, but aside from these 3 problems, the game has aged very well. \n\nOverall I 100% recommend you play this game, preferably before you play Half-Life 2 which has aged a bit better,  as for $10 normally and as low as  $0.99 on sale it's a no brainer,  where you can't go wrong. I also strongly advise you stay far away from Valve's official Source port of the game Half-Life Source with the exceptions being if your buying the Valve Complete Pack or play Gmod and really want OG Half-Life materials.","timestamp_created":1596244175,"timestamp_updated":1596244360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.387755125761032104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73584498","author":{"steamid":"76561198105064215","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":13389,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12983,"last_played":1629066400},"language":"english","review":"outdated but significant, just like terminator titanic or jurassic park.\nFar from required, but if you wanna dwelve into the lore of video game history (PC), this is a good start, or THE start to be precise as far as mainstream PC gaming in general is concerned. its pretty good 7.5/10 today with that in mind.
