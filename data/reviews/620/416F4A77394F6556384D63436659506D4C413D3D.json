Portal 2 takes place several years after the original Portal, and you and a little robot named wheatly must try to escape the facility. This game has awesome plot-twists for a puzzle game like this, and I reccemend everyone to buy this game, it is worth it. This is now my favorite game and will probably be for a really long time, maybe until a Portal 3 comes out, if it ever does. Please play this game; it is amazing!","timestamp_created":1408236886,"timestamp_updated":1408236886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11745485","author":{"steamid":"76561198066708272","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3648,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3471,"last_played":1483421169},"language":"english","review":"Best Game I have every played.
