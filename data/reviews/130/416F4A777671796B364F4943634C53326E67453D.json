It contains everything which made the other games great: Great level design, terrific puzzles, constant suspense throughout, linearity which gives you freedom, great AI, and the little touches. Since I already expanded on these thoughts in my review of Opposing Force though (and even more so in my review of the main game), I'll like to address other points of discussion. The main argument I hear from people who dislike this game is that it's too short. While it is, indeed, really short,  Opposing Force was also really short compared to the main game (it took me over 32 hours to beat the main game and over 11 hours to beat Opposing Force). In addition, this game only costs 5 dollars, so I wouldn't say it's overpriced. I also heard people complain about a lack of new weapons and enemies, and while I agree with that, I don't think those issues take away a whole lot from this game. I feel like one of the best aspects to this game is its eye for detail. For instance, we get to see the old 1950's Cold War technology and the 1970's labs the scientists used at various points in this game. They are contrasted with the modern technology we see at the beginning of the game. I also liked the story, because while your only goal was to find Dr. Rosenberg and escape Black Mesa, you had to do several side quests such as going to Xen and going underground to complete various tasks in order to get the teleporter working. I thought this was a pretty good structure as it was reminiscent of RPG's in the way of having the main game along with various side quests. I feel like these 2 aspects (and what I mentioned at the beginning) are at the forefront of this game, so I didn't mind the lack of new weapons and enemies. If I had to criticize one thing, it would be the lack of new, interesting insight on the G-Man. He only appears once in this game near the beginning. I heard a couple people theorize that this is because he's uninterested in Barney as he only wanted to escape and wasn't interested in fighting the final bosses like Freeman and Shepard were, but there's no way to know for sure as that's speculation (besides, Shepard did attempt to escape in Opposing Force). I'm not sure if the final scene was caused by the G-Man, but I didn't feel the mysterious beauty of his character like I did in the main game and Opposing Force, so that aspect didn't effect me as much as I was hoping it to. Regardless, I still feel like this game is worth playing, because while it isn't as good as the previous two installments, it still has quite a number of merits.","timestamp_created":1529017719,"timestamp_updated":1529243096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42715480","author":{"steamid":"76561198261279335","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2507,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2496,"last_played":1529650699},"language":"german","review":"Habe Blue Shift neu installiert und nun hakt es und man kann es nicht spielen!\nWarum?\n","timestamp_created":1528963256,"timestamp_updated":1528963256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42704275","author":{"steamid":"76561198114563111","num_games_owned":432,"num_reviews":206,"playtime_forever":332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1619116408},"language":"english","review":"Half Life from the perspective of a Security Officer. \n\nBlue Shift did some stuff a lot better than OpFor.

Просто не так давно прошёл OF долго думал, во что ещё позалипать, скачал сначала одно, потом другое, но что-то не шло. В общем, психанул и снова вернулся в Чёрную Мезу.\nСначала я ожидал, что так как недавно играл в OF, то геймплей и атмосфера должны были надоесть, поэтому к небольшой продолжительности игры относился скорее положительно. Но вот BS пройдена и...мне было мало.\nТеперь собственно об игре.\nИгра повествует о злоключениях обычного охранника Барри Калхуна, очередной рабочий день которого оказался настоящим кругом ада. Новшеств никаких нет, кроме разве что того факта, что броню нужно подбирать с тел своих погибших коллег. Оружие урезали, в частности под нож отправились все органические стволы. Пулимёта и снайперской винтовки тоже нет. Но оно тут и не нужно, так как у меня сложилось ощущение, что эта часть намного легче OF и оригинала. Если там временами на харде переодически очень даже нагибали, то здесь таких моментов не было вообще.\nМалая продолжительность тоже спорная штука. Для фанатов серии типа меня это несомненно минус, ибо хочется ещё больше этих замечательных геймлея и атмосферы. С другой сторы люди, которые просто проходили мимо могут посчитать это плюсом, но в таком случае что они вообще забыли в этой игре?\nИтог:\nВсем фанатам серии однозначно рекомендую. Да, игра порезанная и короткая, но это всё равно звмечательная возможность снова окунуться в потрясающую отмасферу научного комплекса Чёрная Меза, немного пробежаться по миру Зен и насладиться потрясающим гейплеем, пусть и на жалких 3-4 часа.\n8,5\\10","timestamp_created":1527862089,"timestamp_updated":1527862089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42402237","author":{"steamid":"76561198087570173","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1435748257},"language":"english","review":">blue shift\n>doppler effect\n>blue shift moves towards us rather than away as the universe expands\n\nconfirmed hl3 is coming in 2020 when kanye becomes prez dont @ me","timestamp_created":1527763677,"timestamp_updated":1527764559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42393322","author":{"steamid":"76561198137948233","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":24,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24,"last_played":1507361637},"language":"koreana","review":"맥주 말이야..","timestamp_created":1527720275,"timestamp_updated":1527720275,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42364737","author":{"steamid":"76561198000001114","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1517505152},"language":"polish","review":"Co tu dużo mówić.

Bei \"Half-Life: Blue Shift\" handelt es sich um die zweite und auch letzte (Standalone-)Erweiterungen von dem Spiel \"Half-Life\" aus dem Jahr 1998. Unter einer \"Standalone-Erweiterung\" ist dabei ein eigenständiges Spiel gemeint, welches jedoch komplett auf dem Hauptspiel basiert. Um damit die Handlung und Thematik von \"Half-Life: Blue Shift\" nachvollziehen zu können, wird daher empfohlen \"Half-Life\" und gegebenenfalls auch die erste Erweiterung namens \"Half-Life: Opposing Force\" davor gespielt zu haben.\n\n\"Half Life: Blue Shift\" kam Juni 2001 heraus, also fast drei Jahre nach dem Hauptspiel. \"Half-Life\" an sich, als auch die Erweiterung \"Half-Life: Blue Shift\" kann man vor allem in das Genre des Ego-Shooters einsortieren, allerdings besitzt das Spiel auch eine Vielzahl an Rätsel-/Puzzle-, Parcours-/Jump 'n Run-, als auch Adventure-Elementen. Da neben dem Erledigen von Gegnern, auch Hindernisse unter komplexe Situationen bewältigt, wie auch verschiedenste Rätsel gelöst werden müssen, um beispielsweise Türen zu öffnen oder Sprengfallen zu deaktivieren. Die Handlung, wie auch der Stiel von \"Half-Life\" ist sehr Science-Fiction basiert.\n\nDer Protagonist dieser Erweiterung ist ein Sicherheitsangestellter bzw. Wachmann der Forschungseinrichtung \"Black Mesa\". Die Storylines des Hauptspiels und der zwei Erweiterungen spielen zur selben Zeit und am selben Ort, quasi parallel. Der Spieler steuert den Protagonisten namens Barney Calhoun, dessen einziges Ziel einfach nur ist lebend aus der Forschungseinrichtung zu fliehen. Barney wird nun ähnlich wie Dr. Gordon Freeman aus dem Hauptspiel \"Half-Life\" von den außerirdischen Lebewesen konfrontiert.\n\nMeine Persönliche Bewertung nach meinen Kriterien*:\n\nStory 65,75 / 115\nGameplay 15,5 / 40\nGrafik und Gestaltung 10,5 / 25\nSound 5,5 / 30\nAtmosphäre 11,5 / 20\nSonstige Besonderheiten 9,5 / 20\n\n*Bewertungen unterliegen hierbei zusätzlich (1) dem Vergleich zu neueren Spielteilen und (2) aus der Sicht der heutigen Zeit!\n\n\nDa die Erweiterung von der Handlung, als auch spielerisch, sehr ähnlich zu \"Half-Life\" ist, werde ich nur auf explizite Neuerungen in der Standalone-Erweiterung eingehen.\nWie man meiner Bewertung entnehmen kann, ist die Punktzahl besonders bei den Punkten: Gameplay, Grafik wie auch Sound recht negativ. Der Grund dafür ist einfach, dass ich das Spiel nur aus heutiger Sicht bewerten kann. Nicht falsch verstehen. \"Half-Life\" wurde 1998 veröffentlicht. Es ist einfach älter als ICH. Dafür, dass das Spiel noch so eine gewaltige Playerbase, wie auch Fans besitzt, hat es meinen Respekt verdient. Für damalige Zeit war \"Half-Life\" bestimmt sehr revolutionär und was besonderes.\n\nDie Handlung und Umsetzung von \"Half-Life: Blue Shift\" wurde aus meiner Sicht sehr gut umgesetzt. Es wurde sehr viel mit dem Aspekt der Kreuzung zwischen den Games gespielt. So kreuzen sich einige Handlungsstrenge miteinander, sodass man Kern-Situationen aus \"Half-Life\" aus einer anderen Perspektive sieht.\nMeiner Meinung nach ist die Handlung von \"Half-Life: Blue Shift\" im Vergleich zu dem Hauptspiel \"Half-Life\" und der ersten Erweiterung \"Half-Life: Opposing Force\" vom Inhalt her leider am schlechtesten gelungen, da kaum spannungssteigendere Elemente eingebaut wurden. Dies hat vor allem den Grund, dass die Erweiterung genau dort endet, wo das Hauptspiel sich gerade aufbaut. \"Half-Life: Blue Shift\" hätte in dem Fall deutlich mehr Potenzial gehabt. So wirkt es (aus heutiger Sicht und Standpunkt) ein wenig, wie eine notwendige Erweiterung um zwanghaft Charaktere einzuführen.\n\nIn der Grafik wurde in \"Half-Life: Blue Shift\" allerdings einiges aufbereitet. Die Half-Life-Engine hat nämlich ein Update bekommen, wodurch die Polygonanzahl der Charaktermodelle, wie auch Waffen erhöht wurden. Dadurch sehen diese weniger kantig aus. Die Auflösung der Texturen hat sich allerdings nicht verändert.\n\nAbschließend kann ich einfach nur erneut sagen, dass obwohl das Spiel nun mehr als 20 Jahre alt ist, dennoch empfehlenswert ist. Erwartet jedoch nicht extrem viel, da es logischerweise mit heutigen Spielen eher weniger mithalten kann, was es jedoch auch nicht muss. Genießt einfach die Handlung des Spiels!","timestamp_created":1526926674,"timestamp_updated":1619796438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42110064","author":{"steamid":"76561198356149742","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1637531574},"language":"english","review":"The best half-life game in the entire series.

If you don't take the crowbar and just parkour over the boxes you have to quit the game, turn it back on, load the training area again and then get back to that point! Also, they just teached a special manuever that you can use called the \"duck jump\" which you can later just use to bypass an entire obstacle that you were supposed to go underneath of! It still opens the door but it says that you didn't do 2 so, when you're playing it for your first time, you get confused as shit because it literally just taught you how to do that \"trick\".\n\nWell, that's just what you'll get in the tutorial, a broken piece of shit tutorial!
