The Aperture Complex is colossal!!), one of my favorites! What attracted me more to Portal 2 was the mix action+puzzle, with an emphasis on the last one. There are a lot of shooting games, and most of them are quite repetitive, different storylines but very similar mechanics and objectives. So a game such as the Portal series brings this differential, you don't have foes you need to shoot and kill to go on (alright, you've got the drones, but it's not the same), you need to use your smarts to overcome the challenges which (believe me) are pretty fun to figure out \"how the hell am I supposed to solve this puzzle???\". If you like a dynamic game with an intriguing plot, comic characters and dialogues (you'll laugh a lot with Wheatley), and nice puzzles (watch out for the secrets!), dude...
