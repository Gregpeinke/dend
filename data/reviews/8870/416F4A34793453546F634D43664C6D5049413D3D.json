The moment a game takes my decision making away from me, and forces the story in a direction by making my character do something I wouldn't do (when there are dozens of possible alternatives based on the previous game-play mechanics), I lose my suspension of disbelief, and respect for the designer. Unfortunately BioShock did this repeatedly and often.  A mediocre FPS experience is the pimento olive skewering this beautify crafted sandwich. \n\nI would recommend  [b]'Dishonored'[/b] over 'BioShock Infinite'! Both games are set in beautiful fantastic environments, with amazing characters and compelling stories, but in 'Dishonored' I felt like I was in control of my ultimate destiny, and the game-play was much more organic and fluid. I could choose not to do something, and it would not halt my game until I complied.\n\nUltimately, I still finished 'BioShock Infinite', and felt compelled forward by a fantastic story and one of the most satisfying NPC companions I have ever seen in  a game. I truly looked forward to interactions with Elizabeth. The world was fantastic, the music and sound were integrated flawlessly, and the ending was substantial (if not a tiny bit predictable).

Une bonne \"suite\" à la franchise Bioshock. On regrette peut-être une faible durée de vie : 5 à 10h en fonction de la difficulté.\n\n-- Graphismes\n\nGraphiquement, on sent le jeu AAA. Poussé en ultra, on prends plaisir à admirer les décors et les jeux de lumières. En combat, les effets sont très réalistes.\n\n-- Ambiances\n\nQue ce soit en terme de décors, en termes de musiques, on se plonge agréablement dans l'ambiance fin 19eme, début 20ème. Sans trop plongé dans la religion stéréotypé, Bioshock Infinite emmène le joueur dans le fanatisme religieux mélangé à une science poussée au delà de son époque.\n\n-- Gameplay\n\nA la différence de ses prédecesseurs, Bioshock Infinite cherche à simplifier la jouabilité. Malheureusement, cela donne une impression brouillon et austère qui pourra en frustrer plus d'un.

Ein Kumpel von mir war ziemlich begeistert davon und empfahl es mir.\n\nEines vorweg: Man muss die vorherigen Teile nicht gespielt haben um die Geschichte von Infinite zu verstehen.\n\nDie Story kann man nicht zusammenfassen ohne zu spoilern. Eines sei aber gesagt: Nach dem Ende von Infinite wird man sich bestimmt noch Tage danach beschäftigen. Ich selbst musste das Ende mehrmals sehen um zu verstehen was überhaupt passiert ist.\n\nWas mir an Bioshock Infinite am meisten gefiel, war die wundervolle Atmosphäre von Columbia.\n\nZur Atmosphäre trugen zum einen der ungewöhnliche Grafikstil und zum anderen der superschöne Soundtrack bei. Mir persönlich ist die Grafik in einem Spiel eher unwichtig, doch in heutigen Shootern findet man nur noch diesen grau-braunen Farbton in den einzelnen Levels. In Infinite gibt es endlich wieder kräftige Farben und wirkt sehr viel lebendiger.\n\nDer Soundtrack gehört für mich zu den schönsten, die ich je in einem Videospiel hören durfte. Von schön und schiefen Geigen wenn man das erste Mal Columbia in seiner vollen Pracht sieht bis hin zu einem Solo von Elizabeth mit Booker passt alles ins Geschehen.\n\nEin weiterer Plus-Punkt war Elizabeth als Charakter. Sie besitzte nicht nur eine wunderbare Mimik sondern half einem auch im Kampf mit Munition und Gesundheit. Dies hatte zur Folge, dass ich sie in mein Herz schloss und mit ihr leiden und feiern konnte.\n\nWas mir aber den Spielspass fast genommen hatte, war das Gameplay. Es ist nicht mehr als magerer Shooter Durchschnitt à la Call of Battlefield Modern Schiessgewehr. Man läuft, schiesst, geht in Deckung, ladet nach und wiederholt die Schritte. Ein wenig Abwechslung geben die unterschiedlichen Zauberkräfte, sogenannte „Vigors“, das Suchen von Medikits, da es keine Selbstheilung gibt, die Hilfe von Elizabeth und der Skyhook, eine Nahkampfwaffe, mit der man auch an Schienen entlang hängen kann. Diese Dinge machen das Gameplay ein wenig dynamischer.\n\nDas Fazit:\nTrotz des mageren Gameplays, was mich nach 3/4 des Spiels zu Tode langweilte und der fordernde Schwierigkeitsgrad (bei mir auf Normal) hat mich das Spiel trotzdem begeistert und gehört zu meinen absoluten Lieblingsspielen. Es hat sich mehr als gelohnt bis zum Ende durchzuspielen. Wer es noch nicht gespielt oder genug hat von den ganzen Kriegsshootern, der sollte sich Bioshock Infinite unbedingt holen.","timestamp_created":1388403831,"timestamp_updated":1388403831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8425064","author":{"steamid":"76561198043346937","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1017,"last_played":1397582455},"language":"italian","review":"Just another amazing chapter in the Bioshock Saga!

Fucks with your mind, and opens up new possiblities to the entire storyline. Bioshock tackles issues that concern the power of religion, racism, and sexism in western society, and teaches us a powerful point of the fragility of western institutions to changes in time, space, and revolution.","timestamp_created":1388390901,"timestamp_updated":1388390901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8421015","author":{"steamid":"76561197998557777","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1972,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":897,"last_played":1407860403},"language":"english","review":"Wow, I've never played a Bioshock game before, and now I'm wondering why. \n\nIn Bioshock Infinite, you are tasked with \"rescuing\" a girl from the flying City of Columbia in order to repay your debts. \n\nExcellent story and great game for any Steam punk themed game, or single player FPS game. Totally Engrossing and I highly recommend it. \n\nI bought this for $14.99 on Steam flash sale and is totally worth it, even at full price is worth every penny.","timestamp_created":1388389913,"timestamp_updated":1388389913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8420742","author":{"steamid":"76561198027023442","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":942,"last_played":1389987297},"language":"english","review":"Easily one of the best games I've ever played.

It wasn't the gameplay that made it good but rather the intense and mind-f***ing story. The gunplay wasn't the best but it was tolerable and could be very fun and satisfying with mixing in vigors to your combat. If you haven't played the first or second one it won't be a problem because the story is completely different. Over all loved it and may be buying the dlc soon.","timestamp_created":1388386723,"timestamp_updated":1388386723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y4STocMCfLmPIA=="}
