una expansion bastante buena de Half-Life.\nLa historia es algo simple, eres uno de los militares enviados a destruir a Gordon y los aliens, pero previsiblemente algo sale mal y, como ya es costumbre en Half-Life y sus expansiones, te desmayas y apareces cuando todo se ha salido de control, y tu objetivo es escapar, no aporta nada nuevo al universo de Half-Life, pero es funcional, así que no tengo nada de lo que quejarme.\nEn terminos de jugabilidad es donde se encuentra el cambio más substancial, ya que si bien es igual a la del juego original, aquí añadieron armas nuevas y cambiaron las viejas, al punto de que se añadieron mecanicas nuevas relacionadas estas nuevas armas, lo cual genera un cambio no muy grande, pero que se agradece, y, sorprendentemente, arreglaron un error del que me quejé en el juego original y Blue Shift, que es la linterna, que funcionaba mal, aquí eso lo \"arreglaron\" al cambiarla a una vision nocturna bastante eficaz, pero de resto sigue igual.\nDe resto es igual al juego original, así que no tengo queja.\nUna buena expansion, aunque pudo ser mejor en terminos de guion, pero aun con eso lo recomiendo.","timestamp_created":1628717406,"timestamp_updated":1628717406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97379127","author":{"steamid":"76561198452738833","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":384,"last_played":1628707097},"language":"english","review":"Good

Bunlar, Black Mesa’nın yüzeyindeki önemli konumlara büyük kamplar kurarlar ve birlikler halinde tesisin derinliklerine inerler. Fakat uzaylı yaratıklara karşı fazla direnemezler ve işi ellerine yüzlerine bulaştırırlar. Alınan raporları göz önünde bulunduran hükümet, HECU’nun geri çekilmesini ister. Kalan askeri personel geldiği gibi giderken, onların yerine profesyonel suikastçılar gönderilir. Bu suikastçıların amacı Black Mesa’nın ana bölümlerini ele geçirmek ve durumu bir nebze olsun kontrol altına almaktır.

This expansion puts you into the boots of Corporal Adrian Shepherd who arrives at the Black Mesa facility after the horrid accident a bit late with his unit without knowing that their mission is to silence every personnel, while Gordon is already halfway through the facility on his way to Lambda Core.\n\n[i]\"So, Corporal Shepherd we meet at last\"[/i] - Gman\n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]\n- The training is really unique and fun to complete, so I advise you not to skip it.\n- Very well integrated with the original storyline\n- Some segments of the campaign are quite memorable\n- Seeing the Black Mesa accident from another perspective\n- The soundtrack is a banger\n- Some new great characters\n- The voice acting is still as great as in the original\n- Same gameplay as the original Half-Life with some new features\n- Unique enemies [i](Mutated zombies, Race X aliens etc.)[/i]\n- Weapons will be the same as in the original, but with new additions [i](Deagle, Wrench, M249 etc.)[/i]\n- All the maps are well designed\n\n[b][u]Neutral:[/u][/b]\n- Not really that long, 4-5 hours only, but for an expansion, it's pretty much okay\n- There is multiplayer, which is dead, but it's most likely the same as the original with different maps and the weaponry, it's a pity really.\n- For some reason when I had allies with me, they tended to shoot me for no reason at all\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n- HD models changes weapon models just like in the original, from an MP5 to an M16 for example. Just turn it off, it ruins the art style a bit.\n- Few bugs, like being stuck at some places\n- When you hit a loading zone trigger and a music is playing, it will just cut off.\n\n[b][u]Canon or not:[/u][/b]\nI personally think that Opposing Force can very much be canon. If you think about it for a second, the appearance of Race X aliens, Gordon could've not seen them as he was already inside Xen at the time when Shepherd and his unit has just arrived at Black Mesa and only after then Race X aliens started invading Earth alongside Xen aliens and a bit later Shepherd has stopped Race X from invading Earth any longer. Shepherd has been in stasis ever since and Valve missed a huge potential for sure.\n\n[b]10/10[/b] Overall this DLC, or well expansion for its time, is a must have if you are a Half-Life fan or if you just started playing the series.\n\n[b][u]My Reviews About Other Half-Life Games:[/u][/b]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBeggarSoldier/recommended/70?snr=1_5_9__402]Half-Life Review[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBeggarSoldier/recommended/130?snr=1_5_9__402]Half-Life: Blue Shift[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBeggarSoldier/recommended/220?snr=1_5_9__402]Half-Life 2 Review[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBeggarSoldier/recommended/380?snr=1_5_9__402]Half-Life 2: Episode One[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBeggarSoldier/recommended/420?snr=1_5_9__402]Half-Life 2: Episode Two[/url]","timestamp_created":1628232925,"timestamp_updated":1628270806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.727471113204956055","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97029104","author":{"steamid":"76561198383736086","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":597,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":597,"last_played":1628231049},"language":"schinese","review":"【解决win10闪退的方法：游戏全程开大写锁定】\n半条命1的扩展内容，新增了多种有意思的武器，游戏内容设计上不输HL1，且加入了一些创新玩法。游戏后期难度很大，补给经常不够，对玩家技术要求很大。作为一款老游戏，现在玩起来依然觉得很有意思，非常好评。","timestamp_created":1628231252,"timestamp_updated":1628231252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581749081611633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97028582","author":{"steamid":"76561198345347959","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":99,"last_played":1659276666},"language":"schinese","review":"巴尼逃脱，是一种庆幸\n戈登脱离，是一种希望与探索。\n然而对地球来说。老谢才是真正的英雄！","timestamp_created":1628230337,"timestamp_updated":1628674702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.667428433895111084","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97019080","author":{"steamid":"76561198370710257","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":294,"last_played":1628213362},"language":"brazilian","review":"Embora eu tenha gostado de Blue Shift, agora entendo os comentários que o comparam a Opposing Force.

With a new main character (Adrian Shephard, a US Marine Corporal) being sent into Black Mesa along with other soldiers, to kill the scientists of Black Mesa, which is seen in the original game. A simple, yet interesting plot that keeps the story moving.\n\nNew additions include more weapons of various types, some of which are rarely used, along with new enemies that become very common as the game progresses. Some new weapons include the pipe wrench and combat knife, both serving as replacements to the crowbar; the displacer cannon, which can be used to teleport to a secret area which normally has health, armor, and weapon pick-ups, or can be used in a similar way to the BFG from Doom; and my personal favorite weapon, the spore launcher, which is essentially a grenade launcher with the ability to launch somewhat slow bouncing grenades.\n\nThe length of the game is quite short unfortunately, only lasting me about 4-5 hours on both of my playthroughs.
