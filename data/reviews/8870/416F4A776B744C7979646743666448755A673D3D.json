MAKER做过龙枪的游戏。\n\n然而仅此而已，因为一些原因，我还是没能走上游戏制作这条路。\n\n后来我玩了很多游戏，也经常从设计的角度去想，这个游戏哪里做得好，哪里还需要改进，哪里沿用了前人的优秀设计……说不定在内心深处，玩到好作品的时候，还是会想着，自己会有机会做出来这样的作品吧。\n\n即使是在国内游戏市场被垃圾页游充斥，以及后来的大规模低质量的轻度手游大行其道的时候，也一样。\n\n直到我通关了《生化奇兵：无限》。\n\n当时的感受是四个字：叹为观止。\n\n深深的震撼自不必说，然而同时伴随而来的是强烈的失落感。\n\n坐在电脑前一动不动，我看完了全部的片尾制作人员表。\n\n想到做这么一款游戏所需要的高度，我怕是此生没有办法达到了。\n\n且不说数百人的团队和上亿美元的预算，仅仅是策划这么个游戏所需要的文学素养、经验、知识储备，都让我觉得高不可及。\n\n更遑论做这样的游戏，光专业度还不够，还需要极高的天赋。不止要有专家，还要有天才。\n\n或许从现在开始努力还来得及，只是我当时已经选定了另一座需要用毕生之力来攀登的山峰。\n\n人生苦短哪！不可能遍历这世上所有高峰，哪怕只是其中的一座，也不知道能不能到得了顶点。\n\n看到有人走到了自己曾想着要达到却最后没有上路的地方，只能羡慕一下，然后继续做自己的事情吧。即使是失落，也是这个过程中不可避免的一部分。\n\n只是那天看着制作人名单的时候，脑海里飘过了老男孩的歌词。\n\n当初的愿望实现了吗\n\n事到如今只好祭奠吗\n\n任岁月风干理想\n\n再也找不回真的我\n\n抬头仰望这漫天星河\n\n那时候陪伴我的那颗\n\n这里的故事你是否还记得\n\n\n还是要感谢这个创造了天空之城哥伦比亚的制作组，虽然已经不复存在，但或许还有许多人跟我一样，因为他们，才在此生此世有机会看到，自己的愿望，已经有人实现了吧。\n\n\n高山仰止，景行行止，虽不能至，心向往之。","timestamp_created":1479957481,"timestamp_updated":1479957481,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27003709","author":{"steamid":"76561198183597241","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6822,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2078,"last_played":1641136427},"language":"schinese","review":"终于等到DLC半价了~Elizabeth，我回来了~~~","timestamp_created":1479957479,"timestamp_updated":1479957479,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27003698","author":{"steamid":"76561198280802349","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":639,"last_played":1505900898},"language":"schinese","review":"“带给我们那个女孩，你的债务一笔勾销。”布克·德维特打开盒子，里面是一个手枪、一张照片、一把钥匙，狂风暴雨中一座灯塔的轮廓依稀可见。布克爬上木质码头，朝灯塔走去，一个男人，一座灯塔，一个城市。总是如此","timestamp_created":1479957475,"timestamp_updated":1479957475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27003695","author":{"steamid":"76561198044820429","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3036,"last_played":1566676112},"language":"russian","review":"Самый

But I was wrong. The game has barely begun and the cracks begin to show in the perfect seeming of Columbia. In the same way that BS2 was an adequate spiritual successor to the first and expanded upon the 'choice' motif, so is this a fair successor to each of the previous installations. In fact, Infinite is better than BS2 on almost every level and succeeds in exploring these themes in a much more satisfying, poignant way than BS2.\n\nIn the first: a man chooses, a slave obeys. What is a choice; can you choose; is choice an illusion? Do your choices even matter?\nIn the second: how does intention effect choice; do your intentions matter if things start to go amiss? Can you still make a different choice? Can things that have been broken be repaired? Or is anything ever truly broken?\nAnd in Infinite: both of those sets of themes are explored throughout, culminating in the best ending in the series. \n\nIf this game were the end of the series, this game would be a fully satisfying conclusion. A must-play for fans of the series.","timestamp_created":1479953682,"timestamp_updated":1479953714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26987669","author":{"steamid":"76561197967965462","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1507,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1507,"last_played":1424718384},"language":"english","review":"WoW","timestamp_created":1479953486,"timestamp_updated":1479953486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26987617","author":{"steamid":"76561198109887731","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1081,"last_played":1503193291},"language":"brazilian","review":"História sensacional!! 10/10","timestamp_created":1479953475,"timestamp_updated":1479953475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26987251","author":{"steamid":"76561198020511150","num_games_owned":488,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1045,"last_played":1614719348},"language":"russian","review":"Это Bioshock - и этим все сказано.\n\n- Незабываемый сюжет.\n- Отличный и разнообразный геймплей.\n- Красочный ми приправленный сочной графикой.\n- Уникальные персонажи.\n\nПроект, который никогда не забудется и будет примером хороших игр с большой буквы.","timestamp_created":1479953389,"timestamp_updated":1479953389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26986865","author":{"steamid":"76561198086120853","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1392,"last_played":1466852462},"language":"english","review":"100% Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!”  or I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye Award\nThis is the most impressive game i have ever played.What a masterpiece","timestamp_created":1479953292,"timestamp_updated":1479953331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26986788","author":{"steamid":"76561198208973735","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":672,"last_played":1606736826},"language":"english","review":"This game reminds me of the KKK, and not the good kind.\n\nEDIT: A year later, and I still get flashbacks\nEDIT 2: Two years later, and I still get flashbacks\nEDIT 3: Four years later, and I still get flashbacks","timestamp_created":1479953273,"timestamp_updated":1602714737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26986480","author":{"steamid":"76561197970150321","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1478,"last_played":1404615195},"language":"english","review":"This is the best game in bioshock series.

É bem legal para quem jogou o primeiro Bioshock entender como tudo chegou até aquela situação, então recomendo.","timestamp_created":1479952619,"timestamp_updated":1479952883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26984028","author":{"steamid":"76561198093343515","num_games_owned":369,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":3343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2364,"last_played":1630979547},"language":"english","review":"I love this game \nMore than you\nI love this game\nSo do you\n\nPlay this game\nDay and Night\nPlay this game\nIts alright\n\nSkyhook Grapple\nTo the rail\nSkyhook Grapple\nHelps you bail\n\nComstock\nComstock\nGood at math\nComstock\nComstock\nDrowned in bath\n\nBuy this games\nIts not free\nBut you will like it \nYou will see \n\n","timestamp_created":1479952611,"timestamp_updated":1479952611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26983814","author":{"steamid":"76561198056099302","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1461,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":980,"last_played":1554918239},"language":"russian","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1479952565,"timestamp_updated":1479952565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26982892","author":{"steamid":"76561198082786019","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":503,"last_played":1479085528},"language":"schinese","review":"玩了8个小时，一次性通关,结局简直让我快！要！爆！炸！顺便伊丽莎白女神！！！！！！！！！！","timestamp_created":1479952337,"timestamp_updated":1479952337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26982708","author":{"steamid":"76561198105242797","num_games_owned":447,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1451,"last_played":1483838605},"language":"english","review":"ye","timestamp_created":1479952294,"timestamp_updated":1479952294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26982194","author":{"steamid":"76561197984411213","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":922,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":922,"last_played":1428045358},"language":"english","review":"One the best written stories I've ever experienced in a game.

It might be slightly confusing as to what's going on a few hours in, but it'll kick in. You have to pay attention foremost. Irrational Games went a different route in scenery this time. Although the creepy, dark atmosphere and enemies of Rapture is what made BioShock 1 & 2 so great, you're now in the clouds. And it looks beautiful. Add the soundtrack and it's double that. \n\nGameplay is similar to what you're used to in most types of shooters. You have a array of spells called vigors and you can cast them in combination to get a desired effect. There's weapons too and while you do need to shoot your way out of situations, they're not as exciting as using vigors.\n\nElizabeth is extremely smart and proves to be a very helpful self-dependant ally. So no, don't worry about being a Leon from RE4.\n\nTop voice acting, a story that is better than anything Hollywood can ever come up with and fluid gameplay. If you want to play one of the best single players, get Infinite.","timestamp_created":1479948748,"timestamp_updated":1479948748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56493079662322998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26967016","author":{"steamid":"76561198060688737","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1469,"last_played":1472533940},"language":"schinese","review":"进入哥伦比亚 使用抓钩和超酷的活素技能来战斗的第一人称射击游戏 \n简单说这游戏的话 就是 神作啊～～～ 一定要玩玩啊～～～","timestamp_created":1479948679,"timestamp_updated":1479948679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534883737564086914","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26966645","author":{"steamid":"76561198059929169","num_games_owned":816,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":2230,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2088,"last_played":1656820556},"language":"english","review":"Yes.
