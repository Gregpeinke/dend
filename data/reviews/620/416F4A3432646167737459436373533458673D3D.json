I actually never played a game where i have to use my brain before xD but seriously this game just makes you want to keep playing when u're done with an chamber . I just didn't understood the story\ni'm at the point where this thing which saved me at the beginning becamed the boss and he's still helping me right now even he wanted to kill me... now he can't handle anything as a boss which is so funny xDDD but I'm really curious what happens next\nbut everyone who see this: just get this shit :D you just feel majestic if you're done with an  difficult level ^.^ btw this game has no action at all, you just have to use your brain to get forward :) \n\n\n\n////EDIT///// SPOILER ALERT!!!!\n\nI'm done with this game now and seriously this game was so cool :D  I  just realised that there's no real story in this game. You just have to keep playin some chambers until you're getting to the roboter at the beginning which helped you, just to take the potatogirl back in her position as the boss. \n\nI played 7 hours instead and the game is done now.","timestamp_created":1470904910,"timestamp_updated":1471341393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24820684","author":{"steamid":"76561198073143108","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":1043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":735,"last_played":1646956208},"language":"english","review":"Fun","timestamp_created":1470890907,"timestamp_updated":1643662141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24820641","author":{"steamid":"76561198125753367","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1419,"last_played":1620236594},"language":"english","review":"Now since its and old game i am gonna make a short review.\nPortal 2 is a fun cooperative game for 2 people.You can also choose to play singleplayer which has an amazing story line and its really fun.The game has great graphics and soundtrack.You can sometimes pass a certain level in multiple ways which is also interesting.\nGraphics 10/10\nSoundtrack 8.5/10\nGameplay 10/10\nOverall:\n10/10 I really recommend this game to people who like solving puzzles but with a twist. :)\nEdit:I just finished the game the end was amazing this is THE most interesting,funny and challenging puzzle game there is.And again i 1000% recommend it it is worth every cent.","timestamp_created":1470890630,"timestamp_updated":1470997635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24820588","author":{"steamid":"76561198073356368","num_games_owned":345,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":4871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4096,"last_played":1654093976},"language":"russian","review":"Тортик ложь!!!","timestamp_created":1470890040,"timestamp_updated":1470890040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24817443","author":{"steamid":"76561198177580802","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":969,"last_played":1467484786},"language":"brazilian","review":"este jogo é maravilhoso em todos os aspectos vale muito a pena comprar, porem recomendo jogar o primeiro se quiser entender a historia","timestamp_created":1470867795,"timestamp_updated":1470867795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24816645","author":{"steamid":"76561198166804912","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":519,"last_played":1538014022},"language":"english","review":"Another Legendary Game By Valve That Everyone Should Have The Pleasure Of Playing","timestamp_created":1470863852,"timestamp_updated":1470863852,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24815667","author":{"steamid":"76561198027592492","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1366,"last_played":1480336951},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очень понравилась !\nЖду Portal 3 ) Ну конечно врятли будет 3 чаcть игры.","timestamp_created":1470859563,"timestamp_updated":1482664524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49773755669593811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24815275","author":{"steamid":"76561198026344607","num_games_owned":372,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":385,"last_played":1471725963},"language":"english","review":"Normally i am not into puzzles and closed area but this game is good.

Portal 2. For those of you who have already seen my Portal review, you know what I think about the Portal franchise. Portal is a great game, with some frustrating parts. Portal 2 follows that same level of difficulty, but change GREAT, to AMAZING. First of all, our villain(s) are great. The voice acting is great once again, as are the characters. True, it is just the cores, Glados, Wheatly, and Cave Johnson and Carolin, but all of them with the exception of Carolin which I'll get to later are all geat. The game follows the same rutine that you did last time. Except the game visually looks MUCH BETTER. You can see this in the ruins of the old testing chambers and the ending cut scene. Now do you remember in the last game where you run from Glados, only to reach Glados? Well, in this game you do the same thing, until you reach Glados, who reawakens at the beginning of the game. You see, you've been traveling with Wheatly this whole time. A lovable robot with a great voice and personality. You then get to Glados, and replace her from full control to Wheatly.  At the time, you think it's a great idea, until Wheatly does his laugh. He then promptly throws you and Glados out of the facility, giving you 18+ more stages to play! And while Glados scolds you for being stupid, you feel like it's your fault, and it is! But now the game is flipped. Wheatly and Glados have swapped, and she has become, A POTATO BATTERY. Well then. You then go through all these levels, where new mechanics are introduced. And durring these levels, you not only find out more about Apature curtesy of Cave Johnson's voice, you also find out that Glados is Carolin! You then finally make it back to Wheatly, and then have to endure a similar fight to the last game! BUT IN REVERSE. See with last time, you had to knock cores off of a defenseless Glados with rockets, slowly currupting herself, making her explode. Now here, you want to put cores onto Wheatly. Now you may actually want to listen to these cores for once, as they are hilarious. Namely Space Core. Now here, you do the same thing, but Wheatly defends himself! Anyway, the game \"ends\" with Wheatly being sent to the moon, Glados being back in control, and Chel being sent away out of Apature. Now with online mode, or Co-op, you go through hard levels. Now, your experience is best with friends or having a mic, because believe me, people do troll here. And lastly, the level creator. I'm a fan of this in concept, but my computer just doesn't agree with the controls. If you can get more out of this mode, well more power to you. Overall, I think that Portal 2 is an amazing game.","timestamp_created":1470604425,"timestamp_updated":1473105586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24766132","author":{"steamid":"76561198276009531","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":889,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":572,"last_played":1467220524},"language":"english","review":"good
