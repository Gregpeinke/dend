Portal does a great job telling it's limited story through the use of enviromental clues as well as interaction with the ever-present AI, GLADoS. While not deep, it's quite solid backdrop for a puzzle game that in essense just has you moving from room to room. \n\nAtmosphere: GLADoS make this game. Here \"interactions\" really develop a sense of character  and make you want to hear what she says next. Additionally, the facility is peppered with extra touches to make it feel believable.\n\nTutorial: This game eases you into the concept of Portals very seamlessly. Since it's a testing facility, it's natural to have the first few test be basics and then build from there. The main reason this is important in Portal is that the way 3D space it used (by making Portals) isn't natural to the real world and takes some practice to train the brain. \n\nGraphics: Very nice for a puzzle game. It's basically a tweaked Half-Life 2 engine so of course it's gonna look pretty (even now). The testing rooms feels appropiately sterile and labratory-ish but other areas are equally well designed to convey it's intended feeling. \n\nSound: Honestly, the sounds are fine but there aren't too many to worry about in the controlled enviroments. Some key sounds are used to clue the player in on actions happening out of sight. But mostly, GLADos's synthetic voice is a pefect blend of realism and synthetic. \n\nLength: It was shorter than I expected but not so short that I didnt feel like it was a full game. Although I imagine milelage might vary depending on how quickly the puzzles are solved. \n\n Diffficulty: Not too hard. Know what to do is never really a problem but know HOW to do it another thing. Generally, there weren't any parts that were too complicated to figure out.\n\nReplay: The main story doesn't really warrant repeat play but the addition of achievements and a developer commentary mode make replay worth considering. Additionally, there are challenge rooms that extend the play value. \n\nVERDICT: Worth it! Fun! Do it!\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1402866401,"timestamp_updated":1402866401,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10486344","author":{"steamid":"76561198096763118","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":11550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":34,"playtime_at_review":876,"last_played":1659937822},"language":"english","review":"Portal is an awesome game and I hope you make a mod for portal.

Un original juego de puzzles experimental que fue incluido en la ''Orange Box'', en un pack junto a ''Team Fortress 2'' y ''Half Life 2: Episodio 1 y 2''. Es un juego creado por Valve, por lo tanto lo único que puedes esperar es calidad, pero como ya he dicho fue un experimento, por lo tanto es muy corto y te deja con ganas de más, pero por suerte tiene una secuela.\n\nLo primero que notas cuando llevas unos minutos jugando el juego es que no se trata de algo que ya hayas jugado antes, es totalmente distinto, un sistema de puzzles basado en portales en el cual se juega con las leyes de la física. El juego se desarrolla en un complejo de pruebas de una empresa llamada Aperture Science y básicamente es ir pasando pruebas de lógica siendo guiados por una inteligencia artificial la cual es propensa a hacer chistes. Utiliza el motor gráfico ''Source'', no se ve mal, pero se le notan los años al ser un juego de 2007. El juego implementa un sistema de físicas como el de ''Half Life 2'', pero en este juego hay menos objetos que coger, igualmente en algunos puzzles se tiene que utilizar. Portal no tiene ni una cutscene en todo el juego, cosa que a mi personalmente me encanta ya que hace que la historia se desenvuelva más fluidamente y natural. Tampoco tiene tutoriales, simplemente aparecen un par de indicaciones al principio para enseñarte los controles, otro punto a favor, ya que no te atosiga con tutoriales y deja que te busques la vida para resolver los puzzles, sin ninguna pista. El doblaje al español es bueno, aunque hay pocos diálogos los pocos que hay son brillantes, siguiendo el dicho: ''Si vas a romper el silencio, que sea solo para mejorarlo''. La atmosfera es increíble, haciéndote sentir que estás observado en todo momento y que eres el conejillo de indias de alguien. Otro factor a destacar es su gran antagonista, del cual te vas a enamorar desde el primer momento.\n\nUn defecto de Portal es su escasa duración, pudiéndotelo pasar a lo sumo en 2 horas más o menos, cosa por otra parte comprensible, ya que fue un exitoso experimento para ver si el sistema de puzzles funcionaba y gustaba a los jugadores. Si buscas algo para estar jugando semanas este no es tu juego. Otro factor que también puede resultar negativo es que no tiene mucha historia, pero a mi parecer esto no es un problema, ya que la jugabilidad es lo que te dejará enganchado de principio a fin y la poca que tiene es muy interesante. Si te gusta Portal y quieres lo mismo pero con más historia juega su segunda parte.\n\nFinalmente concluiré con que Portal es uno de los juegos más originales de la historia, un juego emblemático con frases míticas y momentos únicos, una experiencia corta pero intensa. Una obra maestra y clásico del gaming de PC.","timestamp_created":1402548620,"timestamp_updated":1403197492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10434510","author":{"steamid":"76561198095640298","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":386,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":242,"last_played":1591044894},"language":"english","review":"Amazig 10/10 the brain teasing and mix up is amazing and suprizingly i managed to beat the game in only 2.4 hours.","timestamp_created":1402541257,"timestamp_updated":1402541257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10434327","author":{"steamid":"76561198124592304","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":100,"playtime_forever":358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":289,"last_played":1597710516},"language":"english","review":"Love it\n","timestamp_created":1402539583,"timestamp_updated":1402539583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10433803","author":{"steamid":"76561198122354553","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":229,"last_played":1398383949},"language":"russian","review":"Игра супер!

I picked this up in a steam sale for around £4, and I can safely say it has been worth it. The level design is well thought out and ever increasing in difficulty, (I must admit I had to look up solutions to 1 or 2 levels) and the \"storyline\" fits well with the game. There is also a lot of lore and speculation surrounding this game (i.e. who is Chell and the Ratburn crap) which makes for an ever more immersive game experience. And as for GLaDOS... Well... Witty, funny, clever and psychotic are just a few adjectives that describe her. The later levels give off a feeling of... Eeriness... Like you're being watched... Well you are of course but it still has a feeling of tension as you break out of the chamber and advance though the empty pipeworks and offices surrounding Aperture. My only complaint is that there isn't that much content. I completed this game in 1 sitting after 5 hours... I know there is advanced maps and challenge runs etc. but still not a lot of gameplay time. Having said that this is still a game I would recommend to anyone who likes other Valve games (and who enjoys Valve's sense of humour and immersive gameplay). I would give this game 7/10 because although it's a great game with 8/10 visuals (even for my cardboard PC) the content lacks which is why I would recommend also getting Portal 2 which has more content.","timestamp_created":1402431058,"timestamp_updated":1402431058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10420156","author":{"steamid":"76561198062195752","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1404147072},"language":"english","review":"OMG.

Sem falar que a curva de aprendizado é simplesmente perfeita.\n\nÉ o jogo excencial para qualquer gamer.\n\nVale 5/5 Tomb Raiders","timestamp_created":1402098281,"timestamp_updated":1402098281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10373845","author":{"steamid":"76561198093314289","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":305,"last_played":1436027205},"language":"turkish","review":"Hikaye: 10/10\nOynanış: 7/10\nGrafik: 4/10\n\nSONUÇ: 7/10","timestamp_created":1402096834,"timestamp_updated":1419064566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10363147","author":{"steamid":"76561198118351572","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1603153932},"language":"english","review":"YOU SHOOT AN ORANGE HOLE, SHOOT AGAIN GET A BLUE ONE.
