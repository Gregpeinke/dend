A game that has a man with glasses and a ponytail shooting aliens. Now for the people that aren't hard for shooting aliens, you can also shoot middle-aged men in security outfits and old men in lab coats.\n\nThis is not the original Half-Life. This is instead a Source port of Half-Life. This game was to tell a good story with the FPS gameplay and puzzles, however the game I received involved Gabe \"Gaben\" Newell introducing me to \"Half-Life\" by telling me, and I quote: \"Welcome to Team Fortress 2...\" and that's when I knew, I didn't have Half-Life.\n\nI received this through an email from Gabe Newell himself and the subject was \"The Game you Always Desired!\" and that's when my jaw dropped. I LOVE Valve and to receive an email from Gabe himself made me extremely excited, and him recommending me a game that I \"Always Desired\" made me INCREDIBLY joyous.\n\nHowever, the file was \"Half-Life: Source.exe\" and that's when I thought, \"Hey, hold up! I've played Half-Life before today.\" I scratched my noggin and shrugged my shoulders. I honestly don't know how Gabe Newell could send a file bigger than 25MB on Gmail when 25MB is Gmail's file size limit, but I assume it's because he is the God of all Gods.\n\nAnyway, as I said. I started up the file and was greeted by a black screen and had Gabe's soulful voice, with reverb, fill my ears. \"Welcome to Team Fortress 2...\" and that's when the screen showed actual textures. This wasn't Half-Life, nor Source, nor GoldSrc. This was, to my knowledge, Unreal Engine 4. This wasn't the Valve I once knew. Why would Gabe use Unreal Engine 4 and not, say, Source/Source 2? It stated at the bottom of the email in [b]bold[/b] and [i]italics[/i] \"I used Unreal Engine 4 because, Source 2 wasn't ready and Source and GoldSrc was too old for me: Gaben.\"\n\nSo, I was on my toes this time. Obviously not literally. But, my screen showed barely visable textures with a very bright light shrouding it, the textures barely visible. I had to wear special [b]Special Gamer Sunglasses for Pro Gamers™[/b] to make it slightly bearable. By this point, I lost track of what Gabe was saying, from the part I heard it went something like \"...special light functions that we have delightfully stolen from Unreal Engine 4 and sprinkled into Source 2...\" and something along the lines of \"...Source can't actually do this. Source is too old and is not what it once was to handle lighting like this...\". I finally listened to what he was saying fully. And that's when the lighting presentation ended. I could finally take off the [b]Special Gamer Sunglasses for Pro Gamers™[/b]...for now at least.\n\nI pressed the W key and walked forward. Gabe told me how \"this game is revolutionary and will revolutionize the Team Fortress franchise...\". I squinted my eyes. This was not Half-Life. I thought that the audio clip at the start, the \"Welcome to Team Fortress 2...\" clip, was a mistake. A glitch, so to say. Anyway, this may've still been a glitch, but it's happened twice which, when it comes to Gabe and Valve, is unlikely.\n\nPutting on my [b]Special Gamer Glitch Glasses for Pro Gamers™[/b], which can detect whether something's a glitch, or intentional. They detected that this, this was intentional. However, this is NOT Team Fortress 2. This didn't have the Team Fortress 2 art style, and the file name had nothing to do with Team Fortress, nor TF2. This file name was, as mentioned above, \"Half-Life Source.exe\". So, at that point, I was confused.\n\nI continued on to the weapon & shooting showcase and it dropped me in an area, literally dropped me in, that looked like Black Mesa. I had to fight against bots, with an angry Gabe shouting in my ear; the reverb of his voice increased, becoming deafening. He shouted things like, \"GO ON! SHOOT THAT DAMN HEADCRAB!\" and, \"YEAH YOU STUPID VORTIGAUNT! TAKE THAT! YEAH!\" he was getting louder until I had to eventually take off my headphones.\n\nI finally completed the fighting showcase and my heart was pounding. Fast forward to the end of the demonstration and a bright light fills my screen. It was a Headcrab that swallowed a bulb that latched onto my head. The screen was white, Gabe's voice: inaudible. And then, a flash. Half-Life 3's logo. Was this a promo for Half-Life 3? Maybe. But, why did it mention Team Fortress 2? Perhaps it was a joke mod. But, it can't be. It was sent by Gabe Newell himself. So, I'm unsure.\n\nAll in all, Half-Life: Source is a good port.","timestamp_created":1462998932,"timestamp_updated":1532712791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22907223","author":{"steamid":"76561198141017124","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":650,"last_played":1578154906},"language":"russian","review":"Крутая игра, понравилась мне тем что нужно проходить миссии, и уже за несколько лет прошел игру 3 раза, был бы момент сел бы и прошел 4 раз, а пока я останусь в роли G-man загадочного персонажа всей франшизы полураспада.

But not in half life. The puzzles are tough and not thoroughly explained, so I found myslef checking the walkthrough often (FYI, I am stupid). I still found it fun, and the platforming wan't overly impossible. What I liked most about HL was the combat. In CoD or some other modern shooter, you crouch behind a wall for 5 seconds and your bullet holes magicaly heal themselves. In Half Life, you can get knocked down to 2 health with no medkits nearby. It is then that the stakes are raised higher than any spunk-gargle weewee shooter(From [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuNN1D-FCjs]Zero Punctuation[/url]). You have to fight your way to a medkit while avoiding any kind of damage, since a tiny papercut to your pinky will kill you. Then when you finaly get said medkit, it gives a sense of accomplishment that you can never get from gunning down countless foriengers from behind a brown chest-high wall.\n\nOverall, a very fun game and a good representation of how games have changed.","timestamp_created":1457890937,"timestamp_updated":1457890937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21753066","author":{"steamid":"76561198013175714","num_games_owned":379,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":67,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":67,"last_played":1433206307},"language":"english","review":"The buggier, more troublesome version of Half Life.
