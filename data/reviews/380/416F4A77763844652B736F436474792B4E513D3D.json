Es wird zwar einiges erklärt und der Grundriss ist noch recht interessant, aber an sich geht es hier nur darum, aus City 17 zu entkommen. Abgesehen davon, Ist neben wenigen Rätseln oder Jump/Run artigen Elementen das Gameplay nur aus laufen & schießen bestehend. Das ist auf Dauer, bei der langatmigen \"Story\" dieser Episode ziemlich langweilig.\n\nEin Plus gibt es jedoch fürs Ambiente, dass gut gelungen ist. Zwar hat man im Gegensatz zu Half Life 2 eine gewisse Hoffnung, dass es doch irgendwie gut weiter geht, jedoch kommt das Gefühl beobachtet und gejagt zu werden gut durch. Auch die verschiedenen Locations sind realistisch und authentisch gelungen. Jedoch sind diese im Vergleich zu Half Life 2 nicht so vielseitig.\n\nEin großes Minus und auch der Grund, weshalb ich dieses Spiel nicht empfehle ist, dass die Bosskämpfe, die oft nur daraus bestehen sinnlos mit dem Raketenwerfer auf große Viecher zu schießen, einseitig, langwierig und einfach nervig sind. Zum einen gibt es zwar eine Art Zielverfolgung, jedoch trifft diese nur selten und schießt manchmal den Spieler selbst ab. Wenn schon eine Zielverfolgung, dann bitte keine, die mich selbst abschießt. Es ist nicht nur unrelaistisch, dass jemand so eine schlechte Zielverfolgung entwickelt, sondern stört den Spielverlauf enorm. Außerdem gibt es keine Lebensanzeige oder Veränderung am Körper eines Boss-Monsters, die darauf schließen lassen, wieviel Schuss noch notwenig sind. Und so steht man teilweise da, und feuert 50 Raketen auf das Vieh, von denen nur 5 durchkommen und das soll dann ein Bosskampf sein? Meiner Meinung nach ist das recht einseitig und langweilig.\n\nAlles in allem ist es eine nette Erweiterung zum Hauptspiel, die durch Erklärung und Weiterführung der Story zum einen das vergangene verstehen lässt, zum anderen das Interesse an der weiteren Story weckt. Jedoch überwiegt das leider nicht die Gameplay Mängel.","timestamp_created":1422677050,"timestamp_updated":1484432761,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507469832897186279","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14239175","author":{"steamid":"76561197986899723","num_games_owned":418,"num_reviews":81,"playtime_forever":585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1657851301},"language":"russian","review":"Самый недооценённый эпизод.
