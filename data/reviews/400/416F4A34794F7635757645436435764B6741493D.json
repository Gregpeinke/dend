tempos que muitos jogos parecem versões de outros e a originalidade ficou meio de lado, são poucos aqueles que podem dizer que são diferentes.\n\nIsso é normal, uma vez que as grandes publishers têm medo de colocar jogos diferentes, pois isso reflete perda de dinheiro.\n\nEntretanto, em 2006, a Valve lançou um jogo diferente e que caiu muito bem no gosto do público: Portal.\n\nPortal foi um jogo que deu tão certo que ganhou diversos memes e referências em várias mídias. Mas o que o Portal tem de diferente que fez o sucesso que é agora?\n\nA história começou antes do Portal em si\n\nTudo começou na conceituada Digipen Institute of Technology: um trabalho de conclusão de curso deu origem a um jogo chamado Narbacular Drop. O conceito do jogo é simples: uma princesa incapaz de pular está fugindo de seu calabouço usando habilidades de abrir portais nas paredes. A princesa usa um portal laranja e um azul. Com isso, ela vai abrindo caminho para a liberdade.  O jogo foi lançado e Gabe Newell, fundador da Valve, o descobriu, gostou do conceito, contratou toda a equipe que criou o jogo Narbacular Drop e fez uma proposta: recriar o jogo usando a engine Source, a mesma do Half-Life.\n\nA medida que o jogo foi sendo refeito, mudanças ocorreram: a primeira delas é a narrativa da história, que não era tão interessante. Mexendo ali e aqui, o game Portal começa a tomar corpo da forma que conhecemos, com parte da história sendo contada por meio de mensagens na parede em áreas escondidas.\n\nOutra ideia que foi incorporada foi de uma voz para narrar/treinar como usar os  portais durante as séries de puzzle. Foi usado como teste um programa sintetizador de voz. Dessa forma, foram surgindo as correntes de ideias: e se fosse a voz de um robô com inteligência artificial? E se esse robô tivesse uma personalidade Passiva-Agressiva, estando  de brincadeira com o jogador? Então aí surgiu a GLaDOS, a sarcástica Inteligência Artificial do jogo.\n\nO jogo levou 26 meses para ser concluído e, na metade do ano de 2006, o jogo foi vendido na coletânea Orange Box, que continha, além de Portal, os jogos Half-Life 2 e Team Fortress 2. Também em 2007 levou mais de 30 prêmios “Jogo do Ano” em diversas organizações.\n\nA trilha sonora tem algumas músicas que servem para enfatizar as partes dramáticas do jogo. Entretanto, a maior parte dele possui apenas efeitos sonoros dos equipamentos e cenário e comentários da GLaDOS. Outro destaque é a música de encerramento: “Still Alive”, que viralizou tanto quanto o Companion Cube, um objeto que você deve carregar em uma das fases.\n\n\nO Portal está pronto\n\nO gameplay é bastante simples, bem semelhante ao de FPS atuais, com a seguinte diferença: botão esquerdo do mouse abre um portal azul, enquanto o botão direito abre um portal laranja. Portais podem ser colocados em qualquer superfície não metalizada. Quando o jogador atravessa o portal, a inércia do jogador é mantida. Isso permite que eu possa abrir um portal no fundo de um buraco e aproveitar a velocidade ganha na queda para ser arremessado para alcançar lugares mais altos. Por ser um Puzzle que envolve a física, não preciso dizer o quanto ela foi bem implementada. A narrativa do jogo é contada de duas formas: a primeira pela própria GLaDOS que, conforme vai passando as fases, ela vai revelando as suas verdadeiras intenções. A segunda forma é contada por meio de mensagens deixadas pela parede, geralmente em lugares secretos longe das câmeras  da GLaDOS.\n\nPoucos são os defeitos do jogo. Um deles é que relativamente ele é rápido de fechar, embora os desafios de Time Trial dão um objetivo interessante a mais. Para quem jogou Portal 2, viu que existem diversas formas de aproveitar o mecanismo do jogo, mas, para um game inicial, ele foi bem desenvolvido.\n\nPontos Fortes\n\nConceito de jogo diferente do que está no mercado;\nBoa narrativa, sem precisar parar o jogo para entender a história;\n”Still Alive” é uma música obrigatória para um repertório gamer.\n \n\nOportunidades de Melhoria\n\nJogo bastante curto.\n \n\nPortal é um daqueles jogos diferentes, que não se vê por aí. Também possui uma história interessante por trás do desenvolvimento, onde a ideia começa em um trabalho acadêmico e acaba parando na equipe de desenvolvimento da Valve. Apesar de curto, ele é um bom jogo para quem quiser um game de puzzle físico em primeira pessoa.","timestamp_created":1586865619,"timestamp_updated":1586865619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67288545","author":{"steamid":"76561197966553225","num_games_owned":969,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":585,"last_played":1586863684},"language":"english","review":"Cake was delicious!","timestamp_created":1586863956,"timestamp_updated":1586863956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67286967","author":{"steamid":"76561198329901394","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1588195012},"language":"english","review":"Went back to play this again, and Steam encouraged me to write a review, so here we go!\n\nYou already know what Portal is, and you already know the basic premise.
