Ama Half-Life'ın çok başarılı bir de hikaye modu var. Konusunu kısaca değinelim. Ana karakterimiz Gordon Freeman bir teorik fizikçi ve Black Mesa Araştırma Tesisi'nde çalışıyor. Oyunun başında Gordon'un bir deneye 30 dakika geç kaldığını öğreniyoruz. Bu deney için gizemli bir karakter olan G-Man buradaki bilim insanlarına Xen Gezegeni'nden getirdiği bir kristali verir. Bilim insanları ise bu kristali yeterice incelemeden deneyde kullanırlar. Bunun sonucunda Xen Gezegeni ile dünya arasında bir portal açılır ve Xen Gezegeni'ndeki yaratıklar dünyaya geçer. Yapılan bu deney çok büyük bir karışıklığa sebep olur. Bu olay hükumetin kulağına gidince Black Mesa tesisine Black Ops Timi gönderilir ve Black Mesadaki herkesin öldürülmesini emreder. Oyun kısaca Gordon Freeman'ın hem askerlerle hem de yaratıklarla olan mücadelesini anlatıyor.","timestamp_created":1593511317,"timestamp_updated":1593511317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.769667565822601318","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71718001","author":{"steamid":"76561199056356721","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84,"last_played":1594991994},"language":"turkish","review":"Nostalji sevenler için 10 numara oyun","timestamp_created":1593510180,"timestamp_updated":1593510180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71716145","author":{"steamid":"76561198807788656","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":12486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10854,"last_played":1653077553},"language":"english","review":"its a great shooter and a classic  i really think its a great game","timestamp_created":1593507808,"timestamp_updated":1593507808,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71715230","author":{"steamid":"76561198328428494","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4,"playtime_at_review":336,"last_played":1659541589},"language":"english","review":"hello gordon","timestamp_created":1593506687,"timestamp_updated":1593506687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71714964","author":{"steamid":"76561198964912637","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":358,"last_played":1595915634},"language":"english","review":"It is a really good game that has not gone old after 22 years.

When I was younger, I didn't have a computer to play games on, so I never got the chance to play Half Life, and to find out for myself why it is such a beloved game to so many people. Then one day I saw the announcement trailer for Half Life Alyx and found out that Valve was letting people play Half Life for free in the months leading up to the release of Half Life Alyx and decided it was time to find out what was so special about this game. Starting out, I didn't really know what Half Life was about or what to expect from it. All I'd ever seen of it bits of a speedrun done at GDQ. I had no idea what I was about to get into. \n\nYou play as a scientist  Dr. Gordan Freeman who works in a top secret military facility called Black Mesa. Your day starts with a science experiment, but during the experiment, something goes horribly wrong, causing aliens from a different dimension to invade Black Mesa. Your job is find a way to deal with this issue, using an ever growing arsenal of weapons to progress through Black Mesa to stop this alien threat. Once I started playing, I legitimately couldn't stop. I beat the game in 15 hours, and I think I put in half that time on the first day I started playing. All the weapons feel amazing, and you acquire them at regular intervals throughout the game, which gives you new and interesting ways to defeat your foes. Are you gonna lay down a tripwire to stop the enemy, toss a grenade at them, use your rifle, or just shotgun them in the face? The game is pretty easy at the beginning, but the difficulty ramps up as you progress, with the game throwing more difficult enemies and areas at you forcing you to get better at dealing with enemies while managing your ammo and keeping your health up. Some areas in the game gave me more trouble than others, but I didn't find this frustrating at all. I just kept adjusting my strategy until I found the one that worked. \n\nIn conclusion, I cannot recommend this game enough. If you like first person shooters, enjoy games with a good story, and haven't played this game yet, what are you doing? Buy it. Right now. In no world do you ever regret buying Half Life. This game is a masterpiece and it does everything right. \n\nThanks for reading, and Valve, please make Half Life 3. \nThat is

But if you think that this game has aged like anything but fine wine, you are wrong. as someone who hadn't played half life up until recently, I can confidently say that this game holds up remarkably. Everyone who enjoys FPS games should play this game at least once all the way through. The gameplay is fast paced, and requires a degree of thinking that will keep you on your toes. the storytelling is phenomenal and immersive, never taking you out of the shoes of Gordon Freeman as you watch events unfold around you. The soundtrack is great, though if I were to have one complaint about the whole game I wish the soundtrack would have kept playing a bit longer. I understand that it helps immerse you in the atmosphere by only having the soundtrack play occasionally during regular gameplay, but I feel that specifically during boss fights letting the music linger a while longer would be beneficial to the atmosphere. If you don't own this game already, but it. now. it's exceptionally priced, especially if you buy it as a part of one of the many bundles it's included in.","timestamp_created":1593433899,"timestamp_updated":1593433899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71648526","author":{"steamid":"76561198814587955","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1786,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1786,"last_played":1583634934},"language":"brazilian","review":"Para quem esse jogo foi desenvolvido?\n( ) Zé porrinhas\n( ) Crianças\n( ) Adultos\n(x) Tudo e todos\n( ) Gamers\n( ) Sem vida Social\n\nTexturas, Gráficos e Ambiente?\n( ) O que é isso??\n( ) 220 x 120p\n( ) Dentro da média da época, maravilhosamente bons\n( ) Muito Bom\n( ) CHEGA A DAR TESÃO\n\nGame é otimizado?\n( ) Irineu, você não sabe nem eu\n( ) Tá travando, tá lagando...\n( ) Mais ou menos\n(x) Jogável\n( ) Perfeito\n\nErros/Bugs?\n( ) Tem um pouco de jogo nesse bug\n( ) Simulador de bugs \n(x) Tem mas dá pra engolir\n( ) Tá quase lá\n( ) Esse jogo tá uma Delicia\n\nÉ difícil?\n( ) Nem precisa de dedos\n( ) Pega logo as manha\n(x) Bem desafiador, as vezes difícil.\n( ) Parece Dark Souls\n( ) Quem é Dark Souls perto desse inferno.\n\nTem uma história?\n( ) Nunca nem vi \n( ) Tem história só pra não dizer que não tem\n( ) Dá pra gostar da história, se esforçando.\n(x) Historia muito boa\n( ) Quase chorei\n( ) Tem um olho na minha lagrima\n\nAudio, músicas?\n( ) Meus ouvidos sangram\n( ) Jogue mutado\n(x) Legalzinho\n( ) Baixe a play list pra escutar no ônibus\n( ) Toque o tema no seu casamento\n\nPC pra rodar ?\n( ) Calculadora\n(X) Laptop da xuxa\n( ) Um PC decente\n( ) Um PC gamer com luzinha","timestamp_created":1593433199,"timestamp_updated":1593433199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71647427","author":{"steamid":"76561199021464435","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1607166053},"language":"italian","review":".\n","timestamp_created":1593432125,"timestamp_updated":1593432125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71647127","author":{"steamid":"76561198379267785","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":936,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1619950470},"language":"russian","review":".","timestamp_created":1593431827,"timestamp_updated":1593431827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71646227","author":{"steamid":"76561198326551607","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":572,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":246,"last_played":1657186155},"language":"schinese","review":"经典","timestamp_created":1593430917,"timestamp_updated":1593430917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71645890","author":{"steamid":"76561198867977238","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":301,"playtime_at_review":297,"last_played":1660060548},"language":"turkish","review":"oyun 92 yapımlı ama çok güzel be","timestamp_created":1593430562,"timestamp_updated":1593430562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71643620","author":{"steamid":"76561198841032110","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":173,"last_played":1643736650},"language":"russian","review":"игра хорошая как и все игры серии Half life.

Life is an FPS game from the late 90s that, surprisingly, hasn’t aged all that poorly, given its age. Don’t get me wrong, the game looks and feels old, but it is still a fairly enjoyable experience. \nThe only real problems I had with it are as follows:\nThe game will often ask the player to complete platforming challenges, and those can be really frustrating at times, given how slippery your character is when moving at his default speed.\nFall damage is way too high, you can lose more than a quarter of your max HP by falling from heights that usually would not even damage you in other games.\nClimbing/Descending ladders can feel incredibly awkward.\nThe path ahead is not always clear. The game almost never directly tells you where you need to go, and while I do appreciate the lack of handholding, finding yourself in a situation you have absolutely no idea where to go or what to do will not be a rare occurrence, specially in the later parts of the game.\nThe music in the game might glitch out if you find yourself loading saves often.\nThe quality of the audio in general is bad, most sound effects and voices sound like they were recorded with a shitty Xbox 360 mic. I’ve seen older games with better audio.\nThe final boss is not particularly good, since you are forced to rely on a very inconsistent mechanic to get the final hit. \nThe game might be a bit too lengthy. While the game will constantly put you in interesting scenarios, the overall simplicity of its gameplay might get you burned out by the end.\nThose problems aside, the game can still be pretty fun. The gunplay is decent and the puzzles are well thought out in most cases. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who might be interested in checking out what might be the most influential game in the PC gaming industry.","timestamp_created":1593409869,"timestamp_updated":1593410303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71628564","author":{"steamid":"76561198186670642","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1588,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1046,"last_played":1593580717},"language":"english","review":"i played this game last year and judging from how i talked about it in old discord messages i absolutely hated it, but now i can only remember the fun parts so thumbs up :)","timestamp_created":1593409653,"timestamp_updated":1593409653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510703384876251221","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71627855","author":{"steamid":"76561198141066202","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":755,"last_played":1593396523},"language":"english","review":"As of recently getting interested into the half-life series, I decided to pick up this game since it was on sale for $2.
