The Story is really good and i just finished it for the second time. Even though the story is the same thing every time i can still play it with out getting bored. If you finished the story and want something else to do then this game has got you covered, There is a Coop mode which is really fun with friends. You can also download levels made by the community on the workshop, these levels can either be coop or single player levels depending on what the creator of the map set it too. If you want to make your own levels all you have to do is use the inbuilt level editor which is not hard to use at all. If you get sick of the level editor you can move on to something more advanced called Hammer editor which harder to learn and use but with it you can create levels with more detail and even add a story in if you want. Now this game was released in 2011 and its 2019 now so the game is pretty old but its not its still fun to play and the game doesn't feel dated.

I wrote an essay about how good it is for an English class before I wrote a review talking about how good it is.\n\nLong overdue, I honestly don't even know where to begin with this masterpiece. This game is hands down the best one I have ever played in my life. An improvement on the first one in all the right ways, this game is potentially the only singleplayer experience I have had a proper craving for, the only experience that I have genuinely felt that going back and replaying is the thing I want to be doing.\n\nIn the essay that I wrote about Portal 2, I spoke at length about all of the fancy rhetoric that the game employs to convey various emotions and force the player into a mindset. The big thing I noticed was how well the game uses the physically small map to portray this MASSIVE sense of scale. In the essay I focused more on how it forces the player into experiencing something akin to a \"trapped freedom\", where you have the opportunity to do whatever you want but in a certain space. In retrospect, I should simply have written about the way that the game conveys lonely companionship, fearful trust, and reliance on someone openly trying to kill you. It tears out your deepest emotions and plays with them, trying to and succeeding in making you feel two conflicting emotions simultaneously. This is a powerful way to write a story and Portal 2 pulls it off flawlessly.\n\nWith a mix of top-tier voice acting, fluid animation, realistic interactions, interesting characters, an amazing story, the usage of a silent protagonist, and the lack of cutscenes entirely, the game feels realistic and involved. The game doesn't break immersion for a second. While remaining tense, it manages to employ humour, and does everything tastefully.\n\nI can't rave about everything in one review because it frankly will turn into another 20 page essay like the last one did. The TL;DR of this is that the game does everything a game should do flawlessly.\n\n\nThis is the best game ever made and nothing can change my mind.","timestamp_created":1551191244,"timestamp_updated":1551191244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":58,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.835979878902435303","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49245796","author":{"steamid":"76561198350683861","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1002,"last_played":1577458499},"language":"russian","review":"Прошёл / Играю / Веселюсь / Бешусь / Строю / Прохожу... а хулЫ?

In short, even more portal.\n\nThe game is basically the same thing as before, you go from room to room and do portal puzzles, that are accompanied with funny dialogue. However, this time around we have a way more engaging main story, with more characters and waaaay more world building. There's also way more diversity in terms of locations you visit, you'll be going of the rails of your standard experiment room way more in this game. So, if you loed the first game, you will definitely at least like this one.\n\nI only had two issues with the game, both relatively minor and had almost no effect on my personal enjoyment.\n\n- First one is that the pacing of the game struggles in the second half. Wirhout spoiling the game, let's just say that when you feel like the game is reaching the climax, you are thrust back into it and get back into the puzzle routine. This happens two times, and really throws off the pacing of the game. I am not against more content and I do not wish the game was shorter, I just wish the experience felt more like a journey I had in Portal one, rather than getting thrown all over the palce in the second half and going from 100 to 0 a couple of times.\n\n- Second one is that the game tries really hard to be funny. A little too hard. I liked most of the jokes and dialogue, especially one of the characters has excellent lines and delivery. However, there were a couple that felt very forced and honestly by the end of the game I've already been assaulted by so much humor I no longer was laughing at most of the jokes. It gets a little bit too saturated and could've been toned down. It's better to have great jokes from time to time rather than almost every sentence being an attempt at comedy. Ultimatelly not a big deal for me, but I can deffinitely see some people getting really put off by this.\n\nTo summarize, Portal 2 is a great sequel to the original and provies both more of the same excellent gameplay as well as adds a lot of new things. It's in a lot of ways a better game than the original, and also falls behind is some as well. Nevertheless, it's still a really good game that I think anybody should play.","timestamp_created":1551184572,"timestamp_updated":1551184572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.449438214302062988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49245044","author":{"steamid":"76561198236439960","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1883,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1597,"last_played":1554979905},"language":"russian","review":"Сыграйте в эту головолому!!!","timestamp_created":1551184422,"timestamp_updated":1551184422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49244464","author":{"steamid":"76561198907272842","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":136,"last_played":1553771182},"language":"russian","review":"Главный антагонист -
