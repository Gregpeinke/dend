SOMETHING.\nThe ambience, the way the music always reflected the map, i'm pretty sure that playing this game made me ten times better at problem solving, since beating this game for the first time took me two days.\n\nBut after that it was like i could finally think clearly, thinking with portals made me better at looking at everything in life from an abstract point of view, philosophy now made sense to me because i could always try to see EVERYTHING from a subjective point of view, this game made me SMART.\nAnd i'm not crazy, replay the game and pay attention to the maps and you'll see what i mean, there is an underlying philosophical pattern to how the maps are designed, it's not \"just\" a puzzle game, it's a game that is trying to challenge our preconceptions of reality, and by doing so is actively making us more open and understanding as thinking beings.\nAnd it's a game that a CHILD can pick up and have FUN with, because learning is supposed to be FUN, but in this case it actually makes you smarter the more fun you have with it.\nNow tell me that's not amazing!\n\nThis game is my childhood, and the fact that i still remember it so vividly speaks volumes of how timeless it is.\nThis is one of those games that i cannot even RATE, because this game is so good that it physically shouldn't EXIST.\nIt is as if god himself descended upon earth and gave us this game as an example of what a perfect video game looks like, to challenge the boundaries of human cognition while simultaneously being one of the most fun games EVER.\nFact: This game will go down in history as one of our greatest technological

To summarize it, Portal is a linear puzzle game with a focus on a subtle yet funny narrative with interesting and creative level design. The game is so good that I believe this belongs on the list of \"must play before you die\" titles along side Deus Ex, Mario Bros 3, and Max Payne. The game keeps its length short, allowing for an extremely engaging pace that is worth much more then games touting the \"100's of hours of content\" their open worlds offer. But I do believe that nothing is flawless, and Portal is no exception. The game's only issue is that grabbing items can be slippery in Chell's (player controlled characters) hands and often fall to the ground without player input. But this in all honesty is a nit-pick that only effects players trying to achieve 100% completion. To put it simply, I beat Portal for the first time in only an hour and forty-five minutes, but it will take me years to forget the experience it provided.","timestamp_created":1586726131,"timestamp_updated":1586726131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.660668373107910156","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67187182","author":{"steamid":"76561198283946217","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":622,"last_played":1629402778},"language":"english","review":"Gladoss is dead.","timestamp_created":1586725266,"timestamp_updated":1586725266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67187176","author":{"steamid":"76561198083529226","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":417,"last_played":1586725132},"language":"brazilian","review":"Excelente","timestamp_created":1586725256,"timestamp_updated":1586725256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67186971","author":{"steamid":"76561197980796094","num_games_owned":835,"num_reviews":416,"playtime_forever":589,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":589,"last_played":1586724698},"language":"english","review":"If you haven't played Portal yet, \n\nWHY?\n\nBuyit and be amazed by the brilliance of this game.
