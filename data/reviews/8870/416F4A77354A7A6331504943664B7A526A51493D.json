Gameplay wise, I'd say that Bioshock Infinite excels well past its two predecessors. What were once plazmids are now referred to as \"vigors\". For the remainder of this review i'm going to call them plazmids because vigor is a fucking stupid name and I don't see why they changed it. The plazmids work in a familiar way to how they worked in Bioshock 2 where they can be used at the same time you're blowing some poor sods brains out with a machine gun. And despite being a OG Bioshock fan I do acknowledge that the system used in its sequels serves the plazmids better and lets you combo different plazmids and weapons easier. The way you restore your Eve or \"salt\" in this game is very unique to this game in the series so far. Instead of picking up eve hypos and stabbing that shit into your wrist faster than formula 1, you instead have to pick up salt and health packs on the go without being able to store extra. This is a running trend throughout the entirety of Bioshock Infinite. Packing lightly and choosing wisely is a necessity since you can also only carry 2 weapons at a time, which I at first found odd, but I easily adapted to after a while. \n\nThe new weapons and unique plazmids on offer would be nice if I didn't restrict myself to only 3 or 4 plazmids out of necessity. And the hand cannon is just as necessary late game when fighting handymen. I never dropped my hand cannon since getting it off FInk's butler because its so damn useful at both long and short range. Speaking of the handymen, if you haven't played the game heres a tip on how to beat them that I learnt the hard way. Bait them to electrocute the rail before jumping off the rail and unloading everything you have into them. This was one of the only ways I could kill them on hard mode. The rails themselves are one of the best additions to this franchise that I didn't even think I needed. The freedom and mobility they grant you is just amazing and it's so unlike anything we've seen from Ken before that i'm absolutely sure he was on drugs while making this. But what do I think of Elizabeth? Surely having the game be one big escort mission would suck big columbian balls? Well, no. From the beginning the game makes it obvious that Elizabeth doesn't need you to protect her. The enemies don't attack her and she keeps up with the player pretty easily. I never had a problem with her path finding and i've only noticed one instance of when I had to wait up for her. Her ability to find money for you just after you spent all the money you had at a vending machine is sometimes annoying but a minor problem and is well made up for when she hands you health packs and ammo on the battle field. I cannot say how many times a stray health pack or salt container has saved my ass mid fight. Her tears on the other hand put you in control of what you want and when you want it. They work fairly well and are useful for preparing for a fight, as well as being stressful sometimes since you can only open one tear at a time. A good part of this is that there's no cool down so you can switch from one tear to another quickly but they also don't restock so once you use all those precious health packs you'd better high tail it out of there. My one and only major gripe with Bioshock Infinites gameplay is that sometimes I have to many options. I know that sounds like bullshit but hear me out. Having so many different ways to complete something does make the player more likely to become attached to one way of doing it. Half of the plazmids in the game I only used once. A lot of the explosive and one-shot weapons really weren't worth keeping in a slot, and upgrading the guns you have ammo for is always better than not. There is quite a few more things I forgot to cover so i'm going to go over them now. The rechargeable shield mechanic worked well for the most part but I thought that it broke a bit to easily sometimes. The infusion was fine but I don't recommend putting too many points into shield. And the melee mechanics. Comparing the skyhook to the wrench from Bioshock 1 is interesting given that the skyhook is an instant attack while you had to switch to the wrench to use it. I like how when you hit lighter enemies with the skyhook the fumble over leaving an opening to finish them off. I also like how when you finish off an enemy with the skyhook, it plays a horror movie sting. Just something to cement how fucked up some of the finishing moves are. My personal favourite is the one where you snap the enemies neck with the spinny part of the skyhook. Just the right amount of disturbing. And Elizabeths reaction to your senseless brutality is always gold.\n\nI'm not going to go indepth with the story to avoid spoilers for anyone who wants to play this game for themselves. All you need to know is that I think it's alright and it might take a while for it all to make sense if its your first time playing it. And while there are some plot holes, it's easy to look past them. All in all, it's not as tightly written as Bioshock 1 but it's easy to become invested into this world. My whole thought on the capitalist rich and the working class immigrants having extremes on both sides is something you don't see often in this day and age. This is an overall great game and I think a worthy continuation to the Bioshock series ( even though like 90% of the game has nothing to do with the old Bioshock but whatever that's ok ) and I would play 1999 mode if it wasn't rigged. The best way to play this game is probably on hard mode but if you're just starting to play the game, maybe stick to medium or lower. 9/10 good shit.","timestamp_created":1592206219,"timestamp_updated":1592206319,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70815234","author":{"steamid":"76561198301492475","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":965,"last_played":1589088020},"language":"english","review":"Pretty good game, I did not like it as much as Bioshock 1 & 2 but it was still an enjoyable game.

When you take those and add them to the fact that Elizabeth will throw you anything you're low on in the middle of  a fight with only a small cool down, it becomes a bit of a joke.\n     \n     In what appears to be an attempt to \"trim the fat\" in the Bioshock's passives system, it seems half the meat was lost as well. The passive ability slots are brought down from Bioshock 2's impressive 18, to a measly 4 in Infinite.\n\n     Hacking as a game feature is gone. A salt heavy vigor known as possession will allow you to take control of one enemy security system for a very limited time, but long term or permanent security allies are non existent. Door security systems and key code locks are replaced with Elizabeth's lock picking abilities. \n\n     All weapon and vigor upgrades are purchased with money, negating the need to find upgrade stations off the beaten path, or take on challenging enemies such as big daddies. Guns now only have one ammo type, with weapon based traps being removed from the game. Variety is also greatly reduced, with all weapons now falling under the basic pistol, rifle, shotgun, launcher setup you'd see in most fps games.\n\n     The dark, wet, creaking underwater city of Rapture is replaced with a sunny skied Columbia. Gone is the horror aspect, gone are the tight, small corridors, gone are the enemies with motivation, gone is the entire atmosphere this series was built upon. Bioshock Infinite's world introduction is a bland and pretentious mess, filled with the writers thinly veiled hatred of certain groups, while arrogantly claiming to champion others. And then, only a few hours in, they just seem to drop it in the background. It's as if these all these \"heavy\" issues this game seemed so ready to face head on just no longer mattered to it. The game's attempt to build up it's characters repeatedly falls short. Infinite isn't able to find an organic relationship between Booker and Elizabeth, emotions feels off, closeness feels forced. When it's all said and done the player is left uncomfortably aware that they are sitting in a chair, watching two lumps of pixels stand in an elevator, preparing themselves for the next wave of faceless enemies who will throw themselves at Booker's feet. A sad end to a great series.","timestamp_created":1592097665,"timestamp_updated":1592097665,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528838455677032471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70750870","author":{"steamid":"76561198096899553","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":913,"last_played":1630958069},"language":"english","review":"I would pay to have my memory erased so i could experience this game again for the first time.
