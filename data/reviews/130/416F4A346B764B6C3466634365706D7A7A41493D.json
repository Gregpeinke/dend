This happened to me three times, and at a certain point I was just getting tired of it. I'm glad I pushed through it though, because this game does pick up quite a lot in the second half.\n\nHowever, this game does not feel as innovative as some other titles in the series, notably Half-Life 2. It sort of feels like a rehash of the first game, just with a different main character (not that it really matters, all you ever see of Calhoun is his hands).

This is because it was originally created for the Dream Cast port, hell on my first time playing the Half Life games I skipped Blue Shift because I heard it wasn't that important, but when I finally decided to play Blue Shift one day via a complete whim, I actually kinda liked it.\n\nBlue Shift doesn't do much, unlike Gordon Freeman or Adrian Shepard, this time you're a security guard, which means that you're not getting any fancy suits of armor or any of the cool tech they get during their adventures, instead you're forced to settle with body armor you can scavenge, in concept I actually like this mechanic a lot, the prospect of being much more vulnerable during the Resonance Cascade can make some really interesting combat scenarios (something which the mod Echoes did to great benefits years later), hell that's probably why I've played the game over and over, but Gearbox never really balances your limited arsenal in any meaningful way, I don't think you even get any trip mines, like come on! All I have is body armor! Allow me to trap and outsmart my enemies in creative ways! \n\nPersonally, this is a game that could really benefit from an update or mod that further balances your arsenal and combat abilities in ways that force you to think about how you approach combat scenarios, think you fall from too high a distance and now you can't sprint, mechanics that actually force you to think about to do, as well as including any punishments for rash behavior could really make a no death run really fun. \n\nStill I probably like Blue Shift more than most people, it isn't that bad if you approach it with an open mind, and I've probably played it more times than Opposing Force, but it also doesn't take the necessary risks or deviations that it needed to stand out.

I first played Half-Life Opposing Force, it's a really good game I really recommend it. So next I decided to play Half-Life Blue Shift. It's definitely not as good as Opposing Force, but its not bad either, its just more Half-Life gameplay and that is great. It does not introduce new creatures, weapons, or mechanics like Opposing Force did, but its not really trying to be as big and grand as Opposing Force and the story was still engaging and revealed some interesting Half-Life Lore even though some fans will argue over whether or not it's cannon.  \nI would also like to mention that this game seems to have multiplayer because on the bottom right you can click \"servers\" and there is a server browser, but unlike Opposing Force I did not see any servers so it looks like Multiplayer is dead.\n\nI enjoyed my time with the game, playing through Barney Calhoun's adventure to escape Black Mesa. Watching more of the chaos unfolding at Black Mesa during the events of Half-Life from a different point of view. In fact in this game we get insight on what was going on right before the incident.\nAll in all I would recommend the game to anyone who still has an itch for some more original Half-Life action after playing Half-Life and Opposing Force. \n","timestamp_created":1613877449,"timestamp_updated":1613877449,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kvKl4fcCepmzzAI="}
