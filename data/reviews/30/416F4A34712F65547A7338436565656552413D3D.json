The simple, predictable mechanics of the GoldSource engine give you a level of fine control over movement that greatly contributes to the depth of the gameplay.  It's not without some bugginess and rough edges, all games of that era had that, but once you get past the dated graphics the gameplay stands up to any modern FPS out there.  I would argue it surpasses them.  Once you get passed the initial learning curve, you'll have some adrenaline-pumping moments, sneaking behind enemy lines, going on fast-paced rampages, chucking an enemy's grenade right back into his face.  The community is quite mature and friendly and has a relatively high proportion of female gamers.  There are still some very good servers going, and at the right time of day you can still play on a couple of full servers.  There are hundreds of custom maps, many of them every bit as good or better than the official maps. It's great to play a game knowing that you're helping the other people playing be able to enjoy themselves.\n\nIt's cheap, buy it, stick with it for a bit, and help keep this awesome community alive.","timestamp_created":1447264715,"timestamp_updated":1447264715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581545054912567139","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19002721","author":{"steamid":"76561198067804986","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":8464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6303,"last_played":1615426372},"language":"english","review":"Bloody frusterating as all hell.\nWhy?\nWalking through an ally way with team mates, at least four\nIm at the front, theres a machine gun at the exit and I can't get out.\nSuddenly, team mates all decide the best course of action is to throw \ntheir grenades out of the exit in an effortless hope to kill the gunner.\nThey all miss horribly. \nAllyway is filled with grenades, I turn around and start screaming\nmaniacally while the rest of the team says \"GO FORWARD DUMBASS\"\nI sprint out of the allyway at mach speed, get gunned down, the rest\nof the team gets blown out of the allyway by the force of a thousand \nsuns into one big pile of clipping corpses in front of this mortified\nmachine gunner who just witnissed the first friendly fire induced\nholocaust.
