He subsequently managed to consolidate power following the 1924 death of Vladimir Lenin through suppressing Lenin's criticisms (in the postscript of his testament) and expanding the functions of his role, all the while eliminating any opposition. He remained general secretary until the post was abolished in 1952, concurrently serving as the Premier of the Soviet Union from 1941 onward.\n\nUnder Stalin's rule, the concept of \"socialism in one country\" became a central tenet of Soviet society. He replaced the New Economic Policy introduced by Lenin in the early 1920s with a highly centralised command economy, launching a period of industrialization and collectivization that resulted in the rapid transformation of the USSR from an agrarian society into an industrial power.[2] However, the economic changes coincided with the imprisonment of millions of people in correctional labour camps.[3] The initial upheaval in agriculture disrupted food production and contributed to the catastrophic Soviet famine of 1932–1933, known as the Holodomor in Ukraine. Between 1934 and 1939 he organized and led a massive purge (known as \"Great Purge\") of the party, government, armed forces and intelligentsia, in which millions of so-called \"enemies of the Soviet people\" were imprisoned, exiled or executed. In a period that lasted from 1936 to 1939, Stalin instituted a campaign against enemies within his regime. Major figures in the Communist Party, such as the old Bolsheviks, Leon Trotsky, and most of the Red Army generals, were killed after being convicted of plotting to overthrow the government and Stalin.[4]\n\nIn August 1939, after failed attempts to conclude anti-Hitler pacts with other major European powers, Stalin entered into a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany that divided their influence and territory within Eastern Europe, resulting in their invasion of Poland in September of that year, but Germany later violated the agreement and launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Despite heavy human and territorial losses, Soviet forces managed to halt the Nazi incursion after the decisive Battles of Moscow and Stalingrad. After defeating the Axis powers on the Eastern Front, the Red Army captured Berlin in May 1945, effectively ending the war in Europe for the Allies.[5][6] The Soviet Union subsequently emerged as one of two recognized world superpowers, the other being the United States.[7] The Yalta and Potsdam conferences established communist governments loyal to the Soviet Union in the Eastern Bloc countries as buffer states. He also fostered close relations with Mao Zedong in China and Kim Il-sung in North Korea.\n\nStalin led the Soviet Union through its post-war reconstruction phase, which saw a significant rise in tension with the Western world that would later be known as the Cold War. During this period, the USSR became the second country in the world to successfully develop a nuclear weapon, as well as launching the Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature in response to another widespread famine and the Great Construction Projects of Communism.\n\nIn the years following his death, Stalin and his regime have been condemned on numerous occasions, most notably in 1956 when his successor Nikita Khrushchev denounced his legacy and initiated a process of de-Stalinization. He remains a controversial figure today, with many regarding him as a tyrant.[8] However, popular opinion within the Russian Federation is mixed.[9][10][11] Stalin is attributed to 20,000,000–40,000,000 deaths as a result of his regime's actions.[12][13]\n\n","timestamp_created":1424132609,"timestamp_updated":1424132609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514925360679626465","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14374965","author":{"steamid":"76561198125058989","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":107,"last_played":1425480826},"language":"russian","review":"Класная игра при том что 2001 года выпуска.Сыграть с друзьями повеселится)","timestamp_created":1423340118,"timestamp_updated":1423340118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14370574","author":{"steamid":"76561198070386406","num_games_owned":540,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":47,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1437693868},"language":"english","review":"Like Quake but with crowbars.\n10/10 it's ok - IGN.","timestamp_created":1423323631,"timestamp_updated":1423323654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14340175","author":{"steamid":"76561198152177986","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1422552182},"language":"russian","review":"Неплохая игра, вспомнил детство)","timestamp_created":1423154819,"timestamp_updated":1423154819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14218729","author":{"steamid":"76561198030593714","num_games_owned":552,"num_reviews":116,"playtime_forever":14,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1558719145},"language":"english","review":"Bad.","timestamp_created":1422499857,"timestamp_updated":1422499857,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.423518508672714233","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14196519","author":{"steamid":"76561198105024811","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":50,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1515010976},"language":"english","review":"Theres a reason this game comes free with every valve pack.

Skip it and grab Quake instead.[/h1]\n\n[b]DISCLAIMER:[/b] As an Australian, the playerbase is almost non-existant. While playable with 4 to 8 friends, you won't enjoy this game as much if you're by yourself.\n\nDeathmatch Classic is essentially just a deathmatch type game mode using Quake's weapons (and some of its maps). It feels like it was an experiment to recreate Quake inside Valve's new engine than anything else, because it lacks any sort of content unique to the experience.\n\nNot that there's anything wrong with this game: Quake's multiplayer is some of the best there is. There's a bunch of cool weapons, each for different playstyles and situations, and the maps give a nice sense of dynamic movement. It's quick, fast, and tonnes of fun.\n\nThe issue here is that Deathmatch Classic doesn't add anything other than a couple of maps. They're still good, but the issue is that for $5, you're playing a thinned down experience of the multiplayer portion of an 18 year old game that is available on the same platform. As part of the Counter-Strike 1 Anthology, it's an okay bonus, but as a standalone title it's not worth the price.\n\n[h1][b]RATING: 0 UP, 1 DOWN[/b][/h1]\n[i]My up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals).

Today the community of active players is small and there are not a lot of games to join (I just found 1 server with 13 players). I got this game with Counter Strike 1.6 and decided to give it a go. It's a classic Quake-type shooter and lots of fun. Gameplay is great but lack of people to actually play with pulls it down somewhat.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1417897831,"timestamp_updated":1495267082,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497266232967376709","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13245185","author":{"steamid":"76561198146828559","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1417823055},"language":"brazilian","review":"BOMMM","timestamp_created":1417824689,"timestamp_updated":1417824689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13239221","author":{"steamid":"76561198113810046","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":55,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30,"last_played":1456144053},"language":"russian","review":"Отличный шутер!

But it's now shinier and a bit slower-paced. You get same maps. You get same weapons, but they look quite HD compared to Quake 1 style. You know them, shotguns, nailguns, grenade and rocket launchers. And as you know, rocket launcher is really the best weapon here, can't really hope to hit all time with weak projectile weapon that is Nailgun, while Rockets provide heavy-damaging splash effect anywhere you point at. Another thing, is that high-ping is quite unfriendly in this game, you can only hope to do damage with rockets. So yes, Rocket Launcher is overpowered and main thing there, like in Quake 1.  \nOtherwise, classic Arena formula. Stock, shoot, then run and restock. It's quite fun to duel, combatting and juggling with rockets and then getting away to restock health and armor, taking best on map.\nNow, if only it wasn't so dead...","timestamp_created":1408114127,"timestamp_updated":1408114127,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.42065092921257019","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11574986","author":{"steamid":"76561198141876277","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":123,"last_played":1484497075},"language":"english","review":"Love It!

Un aspetto che ho apprezzato molto è stato quello di non avere aggiunto la possibilità di accuciarsi, il che dimostra quanto Valve sia rimasta fedele al prodotto originale.\nSfortunatamente, pur mantenendo la frenesia e la godibilità del multiplayer del primo sparatutto 3D mai sviluppato, ne mantiene pure i difetti, più qualcun'altro che Quake non aveva, purtroppo. Innanzitutto, le armi sono un filo sbilanciate... un giocatore appena spawnato non ha, infatti, alcuna speranza di sfidare faccia a faccia un altro giocatore munito di lanciarazzi, dato che le armi con cui si rinasce sono completamente inutili. Il respawn, sarebbe da rivedere, visto che (non per mia esperienza, ma per quello che mi è capitato di uccidere) è piuttosto stupido far respawnare un giocatore nello stesso posto dov'è appena morto, ucciso da un altro munito di lanciarazzi, vita a 200, armatura a 200 e Danno Quadruplo... molto stupido. E un piccolo difetto aggiuntivo, dato che Quake ne era esente, è il mouse lag spostando lentamente il mouse, ma niente di che.\n\nPassando a scelte stilistiche, e a differenze con l'originale, ci sono parecchie cose da far notare.\nInnanzitutto, si vede come Valve abbia voluto dare un tocco personale al tutto, sfruttando (o modificando lievemente) personaggi di altri titoli precedentemente sviluppati.\nAltro tocco personale è stato dato ai power up! Il Quad Damage è stato piacevolmente convertito in un logo di Half-Life, sempre e comunque Blu... sfortunatamente però, anche il Pentagramma, e l'Anello delle Ombre sono stati convertiti in loghi rossi e gialli.. il che è un pò meno azzeccato. Le mappe sono poche, ma ben realizzate, e con qualche logo di HL sparso qua e là. Ah! E tra le armi al posto della scure c'è il Piede di Porco di Gordon Freeman! Eh già... originale e non male come trovata, ma poteva essere realizzata meglio, dato che le hitbox sono completamente sballate, e per quanto riguarda gli effetti dell'arma (sempre se si riesce a colpire qualcosa), è troppo veloce e fà troppo poco danno. Forse a questo punto sarebbe stato meglio lasciare la cara e vecchia ascia, magari con un logo stampato sopra, ma ormai è fatto.\n\nDando il colpo di grazia a questo titolo, devo dire che l'ho apprezzato molto. Il gameplay è solido e veloce com'è quello di Quake, in più c'è qualche tocco di classe ''alla Valve'' parecchio azzeccato... anche se qualcun'altro un pò meno.\nTuttavia, è un fps multiplayer duro e puro come si doveva un tempo, quindi non ci sono achievements, nè statistiche o quant'altro, a invogliare il player più moderno ad andare avanti. Ad ogni modo, per un oldschooler è un titolo più che godibile, dotato di mappe, armi e di un gameplay più fedeli all'originale di quanto chiunque si possa aspettare.

The run around and shoot anything that moves style of deathmatch gameplay is a blast. The one thing that holds me back from saying you should run out and get this is the fact that barely anyone plays. You'll have maybe 3 or 4 humans at one point or another, with everyone else being bots. That said, if you get this in a Half-Life or Valve package, you should absolutely boot it up and play a few rounds.\n\nEDIT: I first wrote this review on June 8th 2014. Now, on March 31st 2018, a Miracle has happened. Someone made a post on reddit mentioning this is one of the least played Multiplayer games on steam, having a peak of 28 players at it's highest point (at least since steam started tracking these things, I'm sure it was probably more popular in its \"heyday\"). The post became a rallying point (and a meme) and through a concerted group effort, it was resolved to try and set a new world record for concurrent players today.\n\nAs of now it's dying down a bit, at 169 people, but the peak was 627 and it was a blast. At first I joined one 32 player server, but the game really wasn't built around that many players per map and it was chaos, albeit fun chaos. I then joined a more reasonable 16 player server and had a great time for about 90 minutes. It really reminded me of why HL1/Hl2 engine multiplayer games have such a magic to them. You aren't being pushed by hte game to rank up or do a certain thing, it's just everyone in a map, and if you want to goof around and chill out you can. As the playercount in the server dwindled to 8 we called an informal cease fire, to look at interesting things in the map. We saw a wall that bleeds when you hit it and a lava pit that doesn't kill you, which became a hot tub for an impromptu party. That's the sort of thing you just wouldn't see in something like Overwatch. \n\nOf course, the actual game is still incredibly fun- it really is just Quake 1 on Half-LIfe's engine, but the grenade launcher and the rocket launcher actually feel a bit better. The maps are cool, it's got a cool art style despite it's age, and it makes for a great arena FPS. It's fully understandable why it never caught on, Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament would have been the hot flavor of the time, so a remake of a Quake game two installments ago obviously held little wide appeal even at it's time, and over the years DMC has been forgotten even in Valve's [i]ouvre[/i] in favor of Half-Life 1 and 2 deathmatch, and later Counter-Strike, TF2, etc. That doesn't mean it's a bad game though, it was simply the wrong game at the wrong time retreading something old when newer takes were doing fresher things. I got into Valve stuff (and FPS games) around 2008 with Orange Box and playing DMC again brought me back to those days, when I would just try whatever mods and multiplayer games I could find on GoldSrc/Src.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this meme-based second wind will have any sustained impact, exposing new players to a fun game they might not have known about, or if everyone will have moved on by tomorrow, but it was nice to see everyone come together for something fun and positive. As of now there's only about 30 people on, so I think DmC has begin it's slide back into obscurity, but it would be nice to revisit things like this [i]en masse[/i] again. I for one, would love a Fortress Forever revival.","timestamp_created":1402337768,"timestamp_updated":1522531615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497100234031677246","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10326425","author":{"steamid":"76561198137892623","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":71,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71,"last_played":1401733414},"language":"russian","review":"Очень

Ma ora vorrei elencarvi precisamente i lati positivi e non di questo gioco e qualche voto su alcuni aspetti:\nPositivi:\nMolto competitivo e frenetico, con molte armi e oggetti a disposizione (c'è anche la crowbar *_*)\nHa le carte in regola per essere paragonato ai \"concorrenti\" Quake e UT\nNegativi:\nPoca gente e pochi server di conseguenza\nHUD non brutto ma comunque più scomodo rispetto a Q e UT\nMappe copiate da altri titoli \n\nGrafica: 10 (Stesso motore grafico di HL)\nAudio: 7\nGiocabilità: 8\nLongevità: 9 (Penso che sia ovvio per un gioco esclusivamente multiplayer)\nCompetitività: 10 (Fps arena=Competitività)\nDifficoltà: 9 (Nel senso che ci vuole allenamento e costanza per essere bravi)\nOriginalità: 5\n\nSpero che questa recensione vi sia stata di aiuto :) e mi scuso in anticipo per eventuali errori grammaticali.\n\nP.S.\nMi dispiace molto che la valve non punti su questo gioco, magari facendo un sequel con il Source di HL2, ma evidentemente deve pensare ai cappelli di tf2 -_-\"","timestamp_created":1392410044,"timestamp_updated":1392410044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.696862459182739258","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9042958","author":{"steamid":"76561197960307880","num_games_owned":472,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":162,"last_played":1474998587},"language":"english","review":"A fair clone of Quake/Quakeworld.
