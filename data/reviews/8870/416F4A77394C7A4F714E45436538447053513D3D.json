Battles are quite fluid and dynamic, as you can use a combination of offensive or defensive firearms, melee attacks, vigors, transdimensional assists and the fast-moving sky-line. The enemy AI is not very smart though, they tend to simply charge you and they are quite tanky.\n\nYou also manage an in-game currency to purchase supplies and weapons/vigors upgrades, and have access to a multitude of character upgrades. All these choices felt a bit overwhelming on my casual playthrough (15 hrs on hard), and the game should have good replay value.\n\nThe story is very good. The first 2 hrs were quite boring, but once you connect with Elizabeth (who has a pretty convincing AI), the pace picks up nicely and it was hard to stop playing. The finale however is disappointing; it's overly long and not exactly transparent: [spoiler] it seems to be based on a time-travel paradox which IMO is a bit cliché [/spoiler].\n\nIt's too bad that you are limited to two firearms since there is a great variety of them.

Les dlc (hors Carnage Celeste) se terminent facilement en 2h chacun. Autant dire que la durée de vie du jeu n'est pas longue mais suffisante à vous divertir comme il se doit. Je l'ai terminé en difficile (mais vraiment sans aucun accro). Un mode 1999 se débloque ensuite mais je ne l'ai pas testé.\n\nL'histoire est captivante mais au fur et à mesure de l'avancement du jeu ont peut très vite s'apercevoir que les raccourcis scénaristiques se multiplient (malheureusement). Les dlc nous donnent une vision plus fine et quelques détails supplémentaires que l'histoire principale n'a pas su nous fournir directement mais tout n'est pas mis en lumière et beaucoup de choses restent dans le flou.\n\nL'ambiance générale est très bonne, les graphismes sont très bons également (même s'ils sont un peu trop saturés et que le flare est présent en abondance) et on s'amuse rapidement à faire quelques screenshots sympathiques pour notre bibliothèque. Les scènes dans le jeu sont vraiment très belles.\n\nLe gameplay global est assez répétitif et ne donne pas l'occasion au joueur d'aller plus loin que le couloir déjà tracé vers les objectifs (pas assez d'exploration). C'est bourrin (même si les armes ne sont pas des engins de siège) et certains sorts sont juste abusés (je pense au Plasmide Hiver d'Antan des dlc qui vous donne le pouvoir de geler les enemis pour ensuite leur mettre un coup et les faire exploser...). D'autres sorts sont par contre totalement inutiles... Les enemis ne sont pas très évolués et trop peu nombreux en types. Je regrette également le fait qu'il n'y ait pas de vrai boss dans le jeu. L'utilisation des failles est pratique mais pas indispensable et surtout pas assez exploitée. \n\nAu final je le recommande dans le sens où je suis certain que vous passerez un bon moment.","timestamp_created":1448802205,"timestamp_updated":1448802222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19360800","author":{"steamid":"76561198072766613","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":649,"last_played":1422698502},"language":"english","review":"Do not recommend.","timestamp_created":1448797438,"timestamp_updated":1448797438,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.400388240814208984","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19360666","author":{"steamid":"76561198040083751","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":710,"last_played":1448794808},"language":"english","review":"There will be many superlatives in my review. But be warned, there are also some little things that I didn't like.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a visual masterpiece. I'm not talking about the cutting edge graphics, I'm talking about the artistic style. I love how everything is huge; the buildings, the statues made of pure gold, the gigantic doorways. I love looking into the starry  sky. Don't get me started about the moment when I saw a glipse of Manhattan burning. I love how they captured the early 20th century feeling. I always imagine the pre-1914 era as a careless time, when people were enjoying their sunday picnic in the park or sunbathing at the beach. Bioshock captures that very feeling. The soundtrack is one of the best ever. Hall of heroes with different movements from Mozart's Requiem beginning with \"Lacrimosa\" and climaxing in \"Confutatis\" is maybe the best moment in video game history. W.A himself would be very proud of that scene!\n\nNow the things that I didn't like about Bioshock Infinite. The story was galloping at the speed of light and left me clueless from the very beginning. Who's Slate? Who's Comstock? What are all these dimensions? Is it time traveling? What exactly is the debt that DeWitt is constantly reminded of? There are some crumbs of information in these short voxophone and kinetoscope recordings, but I probably wasn't paying enough attention to them at 4 o' clock in the morning. After the ending I was more clueless than I was in the beginning. I guess this is a game  you have to play through more than once.  Another thing that I didn't like so much was the shooter mechanics. It resembled a 1990's playstation arcade shooter. Shoot em all and advance to the next level all over again.\n\nBut summa summarum, this game is art at its purest form.

Tho my pc settup then was primarly the reason why I didnt finsh BS1 kept crashing after random times in the game.  So I gave up on Bioshock.  I got this game on a steam sale heard alot about it remembered G4TV's review of it and thought I'd give it a try. I was pleasntly surprised prob one of the best shooters Ive ever played thought the story line was very interesting and engaging and the gameplay was top notch kept making me want to come back and play. Something else I wasnt used to in a shooter was the horror element it reminded me of the way Doom 3 used to make me feel. I enjoyed this game makes me wish I wouldve played the Bioshock series sooner.

I just bought this recently during a sale when it was $5, but boy oh boy do I regret not playing it when it released. This game is worth buying full price, and if I could I would pay 20 bucks if I knew how great it would be. Being the 3rd of the series in BioShock, Infinite brings us to a whole different dimension where we look into the life of Booker DeWitt. I don't want to spoil anything, but being my BioShock game I played, I really enjoyed the combat and nice storyline. The different weapons and vigor system was also very fun to play around with. One thing they could've fixed was adding a bow to the game, but my carbine rifle was enough to give me the joy of headshots :D\nTL:DR 10/10 >------>BOWS RULES! <-------<","timestamp_created":1448771984,"timestamp_updated":1448771984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19353184","author":{"steamid":"76561198207770932","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1352,"last_played":1507350327},"language":"english","review":"I cried at the end.","timestamp_created":1448769228,"timestamp_updated":1458189382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19353125","author":{"steamid":"76561198120410957","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1068,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1526187563},"language":"english","review":"10/10 would do Elizabeth again.","timestamp_created":1448768999,"timestamp_updated":1448768999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19352587","author":{"steamid":"76561198149954848","num_games_owned":311,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":661,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":581,"last_played":1470324322},"language":"english","review":"Me: *Accidentally pressed the jump button*\nNPC: He's a thief!
