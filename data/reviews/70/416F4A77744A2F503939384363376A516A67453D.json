This game has three strong points:\n\n[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]\n\nHalf-Life 1 objectively has [b]one of the best[/b] multiplayer experiences in the entire Steam store. Playing multiplayer is a very unique experience for many reasons...\n\nFirst is the community servers. There is no matchmaking like we have nowadays. This means you see recurring players, and unlike in matchmaking systems you get the opportunity to make friends (shout-out to the OAK server)\n\nSecond is the weapon selection. Every weapon is good for different situations, and it allows people to develop unique play-styles. As you learn what weapons are good for when, you'll see your scores improve and you'll start winning more matches. Then when you've mastered all the weapons you start to realize you can sort of combo certain weapons together. \n\nIt's a very no-mercy type of multiplayer. At first, you will get beaten and battered simply because there is no tutorial or guide and its combat is complex (and if the map is Crossfire you're going to constantly get obliterated by someone shooting a laser canon through a wall). You join a server in the midst of an all out free-for-all war and you're left to figure out how to fight for your life or lose trying. If you're not willing to put some effort into learning new skills to git gud at a game, consider playing Valve's other multiplayer games. If you are however, soon [b]you[/b] will be the one obliterating people through walls with a laser canon.\n\n[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]\n\nIt's story is not over-bearing like normal games these days, it's just enough to host the gameplay and keep you en route and not too potent that it gets in the way or takes control away from the player. The game only stops you to give you direction and tell you what you're trying to achieve in the story. It never takes control away from you, all of Gordon's actions are yours. [b]It's all you.[/b] The game lets the events play out around you while you're still able to move and look for yourself. It makes you feel like YOU were the one responsible for the destruction of Black Mesa, like you are dealing with the unforeseen consequences. It sets you up to feel like a badass.\n\nAs for functionality, the age of the engine will guarantee you a high framerate and you can uncap it (fps_max 999) for super low latency and ultra smoothness. This makes movement fun and maximizes control and comfort with your character.\n\nIn the end, I love this game and all but I can't say most people would enjoy it simply because of the looks and 90s jank. Lets be real, HL1 looks gross next to something like Doom 2016. However even if you can't get past that stuff, there is \"Black Mesa\", a HL1 remake in Source 2 that looks beautiful and functions great. It's the same game with mostly the same levels, but it utilizes technology that wasn't available in 1998 and makes the game look sexy. \n\n\n[h1]Speedrunning[/h1]\n\nThere's not much to say about this. Everything about this game makes it perfect for speedrunning with the exception of the latest version capping your speed (so we use GoldSrc Package for pre-Steam physics). This is hands down one of the best game out there in terms of movement heavy speed games.","timestamp_created":1511593054,"timestamp_updated":1628376829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37472911","author":{"steamid":"76561197995004462","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":703,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":652,"last_played":1587582206},"language":"turkish","review":"Yıllar yıllar sonra bile, tadından vazgeçilmez.
