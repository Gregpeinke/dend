Эта игра как раз таки даёт такую возможность, причём на прокачку каждого навыка придётся потратить довольно большое количество времени. Хоть игра довольно простая, но затягивающая и интересная. Игра расчитана на командное выживание и лучше играть с друзьями, ибо некоторые незнакомые люди, с которыми ты играешь на сервере могут вообще не обращать на вас никакого внимания. Вообщем игра для меня просто прекрасна, но есть то, что её дико портит. Это, конечно, DLC. Премиум скины по 150 руб. и парочка оружий за 200 руб. не стоят своих денег. Причём многие паки с оружиями абсолютно ничем не отличаются от своих аналогов. Ни уроном, ни скорстрельностью, ни перезарядкой, только окраской, и тратить на это деньги я не вижу смысла.

You are not forced to go through specific areas of the map to beat the game, but to kill all the specimens that come in waves. After you do that you get to fight a boss, Patriarch.\n\nOne of the first things you notice while playing is that the game does not have a crosshair, which in my opinion makes it more realistic and challenging. It's not a big deal since anyone can get used to it pretty quick. There are also 7 different perks that give bonus stats to specific weapons. The higher the perk level, the more bonuses you get (weapon damage, spawn with better guns etc.). You don't have to necessarily play with one perk the whole game. Every time a wave is over you can change your perk, which is also a good thing.\n\nThe maps look also pretty detailed and have the right atmosphere to fit in. There's also some metal-ish music playing in the background to keep you pumped. However, you may want to mute the music  since sometimes you really need to be able to hear strong enemies coming from behind, like fleshpounds.\n\nSo, why do I not recommend the game?\n\nThough there are many mods by the community and a lot of great ideas, TWI ignored most of them and released bunch of DLC instead. The earlier ones are mostly cosmetic, but advertising them in the  menu all the time is unacceptable for a game that I have actually paid. Later they even decided to add weapon DLC, that one wasn't cosmetic. Now, I'm not saying that it's pay-to-win since the game is co-op. However guns in killing floor matter and affect the gameplay. When there is a community that has bunch of decent ideas or concepts for your game and you ignore them and release DLC, that's dirty. But I thought \" Alright, I got 200 hours on this game so I guess I got my money's worth\". Ironically they added some of the community's ideas to \"early access\" Killing Floor 2 and presented it as \"new content\", just to make the players feel like they're getting something. \n\nSome people had high hopes for KF2 but sadly the second one is much worse since they added microtransactions while it's on 'early access' state.","timestamp_created":1392395913,"timestamp_updated":1451166538,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":113,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577644050121307373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9102944","author":{"steamid":"76561198089749320","num_games_owned":339,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":16682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8684,"last_played":1457622674},"language":"english","review":"zombie game- check\nmultiplayer game - check\nhuge amounts of developer support and mods  - check\ncheap - check\n\nprb one of the best shooters out there, cheap, heaps of stuff and is a zombie game. \n\nps: the game might not appeal to everyone, the game has a rather steep learning curve and on 1-3 players it can be quite boring. on a full map it can be very fun but to some who are looking for a refeshing change in game play this game wont offer it, its the same thing again and agian","timestamp_created":1392392256,"timestamp_updated":1395513032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9099690","author":{"steamid":"76561198072729088","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1120,"last_played":1391332909},"language":"english","review":"Great game with heaps of updates and never get bored if it","timestamp_created":1392376033,"timestamp_updated":1392376033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9099168","author":{"steamid":"76561198075335720","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":684,"last_played":1359446400},"language":"english","review":"FPS de survival, legal mas muito repetitivo.","timestamp_created":1392372404,"timestamp_updated":1392372404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9098953","author":{"steamid":"76561198075378702","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4714,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3464,"last_played":1498397481},"language":"russian","review":"Анальное веселье :D Круто играть с друзьми","timestamp_created":1392370752,"timestamp_updated":1392370752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447412729263305664","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9098898","author":{"steamid":"76561197983344055","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19748,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18983,"last_played":1514882810},"language":"english","review":"BAD ASS GAME","timestamp_created":1392370513,"timestamp_updated":1392370513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9098011","author":{"steamid":"76561198097026156","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4225,"last_played":1432450854},"language":"english","review":"Really fun game!!!","timestamp_created":1392363300,"timestamp_updated":1392363300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9097616","author":{"steamid":"76561197999757048","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":32550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26489,"last_played":1488921009},"language":"english","review":"I have owned Killing Floor since around the time it was originally released.\nIt has [b]never[/b] let me down.\n\nPlayer wise - you will come across a BOATLOAD of idiots that seriously want to bring down your gameplay experience; especially on servers that are not altered (those with more than 6 slots and serverside perks, as well as friendlyfire servers). You cannot compare the Killing Floor community to something like the Counter-Strike: Source community - they are both very different, and Killing Floor, while being a co-op game, still for some reason makes everyone think it is every man for themself.\n\nThe DLC that came out the first few times is well worth the purchase, so are the Golden Weapons. However I do not think the camo reskins are worth the money. That is my only negative factor about it; the DLC just went downhill.\n\nThere are holidays events going on all the time. Hillbilly Horror, Twisted Christmas, etc. The models of the \"specimens\", as they are called (not just \"zombies\"!), are remodeled for the holidays with counterparts respective to the festivity.
