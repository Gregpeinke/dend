You go from completing puzzles in little rooms to defeating a rogue AI (No spoilers), and yet the game retains its core game mechanics. While I loved Portal 2 aswell, this game will allways be my favourite, its just better, in my opinion, and is probably one of my favourite games I've ever played. \n\nWith its cheap price (Due to the steam sales), theres never been a better time (Well, prehaps at launch, but still) to get this game.

C’est vraiment une expérience vidéoludique  à ne pas manquer. La célèbre GLaDOS est son humour caustique, donne une ambiance troublante et drôle.  La difficulté des puzzles est bien gérée, toujours croissante en avançant dans les tests. Et si c’est trop simple la première fois, il existe un mode avancé. Le jeu est malheureusement très court, je le conseille donc en solde ou en pack.","timestamp_created":1434662793,"timestamp_updated":1456440580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16508273","author":{"steamid":"76561198145509590","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":248,"last_played":1527467864},"language":"spanish","review":"Robots con sentimientos 213/10","timestamp_created":1434661111,"timestamp_updated":1434661111,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460491865873336792","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16507876","author":{"steamid":"76561198070918153","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1607346712},"language":"czech","review":"Piece of cake","timestamp_created":1434660106,"timestamp_updated":1434660106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16505763","author":{"steamid":"76561198175418673","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1479736715},"language":"english","review":"THIS GAME IS SO DIFFICULT!!!\n","timestamp_created":1434654933,"timestamp_updated":1434654933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16504560","author":{"steamid":"76561198163104624","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":332,"last_played":1500344986},"language":"english","review":"When I built my gaming PC last month I felt the need to play all Valve games , as I hear so much praise about them.

I boot up the game and thihk damn only 19 level / chambers and quickly get dissapointed. After completing the last chamber everything changed. The ending of this game is PHENOMENAL. I began to appreciate the game and its simple plot. The ending when you are running through the facility is immense fun and the way you get around is awesome. It is a challenge, but my god when you find out what to do, it feels great. I can now say I am beyond happy I bought this game and especialy for the low price point.

Pues bien. Me equivoqué. \n\nEs dificil encontrar un juego más sencillo y a la vez más completo que \"Portal\". Con una historia sencilla (salir del complejo) y unas enormes dosis de humor negro, me ha parecido un juego divertido y con una mecánica espectaluramente sencilla pero bien aprovechada. Es increible como puede sacarse tanto jugo a tan poco. Los movimientos no podían ser más basicos. Crear portal azul, crear portal naranja, agarrar objeto y moverse.  Solo con esto te sumerge en un mundo de trampas, laberintos y atajos, con unos toques maravillosos de ciencia ficción. La IA que te va guiando por las habitaciones (GLaDOS) es simplemente magnífica y tiene una personalidad y unas frases inolvidables.
