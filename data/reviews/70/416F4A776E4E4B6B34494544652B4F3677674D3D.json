Много часов геймплея проведено в offline.\n\n[b]🟢Что мне понравилось[/b]\n\n+ Архитектура уровней. В этом шутере нельзя просто идти вперёд по коридору в направлении врагов и убивать их. Продвижение по уровню - отдельный пласт геймплея. Переходы между отдельными частями уровня представлены в виде небольших головоломок, где надо куда-то пролезть, что-то включить, передвинуть какой-нибудь ящик. До сих пор я не знаю ни одного шутера, который подошёл к этому моменту игры настолько творчески. Супер.\n\n+ ИИ врагов. Враги тут далеко не самые тупые. Пытаются в укрытия. Кидают гранаты. И видов врагов довольно много. Поэтому потягаться с ними в перестрелке интересно. Мясом игра закидывает редко.\n\n+ Визуальный стиль. Старая графика не мешает игре выглядеть как произведение искусства. Локации детальны и приятно выглядят.\n\n+ Звуки. В игре довольно мало музыки. Звуковой фон здесь создают всевозможные звуки, которые создаются существами и окружением. Это хорошо работает на иммерсивность.\n\n[b]🔴Что разочаровало[/b]\n\n- Импакт от оружия и звуки оружия мне не нравятся. Некоторые виды оружия очень неточные, так что из них стрелять неприятно вдвойне.\n\n- Плохая индикация направления вражеской атаки. Враги могут убить вас с пары выстрелов и вы даже не поймёте откуда. Это раздражает.\n\n- Подозрительный ТТК. Возможно из-за странной точности оружия. Иногда можно убить врага за 1-2 секунды стреляя вплотную, а иногда приходится стоять долго и высаживать несколько магазинов патрон. \n\n- Слабая подача сюжета. Можно запросто потерять нить повествования с середины игры.\n\n[b]Вывод[/b]\n\nИнновационный шутер в плане дизайна уровней. Не подходит для расслабленного геймплея - местами придётся попотеть, особенно на высокой сложности. У меня вызывает приятное ощущение ностальгии кверху.

is a legendary, must-to-play 1998 FPS game developed by Valve. To consider yourself a true gamer, you must have this game under your belt. A game strongly recommended for everyone and an excellent game for people that are starting to become gamers. Give this to your kids as their 1st game, you won't regret it and they will be thankful in the future. \n\nPlaying a badass dude and a legendary gaming character named Gordon Freeman, Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics, which I guess Ph.D. gives you knowledge of every weapon you touch and just kick ass. Works for the Black Mesa and gets involved in an experiment that goes wrong and opens a dimension to another world called Xen. Through each fight and puzzle, you piece together the story in the game. Also, in the game, you will meet another legendary but mysterious character, G-Man. He plays a huge role in this game and the Half-Life sequels. Won't spoil them and the story. You should experience it all with a huge jaw drop and dilated pupils.\n\nThe game consists of 1 Training room and 3 modes, easy, medium, and hard.\nThe training room is strongly recommended for new gamers and for gamers that haven't played a Valve game in their life. Get to know how the game functions and its controls. If you skip it and act all tough, you will have big difficulties.\nNow the modes:\n1. Easy mode: Recommended for new gamers. Not difficult at all and not even a challenger. Great way to observe the game, it's surrounding and the story behind it without any fear of getting killed instantly. Difficulty 1/10;\n2. Medium mode: Great for players that never played a Valve game before but aren't new to FPS games. It's the same as the easy mode, just with the challenging fights. Difficulty 5/10;\n3. Hard mode: This mode is for veterans and people that enjoy pain. It's challenging as hell and keeps the adrenalin pumping. Difficulty 10/10;\n\nOf the various weapons that are offered in this game, I must praise the most powerful weapon in this game. Equivalent to the Doom 1993 shotgun (not as powerful and impactful as the Doom 1993 shotgun), the 44. Magnum. Its amazing power strikes down all foes, no matter their sizes and the difficulty you will play on. If you ever feel endangered just whip out this bad boy and it will do the job. The best weapon in this game!\n\nPersonally, the worst weapon in this game is the HECU RPG, the bazooka in the game. Proved unworthy and cost my life many times. It has a guiding option to guide your missiles, and boy did they miss, a lot. It seems like it was a hit, but it goes through them. In hard mode, it barely does a thing. I prefer using the crowbar and the pistol over this thing. Almost always I barely use this thing, because the rest of the arsenal does a better job.\n\nMultiplayer: After so many years, it's still alive and you can easily find a couple of good and full servers. The multiplayer is awesome and you need to check it out. You must experience it.","timestamp_created":1656828191,"timestamp_updated":1656828191,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118109296","author":{"steamid":"76561199127539580","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1713,"last_played":1659044576},"language":"ukrainian","review":"Love this game","timestamp_created":1656827315,"timestamp_updated":1656827315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118108904","author":{"steamid":"76561198123387209","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":746,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":746,"last_played":1554345154},"language":"english","review":"This game is cooler than Half-Life 2","timestamp_created":1656826803,"timestamp_updated":1656826803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118108237","author":{"steamid":"76561198986594776","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":785,"last_played":1658880054},"language":"spanish","review":"god\n","timestamp_created":1656825796,"timestamp_updated":1656825796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118107100","author":{"steamid":"76561199099448730","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":689,"last_played":1658692838},"language":"english","review":"my wife left me","timestamp_created":1656823960,"timestamp_updated":1656823960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118107025","author":{"steamid":"76561198046376244","num_games_owned":693,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":896,"last_played":1655496566},"language":"english","review":"This game has not aged well.
