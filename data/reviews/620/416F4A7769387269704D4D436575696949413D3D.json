There's no getting around it, the game is simply exceptional. The writing, voice acting, humor, atmosphere, puzzle design, physics, and even graphics (in areas) are stellar. The game returns with a significantly longer but also more complex and more developed campaign, which sees Chell waking up within Aperture labs several hundred years after the events of portal. The atmosphere of decay really permeates the entire game.\n\nThe puzzles are surprisingly innovative. Valve has expertly integrated more small project ideas (like the gel) into portal, expanding the possibilities and factors present in test chambers. While it can seem overwhelmingly complex at first, you get used to it, and the feeling of accomplishment you get after completing some of the harder tests simply can't be beat. They've really done a lot by adding more and more elements to the tests, although it does make me wonder how many more new tests can really be created without being Repeats. I guess we'll see in the free DLC for coop.\n\nSpeaking of coop, while the coop campaign doesn't have much of a narrative, it's a blast to play. You really have to not only work together, but to think together as well in order to solve some of the harder tests. It's really fun to play with a friend over skype.\n\nOverall though, Portal 2 is incredible, and it's really nothing less than I expected. You owe it to yourself to play this game.","timestamp_created":1388517483,"timestamp_updated":1388517483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8462647","author":{"steamid":"76561198057822283","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":646,"last_played":1386567406},"language":"english","review":"Fun puzzle solving experience with an entertaining story as well.
