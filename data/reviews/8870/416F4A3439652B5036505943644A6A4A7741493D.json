I'm almost ashamed that I slept on it for so long. When it first released, friends were putting it down and I found myself turning away from the game. Eventually I just... forgot about it. Didn't get around to it. I think now, that people were judging it based on the rose-tinted glasses they were viewing Bioshock 1 through.\n\nWhile I do prefer Rapture to Columbia, it is ONLY personal preference to be underwater as opposed to being above the clouds. I felt that Columbia's weird alternative history world-building was so much stronger than Rapture's. Rapture did have the allure of mystery, but Columbia feels much more fully realized. And it is REALLY something to behold. \n\nHowever, I didn't care too much for Infinite's combat. I much prefer splicers and big daddies to mechanized patriots and militia/soldiers. Columbia's heavily defended world (full of innocent civilians needing protecting - from you, apparently) means you have to fight waves upon waves of enemies, making the game's combat feel like an absolute never-ending slew of bullets. You're able to swap out many different types of firearms to give yourself some variety, and Elizabeth has an interesting skill that spices things up. And still, for me, this was far less interesting than Rapture's smattering of weird muttering crackheads who sneak up behind you and try to whack you in the head with a wrench. Columbia has no panicked moments of \"ah frick I'm gonna die,\" not even when a Handyman shows up.\n\nBioshock Infinite's greatest strength, I believe, lies in its characters and story. Elizabeth is absolutely charming and Troy Baker's voice acting keeps Booker from feeling like an otherwise bland/generic protagonist. What a duo. It was a delight getting to spend the game with Elizabeth, rather than being alone. She's very useful, too! \n\nAnd the story... lordt. It is difficult to speak much about the subject without giving spoilers. I will say that reaching the end of the game and realizing why the game was called Bioshock Infinite... blew my f*cking socks off. The sense of awe and wonder during some of the final cutscenes. Ah. It's an idea that is not necessarily original but still managed to be somewhat of a tour de force in execution.\n\nThe noir-esque Burial at Sea DLC expands on the ending a bit and is 100% worth checking out, especially if you want to pop back into Rapture for a little while. However, the full DLC is $30 and not really long enough to warrant the price point, so grab the season pass on sale.","timestamp_created":1609883847,"timestamp_updated":1609883847,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":50,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.789004862308502197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84101478","author":{"steamid":"76561198025277563","num_games_owned":640,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":1330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1318,"last_played":1609882480},"language":"english","review":"What a game!

My first 1-2hrs in the game were just exploring, appreciating, each and every corner of this beautiful city. MAGNIFICENT! Reaaallly made me wanna go and live there!\n\nNot happy with how you can only use 2 guns at a time. Even if you stick with your fav weapons, the ammo dropped by enemies are random...so you eventually *have to* switch to/pick up some other weapon. And i have no idea why the sniper rifle was scattered SO MUCH throughout the world. I didnt want to use it, but only that weapon was available in plenty. Using the guns is very satisfying....great animation+sound mixing! \n\nYour plasmids from previous BioShock games is now Vigors...and just like previous games, i used 2-3 vigors only. Never found others useful. So it all depends on your playstyle. \n\nThere are 'Gears' to wear which give you some stat bonuses and tbh, most of them are worthless.\n\nAudiologs are now Voxophones...I have no idea why they removed the subtitles when listening to them!? You have to go to options to 'read' your Voxophones....and the font is SO SMALL! Pathetic.\n\nGood characters, good story. Great voice acting!\nThere are some things which i still dont understand why they were there (and which i cant say here because of spoilers).\n\nThis game has better twist in the end than the first two games combined.","timestamp_created":1609831845,"timestamp_updated":1629972932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528301894664764404","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84048092","author":{"steamid":"76561198147056905","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":485,"last_played":1609827467},"language":"schinese","review":"玩完之后又看了剧情解析，太震惊了，剧情和标题的“无限”完美契合。只能说这部游戏，真的牛批\n\n还有伊丽莎白永远的神，这才是神队友","timestamp_created":1609827593,"timestamp_updated":1609827652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84047991","author":{"steamid":"76561198158482501","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":854,"last_played":1649731446},"language":"english","review":"The story is excellent and absolutely gripping from start to finish.
