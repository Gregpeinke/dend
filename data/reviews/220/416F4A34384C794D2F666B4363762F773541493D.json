Why is that? Because quite frankly. I loathe this game with a certain type of burning hatred that's indescribable. I'm not gonna say it's a bad game game per say. But rather, Half Life 2 is a tedious soul sucking experience that I find it unfathomable why it's as adored as it. \n\nSure the game has it's strengths like it's physics based puzzles that's sometimes combined with the combat to create interesting tactics. And the lore is up my alley as well. But there's certain sections that I can't muster the strength to go through such as the overly long airboat section where you have to deal with the helicopter. There's also annoying enemies such as manhacks that flock to you in numbers. They're erratic and take too many bullets to kill. It's not many bullets by the way, but if a tiny pigeon sized robot takes more than one bullet to destroy, it's too tanky. Ravenholm sucks too.\n\nOh and by the way, It's been like four years since I beat Half Life 2 and I quit every subsequent playthrough somewhere in the canals because of the tedium I have to endure before the game gets a little better.\n\nWith all of that being said, I like the hammer editor and that's probably the sole reason I would recommend Half Life 2 at all. Better yet, get Garry's Mod.","timestamp_created":1623538653,"timestamp_updated":1623538653,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93648503","author":{"steamid":"76561198119485468","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1450,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1450,"last_played":1605392587},"language":"spanish","review":"excelente juego HALF LIFE 2","timestamp_created":1623537846,"timestamp_updated":1623537846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93647249","author":{"steamid":"76561198813262330","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":1610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":784,"last_played":1656799369},"language":"english","review":"they add gordon feeman poop update\n","timestamp_created":1623535881,"timestamp_updated":1623535881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93646929","author":{"steamid":"76561198427298457","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1049,"last_played":1623775289},"language":"spanish","review":"Una joya que deberían tener en su biblioteca.","timestamp_created":1623535415,"timestamp_updated":1623535415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93646368","author":{"steamid":"76561198046895199","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":5140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5140,"last_played":1429806097},"language":"english","review":"i've played hl2 through twice! love it, took me a while the first time. but, the second time was just as good.good story and good graphics for an older game. a lot of fun. love the gravity gun. if you like this one you definitely should get hl2 episode one and episode two. there a little shorter but still real good games! oh and the characters are unforgettable. no bugs or glitches","timestamp_created":1623534509,"timestamp_updated":1623534509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93645861","author":{"steamid":"76561199179272573","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":789,"last_played":1658632242},"language":"english","review":"Really well made game, packed with action and all sorts of puzzling levels. the character interactions are great for it's time, and there is always a challenge awaiting.","timestamp_created":1623533706,"timestamp_updated":1640344387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93644836","author":{"steamid":"76561198054673776","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":350,"last_played":1625522033},"language":"english","review":"I have enjoyed this game for years.

It's an example of what a good game should be: engaging, story-driven, well written and with a great execution. While the first one didn't quite catch my attention, this one did and it hit pretty good. \n\nThis is Half-Life 2.\n\n[h3]What surrounds you drives the story[/h3]\nIt's a direct sequel to Half-Life and, while making more characters have more lines of dialogue, it retains the \"silent protagonist\" formula. Usually I'm not prone to liking silent characters, but I have to say that this time was different. \n\nI've felt like Gordon Freeman, I've felt like a protagonist and the dialogue is written in a way that makes you feel engaged even when you're not even speaking or interacting to people. \nThe whole world is literally built [i]around you[/i] and yet Gordon doesn't have a single line of dialogue! Combine* this with an excellent cast and you're in for a really good trip.\n\n*[i]Pun not intended[/i]\n\n[h3]Frenetic gameplay, smart platform sections[/h3]\nJust like HL1, gameplay-wise the game retains its frenetic pace (at least in hard mode) but also its calmer sections, including platforming. I've always felt that every decision made for the level design was good, not boring, engaging and original. \n\nSure, nowadays some aspects may seem outdated, but overrall I think it handles everything really well.\n\n[h3]Technical masterpiece?[/h3]\nHonestly I can't even begin to imagine how it must've been to see such a complex game coming out in 2004. Source engine has proved to be a solid and pleasing graphical engine which, to this day, still looks interesting. Sure, it's outdated, but I can't say I was bothered graphically by the environment while playing. In addition to that, there's a free update available here on Steam which enhances its graphics.\n\nI've played it with original graphics, and I must say that I was impressed with how they managed to put so much detail into a game, cosidering how old it is.\n\n[h2]What should you do?[/h2]\nIf you like a well built story-line with engaging dialogues and an engaging environment, buy it.\n\nThere are two more episodes available which expand the game lore (I'll be reviewing them soon, so check them out if you want).\nUnfortunately, Half-Life has earned its infamous reputation for being an interrupted story which never really continued, until HL: Alyx (which has like a 20 seconds scene set after the ending of episode two). \n\nSo, be aware that the story doesn't actually end and probably won't, at least for now. Sure, HL: Alyx proves that this franchise is not dead, but I would not raise my hopes up that much.\n\nYou can check my other reviews here, if you want:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/bodolovsello/recommended/\n\nRecommended!","timestamp_created":1623440794,"timestamp_updated":1624012468,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93582900","author":{"steamid":"76561199111388791","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":664,"last_played":1656619337},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1623440776,"timestamp_updated":1623440776,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93582345","author":{"steamid":"76561198987067056","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1087,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1087,"last_played":1619497502},"language":"english","review":"[h1]Half Life 2[/h1]\n[i]By: Grained Orator[/i]\n[b]“The incident”:[/b]\n\t Half-Life is a series that is held in very high regard in a lot of gamers' pantheons. Now I’m not going to sugar coat and say “is it as good as everyone says? XD Ogbogaloo” because there is no need. So let me introduce this series to the layman.\n\tHalf-Life 2 is one of those sequels that is played before the original, much like how not many people play Call of Duty games in chronological order. The predominant reason for this is just how much innovation Half-Life 2 brought to table to gaming and Values other games. Physics based gameplay? Graphics that don’t make me wish for a LASIK surgery? Take my child as a down payment! Both these features were a breath of fresh air the year they came out so I guess it’s time to fully discuss them, the gameplay and graphics.\n\n[b]“Pick up the can.”:[/b]\n\tPhysics is a word we often use haphazardly to describe any scene or moment where “that explosion is much too large from that milk truck” or “that jump isn’t physically possible!” but Half-Life 2 takes that trend and piledrives it into the pavement. Many of the puzzles of the game involve using critical thinking about how the laws of the universe work around us, such as the center of mass, or momentum. Now these puzzles may not be very difficult but they serve their purpose as an illustration of the capabilities of the source engine. I mean I can break a table on a combine soldier's head using the gravity gun and he’ll peel over and die. The physics is just so satisfying to play through as it’s all intuitive and clearly play tested to an absurd degree. I mean even my Monkey brain knows how to move cinder blocks to make a ramp. But speaking of physics, this game has guns. No not muscles, but an assortment of a shotgun, small machine gun, pistol, and other things. Now to be honest the gunplay is serviceable, by itself it wouldn’t really be considered very good but mixed with the fast paced dodge and shoot combat makes it engaging throughout it’s runtime. The game lasts maybe six to seven so you don’t get exhausted by the gameplay nor the gimmicks such as the airboat. Which controls like a shopping cart with all bad wheels but the section only lasts like thirty minutes so you can leave that thing at the bottom of the lake where it belongs. So in conclusion, gameplay is good.\n\n[b]“Rise and Shine”:[/b]\n\tThe story of Half-Life Two is entertaining. Honestly, I found the story to be admirable and somewhat cliche. A hero must go and save humanity from an alien force with a resistance by his side. Sounds like the plot of a C list anime but what makes it endearing are the small moments. Playing Catch with a Robotic dog, surviving the terror that is Ravenholm, teleporting across the universe to only have to travel to the destination you were planning to anyway. These small moments and details make up any art piece, film, game, or whatever. I don’t want to spoil anymore of what happens in this story so just go play it again if you’re already willing to suffer through this tiny summative review.\n\n[b]“The Freeman”:[/b]\n\t10/10. Truly an example of what game development is all about, innovation, creativity, and a bit of insanity.

Y yo se que voy a recibir muchos comentarios negativos y dislikes en mi video, por lo que para todos los haters que escuchen esto, MI OPINIÓN ES LA CORRECTA,y si vas a darme dislike, a mí honestamente no me importa, soy un youtuber de Roblox, así que obviamente tengo la opinión superior; Y como siempre no se olviden de darle like y suscribirse.\n\n-Primero, a mi no me gusta este juego por la música, al ser un juego de ritmo, la música tiene un rol demasiado importante, juegos de ritmo como OSU! tienen muy buena música, pero uhhhh Friday Night Funkin suena como Alvin y las Ardillas, cada ves que escucho a los personajes cantar, me hacen sangrar las orejas. Yo honestamente no me voy a sorprender que NinjaMuffin (creador de Friday Night Funkin) trajo a un bebe para hacer estas voces, porque uhhhh la música es puro cirnge.\n\n-Razón número 2: Friday Night Funkin no es un juego de ritmo porque no es OSU!, OSU! fue creado antes que Friday Night Funkin y es el único juego de ritmo que existe; El creador de Friday Night Funkin también dijo que el hizo el juego en 2 días, 2 días no es tiempo suficiente como para hacer un juego bueno, como uhhhhhhh, deja de copiarte de OSU!, porque es cringe.\n\n-Razón número 3: En Friday Night Funkin el nombre del novio es: BOYFRIEND, eso no tiene sentido, NADIE EN ESTE PLANETA SE LLAMA BOYFRIEND, como, quién le puso es nombre?, cuando lo nombraron sus padres probablemente estaban fumando marihuana, y el nombre de la novia es: GIRLFRIEND, por favor piensa en mejores nombres Ninjamuffin, es como si un niño de 5 años escribió estos personajes.\n\n-Razón número 4: La novia tiene que pararse, si ella no se para de esos altavoces, ella no podrá comer usar el baño o hacer cosas que los seres humanos deben hacer, y es que no es tan saludable sentarse por tanto tiempo, estudios han mostrado que sentarse o hecharse por tanto tiempo aumenta tu probabilidad de de sufrir problemas, como la diabetes y algunos canceres, sentarse mucho también puede ser malo para tu salud mental, Yo espero quw la novia se pare algún día, y que NinjaMuffin deje de promover este mensaje no saludable, porque no esta bien.\n\n\\Razon número 5: Como muchos lo notaron, la abreviatura de Friday Night Funkin (FNF) se parece mucho a FNAF, el cual es un juego de furros que salió mucho antes que friday night funkin, solo hay una letra de diferencia, y a este punto le estan copiando a FNAF, solo hay de diferencia UNA LETRA, en serio, deja de copiarle a FNAF, o Freddy Fazbear se va a enojar.\n\n\\Razón número 6:El cabello de Boyfriend es azul. Esto no tiene ningún sentido, ya que la gente no nace pon pelo azul, entonces por qué tiene pelo azul?, el creador no se ha dado cuenta de eso.\n\n\\Razón número 7: La única razón del porque el juego esta vivo es por los mods, en, serio, si no fuera por los mods, ya estaría muerto, personalmente pienso que los mods son mejores que el juego en sí.\n\n\\Razón número 8: Friday Night Funkin roba personajes de newgrounds, como Pico, TankMan y hasta personajes de Sr Pelo. En este tweet Sr Pelo literalmente dice \"Ninjamuffin deja de robar mis personajes\", yo honestamente no puedo creer como pueden apoyar a Ninjamuffin después de que haya hecho algo como esto.\n\n\\Razón número 9:Las manos de Boyfriend son demasiado grandes, nadie tiene las manos de ese tamaño, el también es demasiado corto, osea, donde carajos están sus órganos? Esto no tiene nada de realismo.\n\n\\Y razón número 10: Roblox es MEJOR que Friday night funkin, todos lo hemos pensado, todos sabemos que es verdad. Roblox es mucho mejor que friday night funkin, Roblox tiene más puntos buenos, hasta los Fangames de Friday night funkin en Roblox son mejores que el juego en sí, creo es dice algo.\n\nY si, puedo estar diciendo más razones por las que este juego es malo, pero eso me va a tomar para siempre. En conclusión friday night funkin es muy mal juego y yo pienso que es completo cringe.","timestamp_created":1623414787,"timestamp_updated":1623414787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93561940","author":{"steamid":"76561198840591678","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1624092672},"language":"english","review":"Ravenholm can suck my ass.
