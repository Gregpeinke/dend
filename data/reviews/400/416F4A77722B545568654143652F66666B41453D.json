Arada çok azını oynanabilirliğinden ötürü tercih ederiz. Portal da herşeyin sadece ilk cümlede saydıklarımdan dolayı alınmayacak bir oyun. İlk duyurulduğunda oldukça amatör ama bir o kadar değişik bir konu ile karşı karşıya kalacağımızdan emindim. Ama gel gör, oyunu yüklemem ile birlikte konu bile olmadığını fark etmem hiç zaman almadı. Peki benim bu ağzımdan akan köpükler ne? Şu yazıyı bile hazırlamayı eziyet kılan ne? İşte onu göreceğiz birazdan... \n\nDigipen Teknoloji Enstitüsünün birkaç öğrencisi bir araya gelip Narbacular Drop isminde bir proje hazırlamışlar. Amaç geçitler açarak çıkış noktasına ulaşmak imiş. Kendi hazırladıkları grafik motoru ile Digipen'in yıllık öğrenci fuarında sunmuşlar. Valve'nin kurucusu Gabe Nevell bu fuarda görüp etkilendiği bu projeye hemen sahip çıkıp, tüm ekibi bir arada işe almış. Ardından Portal'ı birlikte geliştirmeye başlamışlar. Bu süreç içinde oyunun nasıl satılacağına dair bazı fikirler sundu Valve yetkilileri. Kimi zaman, Orance Box ile, kimi zaman ayrı tek başına bir proje olarak satılacağı bildirildi. En sonunda Half-Life 2: Episode 2 ile birlikte Oranga Box içinde verilmesine karar verildi. \n\nBugüne kadar çözdüklerinizi bulmaca mı sanmıştınız? \nBir çok oyunda karşımıza çıkan bulmacalar, genel olarak çok zorlamadan geçilir ki oyunun akışını çok fazla etkilemesin. Macera oyunlarında biraz zordur. Ama yine de çözersiniz. Portalda ise bu tam tersine işliyor. Bir bölümü geçebilmek için sadece bulmaca çözmeniz lazım. \n\nPortal'ın genel mantığı şu şekilde. Elinizde ki alet (Half Life 2'de ki gravity gun'a çok benziyor) ile iki ucunu belirleyebildiğiniz geçitler açıyorsunuz. Bu geçitleri kullanarak bölüm sonundaki asansöre ulaşmanız lazım. Yazımı kolay olsa da yapması o kadar kolay değil. Hele bölümler iyice ilerledikten sonra. Zira birçok noktada sadece geçit açmak işinizi görmüyor. Kimi zaman tavana açıp, hedefinizin üstüne düşmeniz, kimi zaman ise bulunduğunuz odanın dibine açıp, yukarıda bulunan bir yerden ona atlayarak hız kazanıp diğer tarafa ulaşmanızı gerektiriyor. Görüldüğü üzere anlatması bile çok zor. \n\nSonuca ulaşmak için sadece portalı kullanmak yeterli olmuyor demiştim. Aynı zamanda bölüm içinde bulunan ve sürekli olarka size ateş eden silahları da uygun şekilde yönlendirmek lazım. Mesela silahın mermisinin yoluna geçidin bir ucunu silaha enerji veren kaynağın önüne geçinidin diğer ucunu açıp silahı yok etmeniz gerekiyor çok zaman. Yok ettiğiniz silahtan sonra yerdeki ağırlık algılayıcıların üzerine, bulacağınız bir koliyi koyup, bir yerlerde kapıyı açacaksınız. \n\nKeşke defalarca oynayabilseydim \nBu kadar süre övdük, anlattık durduk. Şimdi bu oyunun hiç mi sıkıntı yaratacak özelliği yok? Var tabi ki. Bunların en başında da sadece bir defa oynanabiliyor olması var. Sonuçta bölümler statik olarak hazırlandığı için tekrar oynamaya niyetlenseniz de aynı sistemle çözeceğiniz için ikinci oynayış zevk vermeyecektir. Tabi bölüm sayısının çokluğundan dolayı bunu telafi eden bir özelliği var. Toplam 19 ara, 4 ana bölümden oluşan bir yapısı var. Kimi bölümlerde 3-4 dakika harcarken kimisinde 30 dakika hatta daha fazlasını bile harcayabiliyorsunuz. Bu tamamı ile çözümü görmeniz ile alakalı. Zira çok ufak bir ayrıntıyı atlamak, belki bir saatinize mal olabilir. \n\nDediğim üzere anlatması bile oldukça karışık olan Portal, hep aynı senaryolardan sıkılmış ama grafik ve ses gibi özelliklerden de ödün vermek istemeyen, daha dingin fakat beyninizi iyice zorlayacak oyunu arayanlar için mükemmel bir çözüm.","timestamp_created":1512174040,"timestamp_updated":1512174040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.692608535289764404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37988901","author":{"steamid":"76561198342006465","num_games_owned":526,"num_reviews":146,"playtime_forever":151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":151,"last_played":1512170826},"language":"english","review":"This game is wonderful, great sound and graphics.
