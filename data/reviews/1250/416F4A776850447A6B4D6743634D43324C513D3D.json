Floor, man oh man, where do i start?\n-It's got great gameplay\n-Teamwork is vital\n-Patriarch\n-Dosh\n-A bunch of other nice things\n\nGameplay and Graphics:\nThis game has awesome gameplay. You can solo maps if you are really good. If not, grab a few buddies and play together. It also has a wave limit, up to 10 long waves is the maximum. The shooting is great, so is melee. In this game, you can self heal and heal others. Self healing is not as effecient as healing a teammate. The graphics aren't anything special. I mean, for a 2009 mod-turned game, it's pretty good looking!\n\nGore and Class/Leveling:\nThe game is well known for having gore. Heads coming off and bodies being blown to bits. Its pretty interesting. Also, they are so dedicated to good kills that they made a mechanic called Zed time. Zed time puts slo-mo into the game for all players for a short time. This allows for some life saving stunts. The classes are pretty interesting. Though its effecient to use class oriented weaponry, you can give a sharpshooter a shotgun and a chainsaw and they could still pull it off.\n\nStory:\nNothing to see here...\n\nOverall: \nGet this game, if you don't want to pay $20, its frequently on discount for $5. Also get Killing Floor 2.\n10/10 would rush a scrake
