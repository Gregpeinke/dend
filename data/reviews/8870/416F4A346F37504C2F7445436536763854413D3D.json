The game is beautiful and it's a lot of fun. This is a must play.\n\n\nAs a BioShock Game: 6/10\n\nThey completely changed the gameplay from the originals. In this game you can only carry 2 guns at a time, it's more linear (there's no choices to make and only 1 possible ending), it's a lot more fighting oriented and not very objective oriented. If you're a huge fan of the original games, then this game is most likely going to be a bit disappointing. You probably will still love the game, but it doesn't have the charm that got you hooked to the series in the first place. If you were given the game to play without seeing it's title, if wasn't for the Vigors (which are Plasmids) then you wouldn't have known it was a BioShock game.\n\n\n\n\nLong Review\n\nFirst off, if you haven't played the first do games then you better not play this yet. This game has much more of an impact if you've played Bioshock 1 & 2. \n\nSo, I've played the first 2 games a number of times on PS3 and PC. I've played Infinite on my PS3 when it came out, and I've been wanting to play it again on PC. First off, this game is amazing for the most part. There were some things that bothered me a bit becuase they were different from the first 2 games, like the number of guns and plasmids that you could have and the fact that you cannot manually save. And though those things were a bit annoying, it did offer more of a challenge which isn't bad. I think the lack of a manually save is the most annoying thing though since there were a couple parts where the game automatically saved in the most possible spot, and there was no way back. \n\n*********WARNING********* Now this is where I was conflicted about reccommending the game. The game seems to have lots of issues on PC. For me, the game kept crashing every 2-5 minutes so it's pretty unplayable. I've looked up many possible solutions and none of them worked for me. From what I have read, many other people have had problems as well, but not everyone. I have a few friends who have played it on PC with no problems. So, since you can get refunds now, I would say try it out and if it doesn't work just return it. Just make sure you stay eligible for the return. From what I've seen from other people, that means you cannot have over 2 hours on this game or any other game that you purchased at the same time. So, you probably want to buy this game seperately. And since you can get a refund and the game does work for some people, I decided to reccomend it. \n\nI hope this game works for you. It's definitely one of the best games that I have ever played and then ending is just... WOW! I sat there for the entire ending (it's a longer ending) with my mouth just hanging open. 10/10 would play again... and again.. and again... and so on.\n\nUPDATE: When I switched to Windows 10, I bought the game again and had no issues. Windows 7 users may encounter a problem. I'm pretty sure it had something to do with Direct x11 not working properly.","timestamp_created":1451768580,"timestamp_updated":1480130029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20229652","author":{"steamid":"76561198135281906","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1657081436},"language":"spanish","review":"Lo bueno: Como FPS es uno de los mejores que he jugado.
