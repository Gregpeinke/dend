Absolutely delightful humor and background. Characters, though few, are charming. The style of story-telling is iconic.\nGameplay. Simple mechanics that interplay perfectly to add a lot of depth that remains uncomplicated. The puzzles are intuitive but this is definitely not a walking simulator. \nPresentation. This game looks and sounds fantastic. The setting is fun and the game has moments that are breathtaking.\n\nI played through the game in about 6 hours but there is a LOT more content available through community made mods and co-op modes.","timestamp_created":1528039252,"timestamp_updated":1528039252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgpSP4+MCf7aCogE="}
