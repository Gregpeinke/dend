On apprends alors que l'histoire de Half life dans les méandres de Cité 17 ne se ridiculise en rien. En effet on retrouve alors tout un récit qui du premier abords semble facile de compréhension, cependant toute la complexité de l'histoire nous est révélée après avoir combattu plus d'une fois le Dr. Wallace Breen ou après avoir traversé plusieurs fois Ravenholm. C'est un vrai délice dramatique que de faire et refaire ces deux premiers volets.\n\nLes deux volets qui suivent, c'est à dire Half life 2 : episode one et Half life 2 : episode two, ne font que confirmer mon points de vue sur cette formidable saga. Selon moi l'univers d'Half life est du même niveau que celle de Star wars et est même bien plus intéressante. Le travail des personnages notamment celui d'Alyx Vance nous transporte véritablement du début à la fin. La personnalité d'Alyx \"déteint\" sur le personnage de Gordon qui nous permet alors de ne plus déifier le célèbre Gordon Freeman et lui confère alors un visage plus humain. \nDe plus l'orientation prise autour du G-man est fabuleuse, le secret autours de ce personnage qui nous accompagne (malgré nous) tout au long des chapitres de la série est intense.

После прохождения этой игры (от которой я не мог оторваться) я пошел в одиночную кампанию Battlefield 4, и меня, если честно, от нелогичности и напыщенности происходящего по сценарию и откровенной однообразности геймплея начинало тошнить.\nHalf-Life 2 выделяется на фоне других шутеров сразу по нескольким факторам: 1) Игра до сих пор выглядит неплохо, а как она выглядела в сравнении с другими играми в далеком 2004 году страшно себе представить. Если прибавить к этому очень неплохую физику (которая явно лучше, нежели в Call of Duty, ибо тонущие под весом героя машины были еще здесь, а в Ghosts это появилось впервые), то в техническом плане игра опередила свое время.\n2) Непрерывность повествования: между уровнями даже нет загрузочных экранов в привычном понимании. Переходя на следующий уровень, игра ставится на паузу, и прогружется следующая локация, создавая эффект целостности игрового мира, причем во многих случаях можно вернуться назад. Также это подчеркивает кратковременность всего происходящего (ну, если не принимать в расчет скачек на неделю вперед, который, впрочем, Гордон и Алекс даже не заметили).\n3) Эта игра заставляет думать. Уровни наполнены множеством головоломок, решение которых всячески задействуют особенности и возможности движка Source (который, кстати, использует свеженький Titanfall, пусть и усовершеноствованный).\n4) Неплохой сюжет, в котором обошлось без ляпов и откровенного бреда, которого в том же самом Battlefield 4, о котором я говорил в начале, предостаточно.\nМоя оценка ей - 10\\10.","timestamp_created":1394387272,"timestamp_updated":1394387774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569767415523529053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9400772","author":{"steamid":"76561198070680094","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":334,"last_played":1582422635},"language":"english","review":"You're in the Palestine of the future, City 17 is Gaza, Breen is Mahmoud Abbas, the zombies are the other 3rab, and the headcrabs are the US and Israel, shit all makes sense.","timestamp_created":1394386079,"timestamp_updated":1394386079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9400296","author":{"steamid":"76561198055890296","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":742,"last_played":1602794730},"language":"english","review":"So you have your typical FPS games.

Das Spiel ist in der first Person und Grafik ist eigentlich recht gut obwohl es im Jahr 2004 erschienen ist! \nSo aber jetzt mal zu den Punkteverteilung! =) (von 0-10 Punkten)\n- Grafik = 8 Punkte \n- Steuerung = 9 Punkte (einfache und leichte Steuereung !!Achtung!! ich weiss es nicht wie es bei Gampads ist!!!)\n- Spielspass = 10 Punkte ( es macht immer Spass und die Story wird nie langweilig!) \n- Sprache = 10 Punkte ( da es 18 Sprachen gibt)\n- Spielstunden = 8 Punkte ( da man schon einige Zeit braucht bis man das Spiel durch hat) \n- Steam Errungenschaften = 10 Punkte ( da es ja von Valve programmiert worden ist und dadurch auch Steam Errungeschaften gibt macht es wesentlich mehr Spass) \n- Story = 10 Punkte ( die Story wird nie langweilig!!) \nFazit: \n\nIm großen und ganzen ist das Spiel ein echt gutes Action Shooter Game das wirklich (meiner Meinung nach) immer noch in die Top 10 soll! Das Spiel macht spass und es wird einen nie langweilig! Das gute an Half-Life 2 ist das man auch mit Fahrzeugen (wzb. Wasserfahrzeug, etc. fahren kann!). \nAlso ich finde das ist eine Kaufempfehlung und rate jeden das er es mal spielen muss! Ich freue mich schon auf den Teil 3 (Half-Life 3), dass hoffentlich bald erscheinen wird.","timestamp_created":1394214977,"timestamp_updated":1394266293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492682933807373047","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9374358","author":{"steamid":"76561198042324936","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1333,"last_played":1634732193},"language":"russian","review":"Игра шикарная.
