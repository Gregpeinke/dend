I played this almost every night when I was in high school and wouldn't be surprised if I put 1000+ hours into the original mod.  \n\nComing back to this game after over a decade away I find it's still one of my favourites.  The gameplay is pretty basic by modern FPS standards, coming from an era where things like free mouselook were still kind of new.  Even the ancient BF1942 is more advanced than Day of Defeat.  And this isn't a Battlefield game - no vehicles, no huge maps and far less time from spawn to action.  \n\nWhat this game offers is intense rifle and SMG combat as two sides battle over flags.  Snipers and machine-gunners will find themselves at home as much as players like myself who prefer to charge forward with no cares in the world.  The gameplay is pretty similar to Counterstrike, although there are understandably fewer automatic weapons and more reliance on bolt-action rifles and grenades.\n\nThere is a small but loyal server population.  I recommend playing on the Merrill's Marauders servers - they have a 24/7 Caen server (Caen is one of the best original maps) as well as a 24/7 Avalanche server (perhaps the most popular map of all time).  Their players tend to be older guys like myself and, though polite and fun to play and chat with, aren't exactly slouches when it comes to playing DoD.  Mature, but challenging competition awaits.  The Merrill's servers use bots for times when server populations are low, so there will always be at least a little action.\n\nI heartily recommend getting back into the game for anyone who played the mod almost two decades ago.  I also strongly recommend the game for older gamers (30s+)  who prefer playing with others around their age group.  You'll find that the simplicity of the game mechanics means any hand-eye coordination you've lost over the years won't mean quite as much as it might playing CoD or Battlefield.\n\nI give the game a \"sure, why not?\" for younger gamers who are just getting into first-person shooters.  Learn the ropes with some old pros before moving on to fancier and more expensive games (on sale, DoD costs as much as a snack).\n\nYoung gamers who are FPS pros should probably give this game a pass, because the aging graphics and archaic mechanics might prove frustrating and limiting.  Then again, you just might enjoy yourselves, and for a few bucks it isn't a big investment.\n\nSummary:  One of the best \"original\" mutiplayer FPS experiences, in my opinion.  I didn't happen to own the Quake or Tribes games back in the 90s, but I was definitely a hoarder of Half-Life mods.  Old gamers may appreciate it more than younger ones thanks to the nostalgia and aged community, but young gamers might have fun too.  It will *not* blow you away with its graphics, and its mechanics are certainly far from innovative in 2016, but given that the game might very well be older than the person reading this, that can't be helped.\n\nGive it a go!\n\n(Note on DoD Source - I haven't really played Source much, but from what I understand it changes a lot of mechanics to work with the newer Source engine and is missing some classic maps like Caen.  You might get more mileage out of Source, but then again you might not - up to your discretion).","timestamp_created":1471256536,"timestamp_updated":1471256882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24886323","author":{"steamid":"76561198059674066","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":701,"last_played":1527536819},"language":"english","review":"i join into a game then some how i get into a game with 40 year olds talking about there teens in the 80s","timestamp_created":1471099470,"timestamp_updated":1471099470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":18,"weighted_vote_score":"0.635550618171691895","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24879267","author":{"steamid":"76561198280120059","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1472902931},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun kıtlığı çekiyosanız iş görür.","timestamp_created":1471080850,"timestamp_updated":1471080850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24874211","author":{"steamid":"76561198260569821","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":730,"last_played":1562624770},"language":"english","review":"It was ok but i refund cuz i got bored it was fun for like 2 days lol","timestamp_created":1471066377,"timestamp_updated":1471066377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24838029","author":{"steamid":"76561198151339018","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":719,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":615,"last_played":1575441991},"language":"schinese","review":"一部03年的游戏，这么低的配置居然能做的这么好！还能匍匐、奔跑、安装枪架！还能把敌人扔过来的手雷再扔回去！虽然画质差劲，如果不论画质，这游戏就已经算神作了！除了DOD还有什么游戏能做成这样？","timestamp_created":1470986203,"timestamp_updated":1470986203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507389187812805176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24829919","author":{"steamid":"76561198202068413","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":5506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2745,"last_played":1571591797},"language":"english","review":"THE GAME IS GOOD\nBut all the servers suck, if you're like me and you want the basic, classic game with no mods and maps the aren't dod_ultaorange_nograv_360 don't buy this game unless you have friends to play LAN with.\n3/10","timestamp_created":1470938715,"timestamp_updated":1470938715,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474958688020706177","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24803446","author":{"steamid":"76561198043399652","num_games_owned":406,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":70,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":70,"last_played":1470795658},"language":"english","review":"gud","timestamp_created":1470795699,"timestamp_updated":1470795699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24758314","author":{"steamid":"76561198007284213","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":62140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41028,"last_played":1560695886},"language":"english","review":"Older, but still fun fps","timestamp_created":1470570044,"timestamp_updated":1470570044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24739012","author":{"steamid":"76561198159779766","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":8108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2190,"last_played":1659263733},"language":"english","review":"Played day of defeat souce.

It is all straight forward first-person shooter online action. Just player model and weapon - single shot rifles, semi-auto machine guns, sniper, machine gun, bazooka, and knife (or bayonet and trench shovel). \n\nWhat makes this game excellent? The player control of the models and guns is tight - extremely tight. It feels seamless between ones choice of movement and the actual gameplay. In this sense one feels in complete control, and thus the behaviour of your players feels like a true extention of oneself. \n\nThe game lends itself well to teamplay with excellent voice over microphone. The sound in the game is very good, and listening is a critical part of playing well. \n\nThe Day of Defeat community is extensive and skilled and has produced an enormous amount of modified material. There are tons and tons of player created custom maps which are equal in quality to the core of 20 stock maps which come with the game. \n\nHalf-Life is the greatest shooter game ever. So is it any doubt that this ww2-based modification of Half-Life is the greatest WW2 shooter? It has been around for 13 years now, so the skill level of the player base is fairly high. However, DOD players are usually well-helpful to new players. \n\nIf you like running and gunning in a WW2 environment, you gotta give this game a try.

is captured!\" an Allied soldier calls as our squad moves down the alleyway, leading into the larger war-torn plaza. A man to my right gets gunned down by Soviet sniper fire, and I immediately drop to the ground. A faint clink registers to the left of my person. A grenade. I respawn, run around tthe corner carrying a springfield rifle, and am quickly cut down again by a filthy camper to the right of our spawning alley. I angrily mumble \"Camper on right side of alley,\" and almost immediately 3 of my teamates converge on the soldier intrenched in a demolished shop. 2 grenades follow up my callout, and a soldier wielding a Garand comes to to crush his skull with a rifle butt. \n\nOnce again, we sprint to cover in the alley leading to the plaza. But this time, there's a soldier up on the second story of a building to our left chucking potato mashers in our small group of 4-5 people. This time, I admit I'm only wielding a springfield and that sombebody else will need to take the lead into the building. Shockingly, an Allied soldier carrying a Thompson hears my call and moves in ahead of me to take out the camper from behind. I pull out my little 1911 handgun and follow after, in case he needs the backup. A single potato masher tumbles to the Thompson gunner and he crumples to the floor. I sprint past him to the top of the building and gun down the Soviet, and call it out to my team so we can move up. I get back downstairs to move across the street, only to crumple to the ground as a sniper picks me off.\n\n1911/1944 IGN\n\nIn general, the community for this game is very active, especially considering how old it is, and I thoroughly enjoyed making callouts and following up on coordinated charges into the plaza, for hours on end.

Это все там как в TF классы (снайпер , сержант(да это класс), пехотинец и тд) и все оружие естественно  бесплатно (у каждого класса свое оружие) , но у англичан всего лишь 5 или 4 класса (они попадаются очень редко)\nрекомендую","timestamp_created":1464521111,"timestamp_updated":1464521111,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23238824","author":{"steamid":"76561198274229344","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":516,"last_played":1659347800},"language":"english","review":"tf is this","timestamp_created":1464374019,"timestamp_updated":1586382988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23162947","author":{"steamid":"76561197991396886","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":340,"last_played":1546707465},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom","timestamp_created":1464042214,"timestamp_updated":1464042214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23156537","author":{"steamid":"76561198278023392","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":13,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1464014411},"language":"english","review":"VAC banned without installing the game -_- It looks great offline :)","timestamp_created":1464015105,"timestamp_updated":1464015105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23125535","author":{"steamid":"76561198138018476","num_games_owned":377,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":101,"last_played":1511028072},"language":"english","review":"A WWII based Half-Life mod.\n\nPros:\nGreat guns\nGreat WWII atmosphere\nGreat maps\nGreat online gameplay\n\nCons: \nThe game is a little dead, so there is no much servers online\n\n\nI really recommend gettind DoD Source over this.
