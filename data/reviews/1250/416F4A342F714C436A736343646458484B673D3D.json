if you make a mistake ( allow one of the weakest, but most annoying buggers in the game to grab you ) , you die.Except if you have the right perks,which I will now explain.\nPerks define your weapons and bonuses.Technically they are classes.There is a pyro,grenadier,sharpshooter (technically made to one shot most zombies using headshots),commando which is kinda heavy weapons,medic and support specialist.Best thing is - you can always switch them!To level a perk requires one or more feats.\n(Example : To level up a medic you must heal N points.To level up a sharpshooter you must do N headshots.Each perk or class has its own unique feats and weapons.)\nYou have to wait a round, however, and you can change perks once per round,during the shopping time.Shopping time is the time between rounds,lasts a minute and there's a predefined spot on the map,the location of which is shown by an arrow in the top left corner of the screen, and a red sort-of misty-light that show you the way after the round has ended.One in the shop, you heal automatically, restock on ammo, get new weapons and if you want to, switch perks.\nDepending on the size of your team, the difficulty level and the match length, the zombie numbers range from 20 to 70,in a 10 match duration in Normal solo mode,where you can hone your skills,and 50 to 200 if you have 5 or more teammates, this time in Normal Multiplayer.\nDifficulty level is what it should be - measures the damage,health and general smarts of the zombies.\nMoving onto the zombies, there are 12 or so kinds of them, ranging from small black spider-like zombies to the Boss, the Patriarch,who has a minigun, rocket launcher, claws, invisibility and when he's close to death, he has 3 health syringes which heal him.He uses 1 syringe per heal.\nAll in all,there are minor bugs that aren't even close to serious, and are mildly annoying.The game is extremely fun to play, especially with friends.It's also set in Britain so expect lots of British slang.\nNow hurry up, you lot, and buy this bloody game while it's on sale!","timestamp_created":1404983524,"timestamp_updated":1404983524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11163442","author":{"steamid":"76561198136597027","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":622,"last_played":1512636057},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกมาก ๆ","timestamp_created":1404983202,"timestamp_updated":1404983202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11163040","author":{"steamid":"76561198020746641","num_games_owned":336,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":13459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10382,"last_played":1590644131},"language":"english","review":"GREAT ZOMBIE GAME!
