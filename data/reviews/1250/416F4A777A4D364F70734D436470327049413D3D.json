Took me a while to figure out, and is a very hard game, but fun wih lots of weapons, maps, and achievements. The only bad thing is after trying to complete many achievements, I found out later that u can only complete them during certain times of the year. That is about the only annoying thing about this game. So buy it and prepare to be playing throughout the year, if you wanna take the achievements down....","timestamp_created":1388553336,"timestamp_updated":1388553336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzM6OpsMCdp2pIA=="}
