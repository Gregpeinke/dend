There's a bug with the mouse that causes it to snap to the center of the screen. It's fixed by going into the options menu and checking Raw Mouse Input. This expansion pack is short. My first playthrough took me 3 hours to finish it and the only reason why it toke me that long is because some of the puzzles and platforming bits were annoying. More then once I found myself completing a puzzle or puzzle platforming section and going \"What! That's what I'm supposed to do!?\" and \"Oh, think god that's over! I'm glad I wont have to do that again.\" This is an expansion pack for people who like the lore.

The game has a few memorable characters but not because they have any voice-lines, it's because their one of few characters in this game (unless you count the people shooting at you). While this isn't necessarily a bad thing in typical HL fashion this story isn't one to write home about or lose your nut over. Although, seeing the events unfold from the perspective of a guard is quite intriguing to say the least and we see many parts of MESA that I wish I had seen in the original HL \n\nThe graphics are obviously a bit dated in 2020 but I quite enjoy the pixelated character models and low resolution sounds, it's very retro and quite nostalgic and considering the technical limitations of the engine they were using as well as the time period I'd say this is pretty impressive. \n\nI very much enjoyed this game with my only problem being it's length. The game can be beat in about 2 hours on a casual play-through and unless you are trying to complete it on the hardest difficulty level then there is no real level of replay-ability which is a shame as this is such a fun little expansion. \n\nTo conclude I'd only play HL:BS if you've played HL1 and wan't more sweet MESA action!

So our pals at Gearbox are back at it again with this expansion, after having made the rather excellent Half-Life Opposing Force. Now what you might not know is that Blue Shift was intended as a bonus chapter of sorts for the Dreamcast Version of Half-Life, however since that port was cancelled due to the Dreamcast being discontinued. Blue Shift instead became a standalone expansion released for the PC Version in 2001. So with that all said, you may be wondering how is Blue Shift? well..there isn't much to say. I'll just go over the only notable things about this, because really this expansion is very forgettable and can be finished in less than 2 hours if you know what you are doing. So here we go, I will state the things I find worth talking about here both good and bad and then give my final thoughts at the end.\n\n\n1. You play as Barney Calhoun, a Black Mesa security officer in this expansion who happened to be on the job when stuff goes south. Due to Barney not having an HEV Suit you cannot use any HEV Suit chargers, instead you have to rely on finding Body Armor around the field to preserve your armor meter.\n\n2. Your main goal is to just escape Black Mesa alongside a group of scientists and other officers..that's literally it. It doesn't leave much to the imagination.\n\n3. The game is super short with only about 5 major areas to go through, you'll go through Black Mesa, Xen and a Power Plant alongside 2 others that honestly escape me atm and as mentioned above you can finish the game in less than 2 hours if you really know what you are doing.\n\n4. Rather then have Barney fight something at the end, you just face a bunch of Army Grunts who you don't even need to kill, you can just walk past them and walk through the portal to escape Black Mesa, talk about underwhelming. Considering that Gordon and Sheppard both fight a final boss.\n\n5. Barney has a serious lack of weapons compared to Sheppard and Gordon. All the new weapons introduced in Opposing Force are notably absent, the only weapons you get are from the base game of Half-Life but even then not all of them are here. Notably absent is the Tau Cannon, Gluon Gun, and Crossbow are all absent here, leaving Barney with the absolute smallest arsenal of the 3 protagonists. Very lame\n\n6. Basically as a whole this game only serves to explain how certain Black Mesa employees manage to escape the facillity, however most people could probably just take a wild guess on how they did so, so really this expansion just serves as filler content which is a shame. I know it was intended as just a small bonus chapter for the Dreamcast version, but you'd think if they were making it a full expansion, they could..you know expand it?\n\n\n\nSo overall Half-Life Blue Shift is a pretty forgettable Expansion and entry in the Half-Life series that honestly is just there and doesn't have much to talk about. It's not a bad game or anything, but it just feels so bland and forgettable, consider that the most significant thing is Barney Calhoun who would later go on to be a major character in Half-Life 2, other than that this entry is very forgettable and honestly you can skip out on this one. Unless you absolutely want to play everything Half-Life then I would Only pick this up for dirt cheap, it goes on sale for about 1 dollar which is about how much you should pay for it. Otherwise pass on it.\n\nBlue Shift would get about a 5.5/10","timestamp_created":1606771826,"timestamp_updated":1652241363,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496896445751190186","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81279326","author":{"steamid":"76561198879903490","num_games_owned":302,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":327,"last_played":1606693942},"language":"latam","review":"Half-Life: Blue Shift es el segundo spin-off del legendario Half-Life. Este juego tiene la mitad de duración que Opossing Force, o sea que sería un cuarto de la duración del Half-Life. En Blue Shift personificamos a Barney Calhoun, un guardia de seguridad de Black Mesa que trata de escapar de las instalaciones a la par de los eventos del juego original.\nLos gráficos son básicamente los mismos que en Opossing Force. El sonido tampoco tiene cambios significativos, con una buena ambientación. La jugabilidad es idéntica a la del primer juego, sin nada novedoso, ya que no trae armas ni enemigos nuevos respecto del juego original. La historia del juego sigue enriqueciendo el universo de Half-Life, y transcurre a la par de los eventos de los juegos anteriores, con varias apariciones de Gordon Freeman y menciones a Adrian Shephard.\nSi bien Blue Shift no trae nada novedoso a la saga, es totalmente recomendable si jugaste Half-Life y Opossing Force y te

While it pales in comparison to Half-Life and Opposing Force, much shorter and has less intense gameplay, I believe this can partly be forgiven due to the protagonist we play; Barney Calhoun.\n\nSeeing as Barney is merely a security guard with less equipment and skill than who you play in the other two instalments, it makes sense in a canon viewpoint that his time was limited because he most likely would have died if he had stayed as long as the others. This is also why the game has more of a horror atmosphere in places, because Barney is a more vulnerable character; he is the underdog of the trio and his only goal was to get out in one piece and try to help anyone along the way. It fits him as a character.\n\nDespite the difference in tone and gameplay however, it is still very easily the worst Half-Life (altough I haven't finished Decay); the interesting POV of the security guard, its unique setting and tone are the only things it has to offer over the other games. On the other hand, it's very good for being the weakest Half-Life game as overall it is still a good game and is  very enjoyable but just not up to usual Half-Life standard. I really appreciate it for what it is.\n\nIf the game was just a little longer, had a bit more engaging action, a little more original content and put even more emphasis on the horror and vulnerability tone I think people would appreciate this game far more and I believe this would help bridge the gap between this game and the other Half-Life games.","timestamp_created":1606608857,"timestamp_updated":1606608961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":28,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.759613752365112305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80957331","author":{"steamid":"76561198222003948","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1596480358},"language":"english","review":"fun game that in the half life universe \nif you enjoyed the original half life you will probably like this","timestamp_created":1606605611,"timestamp_updated":1606605611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80917845","author":{"steamid":"76561198183893194","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":357,"last_played":1606581823},"language":"english","review":"This spin-off with a third perspective on the main story is a let-down.
