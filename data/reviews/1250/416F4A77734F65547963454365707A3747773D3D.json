The more you play the more you 'level' up and the more powerful you get with your respective classes. Tons of fun, reasonably deep system that keeps you working on improving your skills. Achievements to keep you motivated, and for when you finally think you have what it takes to survive, there is are Suicidal and Hell On Earth difficulties which flip the game play style because the monsters are so hard, and so numerous.
