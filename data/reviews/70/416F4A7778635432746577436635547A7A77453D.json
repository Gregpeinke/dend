Todo el mundo pensaba en aquel entonces que contar historias en este tipo de juegos sería frenar al jugador y arruinar su experiencia. Todo, hasta que llegó Gordon Freeman y cambió las reglas para siempre.\n\n\nHalf Life buscó la forma de tener un argumento interesante y a la vez mantener una buena jugabilidad la cual el jugador no se aburriera en ningún momento.\n\nEl secreto era mantener el jugador dentro de la aventura sin sacarle del control en ningún momento a causa de observar cinemáticas o escenas \"scripteadas\". Porque si. Half Life es un juego donde el jugador está conectado todo el tiempo. Siempre se mantendrá en la piel de Freeman y todas las escenas de acción las verá a través de sus propios ojos, sin que nada lo desconecte del propio videojuego.\n\nEscenas como las muertes de los científicos fueron parte de una experiencia que nadie había conseguido igualar y dieron una inmersión practicamente perfecta. Es simplemente un juego excelente pensado muy bien diseñado de principio a fin.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhora bien, ha pasado mucho tiempo desde 1998 y en estos 20 años hemos podido ver que muchos juegos muy buenos en su día han acabado envejeciendo mal.\n\nEn el caso de Half Life, no es una excepción, aunque con un poco de práctica, el juego puede disfrutarse sin problemas. Pero es cierto que, por ejemplo, como no hay un botón de \"sprint\" pues el personaje corre todo el tiempo y en un juego donde el plataformeo es importante, pues acabas muriendo más por caídas que ser reventado a balazos en dificultad difícil.\n\nDe todas formas es cuestión de tener paciencia porque el resto del juego es muy bueno, aunque tengo que admitir que a comparación de otros shooters más modernos (no recientes, hablo de shooters del 2007, por ejemplo) este resulta un tanto confuso, ya sea por su falta de orientación al jugador o porque tiene muchas cosas mal hechas, como las ametrelladoras fijas que son basura.\n\n\n\n\n\nDe todas formas, este juego debería de ser una compra obligatoria para todos los que tengan un PC y tengan Steam (y más cuando se rebaja a 0,81€ en rebajas).\n\nSe trata de uno de estos juegos imprescindibles que aunque parezcan muy genéricos, se nota que han mantenido su personalidad con el paso de los años y han marcado toda una generación.\n\nPor cierto, tiene dos expansiones opcionales. Son historias alternativas a Gordon Freeman: una manejamos a un guardia de seguridad y otra a un marine de los EE.UU. (enemigos de Freeman). Si os gusta el juego y queréis más, pues más contenido para el singleplayer y multiplayer (por cierto si, Half Life tiene multijugador y aún sigue habiendo gente).\n\nJuegazo imprescindible 1000%.","timestamp_created":1566122917,"timestamp_updated":1566122917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.622760772705078125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54677547","author":{"steamid":"76561198340240050","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":163,"last_played":1591644338},"language":"turkish","review":"Güzel Oyun","timestamp_created":1566117121,"timestamp_updated":1566117121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54672271","author":{"steamid":"76561198042542479","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":918,"last_played":1635217403},"language":"english","review":"I'm not gonna lie, this is me when I'm playing Half-Life","timestamp_created":1566083942,"timestamp_updated":1566083942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54660314","author":{"steamid":"76561198297986253","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1924,"last_played":1581700898},"language":"finnish","review":"No life","timestamp_created":1566032063,"timestamp_updated":1566032063,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54658936","author":{"steamid":"76561198327814838","num_games_owned":247,"num_reviews":162,"playtime_forever":990,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":403,"last_played":1578735814},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшее во что я играл","timestamp_created":1566024735,"timestamp_updated":1566024735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54655727","author":{"steamid":"76561198383234752","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":20,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1569896243},"language":"schinese","review":"没得玩 没的玩 没的玩","timestamp_created":1566004666,"timestamp_updated":1566004666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54654304","author":{"steamid":"76561198796699685","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1066,"last_played":1595276130},"language":"english","review":"almost as good as half-life","timestamp_created":1565995984,"timestamp_updated":1565995984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54652815","author":{"steamid":"76561197990526398","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":80,"last_played":1622385751},"language":"german","review":"Damn when i remember the time when i get my first computer and the first game was Half-Life....insane...\nAlso oppesing Force and Blue Shift are amazing.\n\nStill got the big box with HL1, OF, BS and CS....good old days.","timestamp_created":1565988125,"timestamp_updated":1565988125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483870983123779297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54652484","author":{"steamid":"76561198066993196","num_games_owned":678,"num_reviews":276,"playtime_forever":1849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1849,"last_played":1565986216},"language":"hungarian","review":"Nem rossz, nem erős, de szórakoztató.

The two Half-Life games are often hailed as masterpieces of the FPS genre and the elusive third game remains one of the most hotly anticipated games. Upon release, the original Half-Life may have seemed revolutionary with regards to some aspects but it has aged terribly and flaws that may have been overlooked at the time are now glaringly obvious.\n\nYou play as Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist at the Black Mesa complex. Something goes terribly wrong and you find yourself trying to escape the facility while battling hordes of alien creatures.\n\nThe game tries to be very cinematic with many heavily scripted sequences including the opening ride through the facility. However, these heavily scripted scenes often mean you are standing around aimlessly waiting for the next area to be accessible.\n\nHalf-Life tries to mix things up by being more than just a regular shooter by throwing in some platforming and physics puzzles. However, all this does is damage the pace of the game. As soon as the action gets some rhythm to it, the game grinds to halt as you have to fumble your way across a platforming sequence.\n\nThe graphics may have been acceptable at the time but look absolutely awful by today's standards. In fact, I actually cannot play this game for more than fifteen minutes or so at a time without feeling sick. Something about the graphics style of some early 3D games as well as early FPS titles including Duke Nukem 3D and Doom just always seems to give me a headache. Although, I will not hold that against the game, I'm just giving you some context to explain my experience with Half-Life.\n\nI did not get very far because I got frustrated with the bad pacing and irritating puzzles and platforming (as well as the graphics giving me a headache). The shooting is also pretty disappointing.\n\nThe main reason I bought the game was to have access to mods. I was mostly interested in the Dragon Ball Z-themed Earth Special Forces, which was okay but somewhat clunky. I have tried some other mods such as Gunman Chronicles and Heart Of Evil: Napalm Edition but was not overly impressed. Some mods for Half-Life including Ricochet and Counter Strike 1.6 can be purchased on Steam independent of Half-Life.\n\nI can see how Half-Life was a big deal when it was released all the way back in 1998. It offered a more complex and cinematic experience than the shooters that came before it such as Wolfenstein 3D, Duke Nukem 3D and Doom. It also must have been a significant stepping stone on the way to later games such as Halo and BioShock.\n\nHalf-Life remains a significant part of gaming history because of the engine, the modding community and the fantastic success of Valve. However, as a game itself, I just did not find it remotely fun to play Half-Life.\n\nMaybe it's worth getting for the mods when the game is on sale but otherwise, I really cannot recommend this game. It's a shame because I like some of Valve's other games including CS:GO and the Left 4 Dead series.\n\nNormally, I give games scores but I do not think that I played enough and the personal issue I had with the graphics mean that I probably would be unable to give a fair assessment.","timestamp_created":1565792227,"timestamp_updated":1625334023,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.338263899087905884","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54612420","author":{"steamid":"76561198869112705","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":320,"last_played":1630757638},"language":"russian","review":"Монтировка стала моим любимым оружием)","timestamp_created":1565782833,"timestamp_updated":1565782833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57537156343460083","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54610886","author":{"steamid":"76561198279070736","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2952,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2024,"last_played":1576683908},"language":"italian","review":"A 3/4 del gioco si blocca.

Huge variety of weaponry, fun and engaging gameplay, a story that is both interesting and doesn't get in the way of the action, and amazing pacing. It's amazing and the graphics have honestly not held this game back from being a lot of fun. The only gripes I have are pretty minor. The whole beginning is reaaallllllllyyyyyyyyy slow and you could honestly step back from the game, go get a coffee from the Starbucks across the street, catch up with a friend, and when you come back, the train section is only halfway through. I will say though that it makes up for it by being amazing and not slowing down the moment it's over. It's also a nice touch to see how Black Mesa functions before aliens start coming and sucking peoples heads. Speaking of aliens, the Xen level is really awe-inspiring but is, in my opinion, the weakest part of the game. I could barely get through it without a guide and every time the game makes me do some platforming, it makes me want to yell Gordon Freeman's mute ass off. The final boss is also meh. Other than that, the rest of the game is glorious. So play it! Experience a story of conspiracy, fight against aliens, military, black-op ninjas, and understand how first-person shooters were influenced by this seminal work. \n\nTL;DR:\nYou could kill literally anyone you wanted in this game, even the scientists and guards giving you story stuff.

Half Life é um jogo de fps em que você controla Gordon Freeman, um cientista que resolve colocar a mão na massa na ativação de um dispositivo em um experimento que acaba dando errado, trazendo diversos alienígenas para o laboratório. Não tendo outra saída, ele deve acabar com os imimigos que tentam matá-lo, sejam aliens ou humanos que tentam fazer uma queima de arquivo para que ninguém saiba do experimento. Mesmo pra quem é ruim em fps, como eu, o jogo ajuda bastante com o lock-in da mira, o que deixa as coisas menos complicadas. Hordas e hordas vêm, e você deve ser ágil o suficiente para desviar dos ataques e manter a defensiva ao mesmo tempo, principalmente nas fases finais.
