Sure, the graphics may be questionable to some by todays standards, but for it's time they were groundbreaking. A vast selection of weapons, areas, an amazing storyline and puzzles make this one really brilliant single-player experience. The Hazard course by extension is also the most well implemented tutorial I've seen in a game.\n\nThis is a game that I could play for many more years to come and still enjoy it by setting myself challenges. The only thing that would improve upon Half-Life (and Opposing Force, even Blue Shift) would be to create a list of acheivements just so there is some extra singleplayer playability, but other than that, there is nothing out there in the FPS world that even comes close to matching Half-Life, and I doubt that there ever will be. \n\nValve are amazing story tellers, this is evident in essentially every title that they release with the exception of one or two more silly games and I (like everybody else) eagerly await the upcoming Half-Life titles. It is torture to make somebody wait so long for something so promising. \n\nTo cut a review short, this game is amazing and it always will be. It is well worth the full retail price and so are it's expansions (even though Blue Shift is extremely short), so pick it up and you won't regret it.

yet me just say, I like it. The original Half-Life is still good to this day, in my opinion. It probably has to do with me loving the hell out of retro games.\n\nPros: -The gameplay is good. I do have some problems with it, but that will be in the Cons section.\n-Good story. While there is no major characters other than you, Gordon Freeman, I do still like to look at the NPCs. Some remind me of characters for Half-Life 2. The first guard I met said \"Meet me later, I'll buy you a beer.\" I instantly thought of Barney. Sadly, it was not Barney, as he was in a different part of Black Mesa (Barney's \"About that beer I owed ya.\" line from HL2 is a reference to that exact line the guards say to Freeman). The story isn't too obvious, but trust me, when I first found out the military was killing EVERYONE, it was a shock.\n-I f**king loved the opening. Not the train ride, that was poop, the whole being with your coworkers stuff. I also liked it in Blue Shift.\n\nCons:-Graphics do not hold up today. Compared to the amazing looks of Half-Life 2 (and new games like Titanfall) it's graphics suck. It looks like original Playstation. Yes, I know it came out in 1998.\n-Gameplay is weird! You run WAY too fast. The only way to slow your ass down is to press Shift to walk or crouch down. It is really hard to walk on narrow paths. Jumping onto ladders is weird too. If you keep pressing SPACE you don't grab on. That can be a problem.\n-Headcrabs are too F**KING STRONG! It takes 2 pistol shots to kill them. That's not bad. Then it takes like 4 or 5 hits with the crowbar to kill them. Um.. isn't the crowbar a headcrab's weakness? The tiny knife from Opposing Force insa-kills them! WTF?!\n-You get lost too much, too fast. I found myself revisting corridor after corridor. Everything looks the same!\n-Finnally, it gets too hard, way too damn fast! I just got to the part where you first meet the soldiers. I'm on medium difficulty and I barely survived the horror section of the game. I am on 30 or so health, no armor, and I meet a soldier. I die. I respawn right in front of him. I kill him, then I get healed by a scientist. I go to next room. I get killed by 3 soldiers. TOO HARD, TOO FAST!\n\nOverall, I reccomend getting the HAlf-Life Anthology. 4 games for $15. It is still fun, but unless you want a challenge, play on Easy.","timestamp_created":1402386841,"timestamp_updated":1402386841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10413391","author":{"steamid":"76561198088694247","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":8110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3062,"last_played":1627272852},"language":"english","review":"How do I review a game like Half Life?

The gameplay is absolutely incredible, the story is interesting, and the controls are tighter then the skinny jeans I tried to wear in 7th grade. Exciting and thrilling despite the graphical limitations. It's almost difficult to believe this was made in 1998, well if the character models didn't look like they had been modeled out of clay and then dropped multiple times. I especially love the health and suit mechanics. It may be old, but it gives you a truly epic feel. Boss fights though scarce are some of my favorites. Thrilling, epic, awesome are all words that could be used to describe this game. I thought I had seen the real experience with the Black Mesa Half-Life 2 Mod, but I was mistaken. There are some differences, and the mod doesn't have the same atmosphere as the original. The original game is easier anyway and I respect that this game is one of the best out there and highly recommend that you play it if you get a chance. It works on even low-rate computers like mine and is way underpriced if you ask me. The music is great, and the level design is some of the best that I have ever seen. Among my few minor complaints are that the friendly NPCs are terrible at following, limited voice actor variety, crouch jumping is annoying, and what you need to do is sometimes nearly impossible to figure out without lots of trial and error.

Moje vzpomínky na ni, byly zahaleny v závoji nostalgie, a já měl obavy z jeho rozhrnutí. Unesu pohled na její hranaté tvary? Co když mi bude připadat hloupá a nudná? Nebudu mít chuť naše setkání po několika minutách ukončit, a se slzou v oku si připustit, že mě paměť milosrdně klamala? Ale přesto jsem sebral odvahu a hru spustil.\n\nPo chvilce nervózního přešlapování v prázdném vagónu, zahlédnu Barneyho jak buší na dveře. S úsměvem na tváři mu mávám na pozdrav, ale nevidí mě. Nemám mu to za zlé, má svých starostí dost a dnes ho také čeká těžký den. O něco později se míjíme s panem G-Manem. Uctivě se ukloním, ale pan G-Man mě ignoruje a jen si utáhne kravatu a opráší oblek, prostě profesionál. Po příjezdu na pracoviště, už mají události rychlý spád. V duchu se omlouvám svým kolegům za nepříjemnosti které jim způsobím, ale co se má stát, stane se... V té době už mě hra natolik pohltila, že jsem na svoje počáteční obavy úplně zapomněl. A ve chvíli, kdy jsem v dlani opět sevřel páčidlo, už nebylo pochyb – tahle hra je pořád skvělá.\n\nPokud jste tuto hru zatím nehráli, pak z předchozích řádků asi moc moudří nejste. Pojďme si tedy říct, na co se můžete těšit. Hrajete za vědce jménem Gordon Freeman, který přežil katastrofální následky nepovedeného experimentu. Z vašeho pokusu o únik z výzkumného komplexu Black Mesa se ovšem brzy stane boj o holý život.\n\nHru lze označit jako sci-fi střílečku ze staré školy, která vyšla v roce 1998. Automatické léčení a systém krytí, tady proto nenajdete. V boji budete moci využívat různé typy zbraní, ať už klasické, jako je pistole nebo brokovnice, tak i méně obvyklé. Některé z nich jsou velice nápadité a užijete si s nimi spoustu zábavy, nebudu vám ale kazit překvapení.\n\nVelice rozmanití jsou také nepřátelé, kteří vám budou stát v cestě. Snad neprozradím příliš mnoho, když řeknu že kromě lidských protivníků, si na vás budou brousit zuby také mimozemští tvorové. Lidé jsou navíc v boji velice obratní a často mě překvapilo, jak chytře se přemisťují a pohotově reagují na moje jednání. Dovolím si tvrdit, že vývojáři z Valve, v tomto směru předběhli svojí dobu o několik let.\n\nJedinou věcí, která mi kazila zážitek ze hry, jsou přeskakovací pasáže. Přiznám se, že jsem při opakovaných pádech do hlubin, občas zle nadával. Možná jsem ale jenom nešikovný, a ostatní hráči, tyhle úseky překonávají s ladností kamzíka.\n\nJestli si tedy chcete zahrát střílečku, která se nesmazatelně zapsala do herní historie, pak neváhejte. Hraje se pořád skvěle.\n\n[i][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6861342/]Další recenze na mé kurátorské stránce[/url][/i]","timestamp_created":1402076873,"timestamp_updated":1443109351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508680522441864014","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10370372","author":{"steamid":"76561198043108500","num_games_owned":880,"num_reviews":588,"playtime_forever":82,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":58,"last_played":1502036008},"language":"english","review":"The multiplayer may not be as good as counter-strike, but it makes up with ALOT of mods if you find some in the website.

Your decision to have your Half-Life euthanatized is a serious one and seldom easy to make.\n\nHow will I know when?\n\nIf Half-Life can no longer do with you and your family the things he or she once enjoyed, if your Half-Life cannot respond to you in the usual ways, or if there is more pain than pleasure in his or her life, you may need to consider euthanasia. Likewise, if Half-Life is terminally ill or critically injured, or if the financial or emotional cost of treatment is beyond your means, euthanasia may be a valid option.\nYour veterinarian understands attachment to Half-Life, and can examine and evaluate your Half-Lifes condition, estimate your Half-Lifes chances for recovery, and discuss potential disabilities and long-term problems. He or she can explain the medical options and possible outcomes. Because your veterinarian cannot make the euthanasia decision for you, it is important that you fully understand your Half-Lifes condition. If there is any part of the diagnosis or the implications for your Half-Lifes future that you don't understand, ask to have it explained again. Rarely will the situation require an immediate decision. Usually, you will have time to review the facts before making your decision.\n\nAs you make your decision, you may wish to discuss the care of the remains of your Half-Lifes body with your family and veterinarian. You have several options, and your veterinarian can provide information about burial, cremation, or other alternatives.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nYour relationship with your Half-Life is special, and you are responsible for its care and welfare. Eventually, many owners are faced with making life or death decisions for their Half-Lifes. Such a decision may become necessary for the welfare of the game and for you and your family.\nA decision concerning euthanasia may be one of the most difficult decisions you will ever make regarding your Half-Life. Your decision is a personal one, but it need not be a solitary one. Your veterinarian and your family and friends can assist and support you. Consider not only what is best for your Half-Life, but also what is best for you and your family. Quality of life is important for Half-Lifes and people alike.\n\nWhat if the game is healthy?\n\nEuthanasia might be necessary if a Half-Life has become vicious, dangerous, or unmanageable. However, some undesirable and abnormal behavior can be changed. Economic, emotional, and space limitations or changes in lifestyle also may force an owner to consider euthanasia of a game, but it is better to find another solution or an alternative home for these Half-Lifes. Euthanasia should be considered only when another alternative is not available.\nHow do I tell my family?\n\nFamily members usually are already aware of a Half-Lifes problems. However, you should review with them the information you have received from your veterinarian. Long-term medical care can be a burden that you and your family may be unable to bear emotionally or financially, and this should be discussed openly and honestly. Encourage family members to express their thoughts and feelings.
