O jogo que, recebeu mais de 50 premiações ou indicações de melhor jogo do ano e outros. E isso, na epoca. Obvio que nos dias de hoje, jogar ele vai ser totalmente diferente. Mas eu digo uma coisa, a imersão, a historia e os plots ao longo do jogo te prendem muito. Joguei por 14 horas, e por mais que, me perdi, morri milhares de vezes, não tive vontade nenhuma de dropar o jogo. A curiosidade que ele gera, pra vc saber mais das coisas que estão acontecendo é impressionante.\n\nO jogo é antigo, possui suas limitações. Mas kisso nao impede ninguem de jogar.

Прекрасний сторі-тейл тематики: наукової фантастики та утопії, стилестично грамотно побудована розповідь не дасть нудьгувати майже всім гравцям, яким подобаються такі тематики.\n\n Графіка порівнюючи із сучасними іграми звичайно не дуже, хоча головний мінус за маленький доступний дозвіл.\n\n Саундтрек дуже бадьорий і ставить темп гри.  Музичний бум у стилі наукової фантастики наслідує вас майже весь сюжет і як показують інші огляди: гравцям дуже подобаються такі \"доріжки\".\n\n Геймплей, крім чудовий і цікавий сюжет, дуже прямолінійний: від точки А в точку Б, хоча і розбавлений музикою і цікавим сутичками з мобами.\n\n Візуальне оформлення відтворене дуже добре!

Як типовий грофоман, я не розумів суті таких сюжетних ігор, адже в них було неможливо грати.  Але зараз я воістину всім раджу пройти цю гру.  Вона перезапускає ваш мозок, через що Ви зможете полюбити інші сторі-тейл гри.  Не дарма Half-Life називають легендарною грою, адже таємниці таких проектів таяться у сюжетних дрібницях та таємницях, а не у гравіці та геймплей.\n\n PS: Гра не коштує свої 169 гривень, краще купити її за знижкою.","timestamp_created":1655391329,"timestamp_updated":1659688161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.630898952484130859","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117072447","author":{"steamid":"76561199110120551","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":32,"playtime_at_review":3390,"last_played":1660322998},"language":"turkish","review":"mükemmel","timestamp_created":1655386721,"timestamp_updated":1655386721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117070471","author":{"steamid":"76561198164023936","num_games_owned":350,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":705,"last_played":1655375979},"language":"english","review":"I beat it, is fun","timestamp_created":1655383771,"timestamp_updated":1655383771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117069773","author":{"steamid":"76561198856914579","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":147,"playtime_last_two_weeks":110,"playtime_at_review":37,"last_played":1660564972},"language":"polish","review":"gra jak gra ale to jest najlepsze dzieło sztuki mojego pierwszego życia","timestamp_created":1655382701,"timestamp_updated":1655394213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117069724","author":{"steamid":"76561199100662183","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164,"last_played":1655467378},"language":"english","review":"Arguably one of the best games ever made.
