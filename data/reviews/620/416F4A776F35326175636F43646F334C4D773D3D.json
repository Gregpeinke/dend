That being said, Portal 2 is easily in the top 5 games I have ever played. Graphics are good, the story is as creative as they come, and the gameplay is refined and solid. But it's the humor they worked into the game that makes it worth playing over and over again. If you don't have this game GET IT. You don't need to play the original Portal to enjoy it. But I would reccomend it just for plot information. (Btw Portal 1 is in my top 20 as well). This one really is a no brainer so just buy it allready!

Not as complete as a package. And much more expensive. Antichamber, Q.U.B.E., Mind, Stanley Parable, etc. are all good, but at least a step below these two. So just stop reading these reviews, they will all (mostly) say the same thing. If you won't like this game, you might as well uninstall Steam and go fishing or, I don't know, to the movies, coz gaming is quite probably not for you.","timestamp_created":1419259197,"timestamp_updated":1419259197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13523314","author":{"steamid":"76561198063138588","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1320,"last_played":1452104936},"language":"english","review":"one of these best games iv ever played and an amazing storyline","timestamp_created":1419259173,"timestamp_updated":1419259173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13523249","author":{"steamid":"76561198012383533","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5610,"last_played":1605362118},"language":"dutch","review":"Een van de beste games ooit gemaakt.","timestamp_created":1419258977,"timestamp_updated":1419258977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13523206","author":{"steamid":"76561198101438610","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2165,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1332,"last_played":1619466561},"language":"english","review":"This is my favorite game,\nthe graphics are awesome and I have nothing bad to say about it at all.\n","timestamp_created":1419258865,"timestamp_updated":1419258865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13523162","author":{"steamid":"76561198004146353","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":585,"last_played":1562713534},"language":"english","review":"Best history-game ever.","timestamp_created":1419258700,"timestamp_updated":1419258700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13523158","author":{"steamid":"76561198048613132","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1280,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":802,"last_played":1486318226},"language":"english","review":"My favourite game of 2011.\nPortal 2 is Portal 1 with some things added, more test chambers and mechanics!\nBest part is Co-op and comunity chambers.\nOnly thing that could be anoying is 1 part of main camping which is boring, but it isn't long.\n11/10 would buy again, thanks Gaben.","timestamp_created":1419258686,"timestamp_updated":1419258686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo52aucoCdo3LMw=="}
