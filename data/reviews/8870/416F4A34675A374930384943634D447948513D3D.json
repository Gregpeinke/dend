Well, it doesn't call it magic, but it's the same idea. You're a private investigator who can't investigate for dick and gets pulled along by the undertow of fate and personalities in the universe. And that's just fine. You can switch between two kinetic weapons out of quite a few in the game ranging from pistols to RPGs. Some are better than others, and at one point the overvariety of similar weapons gets a bit overbearing. You also have the power of 'vigors' (spells). I find these similar to the weapons in that there are some stand-outs that I love using but many fall into the \"me-too\" category, particularly those that are only obtained late in the game. The very first vigor, possession, is by far the most useful and fun in general combat situations. There is also a grusome (if fun) melee attack that tends to become obsolete early due to the prevelence of guns unless you find the right gear to improve it when more difficult enemies appear.\n\nThe most similar aspect to the HL2 series is your companion, Elizabeth, who assists you for much of the game. Unlike Alyx in the aformentioned series, Elizabeth doesn't engage in (and outshine you at) combat. Instead she will throw items to the player and effectively act as an engineer by pulling turrents and other defensive items out of her tear. Oh, tears... those are \"rips in dimensional time and space, revealing an alternate universe, which does not exist in the current world.\" Don't worry, it makes sense in context. While Elizabeth's role could be otherwise filled, she is useful in combat and does not require guarding, a good choice by the devs. \n\nShe's a compelling character that is the real star of the story, not the player controlled 'Booker.\" And the story is quite good, though it's confusing at times and feels like it has a few aborted endings. Most of the time it's compelling, though, and makes you want to keep playing to find out what's going on through the time loops and dimensional warps that occur. The ending is a powerful gut punch, and not wishy-washy at all. There are some choices in the game, but none matter. Or perhaps they all matter, but none can alter the ending- further explanation would be spoilerish and get into the philosophy of determinism. There are plot holes, as with any story that involves some sort of time/space warp, but it's a good story with a puncuated ending that I needed to sit back and recover from afterwards.  Then I quickly restarted so I could get back to the more carefree portions of the game and also start to see the events from the hindsight of knowing how everything plays out. There's a lot of backstory lying unobtrusively around for those who want to look for it in a playthrough.\n\nCons include an awful save system (this is 2015, why can't we figure this out?) and a couple of portions of the game that are too repetitive with no payoff.\n\nI'd say the game is a steal at sale prices under $30.\n\nI didn't play the first bioshock but I think it might be a good time to pick it up...","timestamp_created":1385783905,"timestamp_updated":1427326020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562485933303833008","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7836790","author":{"steamid":"76561198000358797","num_games_owned":387,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":4628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4192,"last_played":1535238259},"language":"english","review":"\"Perfection is not the absence of faults.  It's being able to look past them.\"  Truer words were never spoken in regards to this game.  There are some niggling details that hold this game back from perfection.  Most notably, almost all the gear sucks and is ridiculously underpowered.  There are only 3 or 4 really good pieces, out of set of more than 20.  However, the controls are very responsive, and clearly feel that it was built from the ground up for PC, unlike some other abominations I could name.  (I'm looking at you, Dark Souls).  The graphics, sound, and music are all astonishing, and serve to truly immerse you in the experience.  The game is also VERY well optimized.  I have a 3 year old PC, and I can run on highest settings with very short loading screens and virtually no lag.  Booker and Elizabeth are probably the greatest tag team ever seen.  Elizabeth is a rarity for companions because she is so goddamn useful.  Almost dead?  She tosses you a health pack.  Running out of ammo?  No problem, here you go.  Full stop, best goddamn FPS of the 21st Century.  1999 mode will make you sweat and get your heart rate pounding.
