The original Half Life was seared into my memory as an early teen playing on my ancient Windows 98 PC. It was atmospheric, immersive, compelling, intense, scary, tonnes of fun to play and it redefined the possibilities of what games could do, especially in regards to story telling and world building.\n\nYears later I'd come to feel pretty much the same way about Half Life 2, which took things to a whole new level by creating a virtual playground of advanced physics simulations that allowed you to interact with the world in a way that no other game had ever achieved before. And once again the interactive storytelling and world building drew me in all over again, creating a compelling new world to explore with a cast of wonderfully expressive and sympathetic characters.\n\nAll of the above translates into the two episodic entries, especially Episode 2, which is often sited as being the crown jewel of this franchise, and while I still have a soft spot for the original Half Life and Half Life 2, there's no denying that Episode 2 refines and distils everything great about Half Life in a short and sweet package that perhaps has the most compelling narrative of the franchise, and some of the most tense and elaborate set pieces, without ever breaking player immersion and surrounding you with those wonderful characters. Even if the graphics have shown some age, the art direction and level design stand strong to this day. Half Life Episode 2 is still a fantastic experience, a pleasure to return to after all these years. There still aren't too many games like it even now.\n\nThanks to Half Life Alyx for bringing me back to this franchise after I'd almost lost hope!","timestamp_created":1583795072,"timestamp_updated":1583795072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64782043","author":{"steamid":"76561198012203940","num_games_owned":652,"num_reviews":424,"playtime_forever":332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":332,"last_played":1583789070},"language":"italian","review":"Bellissimo mini episodio della saga di HL, ricchissimo per varietà di gameplay (si passa da momenti tower defence ad altri simil oper world nel giro di poche ore), discreto graficamente e con una trama coinvolgente e ben narrata.

last installment in the Half Life series for 13 years. This is the one that ends on a major cliffhanger, probably never to be resolved. The one that started the memes of Valve not being able to count to 3, of Half Life 3 being made and mysteriously scrapped. Despite all that, this expansion is still the Half Life goodness you expect. This time around Gordon has to navigate alien infested caverns, abandoned mining shafts, and gorgeous wilderness on his never ending quest to kick the Combine's ass and save humanity. There were some slight changes to things that were much appreciated, like the flashlight not being tied to the HEV suits AUX power and striders being kept to a minimum and much easier to kill now. Even though the unresolved cliffhanger is an insanely annoying problem, I still recommend this as highly as I can. Maybe someday we'll get a resolution to the stories of Gordon, Alyx, and most importantly Dog, but for now I'm just happy that Valve is at least releasing more content in this universe with Half Life: Alyx.

Also of note is that a lot of the experiences and situations feel more new rather than \"more of the same\". But. I'd honestly have preferred more of the same. There's just some sequences that aren't super fun with the obvious example being the whole sticky-bomb-strider-fight thing. But hey, I sent a gnome to space this time around. So that's something! Episode Two is still obviously a must play and fun most of the time. And the plot and story really starts to grow here too. Which is both good and bad to me. Good that it is a good story, bad in that I preferred the ambiguity and perceived freedom of Half-Life 1. But we already dove in the deep end of plot with the base game of Half-Life 2, so it was nice to see it build up to a story with depth by the end of Episode Two.\n\nIt is definitely a beautiful swan, but also the ugly duckling of the bunch in some ways.","timestamp_created":1583722594,"timestamp_updated":1583729941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536442935466766357","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64730538","author":{"steamid":"76561198215362936","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":421,"last_played":1583702367},"language":"english","review":"I love the part where you ride a helicopter!","timestamp_created":1583702435,"timestamp_updated":1606913957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64726554","author":{"steamid":"76561198088412334","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1050,"last_played":1545244485},"language":"english","review":"I prefer getting it if you don't want missing textures for Garry's mod.

Será que eles fizeram jus a franquia? Como eles se saíram expandindo esse mundo? Vale a pena jogá-lo, mesmo sem garantia de uma continuação depois de tanto tempo? É o que vamos ver.\n\nHalf-Life 2: Episode Two continua de onde o primeiro episódio parou, cabe a você fugir da destruição da Cidade 17 enquanto lida com o que resta dos Combine, impedindo seu progresso. É aqui que a história se torna mais proeminente, resultando em momentos ainda mais icônicos que o primeiro episódio.\n\nAgora se o game design do Episódio 1 foi ótimo, o do Episódio 2 é ainda melhor. Puzzles de física incríveis, situações empolgantes em combate e um grandioso aproveitamento da engine. Half-Life 2: Episode Two leva os princípios de design de HL2 ao limite.\n\nPode-se dizer que, devido ao engrandecimento narrativo, Half-Life 2: Episode Two detém o jogador com maior frequência que seu antecessor,  mas esse episódio propulsiona a gameplay para cantos criativos e satisfatórios com sua história. Tudo se complementa com perfeição e por mais que seu cliffhanger doa, a jornada até então continua valendo a pena.\n\nEntão sim, Half-Life 2: Episode Two é um jogão, elevando o nome de peso da franquia além das expectativas. Se você não jogou Half-Life ainda, dê uma chance.
