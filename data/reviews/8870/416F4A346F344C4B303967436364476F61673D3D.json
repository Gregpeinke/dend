A must-play for fans of the FPS genre alongside Half-Life and DOOM. The lovecraftian aesthetic and design for the monsters and levels is very unique and creates a unique, almost horror-like atmosphere that blends very well with the frenetic, high-octane shooting. \n\nFor the Steam version of this game specifically, I would say buy on sale (it usually goes for a buck). The reason for this is that you're buying an outdated version of GLBioshock which has a lot of notable issues, particularly the inability to increase resolution past 1920x1080 and the inability to adjust FOV, which can be frustrating since you'll have to tinker with it for a while just to get it to run outside of a blurry miniscule window.\n\nDefinitely buy it for the data files and ID1 folder so you can bring it into a more modern Bioshock engine and you'll have a blast!","timestamp_created":1480309754,"timestamp_updated":1512857544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27916478","author":{"steamid":"76561198074195351","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1423233765},"language":"russian","review":"лучшее во что я играл.","timestamp_created":1480308758,"timestamp_updated":1480308758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27916344","author":{"steamid":"76561197976548685","num_games_owned":1438,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1649,"last_played":1399849879},"language":"english","review":"The gameplay is generic, but the story line is one of the best in an FPS I have ever seen.","timestamp_created":1480308581,"timestamp_updated":1480308581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27915767","author":{"steamid":"76561198096774519","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":793,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":702,"last_played":1465137111},"language":"english","review":"When you are hesitate to buy this game, just buy it.","timestamp_created":1480307932,"timestamp_updated":1480307932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27915224","author":{"steamid":"76561197971513515","num_games_owned":318,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":473,"last_played":1616687033},"language":"english","review":"One of the best story lines with great visuals.

Bioshock infinite keeps gameplay and story in check. The game runs extremely well to the point you can run this game on a toaster. My computer has issues it can’t handle older or newer games it was able to run bioshock at around 40-60 fps. The gameplay is varied between excessive amounts of vigors/plasmids/magic or use of guns of course, I personally use guns more but that’s just a habit of mine.  The action in this game feels like a movie a movie where the antagonist must adapt to his environment and learn how to use everything as a resource and when your bullets are nothing but casings then you set them afire. Unlike bioshock 1 this game is very different it offers a whole different experience a more war feel.\n\nThe story in this game does contain some clichés but enacts them in a new way like for me I can guess a story from a mile away. But bioshock has always managed to make it to where you think you know the story but in reality it always manages to either blow your mind or cause you to love the game even more.  Now this game however blew my mind and gave me a headache literally my head hurts at how big the twist is at the end. I already want to replay it, it’s like a gateway game in every bioshock game you play one you want to try another and each time you play it the game seems to have an entirely different feel. Now the question is what's the bad part of this game, what shale deter me from playing this?\n\nEveryone is entitled to their opinions so it merely depends on what ever tickles your fancy. But it’s hard to see what might deter you from playing this game I have yet to see a bug or glitch I think the only glitch is when looting a body their face twitches but that is a common bug with most face posing in games. The negative reviews are mostly focused on you getting a follower for most of the game and it can’t be seen by npcs. But I rather not have concern of an npc dying or they also mentioned it giving you occasional supplies but again this does not really do a justice as I have died multiple times in this game it’s no walk in the park, it's just that it’s not as survival focused as bioshock 1.\n\nBut again this game is not a repetition from the first game unlike most series. And for that it deserves it’s overwhelmingly positive rating and making it on my all time favorite games list.","timestamp_created":1480303515,"timestamp_updated":1488290421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548872172832489014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27911519","author":{"steamid":"76561198033924980","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":120,"last_played":1471448652},"language":"schinese","review":"安娜？安娜？","timestamp_created":1480303049,"timestamp_updated":1480303049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27910919","author":{"steamid":"76561198314243373","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":799,"last_played":1602898092},"language":"spanish","review":"buen juego xd","timestamp_created":1480302354,"timestamp_updated":1480302354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27910729","author":{"steamid":"76561197988933342","num_games_owned":441,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":267,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":267,"last_played":1469035497},"language":"english","review":"One of the most complex stories I ever listened to, end the ending is just phenomenal!","timestamp_created":1480302145,"timestamp_updated":1480302145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27910582","author":{"steamid":"76561198048906599","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3213,"last_played":1397387266},"language":"russian","review":"Игра шикарна.

The art style in general is just great, and I think that a lot of people will adore it.\n-The story is extremely in-depth and pulls the player in. I found myself searching for all of the recordings just to learn more about this world and the characters in it.\n-Certainly a LOT of twists and turns in the plot, which make it not some cookie-cutter dystopian society sort of game, which was very nice and refreshing.\n-Adorable sidekick character that you will most likely fall in love with by the end of the story.\n-Dynamic combat, with a good mix of gunplay and use of powers. Lot of cool combinations that you can come up with by using certain powers both together and with the environment.\n-Increasing difficulty that keeps the player on their toes so the game doesn't become easy and boring by the end.\n\nCONS:\n-Relatively short story (I beat it in about 10 hours or so, but I was trying to go pretty fast so I could finish it in one night).\n-Some may find the graphics a bit dated (even though it's almost four years old, so of course they would be..)\n-Handymen\n-Very linear story, which didn't bother me that much because it works very well with the game.\n\n\n10/10 would catch assorted items again","timestamp_created":1480281517,"timestamp_updated":1480281517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27886273","author":{"steamid":"76561198059725900","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":836,"last_played":1460926475},"language":"czech","review":"Hra s úžasným zpracováním a soubojovým systémem.

The plot played major role in success of all games of series. Scattered audio loogs, gloomy and spooky athmosphere, evil voice in radio leading you to worse than evil...

Надеюсь, достаточно многое.\nЧто меня порадовало в игре:\n1) Ну перво наперво конечно же сюжет. Не могу его не похвалить. Он достаточно хорошо и качественно продуман, играть не скучно.\n2) Графика. Она имеет хороший и высокий уровень.\n3) Атмосфера летающего города передана донельзя сильно и ярко.\n4) Ну и конечно же, как без неё - Элизабет ;)\n\nЧто меня огорчило в игре:\n1) Пожалуй... Ничего. На мой взгляд здесь всё хорошо. Хотя надобность отдельно устанавливать русификатор озвучки и текстур немного доставило дискомфорт.\n\nЕсли вы хотите купить эту игру - не сомневайтесь, берите.\nМоя оценка: 10 из 10.","timestamp_created":1480274620,"timestamp_updated":1480274620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27872665","author":{"steamid":"76561198071569308","num_games_owned":409,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2168,"last_played":1451479492},"language":"russian","review":"Очень хорошая игра.
