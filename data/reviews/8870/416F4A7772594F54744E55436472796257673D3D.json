Подобные ощущения я испытывал, проходя mafia.

Well you arrive in a utopic, peacefull city. But more you will go further in the game, more you'll see backstage of the teater set, this make this opus darker than the previous ones. Fights for power corrupting the the painting...\nThis episode (at least for 75% of the game) is not as creepy and gore as first two opus (nearly end and DLC are darker)\n\nIf you like post apocaliptic amosphere and steam punk you'll love this game (if you like blade runner, fallout, etc). This is not a horror/trash/bloody game, but there is sometimes gore things (some creatures like handyman, boy of silence and theyr lunatics, splicers, etc are really creepy).\n\nbe carefull spoil:\nthe end make sence, it's a paradox, but yeah, most of the people are used to cute happy end with rainbows, birds and unicorns, so they dislike this game only for this. but here... happy end is impossible, or the whole story is worthless.\n\nthis is a must play trilogy (even if you don't like this kind of game) since it's a legend.\n\nWould you kindly play it? ;)","timestamp_created":1466432950,"timestamp_updated":1466432950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23664994","author":{"steamid":"76561198037957137","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2628,"last_played":1465563493},"language":"german","review":"Die mit Abstand beste Spieleserie die ich jemals spielen durfte.
