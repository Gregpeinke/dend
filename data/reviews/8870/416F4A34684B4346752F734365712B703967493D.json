Then, I decided to finish the game now, and I was blasted of how good this game is.\nI really love this game, because it's all about gameplay, gameplay, and gameplay! especially about the gunplay, it's so satisfying to pop some enemies head with a wide selection of guns. The pacing is so good that you won't get bored from a phase to another. The writing is well-written, and all of the character is well-developed.\nAs a game artist myself, I found some really annoying UI feature. for example, the UI for shops are kinda confusing for me, because they didn't put catalogue for each needs and type of weapons, and also how the icons are kind of blend-in with each other. another thing is, I got really confused of how to differentiate between regular shop and vigors upgrade shop. aren't they the same looking automaton?\nBut, those aren't that big of an issue. The thing is the game is a balance between, awesome gameplay, good writing, and beautiful game art/design!

Columbia adds some verticality to combat but it relies on a constant formula of walk down a hall until you get an area to fight bad guys.  Rinse and repeat.  The new vigors are less interesting than plasmids were and given that the game relies on a run and gun style you’ll never be using their trap capabilities.  You are also limited to two guns at any time and instead of different ammo each gun just has two slightly different versions.\nThe game is also very short.  The main game + both Burial at Sea episodes was just barely longer than the 1st Bioshock and about three hours shorter than the 2nd and its DLC.  If you go back and watch the old trailers you’ll see a lot of material was cut and it shows at times.\nI was also frustrated by the absence of standard quality of life and accessibility features.  You can’t save anywhere, instead the game autosaves when you go to a new area.  It doesn’t even have a time based autosave.  Voxophones don’t have subtitles and you no longer have a map so it can be easy to miss areas when you are exploring. \nI do like the story and Elizabeth’s character arc, but if that’s all you are interested in it’s a better use of your time to watch a Let’s Play.","timestamp_created":1630039556,"timestamp_updated":1630039556,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98302647","author":{"steamid":"76561198105032348","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":619,"last_played":1630039319},"language":"koreana","review":"실행이 안됨ㅋ","timestamp_created":1630039451,"timestamp_updated":1630039451,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98301948","author":{"steamid":"76561198101345609","num_games_owned":404,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":759,"last_played":1608298293},"language":"russian","review":"4/4","timestamp_created":1630038210,"timestamp_updated":1630038210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98293947","author":{"steamid":"76561198121770877","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":2453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1899,"last_played":1641862957},"language":"english","review":"⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡀⢂⡉⠐⠀⢂⡁⠄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠰⠀⡐⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠁⠐⠊⠩⠄⢒⡂⠠⠤⠀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⡠⠂⠠⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠐⠂⠤⡈⠀⠂⢄⡀⠀\n⠀⠀⠐⠀⠀⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣱⡄⠀⠈⣦\n⠀⡀⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⡇⠀⢸⣿\n⠀⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⠇⠀⠸⠋\n⠘⠀⠀⠀⠀⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⠠⠎⠒⠈⠀\n⢀⠀⠀⡀⠄⠢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡀⠠⠄⠐⠀⠁⠀⢄⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠈⢔⣬⣭⣁⠤⠤⠤⠀⠐⠀⠈⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⡧⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠈⠻⢿⣯⣿⢶⡶⣦⣴⣤⣤⣀⢠⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⡀⣴⡛⠁⠀⠀\n⢤⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠉⠛⢿⣷⣿⣿⣿⣷⣿⣯⣭⣿⣿⣻⣟⣯⣽⡿⡟⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠙⠀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠀⠁⠙⠋⠻⠿⠿⠿⡿⠿⠿⠿⠛⠛⡸⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⣀⠀⠀⠈⠐⠠⢂⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣦⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⣿⣿⣶⣤⣀⠀⠀⠀⠁⠐⣂⣤⣤⣤⣄⣠⣔⣀⣤⣤⣤⣔⠁⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣄⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⡀","timestamp_created":1630025065,"timestamp_updated":1630025065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98293902","author":{"steamid":"76561198132733455","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1009,"last_played":1629516004},"language":"latam","review":"de los mejores juegos de la maldit4 historia me c4g0 en diooooooo\nEl final es una maravilla","timestamp_created":1630024984,"timestamp_updated":1630024984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98290864","author":{"steamid":"76561198089047678","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1362,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1362,"last_played":1630019551},"language":"russian","review":"","timestamp_created":1630019702,"timestamp_updated":1630019702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98289169","author":{"steamid":"76561197977088954","num_games_owned":639,"num_reviews":182,"playtime_forever":459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":459,"last_played":1629851776},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego es una maravilla.\nGraficamente es impresionante, el entorno muy detallado.\nLa ambientación atrapante y envolvente.

of my favorite games of all time. Love the graphics / art direction, the story and the characters, the voice dialogue and the music. Just make absolutely sure that you when you finish the game you stick around for the post-credits scene! The ending can be a bit confusing, especially if you missed a few voxophones (i.e. backstory recordings) along the way. The post-credits scene will make things a little more clear. The only thing I was disappointed with was the lack of combat customization and lack of it's impact on the gameplay. You're limited to only being able to hold two different guns, and the cost of upgrading them and your powers is very expensive. By the time you reach the end of the game you'll have only been able to fully upgrade about four of them. You also have four clothing items you can equip, but, all of their effects on combat are pretty lackluster and simple. Overall, none of these things have a big impact on the combat and therefore it feels like no matter what decisions you made they don't matter much. You'll be far more reliant on real-time skills rather than any strategy or planning you came up with prior to combat. This was my experience with the harder difficulties, and may be different from normal or easy difficultly.","timestamp_created":1629785086,"timestamp_updated":1629785086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98132255","author":{"steamid":"76561198295152776","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2090,"last_played":1651728050},"language":"english","review":"The Bioshock Collection should be a part of any discerning gamer's library.  I happened to play Infinite, first, because I wasn't sure if I would like this style of game.  I loved it.  Story rich and excellent game play.

There is a clear shift in terms of tone (e.g. no horror elements), but still delivers a breathtaking city, superpower/firearm hybrid combat, and an incredible story which are Bioshock hallmarks. \n\nPlayer characterization is something new to Infinite. The character that you play as is now voiced and has his own personality. While initially jarring due to the departure from the blank protagonist in previous Bioshock titles, Booker slowly grows on you as he becomes gradually more believable and relatable. The strongest point is Elizabeth, your companion throughout most of the game. She also delivers one of the most mind-boggling and heart-breaking plot twists in any game. \n\nA satisfying conclusion to the Bioshock series.","timestamp_created":1629782209,"timestamp_updated":1629782209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98128901","author":{"steamid":"76561199155135742","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":868,"last_played":1627369289},"language":"latam","review":"Un juego que realmente te coloca en la historia, perfecta conclusion para una saga.","timestamp_created":1629777670,"timestamp_updated":1629777670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98128361","author":{"steamid":"76561198090857672","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":743,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":743,"last_played":1629775824},"language":"german","review":"Hervorragender linearer Shooter mit unerwartetem Ende.","timestamp_created":1629776668,"timestamp_updated":1629776668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98127855","author":{"steamid":"76561198342472510","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":883,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":883,"last_played":1629773820},"language":"spanish","review":"Completamente un Juegazo","timestamp_created":1629775831,"timestamp_updated":1629775831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98126586","author":{"steamid":"76561198208077493","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1602,"last_played":1629782245},"language":"english","review":"i've alwaysed liked bioshock as a series\n","timestamp_created":1629773693,"timestamp_updated":1629773693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hKCFu/sCeq+p9gI="}
