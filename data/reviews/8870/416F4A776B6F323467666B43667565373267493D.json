I truly had chills during this section of the game that occurs about 15 minutes in. Also, when you discover a [spoiler]larger-than-life statue celebrating John Wilkes Booth, [/spoiler] this is a genuinely shocking piece of environmental storytelling which tells you everything you need to know about Columbia and Comstock. \n\nThese moments are golden, however, the experience is overall overshadowed by weak writing and a lack of focus on game-play that is fun and engaging over the whole span of the game. About 6 hours in I was asking myself \"when is this gonna be over. I want to finish this to understand the hype, but I'm not having fun.\"\n\nThere are many elements of this game that feel like partially complete ideas -- like Songbird, the reality tears, and the [spoiler] 'BioShock Multiverse ending'[/spoiler] -- these could all feel like really strong elements if they had been implemented in a way that is more interesting for game-play and narrative, but as it is they are all underdeveloped ideas, and the first two don't change game-play drastically enough to justify how unfocused the final products were.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the story is weak, and each individual area is not very interesting. The areas feel like stages for a shooting game, and while this is absolutely perfect for games like Halo, in a game like BioShock Infinite which tries to do so much narratively, the very gamey structure of the maps feels incongruous and counter to immersion. The level design could have been made to feel more realistic and therefor more immersive. I feel that games like Half Life and BioShock 1 do this well.\n\nI didn't enjoy BioShock Infinite half as much as I hoped I would. I'm sure my opinion is somewhat skewed by the expectations that I had after playing the original which I love, but I also think my criticisms are valid on the whole. Buy if you're sure, maybe watch a play-through on YouTube if you're feeling tentative.\n","timestamp_created":1619580512,"timestamp_updated":1619580512,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91031664","author":{"steamid":"76561197990071165","num_games_owned":369,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":166,"last_played":1619825456},"language":"english","review":"bad, very bad","timestamp_created":1619571752,"timestamp_updated":1619571752,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.400000005960464478","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91029252","author":{"steamid":"76561198932010709","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1577,"last_played":1656387330},"language":"english","review":"AMAZING.","timestamp_created":1619566968,"timestamp_updated":1619566968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91029064","author":{"steamid":"76561198375979937","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":941,"last_played":1619747842},"language":"english","review":"Awesome atmosphere.

Kesinlikle Türkçe yama ile birlikte oynanmalı. Ana oyunu 9-10 saat arasında bitirdim geri kalanı DLC. Öncelikle kesinlikle Burial at the Sea DLC'sini almanız gerekiyor, zira bütün konuları, BioShock'un ilk oyunları ile bunu bağlayan şey o DLC; ana oyun değil. Oyunun hikayesi bence güzel. Bu sefer öbür oyunların aksine distopik bir dünyada değil de, ütopik bir dünyadayız. Bulutların üstündeyiz, bir peygamber çıkmış; herkes ona inanıyor. Herkes huzurlu güzel günler geçiyor. Sonra biz borcumuzu ödemek için buraya geliyoruz, ve olaylar gelişiyor diyebilirm Spoiler vermeden. Öbür oyundaki Eve, Havva olmuş burada Tuz. Onu çok garipsedim. Hatta çeviri hatası olduğunu bile düşündüm lakin, Salt diyor karakter. Silah hissiyati mükemmel diyemem, ama yeterli. Bölüm tasarımı güzel. Oyunda teknik açıdan bir sorun yok. Grafikleri -herşeyi Ultra da oynadım ona göre yorumlayacam. 2013 yılında çıkan bir oyun olduğunu unutmazsak güzel, lakin günümüz için biraz cilalanması şart. Bu oyun ile ilgili tavsiyem, eğer ilk iki BioShock oyununu oynadıysanız, Bunun bütün DLC lerini oynayın kesinlikle. Yok eğer ilk iki oyunu oynamadıysanız eğer, DLC leri oynamasanızda birşey kaybetmezsiniz. Eğer ütopik bir dünyada herşeyin nasıl bir anda sarpa sardığı ile ilgili hikayeleri seviyorsanız, doğru

my issue with Infinite, if it wasn't attached to the Bioshock name it would be a great game. However, as a follow up to the city of Rapture I'm disappointed. (I had to youtube the rest of the game because I just couldn't go on).\n\nStory: Bioshock 1's story of a genius capitalist using his funds and other brilliant scientific minds to create an underwater city to escape government intervention felt sooo much more... je ne sais quoi organic you know? Now Infinite is just \"racism and segregation bad\". Andrew Ryan was a twisted, complicated man with ambition while Fontaine was ruthless and cunning. Where did all that artistic creativity go? \n\nAlso [spoiler] you have to especially careful using time travel and alternate realities. It's not something I like to see in movies or video games because it can get so confusing and complicated, which it did in this game, because of that there are too many plot holes. [/spoiler]\n\nSetting: As a setting, Columbia is a actually quite beautiful so I'll give it that. It doesn't feel as cramped or small as Rapture felt, with plenty of open space and plenty to explore. They've incorporated the era of time quite well too and the visual art design was on point.\n\nGameplay: This is where I was most disappointed. The system of Adam and Eve (which I loved) is gone, instead replaced by \"Salts\" and \"Vigor\" YAWWWWWNNNNN BORING!. You can literally only use like 2 or 3 attacks before you have to replenish your \"Salts\" (can't even say it with a straight face). You can only take 2 weapons with you which is absolutely pathetic. The sky hook thing is pretty boring after 5 seconds and the fact that they don't allow you to use it like spider-man is a let down. \n\nYou can't take health packs with you or syringes to replenish your \"Salts\" . They removed the hacking system which I was extremely mad about, the upgrades didn't feel as reward as the first 2 bioshocks and the sky line thing really wasn't as amazing as critics thought it was \n\nOverall: Is it a good game?
