It has few weapons that you can use and every path you take pretty much goes to the same place. It is a good game for teamwork and cooperation or just trolling your friends until they rage quit. In this game each special zombie can pretty much knock down someone and make it so that the player cant stop the zombie from killing them. In order to escape the special zombies you need a friend to kill the zombie for you. I would rate this game a 7/10 because its pretty good but its not as good as its second version. The zombies in this game look pretty stupid though the characters look pretty good, the enviroment is beautiful and very deatailed as well.","timestamp_created":1447633126,"timestamp_updated":1447633255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19100789","author":{"steamid":"76561198028952764","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":782,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":177,"last_played":1455924132},"language":"czech","review":"DVOJKA JE LEPŠÍ","timestamp_created":1447615203,"timestamp_updated":1447615203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19098712","author":{"steamid":"76561198110810496","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1077,"last_played":1488127805},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito bom!!!!","timestamp_created":1447609041,"timestamp_updated":1447609041,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19090717","author":{"steamid":"76561198142279336","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":120,"last_played":1417104572},"language":"russian","review":"Определенно, игра-откровение. Мультиплеерное. Лучшая кооперативная игра года, а возможно и поколения. \"Turtle Rock\" сотворили настоящее чудо. \n4 игрока, Режиссер (особенный ИИ, который расставляет расположение точек респауна врагов и амуниции на карте согласно текущей геймлейной ситуации), несколько карт, толпы зомби, Особые Зараженные (боссы с определенными умениями), сотни часов геймплея. Все настолько идеально, что обеспечивает потрясающую реиграбельность. Практически каждый раз все происходит пусть немного, но иначе. За напарников, если они конечно твои друзья волнуешься, спасаешь их, прыгаешь в кучу мертвецов чтобы вытащить, на ходу обматываешь раненных последней аптечкой. Все помнят ситуации, когда еле живые игроки практически доползали до красной двери, которую необходимо закрыть, но внезапно появлялся Танк, и чаша весов падала. Ситуация кардинально менялась. В \"Left 4 Dead\" несколько режимов, каждый из которых совершенно спланирован и реализован. Выживание - продержись определенное время. Сражение - победи соперников в образе Зараженных и Выживших, меняя облики в процессе матча. Кампания - доберись до точки эвакуации. \nОсобой заслугой L4D думаю можно назвать реализацию персонажей. Они сделаны отлично, играть интересно за любого, хотя функционально они и не отличимы, созданные образы существенно влияют на восприятие. Играть за Зои или Френсиса это большая разница. В целом, сложно сейчас найти людей, которые хотя бы не слышали о \"Left 4 Dead\", но если вдруг вы являетесь этим человеком, а еще любите кооперативные мультиплеерные игры, то даже не думайте. Лучшего предложения возможно и не существует.","timestamp_created":1447582694,"timestamp_updated":1447582694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19085925","author":{"steamid":"76561198146142259","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":158,"last_played":1459636220},"language":"english","review":"Very fun and addicting game that relies heavily on teamwork to make it to the end.","timestamp_created":1447558624,"timestamp_updated":1447558624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19083078","author":{"steamid":"76561198072638102","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":79,"playtime_forever":941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":377,"last_played":1450055466},"language":"english","review":"No wifi?

You can play with 1-4 real players, with the rest of the slots being filled up with adequate AI.\n\nTL:DR; If you can find some decent people to play with co-op, the other elements of the game won’t matter.\n\nL4D is a first person co-op shooter published by Valve. The cooperative nature of the game makes it somewhat tricky to review as one needs to differentiate between the game itself and the people you’re cooperating with. A good game played with poor players tends to sour the game while a poor game with good players tends to elevate it.\n\nThe game was built on the source engine; the same engine Half-Life 2 uses. There were times playing L4D that it felt like you could have been playing Half-Life and I found that a little distracting.\n\nThe graphics themselves were on par with Half-Life 2; they weren’t pushing any boundaries but nor were they terrible. If anything, the graphics felt a little dated, but were smooth and allowed for relatively quick load times. It’s a trade-off.\nYou’re given a limited array of items / weapons to use in the game. It basically boils down to which playstyle you prefer: Long range sniper, mid-range assault rifle/submachine gun or close up shotgun.  All these weapons use up a limited ammo supply with the option of pistols with unlimited ammo also exists (still needing to reload however).  Also available are support items such as Molotov cocktails, zombie luring pipe bombs, medkits and pain-suppressing pills. Some additional variety in items wouldn’t have hurt, but it doesn’t detract from your experience.  (This is addressed in L4D2)\n\nOn the topic of limited array of things; the enemy types also suffer somewhat from this. At the end of the day however, you’re fighting zombies, so what do you expect? They’re a relatively slow-moving, minor inconvenience, offering limited threat…until they swarm. A music cue heralds the arrival of a swarm, often followed by an amount of swearing by the players, as players steel themselves against a brief onslaught of fast moving, swarming zombies. This threat can be a little more troublesome. \n\nAudio cues precede another kind of enemy; a special infected. These inflected also cause players to pay attention and cry an alert as they often throw a spanner in the works of an otherwise simple turkey shoot. Some of them can be easily dealt with or in one case avoided entirely while others can pose a significant threat, an equivalent to a boss in other game franchises. \n\nLastly, the story. Normally the story would be one of the first items I’d address, but in the case of L4D it’s only a minor part of the game. If story is what you’re chasing, you won’t sate your desires here. It exists, but mostly in an overarching chapter introduction, justifying the setting of the map. In most (all?) cases, it requires the players to get from point A to B, usually with a pre-set, player-triggered  swarm encounter somewhere in the middle and another at the end. The story does allow for some interesting, oft throwaway lines of dialogue by the characters however, that allow some entertainment.\n\nWhile L4D may not be the best game in and of itself, but it’s a good co-op. If you can get some friends together and battle your way though it co-op, you should get a lot of enjoyment from it.","timestamp_created":1447003732,"timestamp_updated":1447003732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.683146893978118896","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18948188","author":{"steamid":"76561198078004820","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":68906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21835,"last_played":1643023997},"language":"russian","review":"A very good game.

I mean the game doesn't even have trading cards and early access titles on steam that are purchasable Alpha-stage games DO. What's that say? \n- Also, no steam workshop.\n- There are a number of exploits in the first game that are left totally unchecked by the default game developers - such as crouch glitching a hunter in versus off of a collision-enabled object such as a moveable car [punchable]. (too many to list here)\n- No competitive mode ever instated in the game: I.E. a rebalancing mode that would work much like the Rotoblin sourcemod plugin - removing tier 2 weaponry or limiting them, as well as items and health items.\n- No SOURCETV or HLTV equivalent!!!\n- Extremely locked-down engine, with SO many commands being set to literally \"DEVONLY\" tags in the source code itself - making them invisible inside the engine without removing the \"DEVONLY\" tags or using Sourcemod.\n- No easy or simple way to remove [u]all[/u] of the elements of the hud visually [u][Ilncluding visual recoil][/u] during demo recording, for good smooths, for stable recording that feels more 'camera-like', as POV demos can be somewhat messy, and a cleaning up is always in order when cfging, and you must write a config to record them smoothly, ((and while this is nice of them as a company to let us use the developer console, this is the best kind of game in that arena, and Valve has always held steadfast to that for their older games)); meant solely to increase the popularity of their games that much more.  :/ Come on its a glorification for a fan to dedicate some of their time on earth to the personal creation of something like that, and when done right they are very entertaining.","timestamp_created":1446947815,"timestamp_updated":1461639498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503236532211303711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18937467","author":{"steamid":"76561198257851088","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":457,"last_played":1452267349},"language":"turkish","review":"süper birşey tavsiye ederim verdiğiniz paraya değer","timestamp_created":1446925259,"timestamp_updated":1446925259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18931632","author":{"steamid":"76561198233849256","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1239,"last_played":1447453034},"language":"spanish","review":"Le falta una buena historia, un buen guionista, pero es ultra mega cooperativo, eso me encanto <3, todos depeden de todos","timestamp_created":1446908128,"timestamp_updated":1446908128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18931370","author":{"steamid":"76561198073011673","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4846,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4846,"last_played":1393850557},"language":"russian","review":"Как же я кончал с трейлера к \"Жертва\" и щас кончаю,спасибо!","timestamp_created":1446907327,"timestamp_updated":1446907327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18927244","author":{"steamid":"76561198166080088","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1452782739},"language":"brazilian","review":"8/10 Um dos melhores FPS que ja vi,\nmas compre o 2,ele tem tudo que o 1 e muito +++.","timestamp_created":1446893296,"timestamp_updated":1446893296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514018714427947998","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18926339","author":{"steamid":"76561198095954373","num_games_owned":905,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":356,"last_played":1493730159},"language":"russian","review":"Уильям Овербек, Френсис, Зой, Луис vs \n                                              Толстяк, Охотник, Курильщик, Танк, Ведьма\n                                                                                        Что же будет?\n                                                           10 ОТКУДА ТУТ ТАНК?
