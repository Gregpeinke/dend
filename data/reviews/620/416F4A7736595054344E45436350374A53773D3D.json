If you don't know what portal 2 is, and the steam videos haven't given you enough insight, here's what it is. You know those fun first person puzzle solving games. Yeah, the ones that don't copy other ones and have its own unique mechanic that stands out. Portals is the best. Here's how it works. You shoot a portal on the ground, you shoot a portal on the roof, you fall into the one on the ground and come out of the one on the roof (portals aren't placed just on the floor and roof). This is used SO RIDUCULOUSLY WELL throught THE ENTITRE GAME. Even if the graphics aren't up there with modern games, who gives a darn with this gameplay. And guess what, this is where it gets insane. THEY ADDED A STINKING LEVEL CREATOR. So you know what that means. Yes, INFINITE LEVELS. Also, when a new game comes out and it gets smothered in 10/10, best game ever, astonashing. But everyone knows it doesn't deserve those, because it just looks fancy *cough the order 1886*. Portal is like the opposite of *cough the order 1886*, it doesn't look super insanely well (still, looks good enough to be a playable game) but it actually has hard puzzles, interesting mechanics, a story, fun co op, infinite levels, and a campaign that took me months to beat.

In exchange for Candy Crush's brilliant and vibrant color, the laboratories of Aperture Science are a lugubrious, drab greyish white. The charm that King's mobile title exudes at every corner is lacking in Valve's poor imitation. The illustrious guide, Mr. Toffee, whose physiognomy personifies joy is discarded in exchange for a heartless, inhuman machine. The delightful player character, Tiffi, is replaced by a voiceless, utterly uninteresting test subject. With no character development whatsoever, Portal 2 fails to make the player become invested in the outcome of the characters, one of the main reasons Candy Crush was so well received. The game mechanics of Portal 2 have been watered down in order to appeal to toddlers. The once mentally intensive act of matching varieties of candy has been replaced with generating portals to the end of the levels. No skill is required as one may just create a portal at any moment to the end of the game. Overall Valve's attempt to cash in on the success of puzzle games lacks all that made Candy Crush so fantastic, including the ability to play on the go. Why a puzzle game such as this lacks mobile phone functionality is an enigma to me.\n\nOverall I give this game a 2/10.\nAs others have suggested, play Candy Crush instead.","timestamp_created":1450756796,"timestamp_updated":1450756796,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":21,"weighted_vote_score":"0.191999107599258423","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19836015","author":{"steamid":"76561198085594730","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":5749,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4623,"last_played":1547885460},"language":"english","review":"no
