Instead of just having dif/ guns (like l4d) You actually get to pick a class, each class has its own category of guns that will be cheaper to you since you use this class. Even if your a certain class you may still buy ALL the guns available in game. Killing Floor also has a huge variety of maps, and dif/ character skins. 8.5/10","timestamp_created":1401050703,"timestamp_updated":1401050703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10234606","author":{"steamid":"76561197960423533","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1264,"last_played":1426971072},"language":"norwegian","review":"Løp å kjøp! åsså inviter meg på et game! :D","timestamp_created":1401050344,"timestamp_updated":1401050344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10234540","author":{"steamid":"76561198033803964","num_games_owned":455,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":12999,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11781,"last_played":1498437135},"language":"english","review":"This game is the best","timestamp_created":1401049891,"timestamp_updated":1401049891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10234538","author":{"steamid":"76561197990938240","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":19373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18858,"last_played":1406647499},"language":"english","review":"Best Zombie shooter ever.
