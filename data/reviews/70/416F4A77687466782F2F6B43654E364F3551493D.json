Set in the Black Mesa Research Complex, the game provides a very exciting setting for a shooting game. The level / environment design is the game's strongest suit since most of the levels have a high degree of internal believability and feature a lot of interconnectivity. The game also makes use of very varied combat environments filled with combat setpieces and puzzles so you're rarely stuck doing just one thing. The audiovisual design still feels like it holds up with great action soundtrack used at exciting setpieces, weapons and the industrial machinery sounding what one would expect. My main criticism of the game was that some enemies feel VERY bullet-spongy meaning that even if you surprise them you're going to take a lot of damage which is fair enough.

The game starts with a monorail ride that gives the player a look at the ambience. The soundtrack that plays during said ride gives chills up the spine and feeling of dread to any first-timer. After finishing the sequence, the player arrives at Sector C, where they have to start rushing toward the testing chamber, not before getting a Mark IV HEV Suit to put on as a security measure.\n\nI won't spoil much of the rest, and I don't want to make the review a 20 page long explanation of the lore, so I'll get to the technical and gameplay side of the game. First off, you may have noticed the visuals are a bit rough. This is usually something most players can get over quickly, as with any other old-school 3D first-person shooter. \n\nHowever, if you really think the graphics are affecting your experience, but you're still eager to play it, you may also try Half-Life: Source, an official Valve port of the game to Half-Life 2's signature engine, Source, or you could also play Black Mesa, a full-on remake of the original game on a brand-new engine that not only massively improves its outdated visuals, but also has some gameplay changes and expansion of certain chapters and maps. \n\nAnyway, getting back on topic, Half Life seriously made the entire gaming industry rethink the purpose and possibilities of a story-driven FPS title. After all, shooters back then were thought to be short, fun and chaotic experiences, like Wolfenstein and DOOM. Half Life however, while still keeping gunplay a priority, gave space for a story and plot. Story-driven games did exist, but they were usually RPGs that required really long dialogs and walls of text to explain the lore, and included primitive (or none) gunplay, like the first Fallout for example. Half Life however, needed no more than a few hundred voicelines and implicit story telling to deliver a plot, which is quite the achievement event to this day, where first-person shooters still struggle to deliver stories in a meaningful and interesting way.\n\nIn short, great game, and the first shooter I ever played that got me hooked on its lore. 10/10 would beat zombies to death with a crowbar again","timestamp_created":1623772505,"timestamp_updated":1637462692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93807333","author":{"steamid":"76561198874832871","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":644,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":538,"last_played":1656423155},"language":"polish","review":"super sie robin bhopa\n","timestamp_created":1623771893,"timestamp_updated":1623771893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93807119","author":{"steamid":"76561198258043979","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2948,"last_played":1658693079},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life is an FPS with survival-horror elements that was released in 1998. It revolutionized the world of not just FPS's but gaming as a whole. It was an immersive experience like no other and has set a lot of trends in how games tell their stories that are still commonly used today but just because a game revolutionized gaming doesn't mean it hold up today. However, Half-Life doesn't just hold up but remains one of the best games of all time and is my tied favorite game of all time. \n\nHalf-Life has a somewhat cliche story however the story manages to stay interesting due to the way the story is told. You never leave Gordon Freeman's perspective throughout the entire game and you remain in control for the majority of the experience with only 1 exception I can think of. Set-pieces are commonly used to great effect and help tell the story in a natural way.\n\nWhere Half-Life shines is in it's fast-paced but methodical game-play. There are 2 main types of enemy. There are aliens which appear in a select few chapters throughout the game. They are pretty interesting as there are a lot of variants and they are all unique. They provide a nice survival-horror theme earlier in the game but ultimately leave a little to be desired. The second variant of enemy are the soldiers. Soldiers are my favorite aspect of this game. A lot of people complain that their weapons are hit-scan and that it can feel unfair while others complain that firefights can turn into you and the enemy just unloading your rounds into each other. I disagree with both of these critiques and believe that this was intentional by the developers to create more strategical game-play. Soldiers can not shoot and run at the same time so a lot of the game revolves around you trying to outsmart the enemy. Remember, you're a theoretical physicist not a doom-guy. Each weapon has a unique purpose and there are a lot of weapons in the game. Throwing grenades make enemies run away giving you a chance to unload into their back-side. You can shoot explosive barrels and move wooden boxed to make cover. Little tactics like these add up into a strategical, fast-paced, run and gun experience. \n\n10 euro is not a lot of money and I have played this game 4 times (currently on my 5th play-through) and have sunk 50 hours into this masterpiece so far so you can probably imagine that I highly recommend you pick up this game. But before that I suggest you watch a video titled \"Why Half-life 1 is so unforgiving\" made by 'Leadhead' on Youtube. They do a fantastic job of outlining how Half-Life 1 should be played for the best experience. All I have left to say is I hope you have as much fun as I have and will for hours on end.","timestamp_created":1623771665,"timestamp_updated":1623771665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93806193","author":{"steamid":"76561198879457748","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1656601654},"language":"english","review":"I've got so many great memories with this game.

nasıl desem, artık bir genel kültür öğesine gelmiş bir oyun. Oyuncuların mutlaka oynaması ya da en azından bilmesi gereken bir oyun. Valve'ın en iyi oyunu. Gerçi sadece Valve'ın da değil çıktığı dönemde en iyi oyundu Half-Life. Hikayesi güzel görüntü kalitesi güzel hele hele multiplayer kısmı internet kafelerin vazgeçilmeziydi. Kendi çocukluğumdan hatırlıyorum da bizim internet kafede yer olmazdı sırf herkes oynayabilsin diye herkes en fazla 1 saat aralıksız oturabilirdi. Bir masa boşalınca kimin sırasıysa hemen o masaya geçer oyuna kaldığı yerden devam ederdi. Bomba kurmak, lazer veya süpürge... Bunların anlamları bizim için ayrı bir yer taşır. O dönemde olmayan şimdiki çocuklara üzülüyorum. Asla o internet kafe deneyimini yaşayamıyıcaklar.\n\nAma oyun tabiki sadece multiplayer değil. Ne kadar en güzel kısmı o olsada tek kişilik oyuncu moduda gayet eğlenceli. Sessiz dostumuz Gordon Freeman'ın gözünden oynadığımız hikaye modunda yanlış giden bir deney sonrası farklı bir gezegen ile dünya arasında açılan geçitler sayesinde dünyanın uzaylı istalasına uğramasını anlatıyor. Tabi oyundaki tek zorluk uzaylılar değil. Oynanış yeni nesil oyuncuları biraz zorlayabilir. Çünkü yeni oyunların aksine burda şuraya git buraya git diye bir işaretçi yok. Ne yapacağınızı öğrenmek için dostlarınızı iyi dinlemeli ve ne dediklerine önem vermelisiniz aksi halde çoğu oyuncu gibi sağa sola boş boş koşup zaman kaybedersiniz. Ben dahil çoğu kişi dinlemediğimiz için aynı şeyleri yaşadık, aslında biraz da oyunun yapısıyla alakalı geliyor. Öyle bir oyun ki hani oturupta adamları dinleyesiniz gelmiyor yani.\n\nNeyse işin özü Half-Life bence artık oyun dünyası için genel kültür öğesidir. Oynamasanız bile bilin. Ama ben oynamanızı öneririm.Zaten Valve Complete veya Half-Life Complte alarak tüm seriyi çok uygun bir fiyata edinebilirsiniz. Kaldı ki bu fiyatlar bile indirime giriyor.","timestamp_created":1623576785,"timestamp_updated":1623576785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61538463830947876","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93671197","author":{"steamid":"76561199089557238","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":36,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1650870993},"language":"english","review":"idk ask my cousin he played it\n","timestamp_created":1623576316,"timestamp_updated":1623576316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93668753","author":{"steamid":"76561198354122417","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":409,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":390,"last_played":1629312803},"language":"russian","review":"это игра?","timestamp_created":1623572487,"timestamp_updated":1623572487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93662514","author":{"steamid":"76561199027807236","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":544,"last_played":1657844195},"language":"romanian","review":"tare mai jucam","timestamp_created":1623561968,"timestamp_updated":1623561968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93659830","author":{"steamid":"76561198149301027","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2427,"last_played":1639065350},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1623557386,"timestamp_updated":1623557386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93659635","author":{"steamid":"76561199022662263","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":765,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":618,"last_played":1646012881},"language":"english","review":"It's neat-o.
