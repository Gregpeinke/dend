И вот после прохождения второй части, попадается мне информация о новом биошоке, конечно я сразу же посмотрел все доступные материалы по этой игре и был заворожен предстоящем сеттингом. Как только игра появилась в предзаказе,он был мною куплен. И когда игра наконец вышла, я осилил ее за внушительные 20 часов ( предыдущие были покороче), я был восхищен данной игрой, и конечно же не разу пожалел о покупке. Ну а теперь немного о самой игре:\n\nЯвные плюсы:\n\nАтмосфера серии биошок: она никуда не делась и хоть тут нет безысходности мертвого города Восторга, атмосфера пронизывает игру на всех ее уровнях. Иными словами Колумбия чувствуется от начала и до самого финала.\n\nДизайн уровней - уровни сделаны со вкусом, да они просто шикарны, все очень гармонично и хорошо смотрится, все к месту, нет копипаста, каждая локация по своему красива.\n\nСюжет - именно тут разработчики превзошли свои прошлые творения и создали такую интригу которая переплюнула все предыдущие части биошока разом. О сюжете много и впрямь не скажешь потому что можно сболтнуть лишнее из области спойлеров))Но он просто великолепен!\n\nКомпаньон - да, милая девушка по имени Элизабет будет вас сопровождать почти всю игру. Напарник реализован отлично, нареканий нет, Лизонька может помогать на поле боя, находя боеприпасы, так же может вскрывать двери и кучу всего. Опять же после первых двух биошоков это все очень непривычно и круто вписано в игровой процесс.\n\nСерединка на половинку:\n\nК таким можно отнести графику - да она не мозолит глаза, на максимальных настройках достаточно приятна, но все таки не идеал и многим может показаться неказистой.\n\nБоевая система и ИИ противников - тут опять же спорный вопрос, ИИ противников улучшен по сравнению с предыдущими частями, но опять же противники действуют достаточно абсурдно, берут числом, в некоторых случаях нужно просто выдерживать волны противников, достаточно однообразны. Насчет же боевой системы, в целом она неплоха, есть много видов оружия, заместо плазмидов тут есть энергетики, которых к сожалению поменьше чем в предыдущих частях.Однако лично по мне многие оружия откровенно бесполезны (ну тут уж на вкус и цвет).\n\nПодводя черту под вышесказанным думаю что это лучшая игра уходящего 2013 года на ПК несмотря на свои небольшие недостатки (а какая же игра без них), так что если вы еще не играли в BioShock Infinite, то безусловно советую поиграть в нее!","timestamp_created":1386183298,"timestamp_updated":1386183298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563281416893005371","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7914108","author":{"steamid":"76561198045941188","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":129,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":123,"last_played":1386294715},"language":"english","review":"sickest game ever.","timestamp_created":1386182485,"timestamp_updated":1386182485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7914037","author":{"steamid":"76561197999454457","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1018,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":525,"last_played":1492306465},"language":"english","review":"The story is just amazing! great game! must buy","timestamp_created":1386182181,"timestamp_updated":1386182181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7913594","author":{"steamid":"76561198045933709","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1811,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":836,"last_played":1433777925},"language":"english","review":"A game that is REALLY FUCKING AWESOME!","timestamp_created":1386180014,"timestamp_updated":1386180014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498776525259017944","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7913259","author":{"steamid":"76561198057825321","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":587,"last_played":1386149900},"language":"english","review":"Lots of action, amazing story.

I thought BioShock 2 was okay but suffered from weak plot pacing and a focus on the combat aspect of the game, something I simply don't care about in this series.  BioShock Infinite throws away the pacing and design of the previous two games to give you a boring action shooter with an on-rails story.  \n\nAt its most action packed, Infinite reminds me of monster gauntlets straight out of Serious Sam but the lack of enemy variety -- basically three types: guys who shoot, guys who punch, and big guys who shoot and/or punch -- and bullet-spongey consistency of enemies make combat a slog.  You get a variety of abilities that would make combat interesting like grind rails, hooks, and tears that let you bring objects into the arenas or achieve verticality but truly open levels are rare.  You're mostly fighting in tight corridors against dull enemies who stupidly run into your line of fire.\n\nAll this would be forgivable, as the combat certainly wasn't the highlight of the original, if the story was interesting but it did not engage me.  Unlike the predecessors, the story is presented with as many scripted events and handholding as possible.  The game loves yanking the controls from your hand to force you through a series of events that tries to build a world that's ultimately less interesting than Rapture because those games let you explore their worlds, organically revealing pieces of the story as you went along.  Even the audio logs were cut down from 120+ to about 80 and there are fewer side characters detailed in the audio logs.  I won't discuss the story in detail but it's basically a time traveling/multidimensional plot line so like most time traveling plots expect everything to come around full circle in the end with a ton of last minute plot twists.  A lot of people clearly liked it but without any interesting characters (I sympathize with the silent protagonists of the first two games more than Booker) it doesn't appeal to me.\n\nI was really looking forward to this game after amazing E3 showings but the final product feels completely neutered.  I cannot recommend this but acknowledge it's not a bad game and that people would enjoy it.  If you liked the combat of BioShock, or at least tolerated it, you'll probably enjoy this game as it cranks the battles up to 11 and doesn't stop.","timestamp_created":1386170336,"timestamp_updated":1386170336,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.441010147333145142","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7911507","author":{"steamid":"76561197997518268","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":905,"last_played":1399380325},"language":"russian","review":"Одна из величайших игр.

Игра повествует очень удивительную историю происходящию в восхитительных местах. Удивление и восхищение от безумной фантазии дизайнеров игровых уровней заставляет играющего сидеть с открытым ртом уже через пять минут игры. Вот так вот я и просидел всю игру с открытым ртом обалдевая от происходящего. Очень отлично обыгран сценарий. Прекрасно обствленыйй сюжет прекрастно обыгранная концовка в миксе с умопомрачительной атмосферой, декорациями, сценами. Рекомендую эту игру всем тем кто ценит в игре в первую очередь атмосферу и сюжет. Как я уже сказал на мой взгляд перестрелки в игре сделаны по стольку по скольку и не являются ключевым моментом игры, но тем неменее вы можете достаточно весело их разнообразить большим выбором оружия и тоников. Лично я вобще играл с гемпадом используя автонаведение что позволяло мне всё своё свободное внимание в перестрелках уделять красоте происходящего и избавляя меня от абсолютно ненужного старания в прицеливание во время ведение боя. То как вы будете стрелять никак не влияет на лут и всё остальное что влияет на прокачивание способностей/оружия. Основоной упор сделан на поиск скртых мест с целью дополнительного исследования прекрасных локация я делал это постоянно и не жалею. Отличная игра для тех кто любит хорошее приключение!
