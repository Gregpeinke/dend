At first like many I was disapointed that the game was so violent when with its setting it could have been very picturesque and had different avenues of transversing this world.  Blending in, basically not just laying waste, and at times, the civilian aspect is overshadowed by \"how many soldiers does this guy have in his floating city\" and then I remember \"oh yeah, the end goal wasn't to make a heaven in the sky it was to take over the world\".  Basically I realized that the game had done what I wanted the game to do.  To make some sort of observation about life and gaming in general.  This is why I can't get into games like Call of Duty but love SpecOps, being the hero and winning the day by shooting a bunch of badguys isn't that interesting to me.  What really is interesting is the thought behind these actions.  And that is what Bioshock tries to convey with its very handholdy ending that does keep going but still keeps me interested.  The revelation about this man saturated in violence to the end that he is the villian no matter how you spin him and is always the creator of his own hell is just facinating.  For people who like games that demand you listen to it in order to like it and actual take apart the plot and draw conclusions about gameplay and humanity itself.

It’s one of the strongest emotions you can feel in any work of fiction. Your connection with an imaginary character seems real, born organically through a shared experience and the challenges you overcame at each other’s side. It’s the presence of companionship that elevates BioShock Infinite from being a great game to an astounding one, imbuing the exhilarating FPS gameplay with a sense of genuine humanity. Elizabeth is your only friend in the airborne city of Columbia, a twisted vision of a utopia floating in the heavens. And seeing the sights in an unfamiliar city is always more fun with a friend.\n\nThe year is 1912. You're Booker DeWitt, an ex-Pinkerton agent with the machismo of Harrison Ford, sent to extract a woman from the dizzying heights of Columbia’s aerial metropolis. As with the previous BioShock games, this fantasy environment is stunning to behold and layered with an incredible ambience. The simple act of walking its cobbled streets and browsing through gift shops turns into a mesmerizing experience, where propaganda posters, eavesdropped conversations, and children’s toys all give you a glimpse into this society’s warped sense of patriotism. Columbia feels like an inhabited world, and your curiosity into its inner workings will be rewarded--and built up--at every turn.\n\nYou’ll also find yourself in awe as you explore Columbia. The city is downright beautiful, with striking colors and brightness in some vistas and an ominous duskiness in others. Going from a cheerful, vibrant street fair into less congenial settings (like a church of raven-worshipping cultists who idolize Abraham Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth) is surprising in all the right ways, and no two environments feel alike. The pacing of the level design is excellent, never dawdling on any one set piece for too long but giving you just enough time to appreciate their magnificence.\n\nBlended into these gorgeous locations are messages of repugnant bigotry, and the stark contrast between the idyllic cityscape and the prejudice that pervades it tells a story all by itself. Racist caricatures aren’t used for cheap shock value--they help sell the idea that most citizens in Columbia think that skin color dictates status. But Infinite’s narrative stretches far beyond a mere face-off between the forces serving the self-righteous Father Comstock and the freedom fighters of the zealous Vox Populi. The 15-to-18-hour campaign doesn’t limit itself to the ideas of right and wrong, or force you to make dichotomous moral choices; instead, it’s the kind of tale that subverts your expectations time and time again.\n\nCentral to this story is Elizabeth, your strong-willed, super-powered ally who dreams of escaping her life in captivity. Through a combination of affecting voicework, convincing facial animations, and brilliant AI, Elizabeth feels like a completely autonomous companion--a friend. Her body language delivers emotion without words; a glimmering smile at Booker when he makes promises, an averted gaze and crossed arms if he breaks them. Elizabeth’s behavior makes you forget she’s a video game character: She’ll explore environments all on her own, humming to herself or beckoning you over to point out something you might’ve missed. When patiently waiting for you to finish surveying a room, her gaze will shift to sights beyond the player, rather than fixating on your head like so many video game NPCs. Once you’ve grown accustomed to Elizabeth’s mannerisms, the vacant stares and limited reactions from lesser characters can make them feel lifeless by comparison--though no worse than any other great game.\n\nHer incorporation into the FPS gameplay is downright ingenious. Too often, companions become a detriment in combat, in constant need of baby-sitting or instructions. But Elizabeth is the polar opposite, able to fend for herself and assist you with her supernatural abilities. You’ll be grateful when she opens inter-dimensional tears in the environment, altering the layout of a level to give you cover or create an enemy-attracting diversion. When you die, it’s Elizabeth who worriedly revives you. It makes the bond between you and Elizabeth feel that much stronger--when she’s happy, you’re happy. When she’s hurt, you’ll want to personally slaughter whoever it was that hurt her.\n\n\nElizabeth’s presence also brings the tone firmly into action territory and away from survival horror. Knowing that you won’t have to face your enemies alone will make you feel empowered--quite the switch from the original BioShock’s desolate, chilling atmosphere. Elizabeth is a reliably helpful partner, seeking out the items you need and tossing them to you just in the knick of time during an intense firefight. Her companionship acts as a lifeline instead of a liability, and effortlessly generates thrilling moments during battle.\n\nPicture this: you’re nearing the bottom of a machine gun clip, heart pounding as swarms of Comstock’s goons charge at you. Then you hear Elizabeth shout your name, spin around to catch the ammo she’s thrown, quickly reload, and blast your assailants in the face with hot lead. These moments will overwhelm your adrenal glands, and feel like incidental heroics instead of manufactured, scripted events.\n\nSpeaking of adrenal glands, Infinite’s combat will be satisfyingly familiar for BioShock veterans. The gun-in-one-hand, magic-powers-in-the-other formula delivers exciting shootouts one after another, and lets you play to your strengths and approach enemies however you see fit. In place of Plasmids are some imaginative Vigors, which open up even more avenues for combo-based traps, and the gunplay offers a satisfying range of close-quarters firepower and long-range artillery.\n\n\nBut sky-lines, the suspended tracks you can use to ride through levels like a rollercoaster, turn the first-person shooting into a first-person thrillride. It delivers a new FPS experience entirely, where you hold your breath at the apex of a sky-line before screaming down the rail so fast that no bullet can touch you. You won’t have access to sky-line mobility in the lion’s share of the fights--but when you do, it’s an absolute rush.\n\nIncredibly, BioShock Infinite delivers on your years’ worth of expectations, then exceeds them. Regardless of your affinity for the FPS genre, Infinite deserves your attention, and it’s the kind of landmark experience that happens only a few times in a gaming generation. Even after the game is over, Elizabeth--and Columbia--will stay with yCompanionship. It’s one of the strongest emotions you can feel in any work of fiction. Your connection with an imaginary character seems real, born organically through a shared experience and the challenges you overcame at each other’s side. It’s the presence of companionship that elevates BioShock Infinite from being a great game to an astounding one, imbuing the exhilarating FPS gameplay with a sense of genuine humanity. Elizabeth is your only friend in the airborne city of Columbia, a twisted vision of a utopia floating in the heavens. And seeing the sights in an unfamiliar city is always more fun with a friend.\t\n\nMassive, beautiful, revolutionary--BioShock Infinite is a remarkable adventure that'll keep you hooked from start to finish... and then from start to finish again.","timestamp_created":1426965552,"timestamp_updated":1426974551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510488748550415039","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14992422","author":{"steamid":"76561197967658028","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":538,"last_played":1420668787},"language":"english","review":"Visuals are stunning.\nThe FPS gameplay is ok.\nThe story is just confusing and contrived: after a while I lost interest.\n\nOverall a good game, but a few mis-steps away from being a great or memorable game.\n","timestamp_created":1426963764,"timestamp_updated":1426963764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14992199","author":{"steamid":"76561198083125516","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":381,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":243,"last_played":1584467188},"language":"english","review":"First time I was not a big fan of Bioshock taking place in Columbia but it is amazing...Well after you play all the DLC\n\n+ Story\n+ NPC's Intelligence\n+ Graphic\n+ Columbia\n\n","timestamp_created":1426962828,"timestamp_updated":1426962828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49885261058807373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14992102","author":{"steamid":"76561198124329300","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1917,"last_played":1509235784},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely love this game. would definately reccoment to someone who enjoys a good campain story line","timestamp_created":1426962492,"timestamp_updated":1426962492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14990857","author":{"steamid":"76561198155729745","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1473460126},"language":"english","review":"LOVE THIS GAME","timestamp_created":1426957749,"timestamp_updated":1426957749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14990851","author":{"steamid":"76561198091272427","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1574504750},"language":"german","review":"This game is FUCKING amazing!","timestamp_created":1426957723,"timestamp_updated":1426957723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14990738","author":{"steamid":"76561198046763978","num_games_owned":521,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":2578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2352,"last_played":1426955772},"language":"russian","review":"Без преувеличения одна из лучших игр в моей коллекции! \nСовершенно логично после настолько сильной игры оканчивать историю студии. \nЭто как у гномов: гном может раз в жизни поставить на кон всё свое мастрество и выковать шедевр, но после этого он уже не сможет ковать.\nАбсолютно прекрасная игра и безумно красивая история.\nKen Levine - гений.\nВосторг решительно от всего. 11\\10","timestamp_created":1426957330,"timestamp_updated":1426957546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14990721","author":{"steamid":"76561197990391984","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":609,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":609,"last_played":1388432024},"language":"french","review":"Changement de décor radical avec quelques nouveautés intéressantes.

Total, unadulterated, trope-filled garbage.  This game's story consisted of bunch of Doctor Who bullcrap which removed all realism from the plot.  Unlike Bioshock, where everything was explained (how people grew food, how they survived in their environment, what Andrew Ryan's motivations were, how the economy worked, where all the guns came from) Infinite was like some sort of ridiculous fanfiction where all of the gameplay elements had a cameo and no explanation.  Seriously, how the hell do they breathe air that high up?  Where does all of their food come from?  Where do people live- I sure as hell didn't see that many residences for the population present.  \n\nIn Bioshock, the story takes the player through all of these questions and more in order to provide realism which is essential to justifying the writer's criticism. Audiotapes were so uninteresting and useless in this game that they're not even worth collecting.  There are a few shouts about racism, but they are fragmented and incomprehensible at best.  While they were absolutely essential to grabbing a synopsis of Rapture's history in the first game, in this game they just served as nonessential easter eggs.  \n\nNeedless to say, exploring is dull and unsuspenseful along with being unrewarding. Plasmids in Bioshock were a focal point of the plot and supplemented the criticism of Ayn Rand, whereas Vigours in Infinite were just added to maintain the gameplay and hardly had any explanation as to their origin.  There is literally no explanation as to how Vigours come into play in Columbia's society- NONE.  \n\nIn Bioshock, the moral implications of Adam processing along with the mental effects all help to give the player a better sense of the game's message. Also, it's needless to say that Booker is a \"oh muh horrible past\", \"grizzled veteran\", \"apathetic gunman\" type of character.  Elizabeth is a \"freed from the cage\", \"omniscient\", \"self-reliant woman\", \"Mary Sue\" type of character who gives the game a Deus Ex Machina ending.  The Luteces are the \"absurdist British\", \"quirky\", \"apathetic yet involved\", \"brother and sister\" pair who also act as a Deus Ex Machina in controlling the entire plot.  The multiverse stuff that came with it was almost interesting, but again, edgy and pseudo-meaningful garbage that made no sense and delivered absolutely nothing for the player to think about.  The game's message begins with a decent setting that could criticize early 20th century America and its practices, but falls extremely short as it moves into pseudo-Einstein nonsense.  \n\nHoly CRAP this game's story was bad.  The gameplay was alright, but borrowed from the first Bioshock and just had a lot of bells, whistles, and gimmicks which really didn't do the setting justice.  The gameplay elements (Elizabeth reviving you in the middle of a firefight and somehow taking money for it, the Skylines) just serve to destroy the story and remove realism even more.  So actually, the gameplay was terrible in destroying the story to a ridiculous point. Bioshock inspired me to question my own ideals and the look at society from a lot of different standpoints, seeing how things work and how ideals affect their benefactors in execution and the people who are subsequently left behind.  The first game affected me in a way that changed me as a person at a younger age.  \n\nInfinite inspired me to type this several-paragraph rant about how even I, a generally-unartistic scrub, could write a better plot than Kevin Levine did for this story.  I have this feeling that he came up with a lot of great stuff, but got stomped on by his publisher so that he could market to the majority of people who would buy this game, because this is a huge step in the wrong direction for him and his skills.  Rife with DLC, I'm wondering how hard he winced at watching his plot and setting for the original Bioshock get taken apart.  I'll follow the stuff he's working on now that 2K has been disbanded, maybe it'll have more artistic integrity.\n\n\n\nJK I THINK ITS FUN","timestamp_created":1426955052,"timestamp_updated":1427030702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14990025","author":{"steamid":"76561198074947227","num_games_owned":1669,"num_reviews":219,"playtime_forever":736,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":736,"last_played":1396457826},"language":"russian","review":"10 соловьев из 10.","timestamp_created":1426954743,"timestamp_updated":1426954743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535905539989471436","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14989334","author":{"steamid":"76561198079929937","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1426892904},"language":"english","review":"It's fun to play only its a bit repeative","timestamp_created":1426951784,"timestamp_updated":1426951784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14989016","author":{"steamid":"76561198092259173","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":158,"last_played":1426961312},"language":"russian","review":"ИГРА КЛАСС НО КАНЦОВКА НЕ ОЧЁМ*(\n","timestamp_created":1426950299,"timestamp_updated":1426950299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14988606","author":{"steamid":"76561198141915303","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1612,"last_played":1437241552},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is a Masterpiece!
