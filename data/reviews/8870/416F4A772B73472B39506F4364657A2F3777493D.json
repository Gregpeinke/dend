It's going in lots of places at once and it's coherent without being so. Shame it only lasts one play through because you get so spoiled in the end it's not even funny. It's good on it's own. \nThe game play has been improved again from Bioshock and Bioshock 2. Limiting the guns is a good thing because switching up all of those guns and different ammo in the last two games became quite tedious in the end. Giving a quick swap plasmid wheel was a good thing as well. \nThe game took around 9 hours and I didn't find everything and I thought I was thorough with my searching. The game was easy, even on hard. Only one boss fight took me ages because I didn't really upgrade my guns at all. I used my money on plasmids. \nI can't really say much about the game. Just play it. It's cheap and accessible. It plays well and has aged well. It's a helluva ride to go through but spoiling yourself with the plot ruins the game to be replayable. You can only get one experience and that's it.\nIf you open this door and install this game you won't be disappointed.
