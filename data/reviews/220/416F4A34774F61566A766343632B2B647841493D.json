В игре нет сюжетных вставок, весь геймплей игры находится \"в голове\" Гордона Фримана, посредством которого он и спасает человечество. А спасать есть от кого - землян за 7 часов победил \"Альянс\" - воинственная группировка, прибывшая из другого измерения. Вот и приходится Гордону ФримануИгроку пробираться с боями до Цитадели, главного управления Альянса, уничтожая отряды Гражданской обороны и агрессивных животных, завезенных на Землю инопланетными захватчиками.\n\nГрафика в игре до сих пор может тягаться с новинками игрового мира. Реализма прибавляет и прекрасная физика - на стенах от удара остаются вмятины, мелкие предметы на полу отскакивают, когда в них попадает пуля, деревья и провода колышутся от ветра, поднятого пропеллером боевого вертолета Альянса... Тени, отражения, волны на воде, блики света - мелочи сливаются в прекрасную и правдивую картинку.\n\nВ игре присутствует звуковое сопровождение из смеси электронной музыки разных жанров. Композиторы Valve умело играют с настроением игрока: мощное техно накаляет обстановку в серьезных перестрелках, а красивое звучание синтезатора подчеркивает атмосферу упадка и отчаяния.\n\nКроме музыки из динамиков во время игры идет реалистичные звуки непосредственно игрового процесса, о которых стоит написать отдельно. Тут можно отметить умело спроектированный объем общего шума игры - то и дело можно услышать перестрелки в отдалении, шум летательных аппаратов альянса, крики зомби. Кстати, о зомби. Крики зараженных инопланетной гадостью людей пугают. Я никогда не был слабонервным, но стон зомби задел и меня, не говоря уже о криках и мычании других монстров.\n\nЕщё одна интересная особенность: преградой в прохождении игры может оказаться... обыкновенная глупость. Да, вы не ошиблись и я в своем уме. Именно глупость. Подкупает то, что перед Фриманом (Физик со степенью, как никак) игровой процесс постоянно ставит задачи, без решения которых дальше не пройти. Например Игрок оказывается в яме, посредине которой стоит бетонный цилиндр, на котором - доска. Получаются эдакие \"качели\". Что бы вылезти из ямы, игроку нужно использовать доску как мост, чего у него сделать не получается, т. к. под собственным весом Фриманаигрока \"качели\" уходят вниз. Выход из этой ситуации - накидать на противоположный конец \"качелей\" кирпичей, что бы они перевешивали игрока. Тогда и получится необходимый трамплин для того, что бы выбраться. И это - одна из самых легких задач.\n\nВ общем скажу, что для меня Half-life2 была и остается флагманов мире игр. Рад тому, что Valve разрабатывает продолжение и уже есть новые эпизоды. Ставлю разработчикам твердое \"десять\" по пятибальной шкале.\n","timestamp_created":1611163249,"timestamp_updated":1611163249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.663363277912139893","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85042410","author":{"steamid":"76561198219506633","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":113,"playtime_forever":1401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1401,"last_played":1640549794},"language":"czech","review":"[h1]Half-Life 2[/h1]\nDá se popsat pouze slovy \"Neskutečná pecka\" od prvního dílu byl změněn engin který je teď rozhodně lepší a co se my na něm opravdu líbí je vylepšená fyzika které jsem si opravdu povšiml.

2 to gra absolutnie kultowa, legendarna, która w dużym stopniu napisała historię fabularnych FPSów. Zawsze byłem przeciwnikiem oceniania czegokolwiek wyłącznie przez pryzmat czasu w którym miało swoje pięć minut, więc niech tytułu najlepiej obroni fakt, iż jest on niewiele mniej grywalny, niż w dniu premiery; pomimo tak wielu lat na karku, wciąż potrafi zaskoczyć kreatywnymi rozwiązaniami w zakresie fabuły, mechaniki, złożoności czy też gameplayu.\n\nW kontekście samego gatunku posiada niemal wszystko: dość ciekawą historię, solidny system walki(choć dość archaiczny, nie da się ukryć), zróżnicowane poziomy, a także rozgrywkę angażującą na wielu płaszczyznach. Najbardziej po latach oberwało się oczywiście grafice, natomiast w żadnym razie nie można powiedzieć, że straszy, lub zestarzała się w jakiś fatalny sposób. Ot, nieco skostniały silnik, pomimo bycia nieco obskurnym wciąż oferujący wiarygodną fizykę w dobrze oddanym, futurystycznym świecie.\n\nStrzela się dobrze, choć daleko temu do jakiegoś imponującego poziomu, znacznie lepiej się chyba jednak przemierza. Poziom trudności nie jest szczególnie wymagający, choć potrafi czasem napsuć krwi, jednocześnie dając całkiem pokaźną dozę satysfakcji. Dobre udźwiękowienie bohaterów pozwala wczuć się w wydarzenia na ekranie, a solidny skrypt oparty na elementach horroru motywuje do ukończenia produkcji w całości, szczególnie biorąc pod uwagę, że wcale nie jest boleśnie krótka jak na tak przełomowy shooter. Wszystko tu do siebie pasuje, wszystko ze sobą łączy, doskonałe wyważenie wartkiej akcji ze spokojnym budowaniem nastroju.\n\nMoim zdaniem, naprawdę warto choć raz do tej gry podejść, niezależnie od nastawienia względem FPSów lub światów rodem z science fiction. Kawał historii, który naprawdę daje bezpośrednią frajdę - jasne, że sztuczna inteligencja przeciwników potrafi zawodzić. Niewątpliwie też niektóre potyczki czy walki z bossami potrafią zostawić trochę do życzenia, a muzyka nie wnosi się na szczególne wyżyny kreowania klimatu - są to jednak bruzdy, które w moim odczuciu warto przeboleć. \n\nChciałbym napisać, że dla każdego, ale niestety nie jest to takie proste. Odradzam przeciwnikom shooterów oraz destruktywnej futurystyki. Reszcie zalecam zapoznać się z historią Gordona Freemana, o wiele głębszą, niż to z pozoru może się wydawać.","timestamp_created":1611092804,"timestamp_updated":1611092804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84998696","author":{"steamid":"76561199080883109","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":41,"playtime_at_review":3385,"last_played":1660513648},"language":"spanish","review":"gordon
