The graphics are old, but very impressive for their time, it's quite smooth, the shooting works great and the unbroken first-person gameplay is still great as it is today. It may not be so important now considering that game like Bioshock, Far Cry 3 and this games own sequel got ahold of the method, but not many can do it as well as the original Half-Life and it still engages you into the game and makes for an excellent narrative method. Much like the sequel, the game despite being a shooter, also includes variety in plataforming, exploring and navigation that make the game varied and avoids getting stale as you continue.\n\nNow, although I really liked this game, there are several things that hold it back from being a favorite of mine. Now, I don't know if it's the difficulty level (I played in normal throughout), but some of the enemies have a bad case of bullet sponge, which can be quite annoying. Another things would be the fact that despite the cool soundtrack and its greatness when it's used in battles and certain moods, there's not a lot of music throughout. Finally of course, there's Xen, which while I certainly thought it had great ideas, wasn't a very inspiring last level and the last boss battle can feel a bit anticlimatic, partly due to the teleporting breaking you into different areas and not keeping any momentum and also a lack of music and epic tone that tells \"This is it, time to show who is the boss!\". At the very least the last scenes were very intriguing and do a nice ending.\n\nI guess another thing would be that what the first game did great, the second game did a lot better in every department, including and actually awesome final level and a better immersion for the player, which doesn't mean that the first game can't be awesome on its own right, but feels a bit overshadowed compared to the sequel and dated in some respects.\n\nDespite all that I said, I still had a great time with Half-Life and I do consider it a masterpiece for its time. It's definitely influenced many things that gaming would adopt and really showed what PC gaming was capable of.","timestamp_created":1432964593,"timestamp_updated":1432964593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16053924","author":{"steamid":"76561198065208674","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":233,"last_played":1628993119},"language":"english","review":"love","timestamp_created":1432894389,"timestamp_updated":1432894389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16046877","author":{"steamid":"76561198154612759","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":729,"last_played":1443388403},"language":"spanish","review":"Los años pasan, pero a este juego no le pesan.\nHalf-Life, este juego fue el futuro para muchos.

The original game was released sometime around 1996, so poor graphics are to be expected in the original version of the game. What’s not to be expected is for there to be poor graphics in the remake/remaster of the game (Half-Life Source). If the graphics are this bad, I might have well just played the original version.\n\nAt first I put this aside; a game with bad graphics doesn’t always equal a bad game. I decided proceed through the “tutorial” area until I actually reach the real part of the game (in which you get your first weapon). I was quite frustrated to find out that I had to use a crowbar as a weapon, which in my opinion is quite a bad design decision. You are going to get a gun later in the game anyway, so why not just provide a gun earlier in the game? Another thing I can't work out is why did they put glasses on the main character? It doesn't seem very badass for the main character to wear glasses.\n\nI then struggle to play though the game due to the dry story and boring combat mechanics. I honestly don’t know why everyone thinks the story to this game is so amazing. A science laboratory gets filled with aliens and you need to escape that laboratory. The story doesn’t get any more complicated or in-depth than that.\n\nYou also see a man in a suit from time to time. I don’t see the point in this since you never get the chance to fight him. He is clearly the bad guy in the game, but instead of fighting him at the end of the game, you just speak to him instead. What a disappointment.\n\nTake my advice. Save your money and spend it elsewhere.\n\n(This is from my Half-Life source review. They are pretty much the same game. If you HAVE to buy this game, just buy whichever is cheaper)","timestamp_created":1432418588,"timestamp_updated":1432418588,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":11,"weighted_vote_score":"0.257216840982437134","comment_count":55,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15973024","author":{"steamid":"76561198068416876","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":959,"last_played":1432416537},"language":"english","review":"I was in the mood for a classic game when I got this.

Black Mesa's team did a fantastic job of recreating the world of Half Life with truly awe inspiring graphics and detail, but then they decided they could improve it by quadrupling the number of monsters and making all of them twice as deadly and treating the player like a moron. Given how much praise they're getting for it, I guess most of the people who paid money for it must be just that. Or maybe they just want a game about brainlessly shooting aliens, not being trapped alone and desperate in the once familiar crumbling remains of a now completely hostile underground laboratory, bombarded from all sides by insanity and chaos as reality itself unravels around you, sneaking and fighting from one end to the other in a mad attempt to just survive another hour.\n\nHalf Life has bad graphics because it's from 1998, but the pacing, atmosphere, narrative, and triple headed gameplay of exploration/puzzle solving/platforming shooty action outclass every other first person game from its day and just about all of them today as well. The primary brilliance of Half Life is immersion, kept intact by no cutscenes and peerless storytelling that leads the player along without revealing itself. Bad linear games keep players on track through force, making them do what the designers intended regardless of what the player thinks would be a good idea. Good linear games keep the player on track by designing the world to make the player want to do exactly what they need to to progress, and nobody does it better than Valve.","timestamp_created":1431038703,"timestamp_updated":1431038703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15732623","author":{"steamid":"76561198096981396","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":561,"last_played":1531020209},"language":"english","review":"\"....\" - Gordon Freeman\n\n\nSUCH A WISE MAN.","timestamp_created":1431036398,"timestamp_updated":1431036398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15731160","author":{"steamid":"76561198068127157","num_games_owned":6359,"num_reviews":141,"playtime_forever":1014,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1009,"last_played":1658551412},"language":"english","review":"Half Life is a First Person Shooter that takes place in a hidden laboratory that experiments with teleportation. As you can guess things quickly go wrong and our protagonist Gordon Freeman must fight to survive. Gordon is an engineer but he is proficient with firearms and has no qualms about killing. He is a generic mute character with no personality and very little back-story. As is pretty much everyone you meet throughout this adventure. There are only three character models of scientists and one character model of the security guard rehashed throughout the game. It quickly makes you stop caring if they survive an encounter since you will surely meet the same exact guy again. I know it is from 1998 but it would have been better to make those three scientist models count and have actual characters in the game instead of meeting an endless clone of scientists throughout. \n\nThe story is told during gameplay and there are no cutscenes which is nice. If you don't care about story you can just as easily whack the character talking instead of listening to them. There is no consequence for killing allies but sometimes they do lead to some extra loot or simply help you fight off aliens. It feels like a grand adventure since all the missions are seamless and connect together perfectly. Most of the areas early on are bland and gray but it is impressive how much variety there is in the actual objectives to get through them. It is never as simple as running and gunning, if something can go wrong it always does for poor Gordon.\n\nWhich leads to my main problem with the game. The amount of platforming is kind of ridiculous and it  feels pretty awkward. They also demand too much precision as well as that annoying need to crouch jump to reach just a tiny bit higher so you can jump over certain objects. Another similar problem is that ladders are extremely unreliable and you never know if Gordon will hold on to it causing you to have to try over and over again. Luckily missing it is very rarely fatal although trying to go down one can be fatal as Gordon decides he has no need for ladders and that he can land a 30 ft fall. Quick saving is a godsend and makes these situations much more tolerable. The puzzles are never too complicated though the game can be inconsistent at times such as certain identical objects are not destructible but suddenly one is. Or just plain odd like them expecting you to figure out you can change tracks by shooting a sign during the railcart level.\n\nActual gameplay fairs a lot better. You start off with a crowbar and quickly get a pistol which I used throughout the whole game since it has decent damage and is very accurate.  Most of the weapons are pretty standard like an assault rifle, shotgun and revolver but there are some pretty unique weapons late game. Some do share certain types of ammo like the assault rifle and the pistol. The assault rifle and shotgun are pretty inaccurate which makes sense considering Gordon is an engineer.  Gordon's main source of survival is some kind of special suit that takes the impact out of most damage and allows navigation through toxic hazards. For a while at least, Gordon does not wear a helmet for some reason and the toxicity will kill him eventually. The suit works pretty much the same as armor from any other FPS of the time and can be recharged by finding small glowing vials or through a wall mounted H.E.V center. The same goes for health, both first aid kits laying around and wall mounted health centers will heal you.\n\nEnemies in this game each have their own unique attack patterns and have pretty good AI. Most of the time humans will be your greatest foe since bullets are way too fast to dodge in this and they pull off impressive maneuvers at times such as when you chase them they drop a grenade behind them allowing them to regroup. The security guards yo can have follow you around are completely useless on the other hand. Most of the times they don't react until they get struck first and are only useful to distract the enemies. The game does steadily introduce new powerful enemies but you will be fighting mostly the same group of enemies from beginning to end. Aliens do look very weird and are not simply just humanoid enemies. Some enemies have weird death animations that play whenever they are dying so make sure to recognize them and not waste any ammo even though they are still moving.\n\nOverall Half Life is a pretty good game but don't let all the praise make you expect something amazing. There is no gripping story here nor is there even any characters aside from one mysterious man. Platforming in a FPS very rarely works and it sure as heck doesn't here. Still it is a solid title when it is not trying to be an Adventure game instead of a FPS. Half Life continue to be supported after all these years so it features modern controls and modern resolutions which is always nice. The physics like boxes floating on water and some puzzles solved by it are pretty fun to watch and neat. This is definitely a thinking mans shooter, you will be fighting your surroundings as much as shooting guns. If you can stomach all the forced platforming and want more in your FPS than shooting hordes of bad guys this is the game for you.","timestamp_created":1431027979,"timestamp_updated":1431027979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560009300708770752","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15719120","author":{"steamid":"76561198017154045","num_games_owned":241,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":6787,"last_played":1660420151},"language":"english","review":"Just a classic valve game that everyone should play at least once.","timestamp_created":1430951887,"timestamp_updated":1430951887,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iaDYlc0CcK37Ow=="}
