The racial statements aren't sewn up in the end and seem like they are there more for a shock value.  (spoiler alert)* The ending makes no sense in terms of why he would end his life if there are infinite possibilities? So there is no way in all those \"stars\" that he can't make something better? He came from wounded knee and knows sacrifices but he gets rid of all that for a future he doesn't know is better or worse? His intention rips him away from his daughter to what? It doesn't make sense with his character. \nNow for the technical aspects most of the in game \"vendors\" take you out of the game because they just don't make sense. As well everyone just disappearing in the whole city? Where are the homes and parks or the rest of the \"utopia\" you never get to see? I just don't believe every white person is like \"Fuck it we're out of here\".  They were able to hide all of this by the female lead in your face all the time but the story really wasn't fleshed out and I am pretty sure a seasoned veteran and private eye would make most of the decisions the main character made. So in conclusion it's an okay ride but not even close to a good story that makes any real sense. Especially when you add a ghost.\n","timestamp_created":1414455037,"timestamp_updated":1414455037,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.44058459997177124","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12662152","author":{"steamid":"76561197975065585","num_games_owned":365,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1277,"last_played":1414887608},"language":"english","review":"\"Booker Catch.........\"\nWould recommend!","timestamp_created":1414449061,"timestamp_updated":1414449061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12662136","author":{"steamid":"76561198113635678","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":341,"last_played":1545391809},"language":"russian","review":"Игруха cool!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1414448969,"timestamp_updated":1414448969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12661960","author":{"steamid":"76561198061756163","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1866,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1321,"last_played":1477890996},"language":"english","review":"9/10 Would play again. (And I'm currently replaying the game right now.)\n\nThis game is not only stunningly beautiful but it's also well made and more than anything, a kind of standalone game compared to the first two Bioshocks. (Even thought playing or at least knowing some of the plot could be interesting in understanding the game.) You shouldn't expect something that will emotionally move you because you won't get that here. It's a full on FPS with a more than decent plotline to get you going. I must admit it gets quite confusing after a while and you might need to keep up with it.

После финальных титров осталось чувство разочарования. Ожидал больше.\nВ сущности перед нами тот же BioShock что и несколько лет назад. Оружия чувствуется так же, плазмиды немного изменены, но на картину в целом не сильно влияет. Подача сюжета осталась та же, т.е. в какой то момент игры заходим на территорию где появляется оппонент, который несёт чушь до свое гибели. Комнаты с волнами идущими врагов. Кто играл в первые две части ничего нового не увидят. И в целом такое бросание из одной сюжетной канавы в другую на любителя, мне не понравилось. \n \nЧто же заставляет проходить эту игру? Сюжет и сеттинг. Они впечатляют. Первые время просто ходишь и всё рассматриваешь. Не потому что какая то супер графика, она как раз то довольно средняя, а потому что интересно. Такого больше нигде не было и не факт что будет. Воздушный город, враги, разговоры на улице - всё ново и интересно. Сюжет так же не даёт заскучать развиваясь постепенно и не оставляя игрока на долгое время, играть реально интересно. \n\n К концу игры интерес ослабевает, к воздушному городу привыкаешь и приходит осознания что это просто декорации, игра всё равно проходит в помещениях. Перестрелки не очень интересны, типов врагов мало и т.д. Не то что бы это критично, но уже начинаешь ждать финала. На концовку я возлагал большие надежды, но вот здесь ждало главное разочарование. Создав такой необычный мир, необычных персонажей, соловья и скатится к такой банальщине (не буду спойлерить)...  Придумай разработчики что то более оригинально и запоминающееся, впечатления после прохождения игры были бы совсем другие.  \n\nИгру конечно же стоит пройти, своих денег она стоит (брал со скидкой). Много моментов которые запомнятся. Но это не идеал, как может показаться после многих отзывов и обзоров. Второй раз проходить я бы её не стал.\n\nОценка 8/10","timestamp_created":1414424370,"timestamp_updated":1414424370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12655335","author":{"steamid":"76561198034809673","num_games_owned":422,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":582,"last_played":1627231687},"language":"english","review":"The game is great, until the ending","timestamp_created":1414413065,"timestamp_updated":1414413065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12654040","author":{"steamid":"76561198044306947","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":589,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":589,"last_played":1414402869},"language":"german","review":"Kann persöhnlich, das Spiel nur weiterempfehlen. \nAbwechslungsreiches Gameplay mit den ein oder anderen Schreckseskunden.\nDas Ende fand ich um ehrlich zu sein, sehr unerwartet.\nDefinitiv sein Geld in allen Lagen wert.","timestamp_created":1414403259,"timestamp_updated":1414403259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534690141677856445","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12653778","author":{"steamid":"76561198005249451","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1163,"last_played":1414043134},"language":"english","review":"This is a great game, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys games with a story and some mystery.

It's one of my favorite games of last year. [/i]\n\nThe Bioshock games have been pretty well known across the entire gaming sphere, and doing a retro review now seems kind of redundant, because you've already likely bought the game, loved it, married it, and had a wonderful honeymoon, or you were incredibly dissappointed, left in the middle of the night and never gave it a call again, you [b]monster.[/b]\n\nBut for those of you who haven't bought it yet, you're missing out on one of the most interesting experiences of last year. Love it or hate it, it's definitely one of the more interesting games to talk about. The story is interesting, the environments are well designed. Whereas Rapture had you feeling alone and isolated against forces beyond your control, Infinite by contrast is now a swashbuckling adventure akin to the likes of Uncharted, where you play as Scruffy Mc Grufferson the Generic Handsome White Guy Seeking Redemption For His Dark And Tortured Past™ (I'm looking on getting the name shortened), aka Booker DeWitt, a man with neither books nor wits, to rescue a girl named Elizabeth from the Cloud City of Columbia.\n\nFrom there, things rapidly deteriorate when Booker is discovered to be the person prophesized by the Prophet to ruin everything, so the citizens of Columbia make it their sole duty to ruin everything first so that Booker doesn't get a chance.\n\nThe gameplay is competant, but unremarkable; Booker gets a standard suite of Steampunk weaponry, pistols, machine guns, shotguns, oh my, along with a suite of Vigors™, which are different from Plasmids™ in the sole way of that you drink them instead of injecting them. (Actually, the powers are more varied than Bioshock's; one of my favorite new additions was the one that let you shoot crows to viciously peck at enemies while I whack them with my ice cream scoop.)\n\nOne of the cooler gameplay features that help liven up the shooting aspects are the addition of rails that let you take to the skies and travel from place to place. Not only does this open up a new dimension in combat, but also makes exploration a joy as opposed to a chore.\n\nThe story is a little pretentious, but overall I liked it and thought it was quite interesting, even when it becomes a nigh-incomprehensible mess when alternate realities get introduced. It helps that Booker and Elizabeth are both strong characters, even though they're not terribly unique archetypes, they're still assembled with care and I do feel a sting of emotional attachment when tragedy befalls them.\n\n[b]To be honest, I have no idea whether you would like Bioshock Infinite or not. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason or common criticisms, but I do recommend it, and feel it's at least worth your time. It's well-crafted and beautifully designed.[/b]","timestamp_created":1414388188,"timestamp_updated":1414388188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12651673","author":{"steamid":"76561198123121102","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":521,"last_played":1639628267},"language":"english","review":"saw tits 10/10\n","timestamp_created":1414380079,"timestamp_updated":1414380079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513382017612457275","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12651384","author":{"steamid":"76561198010532705","num_games_owned":634,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1085,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1085,"last_played":1462942790},"language":"english","review":"A game that makes you yell \"WTF!\" in the best possible sense.\nIt's not perfect, but it's the closest I've ever seen in a long long time.\nEasily worth $5-10 if you can get it on sale.\n\nedit:\nBurial.\nAt.\nSea.\n\neasily worth the price of admission to roam throught the Rapture that Ryan envisioned.","timestamp_created":1414377612,"timestamp_updated":1486265324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12650156","author":{"steamid":"76561198119753534","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":861,"last_played":1640662949},"language":"english","review":"Great Atmosphere and keeps a very smooth-like feeling to the whole game, Highly Recommended\n\n11/10","timestamp_created":1414368525,"timestamp_updated":1414368525,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925311326980591","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12649048","author":{"steamid":"76561198045679742","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":832,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":790,"last_played":1414625598},"language":"english","review":"Excellent Story, dialogs, enemies and Gameplay.

Her AI is brilliant as she never once got in my way; on the contrary she's extremely helpful as she often throws you healing packs when you need them the most as well as ammo and money that she scrounges up while the two of you explore the environment. Her tears themselves can be life-savers and game-changers, especialy during the tougher sections of the campaign.\nYou need to have played Bioshock 1 to fully understand a number of the references and story tie-ins, especially in the DLCs (which you should get and play immediately after beating this game, they're that good). Also, one thing that I've always wanted to see were regular people going about their day-to-day business in the worlds of Rapture and you finally get to see that here in the seemingly utopic floating world of Columbia that harbours ugly thruths and realities. It makes the game feel that more immersive and is an absolute delight to behold as the NPCs talk, dance, exercise and more, beautifully animated and renderred the whole while. The same can be said of Burial At Sea Episode 1 as it occurs before the 'fall' of Rapture and you see its citizens going about their business in lush settings.\nFinally, if you hadn't already gotten the message (:P) I strongly suggest getting the Burial At Sea DLCs as they continue Elizabeth's story and will have you exclaiming in awe at the sheer scope and impact of the story that Irrational has lovingly created for us.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1414332092,"timestamp_updated":1417891672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12640473","author":{"steamid":"76561198087329490","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2174,"last_played":1630869423},"language":"greek","review":"I always play games for the story or the world they create.\nThis game delivered that feeling.","timestamp_created":1414325118,"timestamp_updated":1546710913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518072307109832764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12640100","author":{"steamid":"76561198056766084","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1227,"last_played":1414490847},"language":"english","review":"One of my new Favourites!","timestamp_created":1414323384,"timestamp_updated":1414323384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508203506469726563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12639937","author":{"steamid":"76561198029045704","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":2486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":611,"last_played":1603302691},"language":"russian","review":"[h1]Bioshock Infinite[/h1] - Это игра, в Которую хочеться играть из-за сюжета и Красивой графики! :D Наш Главный Герой Букер Дэвитт Который должен заплатить долг свой одной Барышней- [u]Элизабет[/u] .Он поподает туда на небеса типа \"Рая\"! ну и после чего через пару сотен локаций мы таки находим её(хорошо что хоть книжкой не ёбнула xD).

Its kinda steampunk underwater turn-of-the-century feel didn't really appeal to me and I eventually traded in the game.  However, this game - Bioshock Infinite - was one that I DID like.  A decent story (even if it got a bit weird at the end), and the gloom and murkiness of the predecessors was replaced by light and a generally happier feel.  Having completed the game, I'm tempted to play it again and try different weapons and tactics.  However, first I thought I'd give the DLC a try...\n\nBIG mistake.\n\nBurial At Sea Episodes One and Two may as well be add-ons for the original Bioshock games, which is NOT what I expect from DLC.  I expect a twist or extra levels to the game that you've just played.  (Which, to be fair is what you get with Clash In The Clouds, even if it's not all THAT great.)  However, Burial At Sea takes you back to very different world to that you experienced in Infinite - the world of Bioshock 1 and 2.  Add to that the meandering, constantly twisting storylines and (in Ep 2), the inability to melee kill an enemy unless they are unaware of you (?!?), the add-on content just sucks.  Burial At Sea is named after what should have been done with both those DLC Episodes - they should've been weighed down with lead and dropped into the Mariana Trench.\n\nAdded to that, the basic game plus the DLC takes up 44 GIGABYTES of HD space.  FORTY FOUR GIGS!!!  Yeah the game looks beautiful, but bloody hell, it's a hard-drive hogger.\n\nSo in summary, buy Bioshock Infinite - great game.  I really enjoyed it.

I promise you the storyline of this game is one of the best. If you don't own this game you are missing out on playing one of the all time greatest games ever developed.  The graphics are fantastic. The music is amazing. You get connected to lead characters early in the game and there are no slow sections or parts that are left open or confusing. When I played this game I thought it was going to be short. I kept thinking the end was near but the plot kept opening more doors and kept becoming more complex. Interactive media does not get better than this. This is a new standard for gaming. Yes there are a couple of small issues with the difficulty balance I played on hard and felt that should have been medium but I also felt this was a game that people who didnt like fps games could jump right in and enjoy so maybe thats a pro more than a con. I encontered 2 bugs the entire game one of which was a targeting issue (crow commanding) the other was a boss section (boss caught behind unopenable door) and thats it! I hope other developers can start creating games this polished because lately it seems like every AAA title is broken on delivery and its insulting. Bravo to the staff you nailed this one. I also believe there is some replayability on this title but maybe after a 6 month break when you've kind of forgotten the story a little bit similar to halflife2 ( I always go back to it). There are plenty of ways to defend and there are different paths you can take with your perks and weapons preferences.

The use of powers and weapons in combat was done really well, and the foes and antagonists are far more compelling here than in the original BioShock games.\n\nThe story gets a bit janky and heavy-handed at the very end.

Atmosferi, müzikleri, seslendirmeleri, çarpıcı karakterleri ve güzel replikleri ile dikkat çeken bir oyun. Ne zamandır arşivimde bulunmasına rağmen bu kadar geç başlamamın sebebi sadece birinci oyundu. Çünkü Rapture'ı o kadar sevdim ki Columbia'yı sevmemekten korktum açıkçası. Fakat Columbia beni fazlasıyla etkilemeyi başardı. Söylemem gereken bir şey var o da Infinite'in ilk oyundan daha iyi olmadığı. Çünkü ilk oyun o kadar sağlam ki sanırım başka hiç bir Bioshock oyununu ilki kadar sevemeyeceğim. Oyunun incelemesine geçecek olursam oyunun tamamının sağlam bir senaryo etrafına inşa edildiğini görüyoruz. Eğer Infinite bu kadar sağlam senaryoyla gelmesedi muhtemelen oyunda gördüğümüz hiç bir şeyin bir anlamı kalmayacaktı. Elizabeth o kadar güzel çizilmiş ki masmavi gözleriyle bakarken gülümsetmeyi başardı. İlk oyuna yapılan göndermeler de gayet güzeldi.

This game is on har game to put down and is amazing","timestamp_created":1413832730,"timestamp_updated":1413832730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12586676","author":{"steamid":"76561198072161986","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":796,"last_played":1414595800},"language":"english","review":":)","timestamp_created":1413831634,"timestamp_updated":1413831634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12586401","author":{"steamid":"76561198078633880","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1003,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":833,"last_played":1428151184},"language":"german","review":"Wirklich ein hamer geiles Speil !\n... also ein echter muss für Bioshock fans :D\nich würde es jeder zeit wieder kaufen und spielen !\n\nNachtrag vom 26.11.2016: Still good AF you have to buy it !","timestamp_created":1413830169,"timestamp_updated":1480158304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4moq2l8kCcdqBMA=="}
