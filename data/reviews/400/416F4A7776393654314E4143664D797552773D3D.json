Its maps are as well-designed as CS:GO, and the gameplay itself is far more interesting. You use your brain and your handy portal gun to complete levels, instead of just shooting and stabbing your way through them. The puzzles start off easy, and increase in difficulty at the perfect rate. They are hard enough to make me think, but not hard enough to make you look up a walkthrough on YouTube. The use of physics in the puzzles is extremely creative, such as when you need to use gravity alone to fly from the ground to a platform 100 meters up. The levels are very linear and you don't have a lot of choice like in a game such as [i]Dishonored[/i], but they are still the best-designed I've seen except for maybe [i]Portal 2[/i].\n\n[b]Story:[/b] 8/10\nI won't describe the story in detail so as to avoid spoiling it, but I will say that it is pretty much the only (relatively) weak link in the game. The plot is interesting and unusual, but doesn't have as much depth as it should. However, the way GLaDOS [spoiler]slowly changes from good to evil[/spoiler] is an excellent plot twist, and it's not bad, anyway. GLaDOS is extremely funny, and this has some of the best dialogue around, which is unusual for a game with two characters.\n\n[b]Combat:[/b] 10/10\nPortal has the most creative combat system I've ever seen in any game. Instead of firing a minigun at the turrets, you have to drop large blocks on their heads or let them fall through the ceiling. Test Chamber [spoiler]16[/spoiler] is the best level in my opinion, because of the way it lets you figure out combat on your own, instead of giving you quick-time events or hand-holding. The boss battle (and the room full of turrets before it) are sent at you with no warning, and you have to use logic along with what you learned earlier in the game to win. It usually takes a few tries, though.\n\n[b]Puzzles:[/b] 10/10\nThe extreme detail in the puzzles is what makes the game so captivating. Instead of running and doing parkour, you have to send lasers through portals, avoid fireballs and hit detectors with them, drop your friend the Companion Cube into an incinerator, and other creatively designed tasks. The puzzle design is much simpler than Portal 2, but somehow being less complicated makes it more interesting. The gels in Portal 2 are a great addition, but I enjoyed Portal's puzzles more.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b] 9/10\nI understand that this game is from 2007, but as I'm writing this in 2015, I will say that the graphics are good, but not great. Portal 2's [i]graphics[/i] are definitely better, but I like the Emancipation Grids and general aesthetic of Portal 1 better.\n\n[b]Length:[/b]\nUnfortunately, this game is fairly short. I took it at a slow pace my first time, and it took me around 4 hours. The next time I played it I was much quicker. However, this means it never drags or becomes boring, like in the later levels of Portal 2, which is more than twice as long. Every minute of it is enjoyable, and\n\n[b]Overall:[/b]\nPortal is a truly amazing puzzle game with excellent gameplay, combat, puzzles, and visuals. Its writing is also brilliant and hilarious. The weakest part is the story, but even that is above average, considering the huge number of boring shooters around now, in which the story comes second to gore and violence. Portal can count itself as one of the best games ever, and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who doesn't get frustrated after replaying a section of a level 3 times.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+ Incredible level design\n+ Creative gameplay\n+ Entertaining and fun combat\n+ Funny dialogue\n+ Good graphics\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Slightly weak story\n- Short\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 9.5 out of 10.","timestamp_created":1446731791,"timestamp_updated":1446731840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18886414","author":{"steamid":"76561197978415198","num_games_owned":524,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1446702778},"language":"english","review":"The cake is in fact not a lie.","timestamp_created":1446703034,"timestamp_updated":1446703034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18886306","author":{"steamid":"76561198201820736","num_games_owned":1009,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":157,"last_played":1435467097},"language":"english","review":"One of the, if not the, greatest puzzle games ever.

Also features sarcastic AI narration that guides you through the test chambers and makes comments on your progress.\n\nThis is a very short game. (There are only nineteen test chambers, and the first twelve are really just a tutorial and training for the final more difficult ones.) Despite the game being so short, there are plenty of challenges. After completing the game all the way through twice, I was feeling pretty good about my performance. Then I tried the Advanced Test Chambers. At first, I performed depressing badly. After playing through nearly all of the the Advanced Test Chambers, I was once again feeling pretty good about my performance. Then I tried the Challenges. I performed depressing badly, unable to obtain even bronze medals for most of them.

Portal 1 originally came with the Orange Box, bundled as a side-attraction to Half-Life 2 and Team Fortess 2, has turned into a franchise all of it's own since then and this is the game that started it.\n\nA relatively short experience, Portal 1 leaves a bit to be desired, but certainly still delivers.  You can probably beat the game much quicker than you expect, but some puzzles are certainly challenging and the humor the game presents is some of the best I have ever experienced.  The graphic/art-style is amazing and really matches the overall theme of the game.  With tons of puzzling fun and a humorous story, this game was certainly something to be remembered.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who managed to play the second one first, or anyone who is interested in puzzle games, as this is certain to at least provide you with a little bit of a challenge.","timestamp_created":1446047276,"timestamp_updated":1446047276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18727302","author":{"steamid":"76561198240251772","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":601,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1558810939},"language":"spanish","review":"Portal es un juego en primera persona que desafia las leyes de la fisica para darnos un titulo muy bueno y entretenido el cual tendremos que ir resolviendo los distintos problemas hasta llegar a la ''cake'' deseada. recomiendo tanto este como la segunda entrega.","timestamp_created":1446043451,"timestamp_updated":1446043451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18726571","author":{"steamid":"76561198123344817","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":121,"last_played":1436306060},"language":"spanish","review":"Juego con una durabilidad cortita pero entretenida gracias a los puzles de este juego.\nSiendo el primero.","timestamp_created":1446039902,"timestamp_updated":1446039902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18724167","author":{"steamid":"76561197966473494","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":114,"last_played":1626319049},"language":"english","review":"I beat it in 42 minutes. \n\nGlitchers can do it in 5. \n\nwhat's your time?","timestamp_created":1446025576,"timestamp_updated":1446025576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18721827","author":{"steamid":"76561198035718230","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1544505442},"language":"english","review":"cool as a pool and it makes me drool","timestamp_created":1446005308,"timestamp_updated":1446005308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18720249","author":{"steamid":"76561198202370985","num_games_owned":718,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":715,"last_played":1445994077},"language":"english","review":"One of the best puzzle/adventure games made!
