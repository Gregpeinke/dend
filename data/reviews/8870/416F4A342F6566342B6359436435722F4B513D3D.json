Truthfully I don't think it is entirely necessary to play the games in order, as Bioshock Inifinite is a sort of prequel to the other two games. \n\nThat being said, Bioshock Infinite was one of those games that I could hardly put down. The compelling story paired with the versatility of the combat (weapons, vigors, melee) kept me playing for many hours. In fact, the ways you could go about fighting were so diverse that I'm playing through again with a completely different approach (I'm typically a \"play-it-safe\" shoot them from far away player but this time I'm trying to use mainly vigors and close combat).\n\nAll in all I would say Bioshock Infinite is definitely worth the price, and deserves at least one full play through.","timestamp_created":1404407250,"timestamp_updated":1404407250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11052769","author":{"steamid":"76561198069784284","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":525,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":494,"last_played":1404992357},"language":"russian","review":"беритеееееееее","timestamp_created":1404406744,"timestamp_updated":1404406744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11051983","author":{"steamid":"76561198009407425","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1265,"last_played":1404403667},"language":"english","review":"I had a ton of fun going through this game and would recommend it to any friend.

I exclusively loved Elizabeth as a character, like everyone else I would think, and other main characters were so unique but also very real at the same time. Boldness and the comic relief aspect of Booker DeWitt made him seem like a protective father-like figure which I really enjoyed.\n+ Symbolism and reflecting the real world. It was great. I adore the America's Golden Age and the paradise theme.\n+ Combat felt really satisfying. Aiming was really easy and spot-on shots felt like they had somewhat of an effect.\n+ Great visuals and collectibles. Columbia looks really amazing. There is so much to see, to look at and to search for. I thougth I turned every rock in the game but in the end I was proven otherwise.\n+ The Bioshock story twist!\n\n+/- The story. (There is a Bioshock twist! Don't worry.) This was a major turn off for me. I'd say the story till there's 2/6 of the game left was 10/10 but after that it started to be really off-putting. The game started have the usual eerie Bioshock tone to it, which as itself is not bad at all, they went way too much overboard with it. I don't want to spoil anything but my point is that I did not dislike the endgame because I did not understand it, because I very well did and I saw it from the begining. I believe that the majority wont expect that twist though. It strikes when you the least would expect it.\n\n- The voice recordings do not have subtitles! How could they have done this to all of the foreign fans? You can see the text and listen to the recording in the in-game meny though but it's really annoying. Would it have been just too much work to implement subtitles?\n- The ending. I hated it so, oh so, much! I does not mean you would though! Just an opinion of mine. I won't say anything about it really but I say I would have prefered it if it was toned towards the other extreme.\n- Getting stuck. I got stuck a lot trying to sprint and jump around. Also the toggle sprint mechanic was a bit annoying.\n- Only Autosaving?! Like what! Are you freaking kidding me? If I exit the game and you warn me that if I leave I lose unsaved progress then let me F--- save! That mean no quicksaves also.\n- It was really easy. I played the game through on Hard (the hardest difficulty) for the first time and had absolutely no problems. There was a bit challenge though and in some parts the game was just unfair because it was able to.\n- Boring plasmids/vigors. I barely used them at all, mostly because I did well without them and there was not enough money to upgrade them all.\n- Weapon upgrades had no visual effects, at least I saw none.\n\nI would rate this game 2.5 lawn mower tires out of 8 Aaron Paul's toe nails.\nWhich basically means a bit generous 8.25 / 10","timestamp_created":1404390634,"timestamp_updated":1404398570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11048443","author":{"steamid":"76561198062274159","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":395,"last_played":1404358931},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock infinite is a very well crafted game with a great storyline, visuals, world, combat (Standard FPS mechanics mixed with vigours[magic] and a helping hand from your companion. Nothing really stands out other than being very smooth and balanced) and overall a solid game produced by the guys over at Irrational (shut down at the writing of this review). However, this game only really lends itself to a single playthrough. Bioshock infinite provides no elements of consequential choices, which is ironic considering the nature of the story, and as a result presents a very linear journey which therefore provides no motivation for players to jump back into the world of Columbia. If you are a fan of the previous Bioshock games, this may irritate and turn you off from the game. That being said, the plot ties in nicely with other Bioshock games especially with the first (assuming ofcourse you buy the burial at sea DLC) which I think should be the incentive to purchase Bioshock Infinite.\nOverall, Bioshock is a very well rounded FPS with a fantastic, yet disturbing world and story to back it up.

I'll be back later with more details till then 8/10 worth it's weight.\n\nEdit: Alright Review v2.\n\nI've now made some interesting progress but have to admit to a bit of a sin now xD this game has made me stay up till 5am in the middle of the working week! with this achievement done story is rated at, at least 8-9/10.\n\nGame play: Usual RPG FPS good at most parts, something that does spice it up a bit is the \"tear\", where you ask Elizabeth to pull an object/open a hole in the TimeSpace etc. Now I'm going to spare the theories behind all that but the concept and usage seem to have been implemented well :).\n\nRating 8/10.\n\nEDIT: Review v.3 final endgame.\n\nRight so before we get started I got something to admit. I came into this game thinking the with a bit of a snooze of this type of combat so normal difficulty caused me to miss the defence a bit in the final battle. That said.\n\nLe Usuals: \nGame play good very interactive, bit buggy on getting that bird to target sometimes with keyboard and mouse, attempted with controller similar issues. \nGFX: Bit bright at times but I guess that is the effect, setup on first run well worth it. \nStory:........\nRight so for le kiddies I gotta kinda star some of this out but lets give a moment just to say thank you Irrational Games! Right now... excuse my less intellegent version... It was a rightous skullf**k. I won't go into detail as that would absolutely destroy the point of experiencing it but wow thinking it over a few times really gives me the chills :) at the same time completely destructive effect.

[/b]\n  [i] Я помню, как казалось бы в далеком 2007 году, вышла первая часть серии Bioshock. Эта игра просто затянула меня в подводный мир, в город Восторг. Bioshock I был, и я уверен, остается для многих лучшей игрой в жанре FPS (шутер от первого лица), давайте разберем BioShock Infinite, смогла ли эта часть серии увлечь меня, как смогла это сделать первая часть.[/i]\n\n   Для начала затронем самое главное в этой игре - сюжет. И я скажу, ничуть не преувеличивая, что это, пожалуй, один из лучших сюжетов что есть в игровой индустрии. Невероятно интересный сюжет повествующий о Букере ДеВитте вместе с шикарным сценарием возможно заставят Вас пройти игру не один раз. И дабы избежать спойлеров, я больше ничего о сюжете не расскажу.\n   Стоит рассказать о месте действия игры городе Колумбии. Этим парящим в небесах городом можно любоваться вечно. Он невероятно красив, потрясающий дизайн локаций не надоедает, город вместе его жителями кажется живым и беззаботным.     Путешествуя по нему вам точно не покажется что локаций очень мало. \n   Про графику, я думаю, не стоит говорить так как все можно увидеть своими глазами...\n   Переходим к геймплею. С первой части он потерпел изменения, но не сильно. Появилось та вещь которая в некоторых местах меняет геймплей кардинально, эта вещь - аэрорельсы. Они добавили новые элементы геймплея в сравнении со старыми частями. Аэрорельсы позволяют вам посмотреть на место битвы с высока и по возможности спрыгнуть на кого нибудь тем самым ударив его, нанеся довольно сильный урон. Плазмиды заменили солями, и да они довольно разнообразны. Добавили напарника, вернее сказать напарницу. Элизабет будет не просто радовать вам глаз, но и помогать на поле битвы, подбрасывая вам полезные вещи, к примеру патроны или соли. Так же Элизабет может открывать порталы, тем самым она может перенести крюк за который можно зацепится или аптечки. Но там где есть плюсы, есть и минусы. \n   Единственным минусом для меня оказался довольно однообразный геймплей. Да в нем есть свои фишки, но все же, ближе к концу игры мне стала надоедать обычная стрельба по мишеням.\n\n[b] Вывод: несмотря на тот минус, о котором говорилось выше, это достойная игра.

Your immersion only deepens upon hearing the game's soundtrack, the wonderful voice acting and the lively and interactive enrionment that surrounds you. \n\nThe immersion sits the player down, orientates and plunges them into an incredibly rich story that discusse an alternate realm of 20th century America, in which post-moderinism has sky-rocketed however the scientific marvels are under the control of \"the Prophet\", who preaches a religion very similar to Christianity. Through his dominion over Columbia he his created corruption in the city and a severe class division, also, he keeps his daughter locked away in a tower that overlooks the city. As Booker Dewitt, you are tasked to rescue the girl from the tower and return her to New York to pay your debts. \n\nHowever, the story goes above and beyond your original plans and transform into a materfully crafted journey into self-discovery and the liberation of a religously/poltically opressed city. What makes this story so rich and immersive is it's use of  quantam physics' String Theory, as a key plot structure. String Theory explores the fundamental forces in the world, the consquences of hidden dimensions, number of dimensions and the supersymmetry between dimensions. Needless to say the context, the plot, the graphics, the themes, and the gameplay will leave you breathless.\n\nThe Burial At Sea DLC is also incredible. \n","timestamp_created":1404307157,"timestamp_updated":1404307157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11018627","author":{"steamid":"76561198036311336","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":3162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2870,"last_played":1533616640},"language":"spanish","review":"Ken levine y su equipo de Irrational Games nos ofrecen la tercera entrega de su obra Bioshock. En esta ocasión llamada Infinite.\n\nPara empezar y como siempre en nuestros análisis comenzaremos por centrarnos en el aspecto técnico del juego referido lógicamente a la versión de PC del mismo. \nEl cual debemos decir que es fantástico, aunque en honor a la verdad, tenemos que puntualizar que ha pasado un año completo desde su puesta a la venta hasta el momento de este análisis. Dicho esto, el juego presenta una gran estabilidad en su rendimiento, incluso en sus configuraciones más altas y aprovechando con acertada eficiencia los recursos de nuestro equipo. También dispone e las tradicionales opciones de configuración para personalizar la calidad visual en función de nuestro equipo, sin nada más que decir salvo volver a recalcar el buen sabor de boca del aspecto técnico, pasamos a debatir otros aspectos.\n\nNada más comenzar la aventura nos daremos cuenta de uno de los puntos fuertes del título, la impresionante ambientación y nivel artístico que posee. No podemos dejar pasar este punto sin pararnos a comentar la fascinante localización y el diseño tan absolutamente creativo de Infinite. Y es que será un deleite ver la profundidad e inmersión conseguida en Columbia, ciudad donde se desarrolla la trama, y el sublime nivel artístico. Fantásticas recreaciones, acontecimientos,  converdaciones, eventos y demás sucesos que presenciaremos a lo largo de la historia.\n\nPasamos ahora al que supone el verdadero fundamento del juego, su historia. La cual es espectacular, creativa, profunda y sorprendente. La cual es digna de las mejores películas del mundo cinematográfico, y que nos guardará algunas sorpresas y giros una vez que avancemos en ella.\nSin entrar en detalles ni spoilers para no estropear nada, a modo de introducción diremos que encarnaremos la Piel de Booker DeWitt, un detective privado que recibe el encargo de traer de vuelta a una joven muchacha, prisionera en una ciudad flotante bajo el mando de un \"profeta\" con ideales autoritarios y algo racistas.\n\nElisabeth - Este es el nombre de la co-protagonista del título, la cual tendrá una importancia capital en la historia, girando en muchas de sus partes en torno a ella.\nNo podemos olvidar el enorme detalle y belleza a todoslos niveles de Elisabeth. Llenando con su encanto, inocencia y simpatía llena de matices nuestra aventura. Enriqueciendola y dotandola de variedad y riqueza. Una inmejorable compañera de aventuras, dotada de una inteligencia artificial digna de elogio.\n\nEn otro orden cabe destacar el magnífico aspecto y nivel sonoro de B.Infinite. Las numerosas conversaciones y diálogos tanto entre protagonistas principales como secundarios, los pensamientos del protagonista, los voxafonos.. todo con un nivel de detalle exquisito.\n\nEs cierto que el juego tiene una duración estándar, nos ha llevado unas 15 horas completarlo, parandonos con detenimiento a recoger casi por completo las mejoras y coleccionables desperdigados a lo largo de la aventura. Y si bien quizás se eche en falta algún toque que le aporte algo de rejugabilidad, es un juego 100% recomendable y que no se debe caer en el error de catalogarlo como shooter, ya que es mucho más que eso. Sin duda lo volverás a disfrutar si eres un apasionado de una buena historia, con un mejor argumento y un final superior aún.\n\nNo podemos concluir el análisis sin recomendar fervientemente y sin asomo de duda el título  a todo aquel interesado en el.\nToda una obra de arte hecha videojuego y que supone el broche de oro de la aportación de ken levine a la saga Bioshock.","timestamp_created":1404302728,"timestamp_updated":1404302728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510022282600402832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11018076","author":{"steamid":"76561198053472936","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1307,"last_played":1473999176},"language":"koreana","review":"GOOD~!","timestamp_created":1404300187,"timestamp_updated":1404300187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11017499","author":{"steamid":"76561198007808559","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":815,"last_played":1436563674},"language":"german","review":"Top Spiel, echt gut!","timestamp_created":1404297546,"timestamp_updated":1404297546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11017461","author":{"steamid":"76561198017813322","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":797,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":733,"last_played":1433076634},"language":"english","review":"Mind Blowing!!","timestamp_created":1404297322,"timestamp_updated":1404297322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11016887","author":{"steamid":"76561198002243641","num_games_owned":1140,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1575,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1575,"last_played":1404925445},"language":"german","review":"Was für eine sagenhafte Geschichte dieses Spiel erzählt...

Buy it. Buy it. The story is phenomenal and doesn't play around. It expects that you know how to play a FPS, and streamlines through the easy details. Combat is progressive and becomes more difficult through time (as it should, but there has been a lack of that in the gaming industry lately). Plot, plot, and more plot is the biggest pro, although the beginning may drag a little. The artistry is life-changing, and with a high-level graphics card it will shine (not literally). Character customization also had a small presence but was still there with mostly a perk-based system.\n\nCons: The game feels cut short and you want more at the very end, which is bad for me but maybe not for others. The guns became a little bleak at the end because you use the same guns throughout the whole game. It also was constantly wanting me to use a shotgun or an RPG, which is not my style at all. As the game progressively became harder, it was partly because enemies just came in thicker waves. There were some legitamate jumps in enemy difficulty, though, just not that many. Also, don't believe the arrow that points you toward your next objective. Most of the time it is accurate, but it glitched twice on me while going through the game. This forced me to waste probably 20 minutes total of gameplay because I became completely flipped backwards. \n\nOverall: Between the arrow malfucntion and the time I spent with the game idled so I could do other things quickly (the game works on an autosave system), I added probably 2 and a half hours to my total play time. So the game came in somewhere between 8 and 9 hours (this can definitely vary depending on the type of gamer). It may be short, but BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT. GIVE UP YOUR MONEY AND PLAY THIS MASTERPIECE OF A GAME.","timestamp_created":1404267296,"timestamp_updated":1404267296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11011965","author":{"steamid":"76561198097310340","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1625,"last_played":1598885356},"language":"english","review":"fantastic but short game","timestamp_created":1404266977,"timestamp_updated":1404266977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11011822","author":{"steamid":"76561198042626974","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":766,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":720,"last_played":1417027459},"language":"english","review":"Truly mind-blowing.

I'd like to remind you that the original Bioshock had the chemical thrower which could electrocute people, a grenade launcher that could lay mines and a crossbow that could set tripwire traps. Meanwhile Bioshock Infinite has Shotgun and Bigger Shotgun and no alternative ammo types.\n\nThere's a reason I went for the combat mechanics first, because that's all Bioshock Infinite really is. It's a shooting gallery. There's no puzzles, no choice, no consequence, no economy that affects how you play.
