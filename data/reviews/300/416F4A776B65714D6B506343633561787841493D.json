It would be cool to see a new entry in this series at some point but if that ever happens, there will always be Day of Infamy instead.\n\nIt's worth noting that this game does still have an active community, if you're wondering. That's the main reason I'm still recommending it. It's a fairly small community, but you won't struggle to find active servers with a number of players on them. Definitely worth checking out if you already have the game, and if you want to experience it yourself I'd probably recommend just getting the game on sale - you probably won't be playing it a lot.\n\nOf course, the other reason to get this game is for Garry's Mod content.

While obviously not especially good-looking nowadays, for its time it's presentation and audio design were top notch. As in the original Day of Defeat the gameplay is quite punishing and sticking your head out of cover for more than a split second is a sure fire way to get it blown off. While the learning curve in adjusting to the gameplay's punishing qualities may put some players off, for others it adds an extra layer of challenge to a multiplayer selection that is often stagnant with health-regenerating Call of Duty clones. In my opinion, however, the grenades are somewhat overpowered and I have spent many death cycles wondering how the small, barely-visible metal cylinder thrown from halfway across the map 20 seconds ago possibly managed to kill me. Nevertheless, I greatly enjoy this game as a relaxing way to waste some time with some good old-fashioned WW2 shooter action.","timestamp_created":1611767251,"timestamp_updated":1611767251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85425015","author":{"steamid":"76561198343050780","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":3138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2719,"last_played":1658168165},"language":"english","review":"its fun i know my review is helpful","timestamp_created":1611730737,"timestamp_updated":1611730769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.712951481342315674","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85415597","author":{"steamid":"76561198088637877","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":937,"last_played":1644875603},"language":"english","review":"possibly, The best WW2 game Created","timestamp_created":1611713645,"timestamp_updated":1611713645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85408182","author":{"steamid":"76561197996309178","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11708,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11647,"last_played":1658461855},"language":"english","review":"Bullets...
