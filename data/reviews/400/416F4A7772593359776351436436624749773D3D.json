It does take time to get used of its hard to figure out the games purpese but you get so addicted that 1 hour feels like 1 minute.

I had a good time with portal and I hope you will to . If you hate most games that are hard to play this is a terrible game for you.

Like Half-Life, Portal really just throws you right into the game with really no expaination of what's going on, and at first I was like alright, I've seen gameplay, I know what to expect in the way of brain teasers and what not, but what I wasn't expecting was that there was a story shoved into this 3 to 4 hour game, and it just added to the already great experience of what is Portal.\n\nIt's innovative, beautiful, and just all around fun if you wanna give your mind a challenge and the game is just a great example of how cool the Source engine can be. It's definitely recommended if you love any of Valve's other games, it just has that same charm as Half-Life, L4D, and TF, and the splashes of humor in the game really make it even more enjoyable.\n\nEven though it's short it's still got the replayability value to it and I'll be sure to check out the advanced stages and trying to unlock the developer commentary and get to Portal 2 soon!","timestamp_created":1394999055,"timestamp_updated":1394999055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9502621","author":{"steamid":"76561197977503134","num_games_owned":768,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1797,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1797,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"A must play for any gamer.","timestamp_created":1394988464,"timestamp_updated":1394988464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9501586","author":{"steamid":"76561198125054804","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":931,"last_played":1585714469},"language":"english","review":"fun","timestamp_created":1394983352,"timestamp_updated":1394983352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9501455","author":{"steamid":"76561198025696476","num_games_owned":301,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":151,"last_played":1439997932},"language":"brazilian","review":"Impressionante, belo e divertido são adjetivos comuns para bons jogos. No caso de \"Portal\", só isso não é suficiente. \"Genial\" seria a palavra certa para qualificá-lo. É um título que deixará qualquer um boquiaberto, tamanha a complexidade de sua mecânica e quebra-cabeças. O nível de desafio é alto, mas basta botar a cabeça para funcionar para que se chegue a uma solução - o que é altamente gratificante. A atmosfera claustrofóbica e perturbadora, por mais sutil que seja, fará você se sentir ameaçado, sendo que nem inimigos há no jogo.

I've beaten this game countless times, it really is one of my favorite games, I probably like it just as much as Portal 2, the game that a lot of people I know like better than the original.\n\nWhere do I start. This game is still as good as it was 7 years ago (Wow! It's been that long). The Graphics are a 10/10 they still look amazing today. For the few songs that play in the game, they fit in perfectly and help you immerse yourself, 10/10. When I first saw this game I was skeptical if I would be fast enough to place Portals, don't worry though, this game is easy to get into and there is basically no learning curve, although ths doesn't mean it is an easy game, I remember a few chambers taking me about an hour the first time I played it, although they were still enjoyable while trying to find out what to do. Gameplay gets a 10/10. The story, what story. The presentation is good, everything feels connected. The envirnments aren't anything too fancy to look at, with some bland textures, but I'm pretty sure this was done on purpose to ad to the feel that you are in a testing lab, it isn't supposed to look fancy. Presentation gets a 8/10.\n\nUsually this would average in for a clean 9.5, but this game is so fabtastic, I think I'll just give it a 10/10.\n\nGreat game, I higly recommend any person that has a Steam account to buy this.\n\nTo put it into simpler terms, if this game was a potato, it would be a very good potato.","timestamp_created":1394839429,"timestamp_updated":1394839473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9471367","author":{"steamid":"76561198095836442","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1388,"last_played":1603318115},"language":"english","review":"puzzels GLaDOs companian cubes best Valve game yet (that i'v played)","timestamp_created":1394837265,"timestamp_updated":1394837265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9469878","author":{"steamid":"76561198091249708","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1601419757},"language":"english","review":"Portal is a game where you shoot portals\nawesome game, everyone should play it, best game ever.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1394828441,"timestamp_updated":1394828441,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9468140","author":{"steamid":"76561198125398636","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":430,"last_played":1408788106},"language":"english","review":"An amazing game with good graphics for a game made over 3 years ago.

A tech demo stocking stuffer only, but as a full price game? No, not really. That means it is short, and unrefined. It fails to last long enough to even contemplate having complicated, or challenging puzzles. \n\nEven the time the game does stick with you, it fails to impress on many levels. Many of the puzzle mechanics, or solutions are simple, or just plain annoying. For example, the energy ball. Does anybody really like that timed-only-a-few-bounces ball, that never seems to connect with the target, nor do it within a respectable amount of time. Is it unique? Ya sure, the game is fairly unique, but a bent fork is unique too, does not make it any good. \n\nIs there good things about the game? Yes. The music is rather good, as everyone can probably agree. As well, the game can run on any dinosaur system you can imagine, probably DOS systems as well. The game does not overstay its welcome as well. It at least has the brevity to end quickly so you do not have listen to the inane jokes, or fiddle with its rather annoying puzzle mechanics.\n\nAnd lastly, the pandering of this game as the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, and the reiteration of the phrase \"the cake is a lie\" has made the games community, and fans insufferable. This only makes playing the game even more painful, because you know that saying anything bad will come with backlash.","timestamp_created":1393900005,"timestamp_updated":1393900005,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4143962562084198","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9331590","author":{"steamid":"76561197992614420","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":81,"last_played":1567295280},"language":"english","review":"Awesomez","timestamp_created":1393863695,"timestamp_updated":1393863695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9331261","author":{"steamid":"76561197988465588","num_games_owned":277,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1394290711},"language":"english","review":"The game blew my mind like no other game could ever.","timestamp_created":1393861540,"timestamp_updated":1393861540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9330184","author":{"steamid":"76561198045232293","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":375,"last_played":1386473573},"language":"english","review":"A puzzle game that can be finished in 5-10 hours.
