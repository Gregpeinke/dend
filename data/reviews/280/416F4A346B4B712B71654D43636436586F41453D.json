Każdy szanujący się gracz, zwłaszcza jeżeli preferuje tego typu gatunek, musi przynajmniej raz zagrać w tę grę.\n\nGordon Freeman, doktor fizyki teoretycznej, pracownik tajnego kompleksu badawczego Black Mesa, uczestniczył w feralnym teście w komorze testowej C-33/a. Niestety eksperyment szybko wymknął się spod kontroli, a do samego kompleksu przedostali się obcy z innego wymiaru, którzy wymordowali większość personelu. Sprawy nie ułatwia rząd, który wysłał wojskowe jednostki specjalne do ''wytuszenia'' całej sprawy, które koniec końców, zabijają pozostałych przy życiu naukowców. Freeman, początkowo uzbrojony jedynie w łom i w kombinezon ochronny próbuje wydostać się z ośrodka.\n\nHalf Life w wersji Source jest to nic innego jak remaster podstawowej wersji gry na silniku GoldSrc, mówiąc krótko zastąpiono silnik gry tym nowszym. Czy wyszło to grze na dobre? Tak i nie. Główną, a raczej jedyną zmianą w Source jest grafika oraz modele postaci. Brzmi to dobrze i szczerze mówiąc, nie ma się tutaj do czego przyczepić.\n\nJedyną bolączką tej wersji gry są BUGI. Dużo osób wypowiadało się na ten temat i przykładów bugów było mnóstwo, lecz mi osobiście przytrafił się tylko jeden bug, który uniemożliwiał popchnięcie fabuły naprzód ( Sprawdzone na YT czy to naprawdę bug, a nie pominięcie czegoś, niestety sporo osób niesłusznie posądza niektóre rzeczy, a często jest to tylko nieznajomość gry i zwykłe niedopatrzenie ). Mianowicie w pierwszych rozdziałach znajdowała się kałuża wody pod napięciem, gdyż jakieś kable się uszkodziły i po prostu do niej wpadły, po wyłączeniu generatora prądu, napięcie nie zniknęło/nie ustało i zostałem w kropce, gdyż nie było innej możliwości przekroczenia jej, jedynym rozwiązaniem zostało wpisanie kodu na przenikanie ścian i ominięcie lokacji. \n\nMówiąc krótko - bugi występują, lecz nie zawsze, a jeżeli już są, to prawie zawsze są do ominięcia poprzez konsolę, więc nie powinno to za bardzo wpływać na samą rozrywkę oraz na odbiór gry. Half Life ukończyłem dobrze się bawiąc i jestem zadowolony z gry.\n\nGra sama w sobie jest świetna, niepowtarzalna i wyjątkowa. Wciągająca fabuła oraz ciekawe i specyficzne wprowadzenie w świat gry jest jak najbardziej na plus, do tego dochodzi mnóstwo klimatycznych i różniących się od siebie lokacji, przyjemny system strzelania, różnorodność przeciwników od ludzi aż po mutanty oraz spory arsenał broni. Cudo.\n\nPodsumowując, jeżeli ktoś chce uniknąć nieprzyjemnej sytuacji kosztem lekkiego spadku jakości, to zawsze może kupić podstawową wersję gry, nie różni się ona od tej prawie wcale, a pozwala na zanurzenie się w fabule tajemniczego kompleksu Black Mesa oraz na poznanie historii samego głównego bohatera w tym samym stopniu.","timestamp_created":1529063801,"timestamp_updated":1530341694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540069699287414551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42733172","author":{"steamid":"76561198040561757","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":342,"last_played":1529030067},"language":"english","review":"It's the original Half-Life but with a slightly different look and feel to it.

The graphics have been spruced up a bit, and this version has some half life 2 sound effects. Some don't quite sound right, like how in black mesa inbound it uses the wooden door opening sound for a metal door closing, but that isn't too big of a deal. The part that really gets me is the issues i've encountered. Residue processing did this thing where surfaces would clip through and take up the entire screen, making it impossible to see. It got so bad I nearly had to use no-clip. And I had a glitch in surface tensions during the helicopter battle. When you use the rpg, half the time the rockets just go straight through the helicopter. I have had more issues playing the source version of half life. I highly recommend playing the goldsource version, because I had no problems on that. This version to me is a trade in, you get a better looking half life but the bugs are more annoying. If you want a good half life game, don't get the source version. If you want a half life that has good graphics, get black mesa and wait for them to finish Xen. If I were you, I wouldn't bother with this version. I love half life, but this version of it was so buggy that it was nearly impossible to play at times. I also had issues on the Nihilanth chapter as well, with Vortigaunts spawning as I enter the portals, and the Nihilanth would attack me right when I spawn back in. It was annoying, and took me ages to beat it. Half life is a good game, and it deserves to be played with no bugs. I'm not saying you will for sure get the bugs I got, but in my experience the original half life is better.

I will explain why I did this further on in the review.\n\nI'm not an FPS guy. I think that should be obvious from my abysmal track record in TF2 and my games library both in and out of Steam consisting mostly of platformers, action games, and rhythm games, so it's no surprise I had a lot of trouble with this classic. The first, survival-horror esque chunk of the game is absolutely fantastic. Those first few chapters have just the right mix of environment, exploration, minimal combat, horror, and puzzle elements. However, it's when you first encounter human enemies that my enjoyment of this game takes a friggin nosedive.\n\nOut of seemingly nowhere, the difficulty goes from puzzle based, strategic challenges to shooty bang bang grandfather of CoD stuff. Sure, there are still puzzles and exploration, but the absolute overload of combat just turns me off. This is the second time I've played this game with the intention of getting through it, the first time ending shortly before Forget About Freeman. I understand that this is partially due to my personal taste, but I could not stand the combat in this game beyond the first bunch of chapters.\n\nHowever, that's not to say this is a bad game. Upon switching on godmode, my enjoyment skyrocketed. The game went from being a stressful sneak around and conserve health & ammo game to a YEAAAAAH I GOT A GUN AND A CROWBAR, EAT SHIT, DICKLORDS game. No matter how long I kept godmode on, encountering powerful enemies and just walking through their bullets and beating them to death with my crowbar remained an awesome power trip all throughout. \n\nThe ambience and story I thought were pretty good. The twist that the gubment men aren't there to help you, but instead to uh, clean up the situation, was a nice one that, although cliched, I feel added to the overall feeling of being trapped and hunted, not only by alien species, but also by your own fellow man. The whole game has a real End of Evangelion feel to it in tone. \n\nAlthough the spike in difficulty was far too much for me, I would still highly reccomend this or the original Half Life. Both are spectacular showcases of atmospheric storytelling, and have such a wide variety of weapons that I've no doubt that shooter fans will go nuts. If you haven't played Half Life yet, go, fuckin, god what are you doing with your life it's like 5 bucks and 99 cents during sales fuck dude just get it.","timestamp_created":1526437742,"timestamp_updated":1526437742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42037388","author":{"steamid":"76561198094814500","num_games_owned":367,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":1197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1161,"last_played":1490377875},"language":"english","review":"Just buy Half-Life 1\n\nDon't play this buggy piece of garbage.","timestamp_created":1526314858,"timestamp_updated":1526314858,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462486356496810913","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42005418","author":{"steamid":"76561198060628779","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":92,"playtime_forever":457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1584033305},"language":"english","review":"Pros:\n[list]\n[*]Nice Gameplay\n[*]Mod Support\n[/list]\n\nNormies:\n[list]\n[*]Bad graphics, extremely difficult to play,\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1526159376,"timestamp_updated":1530891049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514345288276672363","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42002179","author":{"steamid":"76561198814971326","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":59,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59,"last_played":1525589483},"language":"english","review":"Get this if you got half life 1 but don't get it just to play half life 1 right off the bat","timestamp_created":1526146943,"timestamp_updated":1526340514,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.348119199275970459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41995876","author":{"steamid":"76561198376605183","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":122,"playtime_forever":365,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":115,"last_played":1619346596},"language":"english","review":"good port to source engine","timestamp_created":1526124729,"timestamp_updated":1526124729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.440809637308120728","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41991649","author":{"steamid":"76561198170329838","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":841,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":707,"last_played":1608199781},"language":"russian","review":"Я не знаю как описать те 11 часов прохождения этой игры.
