The ending of the main game will blow your mind. Those DLCs kinda travels back to the very beginning & wrap things up, explains what started it all, why & when.[/b]\nIf you've never played any previous BioShock games, I'd suggest you to buy this game anyway for the amazing game-play mechanics paired with a unique combat system. Stay away from both [i]Burial at Sea[/i] DLCs as you'll probably have no idea what's going on.\n[b]Get [i]Clash in the Clouds[/i] DLC for some creative combat challenges. [i]Columbia's Finest[/i] DLC isn't worth it unless you're looking to complete your BioShock collection.[/b]\n\n[h1]Environment[/h1]\nThe game takes place in a floating city. The city is really beautiful & no place feels empty. The game does an awesome job at visual storytelling as you'd expect from a BioShock game. There are so many assets in every corner of the map, which makes you wanna actually take the time to look at them instead of just walking past them to continue with your current objective. It's worth mentioning that you never die from falling off the city during combat or exploration. You'll just spawn very close to the area you were in - almost instantly without any consequences. You can still die from dropping to the ground from really high heights though, especially if your health is low. If you're looking for some good soundtracks, this game has none. No music matches with the different atmospheres the game has to offer. This is really not that noticeable because most of the time there's several sound effects of whatever is happening around you, along with various NPC dialogues. Almost every level has some [b]Sky-Lines[/b] & [b]Freight Hooks[/b] which is an awesome way to traverse the area. Overall, the world feels very detailed & alive. Don't expect realistic graphics though, as the game is from 2013 but still, I think graphics could have been better. Lights are way too bright in some places & it can be annoying at times. Meshes of a few objects look really outdated. At least Elizabeth looks beautiful - you don't want to spend your time with a character that looks ugly. Engraved weapons look great too.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n[i]I'll try my best not to spoil anything but if you think you should skip this section, feel free to do so.[/i]\nWhen you arrive at the floating city, the game puts all the combat aside to let you take a good look at what kind of things you might expect to encounter in the near future, that level is very well designed. It's like a tutorial without it feeling like a tutorial, if that makes sense. Unlike the previous games where the main climaxes were at the very end, this game throws in some twists every now & then but saves the big surprise for the end. This doesn't make any of your mission feel boring even though the game is quite long. There are [b]Voxophones[/b] scattered throughout the game which serve as audio logs & most of them contain important information of the main story-line. I highly recommend finding & listening to all of them. You'll do most of your journey with [b]Elizabeth.[/b] She'll interact with various objects in the world & speak some dialogues at certain locations, after seeing some objects etc. You'll never feel like you're with a lifeless character the game is forcing you to be with for the story. She has so many dialogues & some of them are surprising & funny. The story of this game is really very complex. It's a good thing that you can replay every single chapter of the game. So if you don't understand something (especially near the end), just replay the chapter & try to listen carefully what the character(s) are saying. There is only 1 ending however, you'll be presented with some choices during the main story-line, none of them will affect the ending. [spoiler]The choice to throw the ball in the early level has a benefit of giving you 1 extra [b]Gear[/b] later in the game. Choosing what Elizabeth wears (bird or cage) is purely cosmetic. Choosing to take a knife to the hand or shooting first is mostly cosmetic too except it'll only affect 2 dialogues in the same level & won't be brought up again.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Game-play[/h1]\nYou have 1 weapon in one hand & 1 [b]Vigor[/b] in the other. Vigors provide unique powers that can help you in combat & with some other stuff in the environment. Using vigors require [b]Salts.[/b] Elizabeth can find salts, money, health & ammo for you from time to time, even during combat. There are total 14 weapons & 8 vigors in the main game. 12 of your weapons & all vigors can be upgraded. You can have 2 weapons at a time, not counting the melee weapon & can have all of your vigors at the same time but can only carry 2 vigors for quick-access. All upgrades require purchases using in-game money in different types of vending machines. There are total 3 different vending machines that you can use: [b]\"Minuteman's Armory\"[/b] for upgrading weapons, [b]\"Veni! Vidi! Vigor!\"[/b] for upgrading vigors & [b]\"Dollar Bill\"[/b] for purchasing general stuff like ammo, health & salts. These machines can be found in lots of places. You can find in-game currency [b]Silver Eagles[/b] in so many places in the game. You can search tons of things in the world to find food, ammo, salts, health & money. All this might seem a bit confusing but it's really not. You can do a little trick on vending machines with a vigor of yours to get more benefits.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nCombat is awesome in the game & there are a lot of enemy encounters. What makes combat fun is the combination of vigor usage & taking advantage of sky-lines among other stuff thanks to Elizabeth. Using a vigor followed by another one can have cool effects. You have an arguably invisible [b]Shield[/b] that absorbs some of the damage before breaking but it recharges automatically & infinite number of times without the need of any resources. Don't be disappointed in the fact that you can only carry 2 main weapons at a time. There's always that perfect weapon for that perfect situation - dead enemies also drop weapons. You can choose to keep a heavy hitting weapon as a secondary for emergencies & keep switching your primary weapon to try out different stuff as there are a lot of weapons available. Enemy encounters, most of the time come with a few normal enemies, some machines & a mini-boss near the end. There are 11 enemy types in the main game. [spoiler]From the weakest to strongest (in my opinion): [b]Founder's Police & its Vox alternative, Gun Automation, Mosquito, Rocket Automation, Zealot of the Lady, Beast, Fireman, Boy of Silence, Motorized Patriot & its Vox alternative, Siren, Handyman & its Vox alternative.[/b] Of course, you'll not encounter them in that order in the game.[/spoiler] You can temporarily turn any enemy into your side, ask for Elizabeth's help in combat & can do really great stuff if there's a sky-line available near the fighting area. It's important to note that Elizabeth doesn't need protection during any combat encounters as she'll stay hidden behind a cover. [spoiler]Elizabeth can help you by opening a [b]Tear[/b] of your choice during combat, that can bring weapons / ammo / health / salts / freight hooks / covers etc.[/spoiler] You have a useful melee weapon that can perform executions on most enemies & it also helps you use freight hooks & sky-lines. Defeating mini-bosses require different strategies & it's a good thing. Some of the vigors are great for laying down traps & for specific enemy types while others are just fun to use in general.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[b]This game has a mind blowing story & one of a kind combat system. It's so hard to think of any reason why I should not recommend this to someone. Get this game even if you don't care about the story, the combat & overall game-play will more than make up for it.[/b]","timestamp_created":1586519020,"timestamp_updated":1586523900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":112,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.867548167705535889","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67018813","author":{"steamid":"76561198038484993","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":3253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3188,"last_played":1586815507},"language":"english","review":"TLDR:  Enjoyable game, beautifully put together\n\nI'm a big fan of the first Bioshock game and I liked the second one, though the instability and crashing was unforgivable, so I approached Bioshock Infinite with hope but a little caution.\n\nBS Infinite moves the story from the underwater city of Rapture and the 1950s-60s to the floating city of Columbia and is set in the 1910s. The player assumes the role of Booker DeWitt, a former soldier and Pinkerton man (private detective and hired thug) with a shady past filled with morally-questionable actions. DeWitt owes an unspecified debt and it told to infiltrate Columbia and retrieve a young woman named Elizabeth and bring her to New York to clear said debt. This almost immediately leads to trouble and the game is off and running.\n\nGameplay is fairly standard Bioshock fare: fire weapon with left click, active plasmid (here, called vigors) with the right. One catch is that unlike the first two games, the player can only carry two weapons. There will likely be occasions where you have to ditch a weapon you like because you are low on ammo for it, to grab one for which you're ammo-full. The vigors will feel somewhat familiar to Bioshock players but they aren't precise reskins of the old plasmids. All weapons and vigors can be upgraded in vending machines, and supplies purchased as well. Currency is in the form of Columbia silver eagles (dollar coins), and food and kits (for health) and blue bottles of salt (mana to power your vigors) can be found littering Columbia's shops, factories and streets.\n\nBS Infinite does have two features unique to the franchise. One, the player will early-on earn a sky-hook, which can be used to grapple various loading cranes and slide down overhead tram-car rails. These become important, as it is not only how DeWitt will progress to new areas, but also becomes tactically important in order to reach cover, available weapons, or attack from above. The enemy can also ride these rails and you can end up in a running gun battle with soldiers while you're all riding the rails. Mounting and dismounting the hooks and rails is very fast and a little vertigo-inducing, though I admit, it is gratifying to dismount and plummet right at a foe and watch him scream in terror just as you collide.\n\nSecond, once DeWitt finds Elizabeth, she will accompany him around Columbia and is surprisingly helpful. The player doesn't have to guard her; she can't be hurt by the enemy or anything. But she will do things for the player, like pick locks to secured areas (if you've found lockpicks for her). She will sometimes find money and flip the coins to you. During combat, if DeWitt is low on ammo or salts, Elizabeth may find them and throw them to the player. These resources are not limitless, and she will frantically tell you if she can't find anything. Most of all, she learns how to open \"tears\" (rips, not crying) in the world. During different battles, she is able to tear-in weapons, medical kits, salts, flammable oil slicks, hook points for your sky-hook, cover to hide you from bullets, or even allies. I recommend trying different strategies, just to see what happens. There are usually multiple workable options in those battles, and I like the flexibility.\n\nOnce things get going, Comstock, the leader of Columbia, will start sending people to stop the player. First, police. Then soldiers. Then other big things. Then other factions get involved.  Some elite foes are just tougher versions of the base enemies, and some are totally different, requiring their own strategies. On human enemies, headshots count and hit hard, so I recommend keeping one zoomable-weapon, like the carbine or sniper rifle, to make enemies drop fast at a distance, especially on harder difficulties. Use of various weapons, vigors, and the environment (riding the sky-lines or opening tears) will help with tougher foes. Experiment and see what works best for you. I found the combat to generally be smoother and more enjoyable than either of the first two games and players that are tactical and plan their fights, as well as those who operate on reflexes can both be successful in these battles.\n\nThe environments in Columbia are gorgeous and colorful. The dress, decor, and architecture very much capture that turn-of-the-twentieth-century feel. The player is constantly reminded they are in a floating city, since there are numerous places one can fall to their death if careless. Graphics-wise, with a GTX 1070, even on max settings, the graphics felt smooth and frame rate consistent.\n\nI personally found the voice-acting and music top-notch.  You could close your eyes and easily identify a dozen characters by their voices alone, and even most enemies. Gun-fire, explosions, the clank of the vending machines, chugging the vigor bottles...all very well done. The actress voicing Elizabeth did such an excellent job you can almost feel the girl's pain in some scenes.\n\nI did find the base story workable but ambitious; it seemed a little more convoluted than it had to be. Explanations for the \"why\" of the floating city, the \"how\" of vigor invention, and the \"who\" of the major players, can be found by listening to voxphones (recorders) and watching old news reels but overall, I found the story less riveting than BS1 and less emotional than BS2. None of the characters other than Elizabeth are particularly likable, including DeWitt himself, so you'll be playing an almost-as-big-a-bastard as the story's main antagonist...which ultimately makes sense as his history is revealed.\n\nThe biggest drawback in Infinite for me was relegating the player to a checkpoint save system, after BS1 & BS2 allowed save on demand. We're on PC, so there is no excuse for not having the option. This is one of my pet peeves; I find it quite annoying and it always feels like lack of effort on the developer's part. The game itself was also quite short; the first time through, on average difficulty, I felt like I did a lot of gawking, exploring, and wandering; I reloaded several fights and took my time--and I still finished in about seventeen hours. Fortunately, the game is good enough to play through a couple of times.\n\nI didn't have many stability problems but did have a handful of crashes. Nothing to really be bothersome. Also a few locks on exiting.\n\nThe DLCs are okay. Clash in the Clouds is the best \"battle room\" DLC in the Bioshock series and the Blue Ribbon Challenges are variable and fun, though a few will test your patience. The good news about those is that you keep your infusions, gear, upgrades and cash from challenge to challenge (or even if you start one over), which helps. The CiC runs are actually good for just practicing combat. Burial at Sea is a weird mash-up of BS1 and BS Infinite, in concept and content, with some resource management challenges. I was left unsatisfied by the resolution of it and felt like the story was borderline nonsensical. If you have not played Bioshock 1, Burial at Sea is all spoilers for that game. You've been warned.\n\nThe Steam achievements are, for the most part, not too bad. As of this writing, I've completed about 3/4 of them. One is to play the game on max difficulty and not purchase anything from the vendors, so that will definitely be a challenge. One nice feature is that the many of the achievements are cumulative from play through to play through.

So, I've played it only now in 2020.\n\nLast years were very poor on good FPS games. First thing that I can say is that Bioshock Infinite does not look outdated in 2020. It's still a great game with good detailed graphics. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and music. What I like most is the character of Elizabeth. She acts like alive, she is so beautiful and emotionally rich. The game worth playing just because of her.\n\nI see that many people underline the brilliant story, and I agree on it. What I like is that the story is finished and debatable at the same time. Most importantly, the game does not keep a gamer as a fool and does not try to explain every detail to you, so you will have to figure out something by yourself.\n\nWhat I did not like is actually the battle gameplay. All this roller coaster jumping and shooting are so childish. The levels are beautiful, but they are not designed for a good battle. For example, recently I've been re-playing Wolfenstein The New Order, and when an action scenes were starting, I felt happy about it. Here, I've noticed that I felt rather tired and I wanted them to end to see the continuation of the story.","timestamp_created":1586432368,"timestamp_updated":1586432368,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66950653","author":{"steamid":"76561198823334156","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":520,"last_played":1586512656},"language":"spanish","review":"SI","timestamp_created":1586431652,"timestamp_updated":1586431652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66944368","author":{"steamid":"76561198075549083","num_games_owned":640,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1618206223},"language":"spanish","review":"Que
