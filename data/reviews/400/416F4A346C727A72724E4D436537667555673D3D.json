Mettendoci nei panni di Chell, un soggetto sperimentale dei laboratori della Aperture Science, affronteremo una serie di camere test l’una più difficile dell’Altra, fino al completamento del gioco.\n\nParlando francamente, il gioco è un esperienza veramente eccezionale; verremo dotati di una “portal gun” che ci consentirà, come da nome, di lanciare portali in determinate zone, consentendoci di passare da uno all’altro. Destreggiandoci quindi nel piazzare i portali per completare le camere test.\nLa storia di Portal è incredibile, ma non eccezionale; narrata attraverso Glados, andremo a scoprire chi siamo e cosa facciamo lì.\n\nNonostante ciò, il gioco dura relativamente poco, può essere infatti concluso in meno di 3 ore se lo si conosce bene, ma può arrivare a durare anche 6/7 ore, ciò dipende da persona a persona ovviamente. Escludendo poi le sfide aggiuntive quali il completamento delle camere già affrontate precedentemente, con alcuni obbiettivi quali: Completarle con il minor numero di Portali, con il minor numero di passi, e con il minor tempo possibile.\n\nPortal è senza dubbio un ottimo gioco, in alcuni momenti potrà persino mettere il giocatore in seria difficoltà, portandolo a lasciare mouse e tastiera, prendendo un foglio di carta in mano per pensare a come concludere la camera test, raggiungendo quindi dei livelli incredibili per la sfida che offre.\nLo consiglio a chiunque sia desideroso di intraprendere questa sfida con se stesso, per vedere fino a dove può arrivare la sua mente.\n\nValutazione: 3.9/5","timestamp_created":1457604865,"timestamp_updated":1457604895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21743753","author":{"steamid":"76561198126616019","num_games_owned":1221,"num_reviews":110,"playtime_forever":196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":196,"last_played":1455982061},"language":"spanish","review":"Bien, no recomiendo jugar al primero después del 2, mejor hacerlo en el orden correcto puesto que el segundo es la explosión de todo lo contenido en este.
