OptionsからControlsのタブを開き、Raw Mouse Inputのところにチェックを付けないと、直視しかできなくなるバグがあるので注意。自分の環境でもそうだった。","timestamp_created":1589354654,"timestamp_updated":1589355850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542260587215423584","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69043765","author":{"steamid":"76561198054640275","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":254,"last_played":1546630188},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life: Opposing Force is most definitely one of the greatest expansion packs released for a FPS, ever.

Это самый лучший пример дополнения для игры. Это как халф лайф только: больше оружий, больше монстров, больше механик и даже новая история! Ну как новая. Кароче вы меня поняли. Кароче это круто! Теперь буду проходить blue shift. \n\nСюжет. И да новая история. Вообще старая, только от лица наёмника. (Ну или кто это) На самом деле в оригинальной игре сюжет конечно намного лучше. Но это дополнение мне вообще понравилось не сюжетом. Тут просто 6/10. Кстати тут ещё можно встретить места как в ориге. это тоже плюс.\n\nГеймплей. Вот реально офигенно! Это всеми нами любимый старенький шутер. На том самом движке, на котором делалось большая часть игр от valve. Кароче это как 1 халфа только улучшенная в 2 раза! Да тут очень много пушек! Это как раз и нужно отличному шутеру. Также много новых монстров и механик. Особенно мне понравилась механика с языком барнакла, которым можно цепляться за стены как человек-паук. Это вообще зашибись! Кароче это самое важное здесь. 9/10\n\nГрафика. Ну я так то не по графике сужу игры, но она также важна как и сюжет с геймплеем. Потому что как ты получишь эстетическое удовольствие, да? Но тут я думаю это не самое важное. Тем более посмотрите на год выхода дополнения. И ещё к этой графике уже все привыкли ещё с первого халф лайфа. Кароче хорошая графика 8/10.\n\nЦена. Очень даже неплохая цена для такого дополнения. А я ещё по новогодней скидке покупал. Кароче ну это очень хорошая цена за такое. 9/10.\n\nПерсонажи. Играть за протагониста это всегда круто. Ну типа почувствуй себя злодеем. Кароче да 9/10.\n\nОчень и очень крутое дополнение к халфе.

Un poco más corto, pero nuevas armas, enemigos y mecánicas que lo diferencian del anterior. El arma que más me gustó es la sniper; no uso ese tipo de arma en ningún juego, pero está buena la mecánica de matar soldados desde lejos. Además, hay otra arma que destaca entre todas las de los fps que jugué hasta el momento; una que es un extraterrestre que llevas en el brazo que con su lengua (?) se puede pegar a los enemigos o a superficies “orgánicas”, puede atraer a los enemigos o dirigirte hacia ellos. Te sirve también para llegar a plataformas que de otra manera no llegarías. \nContás en algunas partes con la ayuda de algunos soldados con diferentes “especialidades”, un médico que te cura (dah), un ingeniero que abre puertas y uno que tiene una ametralladora tipo rambo que ataca a los enemigos, en realidad los otros también atacan, pero el arma del ultimo es más fuerte. Solamente el ingeniero resulta indispensable para pasar algunas partes, los otros pueden morir sin que sea realmente un problema, pero en general se aprecia la compañía, aunque suele ser muy “tonta” la inteligencia artificial. Al menos cuando mueren dejan caer sus armas.\nOtra de las mecánicas nuevas es que Shephard puede trepar cuerdas, aunque se usa pocas veces. Recomiendo que hagan el tutorial porque enseña a utilizar estas novedades y está bien pensado porque es parte del entrenamiento militar que recibe el protagonista antes de ir a black mesa.\nPor lo demás, es muy parecido al half life original solo que desde la perspectiva de uno de los militares que tenía como misión matar a Freeman. Creo que enriquece bastante la historia, tiene más acción en general, más enemigos y resulta probablemente más dinámico que el otro.

Dans ce jeu nous sommes donc un militaire envoyé à Black Mesa qui sera aidé durant son aventure par d'autres militaires ce qui offre une nouvelle mécanique de gameplay car l'on a souvent l'occasion de faire appelle à ces militaires alliés pour progresser dans le jeu. L'arsenal d'armes est très varié et j'ai personnellement eu plus de plaisir à utiliser chacune de ces armes à ma disposition tout au long du jeu que lors de mes parties de Half-life où la plupart des armes n'ont aucune utilité et où 4 armes permettent à elles seules de finir le jeu sans problèmes. Pour ce qui est du combat final je le trouve très différent de celui de Half-life ce qui le rends tout aussi bon. Pour finir le défaut principal que je trouve au jeu est son manque de trousse de soin par rapport aux munitions que l'on trouve tout les deux mètres et par rapport à la quantité d'ennemis beaucoup plus puissants que nous. Ce manque de trousse de soin rends le jeu bien plus difficile que Half-life à mon sens mais le problème se réglerait sûrement en passant la difficulté sur facile. Le jeu à une durée de vie d'environ 4-5 heures ce qui est pour moi la durée parfaite pour un spin-off pour qu'il ne tire pas trop en longueur et ne soit pas répétitif.

I made the mistake of underestimating it, thinking it was just a throwaway add-on, but it's certainly not. There's a lot of recycling from the first game, obviously, but also many new weapons --some of the best in the franchise-- and new enemy types. And, of course, more of those memorable Half Life moments and set-pieces. If you liked the original, jump straight into this one. It's got a somewhat different vibe: there are fewer large-scale set pieces, more corridor shooting, more difficult gun-play due to the new enemies, and even more puzzle platforming -- which is an acquired taste, but works pretty well here, because the platforming, in general, is less tricky and more straightforward than in the original, more about figuring out the route than landing precise jumps. I played on Hard, though, and I have to say the final third, while still good, dragged on a bit. The fights get harder, bigger, longer, and more frequent, and the bullet-soaking enemies get more numerous. I do think the original switches things up with more panache and sense of pacing. That said, this doesn't mean Opposing Force takes a nosedive or anything like that, and the final boss is definitely an improvement over Half Life's. So please, don't get discouraged and jump on this: it's very, very good.","timestamp_created":1588822962,"timestamp_updated":1588822962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68705516","author":{"steamid":"76561197970509330","num_games_owned":979,"num_reviews":202,"playtime_forever":839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":839,"last_played":1588814867},"language":"english","review":"Half Life: Opposing Force is one of the best expansions i've ever played and easily ranks right alongside Half Life 1 and Halflife 2 as one of the best first person shooters made.
