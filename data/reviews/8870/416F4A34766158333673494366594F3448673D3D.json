A soundtrack é absurdamente incrível, os gráficos são impecáveis, a jogabilidade não tem comparação. A história do jogo é muito boa e conhecê-lá é essencial para um melhor compreendimento a história completa do Bioshock, eu recomendo esse jogo a qualquer pessoa, mesmo sendo um jogo ''generalizado'' de FPS, ele atraí jogadores de outros estilos, assim como o meu. O mapa possui uma diversidade de itens que você pode coletar, upgrades e etc acho uma coisa bem legal que acrescenta um pouco mais no gameplay. Existem coisas que você só encontra no jogo se você realmente explorar o cenário, Um título incrível para os jogos de hoje em dia.","timestamp_created":1386731469,"timestamp_updated":1386731785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7999922","author":{"steamid":"76561198095517900","num_games_owned":395,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":876,"last_played":1462154599},"language":"english","review":"BioShock Infinite:\n\n8/10\n\nPros:\n- Intriguing story\n- One of the best characters ever in a video game\n- Amazing atmosphere\n\nCons:\n- Generic gameplay\n\nBioshock Infinite has one of the most interesting stories I've ever seen in a video game. From beginning to end, it had me on my toes, trying to figure out what would happen next. And not to mention it has some of the most realistic and unique characters that I've seen, or the fact that the setting is beautiful. But while Infinite is great in these regards, there is one part in which the game falls flat: the gameplay. Infinite has the gameplay stylings of generic first-person shooter, complete with regenerating shield and two-weapon limit. The skyhook was a nice addition, but the majority of the vigors consist of a different elemental grenade. Even with the unoriginal gameplay, the game still manages to be fully enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1386728366,"timestamp_updated":1404696870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7999877","author":{"steamid":"76561198046679581","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1119,"last_played":1578811408},"language":"english","review":"water okay\nsky is no no","timestamp_created":1386728004,"timestamp_updated":1545347286,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7999757","author":{"steamid":"76561198028991828","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2323,"last_played":1532122390},"language":"english","review":"Has the best storyline for a single player game.","timestamp_created":1386727071,"timestamp_updated":1386727071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7999429","author":{"steamid":"76561198055463583","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":539,"last_played":1386298053},"language":"english","review":"BioShock Infinite is an awesome game.

It not only produces an amazing standalone game, but links the universe together without being cheesy and/or over complicated. Also the intricate character development makes the twist at the end even more devastating, although it could have been wrapped up quicker, that's the only thing i can see wrong with it plot-wise. As always the devs have created a utopiam/dystopian world depending on where you stand, the aesthetics are perfect and although the gameplay can feel repetitive at times, for the most part it's sound, also, the social and political allegorys may be obvious, but they are very effective.","timestamp_created":1386723540,"timestamp_updated":1386799561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507389187812805176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7998949","author":{"steamid":"76561197971694968","num_games_owned":501,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":23387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7091,"last_played":1501759031},"language":"english","review":"Well crafted, lovely to look at and play.

Unser Spielcharakter hat Schulden und will diese begleichen indem er für die Drahtzieher ein Mädchen rettet und es diesen vorliefert. Das Mädchen namens Elizabeth begleitet uns sozusagen durch das ganze Spiel und hat tolle Funktionen, beispielsweise kann sie Dinge aus fernen Welten beschwören, wirft uns immer wieder gefundene Gegenstände wie Geld, Munition oder Heilung zu. Auch wir haben verschiedene und starke Mächte, mit denen wir Gegner besiegen können. Insgesamt sind es 8, angefangen von Lavabällen bis zu Krähen, die unseren Gegner verspeisen.\n\nDie Handlung ist stetig spannend und Gott sei Dank, so wie es in vielen Spielen leider nicht ist, wechseln wir oft die Umgebung. Es gibt auch Nebenmissionen und immer wieder sind Gegenstände aufzufinden, die nicht zum eigentlichem Spielverlauf gehören. Nach und nach finden wir verschiedene Waffen, anngefangen von einer Pistole bis zur Schroftflinte und Bazooka, sogar ein Granatenwerfer ist dabei. Von Einzelschuss- bis 3erschusswaffen ist das Sortiment relativ groß. Interessant sind die vielen Läden die unterwegs zu finden sind, sie verkaufen von Munition und Medipack's bis hin zu Schadensboost für Waffen und Fähigkeiten so ziemlich alles. Fast jede Leiche lässt uns Kohle da sodass es kaum möglich ist pleite zu gehen. \n\nDer allgemeine Aufbau ist toll, es gibt die wichtigsten Funktionen wie Sprint, Zielen, Springen und Klettern. Wir haben sogar eine Nahkampfwaffe, mit der man Gegner die Köpfe abreissen kann und auch hier gibt es einzelne tolle Spezialeffekte. Ich bin schon gespannt wie das Spiel weitergeht und endet, die Story lässt viele Frage offen und bringt den Spieler oft zum Denken, genau so muss ein Ego-Shooter sein.\n\nEin Fazit am Ende: Die Story ist zwar relativ kurz, aber emotional sehr packend. Ich hätte mit Ende NIEMALS gerechnet und alle Rätsel werden aufgelöst. Das Ende ist unglaublich spannend, packed, herausfordernd und aufklärend. Es ist das erste Spiel, das mich so extrem gepackt hat. Der Kauf ist völlig empfehlenswert, selten so ein unfassbar gutes Spiel gespielt.","timestamp_created":1386663652,"timestamp_updated":1386787530,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7991004","author":{"steamid":"76561198065072272","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2196,"last_played":1386626286},"language":"english","review":"Was a great game with twists and turns I never expected.","timestamp_created":1386663376,"timestamp_updated":1386663376,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7990461","author":{"steamid":"76561198084133507","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":638,"last_played":1410886933},"language":"brazilian","review":"Pesquisei muito antes de comprar, e agora sei por que toda análise que eu encontrava era sempre nota máxima!

While I do think there are balance issues with certain gear/skills/weapons being a clearly better choice over others, there is *some* freedom in choosing a playstyle.\n\nThe gameplay itself, is decent. The skyhook mechanic is (pun intended) on rails so there isn't as much freedom to toy with it as you might think from the trailers. You mostly just use it to get to the next destination, find a few hidden spots for bonus loot, and kill a few baddies for free. If the story and visual/audio components were as so-so as the combat, I'd say this would be a pretty average, wait for a sale kind of title.\n\nWith the bad news out of the way: One of my favorite games of all time. It's extremely rare that I play a video game with a story as good as this. Ironically, the first Bioshock is one of the few that has a story that can compare in terms of depth and surprise. If you aren't a fan of first-person shooters, just play it on easy, listen to all the character banter as you explore, read all the signage, and enjoy the gorgeous visuals and music.

Концовка и вправду огонь, но чтоб допереть до общей картины мне пришлось смотреть объяснение на ютубе и еще раз пройти игру (о чем ни капли не жалею)\nP.S. На Bioshock infinite моё знакомство с серии и закончилось. Не мог осилить первую часть из устаревшей графики, хотел пройти ремастер, да все времени никак не найдется.","timestamp_created":1386591769,"timestamp_updated":1480189687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7981016","author":{"steamid":"76561198016195239","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":934,"last_played":1386428686},"language":"italian","review":"Questo è un gioco da avere assolutamente!","timestamp_created":1386590347,"timestamp_updated":1386590347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502338826656341553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7980894","author":{"steamid":"76561197984195958","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2068,"last_played":1396221752},"language":"english","review":"Graphics are wonderfull.

Man sollte alle drei gespielt haben.\n\nVon Bioshock habe ich damals eigentlich einen RPG-Shooter im Stil von System Shock erwartet. Schließlich ist Bioshock dessen geistige Erbe. \nAls ich bemerkt habe, dass es eigentlich nur ein Shooter ist, war ich etwas enttäuscht. \nDie tolle Atmosphäre und das Gameplay haben es aber gerettet.\n\nVon Infinite habe ich nicht viel mehr erwartet als von den Vorgängern. Eher weniger, da mich der Grafikstil von Teil 1 und 2 eher angesprochen hat. \nWas mir Infinite dann aber gegeben hat, war eins der intensivsten Spielerlebnisse meiner über 20-jährigen Zocker-Laufbahn.\n\nDie fliegende Stadt empfand ich anfangs als übertrieben. Auch das Design war mir insgesamt zu hell und blass. Schnell wird man aber vom rasanten Gameplay, dem tollen Leveldesign und der spannenden Handlung in den Bann gezogen. \n\nIn den Außenarealen findet die Fortbewegung zwischen den einzelnen Stadtteilen über ein achterbahnartiges, schwebendes Schiennenetz statt, wo man an den Schienen hängend zwischen den Gebäuden hin- und herrast. Dies ist grandios umgesetzt und macht großen Spass.\nDen Kämpfen verleiht es außerdem eine großartige Dynamik. \n\nAb dem ersten Drittel der Spielzeit entfaltet sich dann langsam die Handlung. \nAb da war ich verloren. \nWenn man morgens aufwacht und das erste, woran man denkt, ein Spiel ist - das kannte ich bis jetzt nur von J-RPGs. \nSpannend, bewegend, komplex, mysteriös, verrückt. Am Ende war ich sprachlos. \nAn dieses Spiel werde ich mich noch lange erinnern.","timestamp_created":1386587841,"timestamp_updated":1441858225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7980746","author":{"steamid":"76561198088568176","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1401380943},"language":"russian","review":"Определенно одна из лучших игр 2013 года.

Непросто представить, сколько человеко-часов было потрачено на создание таких масштабных и одновременно красивых локаций. Стиль выдержан идеально, декорации лишь некоторыми деталями напоминают о прошлых играх серии, в основном тебя погружают в совершенно другую атмосферу. Рассматривать город и его детали не надоедает до конца игры.\nПерсонажи. В игре есть по сути только один действительно интересный герой, и это Элизабет. Не обладая хорошей лицевой анимацией и сверх графикой, разработчикам удалось сделать её предельно “живой”. За счёт замечательной озвучки, крайне выразительных глаз и милого личика(как хорошо, что в игре у героини нет черт  Анны Молевой), следить за Элизабет и общаться с ней – одно удовольствие. Она – один из самых ярких героев за последний год.\n","timestamp_created":1386572226,"timestamp_updated":1386572226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495458304882049561","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7979352","author":{"steamid":"76561197986067997","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1386912119},"language":"english","review":"most excellent","timestamp_created":1386570738,"timestamp_updated":1386570738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7979245","author":{"steamid":"76561198027285538","num_games_owned":272,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":2578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1369,"last_played":1419641892},"language":"english","review":"A truly superb game, loved the art style and overall experience, really recommended.\n","timestamp_created":1386569529,"timestamp_updated":1386569529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520441710948944092","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7979218","author":{"steamid":"76561198064281790","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1052,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1000,"last_played":1388608276},"language":"portuguese","review":"Melhor jogo que ja joguei, simplesmente incrivel, grande história com um otimo final.\nPerfeito","timestamp_created":1386569185,"timestamp_updated":1386569185,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551282048225402832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7979079","author":{"steamid":"76561198057188149","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1585,"last_played":1497512166},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games that I have ever played.
