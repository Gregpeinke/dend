survival horror, разработанная компанией Turtle Rock Studios, которая с 10 января 2008 по 3 июня 2009 являлась частью Valve Corporation. Игра создана на движке Source версии 14 для платформ Windows NT и Xbox 360. Портированием игры на Xbox 360 занималась студия Certain Affinity. 28 октября 2010 года игра стала доступна на Mac OS X.\n\nВпервые информация о Left 4 Dead появилась в рождественском номере журнала PC Gamer UK за 2006 год в виде шестистраничной статьи. А опробовать игру публика смогла на QuakeCon 2007 и Showdown 2007 LAN, прошедшей в американском городе Сан-Хосе. 6 ноября демоверсия Left 4 Dead стала доступна тем, кто сделал предварительный заказ через систему цифровой дистрибуции Steam. 11 ноября 2008 года она стала доступна публично. 18 ноября игра стала доступна через Steam для всех желающих. 20 ноября состоялся выпуск коробочных версий в Америке, а 21 ноября — в Старом свете. Версии для персонального компьютера и Xbox 360 полностью переведены на русский язык.\n\nИгра получила множество положительных отзывов. Разработчикам удалось хорошо передать мрачную атмосферу ужаса и отчаяния, которая возникла в результате распространения в игровой вселенной неизвестного вируса, превратившего людей в чудовищ. Благодаря работе «Режиссёра», искусственного интеллекта, следящего за действиями игроков и влияющего на игровой процесс, каждое прохождение игры уникально и неповторимо, а упор на командные действия делает игру одной из лучших среди кооперативных шутеров. Также уникальность этой серии шутеров придаёт необычный сетевой режим, в котором команды противников поставлены в разные условия: одни играют за людей, а другие — за Особых Заражённых.\n\n1 июня 2009 года на выставке Electronic Entertainment Expo Valve официально анонсировала полноценный сиквел Left 4 Dead 2. Сиквел вышел 17 ноября 2009 года.","timestamp_created":1539183758,"timestamp_updated":1549275735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540365338325500488","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45201698","author":{"steamid":"76561198828692587","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":588,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":348,"last_played":1590379484},"language":"english","review":"Great game!

Getting Left 4 Dead on my 360 was just supposed to be a place-holder,aka,one of those games you get because everyone else has it. Yet despite seeming minimalist and just another \"zombie shooter\" there's simply something about L4D that's genuinely fun to play,even when you go at it alone with a bunch of bots. (This of course is why I bought it again for the pc!)\n \nThere's something to be said for good map design as well as the harmonious balance between light and shadows. Years later the source engine holds up splendidly in this regard. The locations you're in are very believable even if the graphic fidelity isn't thru the roof. In addition all the character models hold up well. Zoey still looks beautiful all these years later and Bill is still the lovable grumpy old-man whom none the less keeps everyone together. Francis is likewise the \"bad boy biker dood\" with a heart of gold whereas Luis is akin to your best mate you take to the pub after work. The cohesion and relationship between the characters is believable and this  is helped by dialogue that's a bit cheeky yet not entirely over the top or beyond the pale. Everyone has expressive faces and small details that set them apart from each other even if game-play wise everyone shoots,switches weapon types,jumps,kneels, and uses side items in the same fashion. The gun-play is spot on and the frame-rate is smooth and steady,even when you're in the middle of an undead horde!\n\nZombie encounters are varied, usually starting off where you pick off a few stragglers here or there but then suddenly you're being bum rushed by 50+ infected at once. To further keep you on your toes,there are \"special zombie types\" that have special varied attacks or just do ridiculous amounts of damage. In L4D these are the tank (Hulk-smash-bruiser),witch (Hair-trigger-berserker with slashy claws), hunter (Surprise acrobat who pounces on you and pummels the crap outta your face Iori Yagami style),boomer (Obese vomit launcher) and the smoker (Has a tongue that can constrict around you and leaves behind a thick cloud of acrid fog when you defeat him.) Even your environment can work against you if you set off a car alarm. (To zombies loud noises equates to the dinner-time bell! Additionally the witch stays docile if you just walk around her and don't shine your flash light directly on her!)\n\nEach area has some kind of goal (Powering up a generator to open a security gate or talking to helicopter rescue pilots are prime examples) But there are no puzzles. You either collect what you need to or just hit the interact button. Sometimes there's a bar that gradually fills as you are doing a task at which point it's good to have friends watching your back. Each series of maps that makes up a mini-campaign end in some kind of daring last-minute escape be it via a chopper,via a tank, or via a boat. Strewn about at various check points are safe houses that save your game automatically and keep track of your performance. (These rooms also offer more med packs and the chance to change out guns and ammunition.)\n \nAnyone who wants to live thru a Romero movie or Resident Evil from the perspective of \"average nobodies\" having to evacuate Raccoon city before the bombs drop owe it to themselves to pick up Left For Dead. It's true other zombie games have perhaps added newer game-play mechanics and hybrid rpg skill trees but we don't always have time to grind for hours or deal with needless complexities. When it comes to fast adrenaline pumping zombie fun by yourself or with up to three friends, Left for dead and its' sequel Left 4 dead 2 are still some of the better games of this ilk out there. There's something to be said for simplicity and satisfaction without all those frivolously added gaudy frills on the side....\n\nPros\n \n+Pinpoint accurate shooting\n \n+Good control scheme\n \n+The director mode makes zombie-rush encounters unpredictable. Aka,there are no scripted events.\n \n+Shadows,lighting,and textures all compliment each other nicely to create realistic environments without any awkward extra sheen or an overly flamboyant color palette.\n \n+Dialogue between survivors is believable and each survivor is likable.\n \n+Great co-op/nostalgic memories with friends\n \n+Different zombie types keep the shoot-outs and combat more engaged and strategic.\n \n+Maps are robust enough to feel fleshed out but tend not to over-stay their welcome.\n \n+AI controlled partners are helpful even when you go at it solo. They will cover for  you  and heal you.\n \n+Great frame-rate\n \n +Mod community for the pc version\n \n+Both L4D and L4D2 are dirt cheap!\n \n\nCons\n \n-Very bare-bones simple premise. There are no skill trees or unique traits for every character. You simply blast away at the hordes of the infected to make it to each safe-house on foot until you can eventually be rescued. Still,what Left 4 Dead \"does do\" it does marvelously. Why over-complicate and muck up what works?\n \n-My biggest worry upon getting Left 4 Dead was the supposed very limited number of maps. Rest assured while there are only 4-5 \"main campaigns\" each one actually has quite a few maps  between them so eh,it was more than enough for me! However, I do believe Killing Floor has more custom maps overall. Then again, if I count mods from both games I might have to re-do my analysis on this. \n \n-Assuming you prefer more story-driven survival horror games L4D and its' sequel may fall a bit short. Aka, the infection is never explained nor do you get to find out who is behind it all. L4D really doesn't have its' own version of Albert Wesker or Oswell E Spencer. Then again,it allows us to use our own imaginations and for fan fic writers and modders this is a blessing in disguise!

Nikt nie wie skąd się wziął i dlaczego zaatakował właśnie teraz. Jedyne co jest pewne, to fakt, że wszyscy dotknięci nim ludzie zamieniają się w krwiożercze, bezmózgie bestie, potocznie zwane zombie. Skromna liczba przedstawicieli naszego gatunku odporna jest na zarazę i to właśnie w ich rękach leży teraz los ludzkości. Muszą przedzierać się przez opanowane przez dziwolągi ulice w poszukiwaniu schronienia i realizować niezwykle niebezpieczne zadania. Tak w skrócie przedstawia się wątek fabularny gry. Choć nie jest on najważniejszym jej elementem, stanowi idealne tło do wszystkich przedstawionych na ekranie wydarzeń.\n\nGłównymi bohaterami Left 4 Dead jest czwórka zwykłych ludzi. Zoey to młoda kobieta, Bill jest weteranem wojennym, Louis reprezentuje pracowników biurowych, a Francis to po prostu rowerzysta. Każdy z nich dzierży w dłoni broń i stara się jak najdłużej pozostać przy życiu. Opóźnienie zgonu nie jest jednak łatwe, z powodu biegających dookoła nieumarłych, dlatego też nasz oddział zmuszony jest do ciągłego wspierania się, nie tylko radą, lecz przede wszystkim ołowiem. Valve, tworząc Left 4 Dead skupiło się głównie na trybie współpracy i od razu widać, że jest on najważniejszym modelem rozgrywki. Osoby nie przepadające za starciami w większym gronie mogą skorzystać z trybu dla jednego gracza, aczkolwiek mija się to z celem. Boty nie oferują takich samych doznań jak zabawa w towarzystwie innych graczy. Siekanie zombiaków jeszcze nigdy nie było tak wciągające i satysfakcjonujące!","timestamp_created":1537384334,"timestamp_updated":1537384334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537216842174530029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44804836","author":{"steamid":"76561198343524872","num_games_owned":515,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":281,"last_played":1589333696},"language":"english","review":"Fun, but not very fufilling in the modern market. much better off with the 2nd one, cause it even plays this one.
