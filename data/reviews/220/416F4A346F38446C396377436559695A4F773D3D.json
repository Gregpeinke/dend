This is a First Person Shooter/Puzzle game set in the future dystopian universe of the Half Life series.\n\n    Half Life 1 saw the series protagonist Gordon Freeman, survive an industrial accident and then work his way through an extra dimensional adventure that was part survival, part horror, part military shooter and part 3D platform puzzler to escape the facility known as Black Mesa. Black Mesa was a secret U.S. Government research facility. \n\n    In Half Life 2 Gordon Freeman begins the game with a cryptic message from the mystery G-man and then wakes up on a train entering City 17. The military villain faction is suppressing the civilian population who are rebelling against them. Gordon meets other scientists who are trying to survive and escape as well as work out who or what is behind the evil experiments. Gordon faces enemy soldiers, vile mutants, zombies and a traitor to finally thwart the plans of the villains.\n\n    The aspects of this game that keep me coming back are the masterfully created dystopian atmosphere, the attention to detail in the weapons, the fluidity of combat, the perfectly suited sound track and the lore of the Half Life series. Puzzle problem solving could be more flexible and there is usually only one solution to find in order to move on. This is an older game but it stands the test of time.\n\n    I had one issue where the game stopped working. The clever and kind person SeraphimGrey recommended that I re-check the integrity of the game file to get it working. That was all that was needed to get HL2 working again.

It features everyone's favorite four-eyed mute: Gordon Freeman. The Earth has been taken over by rouge Combine Harvesters and now playing as Gordon Freeman, armed only with a crowbar and his lunchbox, must go and blow shit up alongside his antagonist, Alyx Vance.\nHalf-Life 2 is also known as Half-Life: Quarter Life (because a second half-life is technically equal to half of the first, thus 1/2/2=1/4), a \"super 1337\" first-person shooter game that is a sequel, oddly enough, to the game \"Half-Life 3\".\nBecause of this unusual order of game titles in this series, many hardcore gamers committed suicide, believing that time and space has reversed, and that they will eventually turn back into sperms. Thus, the release date of this game, November 16, 2004, is forever known as the infamous \"Day of Holy Crap, Time is Going Backwards, Kill Yourself Before it is Too Late-day.\" Unfortunately, for the game's developers, Ugly Spigot, the fan base for Half-Life 2 was sharply reduced by 95%. Some may argue that this tragic incident was a result of improper product advertising, but others believe that this event was an example of Natural Selection (not the mod, of course.) The labs are currently pointing to a massive harpooning of the fans.","timestamp_created":1430481666,"timestamp_updated":1430481666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15633573","author":{"steamid":"76561198083727233","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1042,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":794,"last_played":1431272922},"language":"portuguese","review":"E esse outro jogo da Valve, como é?

It is by no means however a perfect game.\n\nThe story is reasonably satisfying, but is hampered by Valve's way of telling story. It doesn't, as is so often claimed of the game, evolve around you naturally. Instead, exposition is done in sequences which only divert from cutscenes in that you can move around. As many people said about similar instances in Bioshock: Infinite, there is a degree to which engagement is difficult with this kind of story telling unless you stay put and listen, but then there is no difference to static, film-like exposition.\n\nGameplay is satisfying, however many sequences go on too long. It is clear that they were put in as set pieces for the amazing advances in physics that the Valve engine afforded, however with age these sequences feel, for the most part, like relics of flashy showmanship that don't really stand the test of time. Water Hazard in particular stands out to me. The main exception to this is Ravenholm, which was an absolute joy to go through using only the gravity gun. Thank god for the achievement; going through made the level that much more enjoyable the second time around.\n\nChallenge is for the most part positive. At pointsd it feels like the difficulty is cheesed a bit. Particularly during the final chapters, once again with a few notable exceptions, it feels like Valve's answer to \"How do we maintain the difficulty curve?\" is to just throw more and more enemies at the player. It doesn't really call for a greater tactical variety insofar as it encourages shooting more and shooting faster.\n\nOverall though, it was a fun game that is well worth the low price point.","timestamp_created":1430206433,"timestamp_updated":1430206433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15588246","author":{"steamid":"76561198076677793","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":517,"last_played":1458850746},"language":"english","review":"This is one of the best games ive played","timestamp_created":1430170534,"timestamp_updated":1430170534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15586598","author":{"steamid":"76561198104626086","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":877,"last_played":1595695106},"language":"english","review":"very good!","timestamp_created":1430163939,"timestamp_updated":1430163939,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15584800","author":{"steamid":"76561198120674623","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":795,"last_played":1425597589},"language":"english","review":">Starts game\n>picks up can\n>combine says throw in bin\n>throws it at combine\n\n10/10 would be beaten by combine again","timestamp_created":1430157736,"timestamp_updated":1430157736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15584330","author":{"steamid":"76561198114238516","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2575,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1265,"last_played":1611064823},"language":"english","review":"3","timestamp_created":1430156174,"timestamp_updated":1441552036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15584265","author":{"steamid":"76561198021787422","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":3717,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3639,"last_played":1587939799},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 3 confirmed","timestamp_created":1430156002,"timestamp_updated":1430156002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15583850","author":{"steamid":"76561198069520418","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":839,"last_played":1431171814},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegazo!
