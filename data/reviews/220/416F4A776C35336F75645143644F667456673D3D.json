These groundbreaking 2004 graphics would fit in with the best of at least 2011. The sound mixing was great as well. Great puzzle aspect.\n\nOK aspects: The story really was not too well thought out and there wasn't really too much of it; however it was very well paced.\n\nCons: The combat is definitely repetitive even though there is decent AI. The voice acting was very bad. For the most part, a bad use of location.

The game takes place sometime after Gordon Freeman accepted a deal from the mysterious G-Man, Gordon had encountered throughout the Black Mesa lab facility during the Xem alien invasion. The G-Man appeared to know more about the situation at Black Mesa than he's leading on to. After that ill fated day Gordon awakens from a status sleep mode and is once again greeted by the G-Man who gives Gordon a trippy light show straight out of the Twilight Zone opening. After the G-Man giving out his monologe, Gordon soon finds himself on a train accompanied by people all wearing the same clothing. The train docks at what appears to be a city but not like any city Gordon has ever visited or seen before. He knows it is Earth and not the Xem planet, because most of the posters and signs are in European text. The city itself is called \"City 17\" an enclosed society with marshall law as a form of enforcement as there are various security cameras, hover cameras, weaponized mechas, armored swat like policemen, force fields, & tanks. As Gordon wonders through the train station and soon the city itself, he feels alienated as he apparently has been gone from Earth much longer than expected. While trying to make sense of things, he soon finds himself being chased by the police during a raid taking place in an appartment building. When all seem lost for Gordon, he is saved by a woman name Alyx who is the daughter of Dr. Eli Vance whom Gordon knew from Black Mesa. Alyx leads Gordon to a hidden base being opperated by a group of freedom fighters who all want to be freed by the Combine, the organization that is controlled by the Xem that enslaved the entire planet after the Black Mesa incident occured. Gordon immediately makes a few new friends and even meets some of the last surviving Black Mesa staff members who are all more than happy to see Gordon alive and well. After the introductions and reunion Gordon learns about the situation of the city and how to help the freedom fighters win their freedom. The main goal is to destroy the Combine's main base of operations in the center of the city which leads Gordon into a long journey ahead. But with the use of his EMV suit that he reacquires and the assortment of weapons nothing will stand in his or his friend's way towards freedom. Half-Life 2 has so much to offer that I don't know where to start. Well first of all the graphics are improved up a notch and the glitches that were in the first game are no where in site. The enviroments are huge and vast, I could just spend hours sinking in all that is offered in site. The new characters are as great as well as the returning ones, Alyx is a great addition to the franchise someone in which the female fan base can immediately associate with. The method of killing enemies are the same as in the original as with the vast assortment of weapons you have multiple ways to kill certain enemies. The plot contains elements straight outta the novel 1984, the films the Matrix, THX-1138, Alien, The Thing, & The Fly. Every minute of this game I enjoyed to the fulliest, if you liked the original Half-Life then you'll love this game even more. It's proof that a game's sequel can be better than the original and this one takes that title. Half-Life 2 is what legends are made of. I might be ranting on about it for too long, but I am dead serious. The game is more than a high recommendation, it is mandatory you play this game. You have not lived life to its fullest until you have played this game.","timestamp_created":1462944010,"timestamp_updated":1464847380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22905104","author":{"steamid":"76561198050786808","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":709,"last_played":1590121455},"language":"russian","review":"Тысячный отрицательный обзор.
