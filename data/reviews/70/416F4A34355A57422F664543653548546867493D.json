As an individual who never experienced the Half-Life franchise in the younger age, I must say I am impressed of what was created back then. The game is extremely long, took me roughly 12-14 hours to fully finish the game at the hardest difficulty. I never used guides so finding everything myself might have increased the time it took a bit. Graphics are of course not the best, but the game was made a long while ago, so no hard thoughts on that. As far as the story and the interactive gameplay was, I am also impressed over how many details the game had. The military troops acted to my surprise very tactical. They threw grenades accordingly (seemed to always hit no matter what lol, quite annoying tbf) to where i stood and they would use commands to let the other troops they had heard/seen something. The story was very interesting, and I loved how suspicious Gman appeared in this game.\n\nTo summarize, I really regret not playing Half-Life as a kid. Despite this probably giving me nightmares back then, it would generate lots of nice memories. Well, you can't always experience everything when you want to, at least i played it now and it was extremely fun. \n\nRating:\n10/10 story-wise\n7/10 gameplay-wise\n6/10 graphics-wise (yeah its old but still you have to load every new little area you walk into which is like having enourmous stutters all the time)","timestamp_created":1589211362,"timestamp_updated":1589211362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61257249116897583","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68959072","author":{"steamid":"76561198361405831","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2911,"playtime_last_two_weeks":25,"playtime_at_review":1413,"last_played":1660491142},"language":"spanish","review":"Un Clasico FPS.","timestamp_created":1589207709,"timestamp_updated":1589207709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68955834","author":{"steamid":"76561198355229318","num_games_owned":548,"num_reviews":117,"playtime_forever":438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1589738300},"language":"turkish","review":"Hikayeli oyunların atası diyebileceğimiz ve hala tadı damaklarda kalan, yakın zaman öncesinde de Alyx ismiyle seriyi devam ettiren Valve firmasının en efsane oyunu.

Their attempts to create characters are completely lost by the fact that there are only 5 unique character models and voice actors, resulting in characters looking and sounding the exact same. It also doesn't help that many of them have no unique lines of dialogue and they all act the same. The only character worth mentioning is the G-man, who you just see kind of walking around Black Mesa until the ending. All the characters who make it half life 2 just explain their origins, so as long as you know the basic story of this game it is completely unnecessary to play to understand half life 2, a far better game.\n\nThe weapons, with some exceptions like the laser gun or revolver, are not memorable at all. There is also an obnoxiously large amount of very obvious aim assist for some weapons, like the pistol. It negates any skill or practice the player has if the gun aims itself. The graphics are atrocious, and some parts are extremely punishing and frustrating, like the tentacle hydra thing or the helicopter. In both those parts, you spend two seconds outside of cover and lose the majority of your health.\n\nThe game reaches it's highpoints when the aliens begin an organised invasion, and you take part in these big battles between you, the military, and the alien soldiers. When that part arrives, the game's pacing picks up and there are many thrills to be had. There are some unique designs for levels and the gimmicks are actually alright, and the games full arsenal of weapons are available. Still, this is only about 25% of the game, and Xen is another 25%, so the majority if the game is just monotonous.\n\nOverall, the game hasn't aged well. The combat ranges from boring to sort of good, the levels mostly all feel the same, the combat is just alright, and the story is barely present. I give Half life 1 a 2/5. Half life 2 is far better, go play that instead.","timestamp_created":1589071884,"timestamp_updated":1589071884,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456431567668914795","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68874218","author":{"steamid":"76561198300522775","num_games_owned":333,"num_reviews":93,"playtime_forever":692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":692,"last_played":1589067728},"language":"english","review":"Welcome to Half-Life.
