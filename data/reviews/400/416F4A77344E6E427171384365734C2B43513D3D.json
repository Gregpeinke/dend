Where the first few times I might have actively struggled with the puzzles, now it's almost like... a walking simulator. I get to enjoy the voice lines from GlaDOS. I go out of my way to re-read the ratman drawings. I try to see how infinite of a fall I can get into. It's a museum where I can gather my thoughts about previous playthroughs and think about how crazy modern day Valve is, and why they would let so many of their franchises die of old age.\n\nAnd I enjoy it! I really do. This time around I finally cracked into the advanced levels and beat those. What a rush! Some of them are plain unfair, but it was a welcome challenge after all these years of just playing the main game to completion again. Next time around maybe I'll break into the time trials or whatever.\n\nIf you've never played it, it's a must play. You just have to experience it for yourself. Pales in comparison to Portal 2, so much so that it's almost like a demo of what's to come, but it's such a small commitment (playtime wise) that even if you don't like it, you'll find it was worth experiencing.\n\n(Played great on SteamDeck)","timestamp_created":1304794122,"timestamp_updated":1654534387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"915515","author":{"steamid":"76561197981916936","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":93,"playtime_forever":1297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":819,"last_played":1631200828},"language":"french","review":"Le meilleur Puzzle Game du monde, tout simplement !","timestamp_created":1304788268,"timestamp_updated":1385413972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"669395","author":{"steamid":"76561197974914881","num_games_owned":482,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":142,"last_played":1315119600},"language":"english","review":"Now you're thinking with portals!

Portal, much like Human Centipede, is meant to make you start thinking about life with portals. The game is pretty easy (although you will get stuck on a few rooms your first time through) but the reason it's gotten so much widespread praise is due to the story telling. There are no text boxes telling you what to feel and there's certainly no cinematics showing you what you need to feel -- you directly experience it through the mental anguish caused by the insideous AI GLaDOS. This is the best writing you will ever experience in any medium. The graphics push the source engine a good deal, to boot.

I decided to try this game because of the revolutionary idea of portals and applying the concept of ripping wormholes to travel from one destination to another. This game takes physicals to a whole new level, perhaps even exaggerated because you cannot die from gravity acceleration of infinite. Yet it's these physics, puzzles and dead-pan humor of your nemesis that truly makes Portal a great stand alone game. My only complaint would be that it could have utilized gravity rooms to create even more diverse free-gravity game. Another problem is that because portals allow you to travel in any dimension, there can be too many ways to beat the game, making it rather too easy. Valve should start hiring physicists to make a different Portal game. Portal 2, rather fell short in my opinion, not as great and revolutionary.","timestamp_created":1304033892,"timestamp_updated":1304033892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"713640","author":{"steamid":"76561197976299176","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":150,"last_played":1563424149},"language":"german","review":"Geniales Logic & Rätsel Spiel, freu mich schon auf Portal 2 .\nPhysikalische Umsetzung ist auch sehr gut gelungen.\nIst nicht für Dumpfbacken geeignet xD","timestamp_created":1304022077,"timestamp_updated":1304022077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"516258","author":{"steamid":"76561197971414323","num_games_owned":751,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":603,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Think outside the box?

The game is based around evasion and manipulation instead of confrontation and domination.\n5. The turrets. They are the exact opposite of a parody of everything women supposedly hate about regular shooting games. Violence, profanity, blood, evil symbolism, chauvinism...the turrets are always polite and apologize even if you kill them. Because everyone is nice in a woman's world.\n6. Just like actual women, the main villain (GLaDOS) is actually powerless to physically do anything to you. The only weapon GLaDOS has is emotional manipulation. Just like women.\n7. The company is called Aperture Science and women have an aperture between their legs.\n8. The game starts and ends with a cute song instead of a bunch of dead people.\n9.
