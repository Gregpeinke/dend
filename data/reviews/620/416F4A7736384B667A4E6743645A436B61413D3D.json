It stands the tests of times and is an enjoyable experience even after the first playthrough. It is a game that I recommend to everyone, no need to have played the prequel either.\n\nUp front, it may seem like just a puzzle game that features unique mechanics and a silly story behind it, but it certainly excels as one. The puzzles are all fairly challenging, forcing you to be constantly thinking of new ways of approaching situations and utilizing your resources. New mechanics are constantly being introduced as well, building upon old ones and at a good pace too which helps develop these puzzles.\n\nBut it is with the story that Portal 2 begins to really shine. The few characters in the game are all written and portrayed excellently guiding you through the puzzles as you delve deeper and deeper into the game. You begin realizing that there is a lot more going on and just can not wait to beat the puzzle to find out more. And trust me, the story is worth getting through and won't leave you dissapointed.\n\nThe game itself isn't too long and should take less than 10 hours to beat. But even after that, there is a whole lot more to do with the co op mode. Several more hours of Portal for you to enjoy, this time alongside a friend, providing you all new challenges and ways to play the game. Now hopefully taht is enough reason for you to stop reading this review now and just go buy and play the game... for science!","timestamp_created":1480035493,"timestamp_updated":1543031831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27356034","author":{"steamid":"76561197971150428","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2660,"last_played":1590103748},"language":"english","review":"I have to wrtite a review about a game.
