Ten gatunek nigdy specjalnie mnie nie intrygował, ale arcypozytywne recenzje zarówno pierwszej jak i drugiej części zachęciły mnie do kupna zestawu gier z tej serii za - bagatela - 12 zł i od razu piszę że zakup się udał co najmniej połowicznie.\nNa pierwszy rzut oka Portal to Half Life 2 jak w mordę strzelił. Interfejs niemal ten sam, a i grafika dość podobna, bo premiery obu tych produkcji nie były od siebie odległe. I tak jak HL Portal opiera się przede wszystkim na oddaniu realizmu fizyce i jej różnych wariacjach z tytułwymi  portalami na czele. Grafika jest bardzo przyjemna i nie razi w oczy pomimo, że tytuł ten ma już 12 lat na karku. Jedynie przy zbliżeniach można dostrzec niezbyt \"współczesne\" tekstury. Ale ogólnie mi to nie przeszkadza, a z oprawy graficznej jestem co najmniej zadowolony.\nNa początku lądujemy w zamkniętym pomieszczeniu, a wydawać by się mogło przyjemny głos AI uczy nas mechanik od podstaw, a te rozwijane są z czasem. Z początku dostajemy możliwość manipulowania jednym wyjściem portalu, a już niedługo po tym możemy tworzyć własne wariacje zarówno tworząc wejście jak i wyjście za pomocą Portal Guna. Im dalej w las tym zagadki coraz bardziej rozbudowane, a i parę zgonów w końcowych etapach można zaliczyć. Satysfakcja z rozwiązywania tych trudniejszych jest bardzo duża, a czasem możemy rozwiązać dany problem na kilka sposobów. Przyjemne, proste, ale i niekiedy wymagające główkowania.\nTym co napędza rozgrywkę jest fabuła, wedle której zamknięci w systemie laboratoriów mamy za zadanie uciekać z kolejnych pomieszczeń tak aby zaliczyć eksperyment prowadzony przez wszechobecną sztuczną inteligencję zwaną GLADOS. Z czasem sprawy zaczynają sie się komplikować, a multum ukrytych pomieszczeń sugeruje dalszy ciąg tej intrygującej choć dość tajemniczej historii. Ostatecznie jestem usatysfakcjonowany tą krótką ( ok 3-5 godzin), ale intrygującą opowieścią o... No właśnie nie będę spoilerować ;) Po prostu polecam zagrać i doświadczyć tego na własne oczy .\nPodsumowując, dołączam się do tych, którzy zachwalają grę, bo i gameplay i historia spełniają swoją rolę bardzo dobrze i moim zdaniem to jest najważniejsza rzecz jaką mogli osiągnąć twórcy. Oficjalnie najlepsza gra logiczna, choć gdy zabiorę się za ponoć jeszcze lepszą dwójkę to moje zdanie prawdopodobnie ulegnie zmianie.","timestamp_created":1573069781,"timestamp_updated":1573069781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56648918","author":{"steamid":"76561197998622562","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1262,"last_played":1614557024},"language":"spanish","review":"Entretenidisimo!!!!

Both Portal and its successor were absolute joyrides and I found myself not being able to find a place to quit. The excitement of the game-play, the satisfaction the player achieves after solving a puzzle, not to mention the endless times one has failed a puzzle, the RAGE!!! But, in the end, we all resorted to YouTube for tutorials to get past those tedious levels, even then we were still satisfied. \nThe first Portal game provided such great mystery as to where we were, (or where Chell was), but as the levels went on, we became more and more intrigued for the ending, for that satisfactory slice of cake that GLaDOS promised us. The soundtrack of this game is absolute astonishing, and it only gets better in the sequel! I have to say I've NEVER heard any sort of music like this, and I'm glad that this game helped me discover my new favorite genre of music! (Honestly the first game nearly made me crap myself from how scary it was, oh my gosh.)\nBut, now I'll talk briefly about Portal II, for future buyers who want to give Portal's sequel a shot. It's absolutely worth every penny. I found myself playing and replaying levels for over forty hours and counting! The overall atmosphere of the remains of Aperture Science, and the little plot-twist (I'm not gonna spoil it for you ;)), though it upset me the first time, pfft, it was overall an amazing game to experience, and I'm very happy I thought about purchasing these two games even long after the popularity of the Portal franchise died down. It never died in my heart, and I'll always LOVE Portal. It's an absolute masterpiece, a time-killer, and definitely NOT a waste of your money!
