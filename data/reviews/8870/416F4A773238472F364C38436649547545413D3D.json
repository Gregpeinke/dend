Вот только это не главное.\n\nДля меня главное - эмоции, которые я получаю от игры. Знакомо чувство, когда закончилась ваша любимая книга? Это про Infinite. Самая сильная эмоциональная отдача получается тогда, когда становиться действительно не все равно на происходящее. Не просто интересно, а когда по-настоящему  втягиваешься. И чем лучше сделан сам продукт (игра, книга, фильм, сериал, не важно) тем сильнее эффект.  Infinite делали люди, которые знали, как нужно знакомить игрока с персонажами, как нужно подавать историю, где нужно рассказать, а где заставить пофантазировать; где принудить игрока действовать медленно, когда единственное желание не опоздать; как должен вести себя сопровождающий игрока NPC. В итоге получилась потрясающая игра, а Элизабет лучший игровой компаньон в мире (прости, Аликс).\n\nКогда геймплей \"тащит\", действительно, больше ничего вроде и не нужно. Вот только выключил Super Meat Boy (выбран как пример шикарного дистиллированного геймплея) - и все, забыл, эмоции закончились как только перестал играть. К счастью, это не относится к Infinite.\n\nИменно благодаря оказываемому на меня эффекту, Infinite попадает в тройку моих самых любимых игр, в компанию к The Longest Journey и Silent Hill 2","timestamp_created":1373806844,"timestamp_updated":1426791286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5122104","author":{"steamid":"76561198045288427","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":2330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1500,"last_played":1409150909},"language":"brazilian","review":"Simplesmente do caralho!","timestamp_created":1373805107,"timestamp_updated":1373805107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2374476","author":{"steamid":"76561198006523201","num_games_owned":543,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":938,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":899,"last_played":1474582536},"language":"english","review":"Not really an FPS fan but holy shit great story fun game...def worth the money.","timestamp_created":1373801052,"timestamp_updated":1373801052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2888356","author":{"steamid":"76561198014118871","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1854,"last_played":1397412081},"language":"english","review":"worth every penny","timestamp_created":1373799327,"timestamp_updated":1373799327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2596655","author":{"steamid":"76561198009786297","num_games_owned":449,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":890,"last_played":1396090331},"language":"english","review":"Its Awesome, , , , 'Nuff said","timestamp_created":1373795529,"timestamp_updated":1373795529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3512752","author":{"steamid":"76561198023993037","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":557,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":519,"last_played":1422791032},"language":"german","review":"Absolut gelungenes Spiel - das Geld lohnt sich!","timestamp_created":1373795414,"timestamp_updated":1385752102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4704469","author":{"steamid":"76561198040943872","num_games_owned":520,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":4115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":465,"last_played":1590251430},"language":"english","review":"Everything about this game screams perfect.

If anything, you might find yourself burnt out by the 40% mark. I'll elaborate on that later.\n\nBioshock Infinite is my least favourite of the Shock series (I'm biased, I played System Shock 2) but it has an impressive narrative, beautiful artwork, excellent voice acting/characters and a unique ending. However, most of the game's strengths lie in the first few hours and the final few hours. The bulk of the gameplay will have you doing the same predictable things with the same predictable enemies for several hours, unless you choose to experiment. The narrative gets ridiculous (in a bad way) by around the midpoint but it does regain its strength as you approach the ending. This doesn't really leave you with a genuine desire to finish the game, but more to end it so that the experience is out of your system.\n\nSo why buy this game?\n\nA lot of work went into the presentation and execution of this game. I'd go so far as saying the first few hours and the initial experience of Columbia was one of most aesthetically beautiful experiences I've had in a game. It only heightens the impact of when things start to go predictibly sour. It's a shame that the game could never find a way to keep the magic of the initial and final experience throughout, but it shows that modern gaming is heading in a less bland-and-shooty direction... despite still being a bland-and-shooty shooter.\n\nThese developers deserve your money. I would not recommend a purchase at full price though.

Elizabeth is by far the most convincing NPC I've seen and the proof you don't need teh same actor to do mo-cap and voice acting.","timestamp_created":1373724841,"timestamp_updated":1502550520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1307305","author":{"steamid":"76561197991114250","num_games_owned":402,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":1060,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":733,"last_played":1527316830},"language":"english","review":"2deep4me","timestamp_created":1373723545,"timestamp_updated":1373723545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7087909","author":{"steamid":"76561198085710305","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":919,"last_played":1434145063},"language":"german","review":"Packende, emotional und ebenso teils verwirrende Story die die Gehirnmasse mehr als nur einmal beansprucht.\nAlles im Alllem eines (wenn nicht das Beste) Spiel das ich in den letzten Jahren gezockt habe :)","timestamp_created":1373718420,"timestamp_updated":1422203984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4850786","author":{"steamid":"76561198042480926","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1731,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1582,"last_played":1374395661},"language":"english","review":"Definitely one of the best games I have ever played, with the biggest twist I've seen in any media.

Given the setting of the game I think so.\n\nThe symbolism in this game is a lot more obvious and forced than in 1, this does much to make the world feel richer and realistic while slightly cheapening the commodity of social critique. The ending is where you will find the real 'depth' in it's storytelling, while divisive it is at least memorable while the first hardly bears recollection. The art direction is a universally praised feature of Infinite and rightfully so, naturally it is a shame when it doesn't fully carry to the later parts of the game, into blurring the linear nature of the levels.
