What Valve did with HL2 was to create a masterpiece that revolutionized an industry and influenced the games that came later, becoming a pop culture object.\nIn Half-Life 2 they control Gordon Freeman, the scientist who survived the incident in Black Mesa, which arrives in City 17, a city controlled by Combine, an alien race that established an authoritarian regime in the city. Gordon is soon engaging in the struggle between a human strength and a Combine and a roller coaster of events that follow in one of the most memorable histories ever.\nHalf-Life 2 was developed for gaming and accounting. There are no cutscenes, a story unfolds around the protagonist and retains control over a character throughout the game.\nIt features memorable characters such as Alyx Vance, Barney, Dr Kleiner and of course the mysterious G-Man.\nVisually the game is amazing. The game engine Fonte manages to create some of the most amazing animations and environments ever seen and a physics of objects corresponding to real life. The gameplay is fluid, and there are several weapons to use, with clear highlight for a Gravity Gun that allow manipulating objects or use them as projectiles.

It's not awful but it's certainly not the heartrending masterpiece i was lead to believe it was.\n\nThe gameplay doesn't make up for it either. Combat doesn't evolve at all beyond \"shoot a gun at a man\", which can work for games with different enemy types or fast-paced gameplay, but every enemy in the game is just a slight variation of a man with a full-head helmet and hitscan weapons.\nWhile there are quite a few weapons on display, none of them feel great to use. the two automatic weapons you get are wildly inaccurate beyond 20 metres and do a pathetic amount of damage, the crossbow and magnum are decent long-range high-damage weapons but you never get ammo for them so you'll rarely use them, the grenades don't go where you aim them so trying to bounce them off a windowsill to kill someone in cover is needlessly complicated, and the rocket launcher is only slightly more effective against vehicles than blowing kisses. Possibly the only decent weapon is the shotgun, which has just enough range to almost make the SMG obsolete and enough damage with the secondary fire to kill most enemies with a single headshot. There's also gun that you can use to toss loose physics objects at things but that's only really particularly useful in one level where the game basically decorates the walls with sawblades and explosive barrels.\n\nThe level design seems intent on showcasing the game's physics engine, and it gets old fast. Often you'll have to stop some high-octane action to solve a physics puzzle, using the word \"puzzle\" as loosely as possible.  9 times out of 10 it just involves putting a physics object somewhere either as a platform or as a weight, or using the above mentioned gravity gun to move a bunch of heavy objects out of your path. sometimes the levels can be big and sprawling but they're more often than not entirely linear with little side areas that might hold a few supply crates.\n\nAs an aside: for a game all about its physics engine it has some of the most mediocre vehicle physics i've ever seen. A high-powered assault buggy handles like a homemade go-cart powered by an electric toothbrush motor and a fanboat seems to handle almost exactly the same over water. It's not the tech limitations either; halo came out in 2001 and made its jeep feel like a real car. I'm pretty sure it even lost traction on icy surfaces. beyond good and evil came out in 2003 and had a water vehicle that actually felt like it was going through water. both of these games had plenty of other content on top of vehicle sections that didn't control like an RC car on low battery.\n\nWhat finally got me to give a negative review was a bug in the second last level where the game relied on a scripted event to blow up a wall to let me progress, but it never happened. I spent half an hour shooting the infinitely respawning enemies (which hadn't occurred up until that point - if you killed all the enemies in an area they were gone for good) and dying over and over again looking for the way forward. After checking a walkthrough and seeing that an event wasn't triggering i had a look for solutions, where i was told to restart the level and hope the event worked this time. Given the level was if not the longest then certainly the most tedious thus far, i decided i had played enough. \n\nIf you want a decent shooter made by valve, get team fortress or counter strike. If you want a good puzzle game from valve, get portal. If you want a shooter with a good story, get spec ops. This game does all three fairly blandly and i can't recommend it unless your PC can't run anything else.","timestamp_created":1503325480,"timestamp_updated":1503325480,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.435206681489944458","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34395141","author":{"steamid":"76561198143311279","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1503314885},"language":"italian","review":"Che dire...
