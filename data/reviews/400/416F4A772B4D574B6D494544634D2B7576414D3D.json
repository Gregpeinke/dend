Никогда, ни в одной игре подобного жанра, мне не было настолько интересно проходить уровни и разгадывать головоломки как в этой. Portal очень инновационная игра, которая предлагает уникальный геймплей. Игроки должны решать физические головоломки и задачи, открывая порталы для маневрирования объектами и собой в пространстве. И из этого становится ясно, что главная изюминка игры это физика с использованием порталов. И если кто-то как я огорчился, что сама игра идет около 3 часов, то не расстраиваетесь. Ведь в игре есть расширенные режимы, которые обеспечивают дополнительные часы удовольствия. Но если усложненные камеры действительно интересны, то режим \"головоломки\" не рекомендую играть, так как от него у вас просто будет очень сильно бомбить.\nСюжетная составляющая игры довольна простая и поверхностная, которая сопровождается довольно забавными высказываниями от искусственного интеллекта по имени Гладос. Но стоит сказать, что сюжетный поворот и предпосылки к нему, очень удивили меня. То же самое могу сказать и про отсылку со слайдов в игре, которая указывает на то, что игра находится во вселенной Half-life.

The furniture in your room amounts to a bed, a toilet, and a wee coffee table with a radio on it; the voice informs you that you've been briefly detained in a so-called [i]'relaxation vault',[/i] and this sentence alone sets the mood of the game immediately – the mood for which Portal will be remembered and appreciated for many years to come.\n\nㅤㅤㅤYou are a test subject, a guinea pig – and you can't even recall your own name; the only way out is forward, through testing chambers of increasing difficulty, following the guidance of a robot who encourages you and announces your inevitable demise in the same impersonal, but somehow sardonic cadence. Nothing is alive here – and the frosted-glass observation rooms stare at you with their dead fluorescent eyes, revealing no discernible human shape behind them, cold and completely indifferent. Only acid pits and High Energy Pellets – which, as the robot readily informs you, [i]'can and have caused permanent disabilities such as vaporisation'[/i] – accompany you on this perilous journey.\n\nㅤㅤㅤFor the reasons mentioned above, Portal is an exciting game to play now, and it will remain an exciting game to play for as long as civilisation and electricity are a thing. It is fairly straightforward and short – I did everything there was to do in the game several times over and clocked 15 hours – but it is fundamental, in the same sense as a wheel or a button are fundamental; its key principles and discoveries are implemented in countless other games to outstanding effect. That alone is a good enough excuse to schedule a quiet Friday evening to complete Portal in one sitting. It deserves the full extent of your attention, and it gives so much in return.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2814161811\nㅤㅤㅤWhen you get through all 19 chambers and eventually finish the game, you will unlock Challenges, which is where Portal shines the brightest, [strike]frying your brain[/strike]. You're invited to complete several chapters once again, but this time with additional requirements: Least Portals, Least Time and Least Steps. This approach – allowing you to complete the same test chambers while looking at them from a different angle – is nothing short of brilliant. I had so much fun with the first two tasks, but the steps mechanic in Portal is somewhat broken due to inertia: if you press W for a fraction of a second too long, you'll take another useless step, and that's annoying. Also, when objects collide with you, it counts as a step, which makes no sense. Overall, completing all three Challenges, while undoubtedly fun, is nigh impossible without guides, unless you're exceptionally intelligent – in which case you should probably be doing rocket science, not playing videogames.\n\nㅤㅤㅤChallenges are not the only thing to keep you busy; Advanced mode adds several hurdles to familiar levels, and while you're not limited in the number of portals you place and the amount of time you spend, solving these still takes so much brainpower that, if converted to energy, would be enough to keep the Eiffel Tower all lit up for a solid month or two.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]🏆 [b]ACHIEVEMENTS[/b][/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]⚔️ CHALLENGE[/td]\n\t[td]📅 MISSABLE?[/td]\n\t[td]🩺 BROKEN?[/td]\n        [td]⏱ 100% PLAYTIME[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨⬜️⬜️[/td]\n\t[td]✔️[/td]\n\t[td]✖️[/td]\n\t[td]~13 hours[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n[quote]Most achievements have something to do with either Challenges or Advanced chambers, but you will also be tasked with completing the entire game once again while finding all radios and detaching all cameras from the walls in a single playthrough. The presence of exhaustive guides facilitates the whole ordeal by an order of magnitude, but if you're the stubborn type and don't need anyone's help, better make sure you've got your wits about you.[/quote]\nㅤㅤㅤHave you ever played a videogame with developer commentary? If yes, you already know how awesome it feels, if not – you're in for a treat. Playing Portal and being able to peek behind the scenes is not only like seeing Santa Claus when you're six, but also getting to sit on his lap, take a picture and make a wish. I never truly realised how deep and multi-layered the process of creating a videogame is, and how many issues playtesting may reveal in a product that looks perfect on the surface. For those who've been enjoying computer games since childhood, it seems baffling that some folks fail to understand the key concepts which are second nature to some and utterly alien for others – for instance, simply looking up when controlling a character in first person. Portal devs will reveal this and many other secrets to you, and it's insightful enough to warrant a third playthrough.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2814156069\nㅤㅤㅤ📌So, do I recommend Portal? I actually can't recommend it enough. GLaDOS – the impersonal, murderous robot – and her unnerving jokes made the initial journey extremely fun, if a little stressful, and the inventive gameplay additions kept me coming back for more. Ignoring Portal, assuming you've never played it before, is akin to robbing yourself of a good time. Why would you do that?\n[h3][b]After completing all Testing Chambers, visit [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41449676/]our Enrichment Centre[/url] for more high-quality reviews.

Это здешний искусственный интеллект, так называемая GladOS, который следит за твоими успехами и фиксирует результаты. У него имеются забавные понятия о том, что для людей является наивысшей наградой. В конце испытаний нам обещают, ни много ни мало - тортик. Да-да, именно тортик, ведь это высший приз для человека!\n\nВ процессе игры, GladOS подбадривает игрока, а иногда и выказывает неодобрение, что смешит ещё больше.\nЕсть лёгкие тесты, есть такие чтоб подумать, но когда узнаёшь логику игры, правила и закономерности перемещения с помощью порталов, всё получается само собой.\n\nИгра от первого лица, хорошая графика, смешные мелкие роботы, писклявым голосом говорящие \"веду поиск\" и \"цель обнаружена\", когда находишься в их зоне действия - это твои противники в игре. Хотя противники - это сильно сказано, они скорее как автоматические турели, которых надо избегать, а по возможности ломать.\nЕсть и вспомогательные предметы, такие как куб, который можно таскать с собой и по-разному использовать, например сбросить на голову писклявому роботу.\nИ, конечно же, порталы, один - вход, другой - выход, оранжевый и синий, множество способов расположения и применения в зависимости от ситуации.\n\nЭто отличная игра от создателей Half-life, с юмором и интересными испытаниями.\nНеповторимое ощущение, когда, выполнив непростое задание, выходишь на новый уровень и смотришь как загорится белым светом стенд испытаний, на котором в виде рисунков указано, что тебя ждёт здесь, в этой тестовой камере, и тогда - вперёд! К новым приключениям в мире порталов.\n\nС нетерпением жду продолжения,новой части игры","timestamp_created":1654401296,"timestamp_updated":1657421446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116504404","author":{"steamid":"76561199236368277","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":860,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":860,"last_played":1654399929},"language":"english","review":"Great for people who aren't used to shooting, except for a few parts where you can't advance unless you make quick and perfect shots.","timestamp_created":1654400167,"timestamp_updated":1654400167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116502732","author":{"steamid":"76561199110944372","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":252,"last_played":1654493997},"language":"english","review":"HOLY SHIT THIS FRANCHISE IS SO GOOD","timestamp_created":1654396989,"timestamp_updated":1654396989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116501180","author":{"steamid":"76561198195498227","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1658845392},"language":"english","review":"mmmmm yummy yummy cake mmmmmm yumy yum","timestamp_created":1654393967,"timestamp_updated":1654393967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116500025","author":{"steamid":"76561198395503420","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1654444837},"language":"english","review":":D","timestamp_created":1654391783,"timestamp_updated":1654391783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116499934","author":{"steamid":"76561198857357315","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":260,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1654900192},"language":"english","review":"as sweet as moist cake","timestamp_created":1654391614,"timestamp_updated":1654896402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116498025","author":{"steamid":"76561199074419362","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":812,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":788,"last_played":1659117259},"language":"english","review":"wow, just wow","timestamp_created":1654387842,"timestamp_updated":1654387842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116494375","author":{"steamid":"76561199255487540","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":196,"last_played":1654369455},"language":"english","review":"A very fun and engaging puzzle game with great mechanics and out of the box thinking.

W grze mamy 19 poziomów + 1 poziom, sześć zaawansowanych map oraz wyzwania za medale. Gameplay jest niestety krótki. Portala przeszedłem w cztery i pół godziny, nie przechodząc wszystkich zaawansowanych map (jak dobrze pamiętam przeszedłem dwa lub trzy poziomy zaawansowane) oraz wyzwań. Grafika jest w porządku, nic do niej nie mam. Soundtrack jest świetny, według mnie pasuje do gry idealnie i warto go przesłuchać na YouTube. Łamigłówki i poziomy również są bardzo dobrze zrobione, wszystkie mają sens, choć czasami trzeba trochę dłużej pogłówkować nad nimi. Żadnych bugów nie doświadczyłem podczas grania. Jednym minusem, który aż boli, to perspektywa która czasami może się zrąbać po wyrzuceniu gracza przez portal. Fabuły jest stosunkowo mało i nie jest ona najwyższych lotów. Easter eggi również występują i są one ciekawe, warto poszukać ich na własną rękę albo znaleźć na necie. Napisy końcowe mnie zaciekawiły do takiego stanu, że aż postanowiłem zostać do końca, co jest w moim wypadku bardzo rzadkie. Ogólnie polecam serdecznie zakupić gierkę i zagrać w nią, zdecydowanie jest warta uwagi i zagrania, a za małą cenę dostarczy zabawy na godziny.[/b]\n\n[h1]7/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1654373890,"timestamp_updated":1656695077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116488928","author":{"steamid":"76561198309799092","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1637780291},"language":"brazilian","review":"Obra prima!","timestamp_created":1654372763,"timestamp_updated":1654372763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116487522","author":{"steamid":"76561198949464830","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":280,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":267,"last_played":1658512395},"language":"spanish","review":"portal empieza con P de papanamericana","timestamp_created":1654370631,"timestamp_updated":1654370631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116487408","author":{"steamid":"76561199278161804","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1177,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1078,"last_played":1658974508},"language":"english","review":"i dont really got much to say but its a great game","timestamp_created":1654370480,"timestamp_updated":1654370480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+MWKmIEDcM+uvAM="}
