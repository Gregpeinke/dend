Kinda like left 4 dead meets battlefield. Like left 4 dead, you and teammates fight crowds of monsters comming at you. There is no safe room to run to, just a pre-set number of waves of enemies.  After each wave is finished you and your teammates run to a shop to purchase/repair your weapons and armor. More teamwork oriented than left 4 dead, as you can only level up one of your perks by healing teammates, and running off will get you killed pretty fast. Like the battlefield games you choose perks, which act like classes. Everyone has access to the same weapons and equipment, but the more you level your perks, the better you get at specific items related to that perk. Graphics are outdated, but good aesthetics and level design help to offset this. Highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1311060398,"timestamp_updated":1311060398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3424759","author":{"steamid":"76561198022467923","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1383,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1383,"last_played":1343026800},"language":"english","review":"Played Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 and I have to say I like this game more.
