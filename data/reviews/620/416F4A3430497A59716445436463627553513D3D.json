Nie żałuję.\nPortal 2 z pozoru wydaje się być całkiem nudną grą. Logiczne zagadki, wykonywanie testów... Jednak, jak się okazuje, jest całkiem ciekawy. Już na początku gra bawi i prezentuje się całkiem fajnie. W trakcie gry występuje wiele zabawnych i ciekawych sytuacji.\n Angielski dubbing jest po prostu świetny, gra aktorska daje nam wrażenie brania udziału w prawdziwej konwersacji mimo tego, że poza nami są same maszyny. Muzyka idealnie wpasowana w klimat, a świat gry wykonany perfekcyjnie pod każdym względem, więc trudno mi było doszukiwać się jakichkolwiek błędów. Byłem mile zaskoczony jak ta gra jest dobra, nie spodziewałem się tego po grze na silniku source. Ciekawa, zabawna, wciągająca - inaczej nie potrafię tego opisać.\nPortal jest dosyć specyficzną grą, gdzie rozwiązanie, nad którym myśleliśmy pół godziny, tak na prawdę okazuje się banalne. Gra pobudza nas do myślenia i jest moim zdaniem godna polecenia.\nKażdy powinien choć raz zagrać w

Sadly, if you don't have any friends, you won't be able to play the co-op, but in my opinion, the singleplayer alone would be worth your money.\n\nYour problem solving skills will come to a test while playing this, but the story alone in this game is something to love; Portal 2 is a perfect example of great narration and character interaction with the player. The characters are enjoyable and the gameplay is easy enough to master. You can explore and find easter eggs that tell you more about the plot and the world you're in.\n\nThe co-op is also entertaining. Puzzles that you have to solve with a friend? Nothing could be more fun! The commands help communication alot - you can watch your friend in a small window to see what he sees, and with the easy commands you can tell your friend what to do. You practically don't need voice chat at all, but it does help alot! The puzzles in the game are fun as well, as the small storyline that goes along with the co-op - nothing major, but still enjoyable. And the community maps are endless - you can always get more community made maps, that can be wonderful to play through!\n\nTL;DR: 10/10, would play again. Must buy game if on sale in Steam!\n\nYou can also have a drinking game with a friend, if one of you fails, take a shot.
