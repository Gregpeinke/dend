: Half-Life Source\n\"การรีมาสเตอร์ที่แย่ที่สุดที่เคยมีมาของ Valve!\"\n\nต้องบอกก่อนว่าผมเนี่ยรักซีรี่ย์เกม Half Life มากๆ ยกให้เป็นหนึ่งในดวงใจตลอดกาล ผ่านมา 20 ปี ผมก็ยังคงบอกและยังคงพูดเสมอว่าหนึ่งในดวงใจคือ Half Life มันคือซีรี่ย์เกมคอมแรกๆ ที่ผมได้สัมผัส เรียกได้ว่าผมหลงไหลซีรี่ย์เกมชุดนี้ตังแต่ได้เล่นเลยก็ว่าได้ แต่นี่คือความผิดพลาดของซีรี่ย์ชุดนี้ ซีรี่ย์ที่ผมรัก มันคือการนำภาคแรกมารีมาสเตอร์ โดยเปลี่ยนไปใช้ Source Engine จากเดิมทีจะเป็น GoldSrc แล้วมันไม่ดีตรงไหน? เดี๋ยวเราจะมาพูดกัน..\n\n(ขอรวบเนื้อเรื่องในเกมย่อๆเลยละกันเพราะส่วนใหญ่ก็น่าจะรู้กันหมดแล้ว)\nเนื้อเรื่องในเกมนี้เกิดขึ้นในช่วงปี 200X (ไม่ระบุ) ณ สถาบันวิจัย Black Mesa เราจะได้รับบทเป็น Dr. Gordon Freeman ที่เพิ่งสำเร็จการศึกษาจาก MIT ในสาขาฟิสิกส์เชิงทฤษฎี ได้เข้าร่วมการทดลองที่เกี่ยวข้องกับคริสตัลของมนุษย์ต่างดาว แต่การทดลองที่ดูเหมือนจะราบรื่นนั้น ก็ได้เกิดเหตุไม่คาดฝันเกิดขึ้น การทดลองเกิดผิดพลาด ทำให้เอเลี่ยนจากมิติ Xen บุกเข้ามายังโลก และ Gordon จะต้องหาวิธีเอาตัวรอด และหาทางกำจัด Nihilanth เอเลี่ยนตัวแม่ลงให้ได้!! (เนื้อเรื่องเหมือนเดิมทุกอย่าง ไม่มีการเพิ่มเติม เคยเล่นแบบไหนก็จะได้เล่นแบบนั้นเป๊ะๆ)\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2786999417\n\nเกมเพลย์ในเกมยังคงเหมือนกันฉบับ Classic 100% ไม่มีอะไรเพิ่มเข้ามา การยิงการเดินการควบคุมเหมือนเดิมเป๊ะๆ เรียกได้ว่าหากเคยเล่นฉบับดั้งเดิมมาแล้วจะจับเป็นทันที ในตัวรีมาสเตอร์ตัวนี้จะมีระบบฟิสิกส์เพิ่มเข้ามานิดๆหน่อยๆ ช่วยเสริมให้บางฉากมีความสมจริงมากขึ้นจากเดิมมากๆ\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787004514\n\nแต่ไอ้ระบบฟิสิกส์ที่เพิ่มเข้ามาเนี่ย ทำให้เกิดบัคที่เราจะเหมือนโดน Object ในฉากสร้างดาเมจให้กับตัวเรา หรือเหมือนโดน Object ผลักกระเด็น ทำให้บางครั้งเราจะตายเพราะไปเดินเบียดแล้วกระเด็นตัวลอยแล้วตกจากที่สูง (อันนี้ผมเคยโดนอยู่ 2 ครั้งเห็นจะได้) การดรอปของตามกล่องที่อยู่ในเกมจะตายตัว ไม่มีแบบขาดกระสุน ดรอปกระสุน ขาดเลือดก็ดรอปยาอะไรงี้ ไม่มีนะครับ ถ้าเกิดว่าโดนยิงใกล้ตายถ้าไม่โหลดเซฟไปเริ่มใหม่ ก็ต้องแบกสังขาลใกล้ตายไปทุบกล่องหายาให้ได้.. ถือว่ายังคงเสน่ห์ความลากเลือดได้ดี ระดับความยากในเกมก็ยังคงมีให้เลือกเหมือนเดิม โดยความยากในเกมจะมีอยู่ด้วยกันสามระดับ \n\nระบบ Gore System ก็ยังมีเหมือนเดิม แต่จะไม่สามารถตีศพซ้ำได้ เกมจะเพิ่ม Ragdoll Physics เข้ามาเสริมในส่วนตรงนี้ด้วย เวลาโดนระเบิดก็จะตัวปลิวไปเลย แต่ภาคนี้ผมรู้สึกว่าบางครั้ง Hitbox ตัวศัตรูมันแปลกๆ แบบผมยิงโดนแต่ดันไม่มีดาเมจซะงั้น หรือบอสอย่าง Nihilanth เนี่ยยิง Rpg ออกไปยังไม่โดนตัวเลยโดนอากาศข้างๆก็ระเบิด เหมือน Hitbox ของเจ้า Nihilanth เนี่ยมันใหญ่เกิน\n \nHalf Life Source ได้ยกเครื่องใหม่ด้วย Source Engine ที่เคยใช้ใน Half Life 2 มาแล้ว และมันก็ได้ให้รายละเอียดพื้นผิวการสะท้อนของแสง เอฟเฟกแสง เงา และ น้ำ ทำออกมาได้ดีมากๆ แต่รายละเอียดด้าน Texture นั้น ไม่ได้มีการปรับปรุงอะไรเลย Texture ในเกมจะเป็นแบบ Original Texture ไม่ใช่ High Definition แต่อย่างใด\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787000245\n\nหลายๆอย่างที่ผมเจอในเกมนี้บอกเลย มีทั้งอีหยังวะจนไปถึงปวดหัวเลยก็มี เพราะเกมมันบัคเยอะมากๆ แบบเยอะจัดๆ เหมือนทำออกมาแล้วทิ้งเลย ไม่กงไม่แก้อะไรมันละ และมันพังไปยันสคริปเกม แบบศัตรูไม่ออกมาอะไรทำนองนี้\n\n(สรุป)\nHalf Life Source ควรซื้อติดกับแพค Valve Complete Pack ไปเลยดีกว่า ไม่ควรซื้อแยก เพราะมันห่วยมากๆ ไปเล่นต้นฉบับยังไม่เจออะไรแบบนี้เลย หากตังเหลือก็ไปกดเกมอื่นซะครับ ไม่ต้องสนใจมัน ไปเล่นตัวเก่าดีกว่าสบายใจกว่าเยอะ หรือถ้าอยากลองพบบัคแปลกๆแบบอีหยังวะก็เชิญหามาเล่นกันครับ แต่เกมนี้ก็ยังมีข้อดีตรงหากใครมี Gmod หรือเล่น Gmod ก็หาภาคนี้เก็บไว้ด้วยนะครับเผื่อได้ใช้\n\n\nSCORE  ( ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ 🖤 🖤 🖤 🖤 🖤 🖤

Халтура представляет из себя оставленные текстуры 98 года, а с отражением явно переборщили. Огромный плюс, так это красивейшая вода и неплохое освещение, вот что спасает ваши глаза от халтуры. Оружия тоже переделали в лучшую сторону, но со стрельбой у некоторых есть проблемы, тот же разброс, который мне напоминает стрельбу из Cs: Source. \nЭто я считаю достаточным содержанием, которое описывает игру. Half Life: Source - это скорее не ремастер, а эксперимент от Valve, которые решили проверить, как их новый движок покажет себя в деле.

Source is a POS game.

In Blast Pit a Security Guard who is supposed to be killed by one of the tentacles doesn't die and as a result the two NPCs will be locked in a never ending battle. The Gonarch doesn't attack you nor spawn baby head crabs. In one map the skybox smears, Sound effects like footsteps, buttons and doors and the crowbar hitting things are messed up. The Music files will stop playing during level transitions. Certain enemies don't spawn, corpses are static, lack the rag-doll physics. The flash light glitches during the conveyor belt maze in Residue Processing. Barnacle tongues aren't rendered properly, The Nihilanth's portal ball attack are indestructible. Some AH-64 Apache helicopters have more HP than others. In other instances like in We've Got Hostiles the first HECU soldier that you encounter will shoot at you instead of the scientist, which drastically kills the moment, and if you hurt the scientist who screams \"FOR GOD'S SAKE OPEN THE SILO DOORS! IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE!\" he will stop, skip the scripted event and open the door to the Security Guard, thus enabling you to skip that entire map. The scientist will float above his chair in Anomalous Materials. This game is just terrible. So many bugs... If I were you I'd play Crowbar Collective's Black Mesa instead.

Half-Life is iconic and it sucks that Valve hasn't done anything themselves to provide a great way to play. This source port of the original makes it easier to run from a compatibility setting but still runs based on restrictions from the 90's. I must recommend to anyone who wishes to play Half-Life that they go buy Black Mesa.\n\nBlack Mesa is the remake that this likely should've been. It improves the quality and feel of the game. It also makes it closer to the gameplay that can be seen Half-Life 2. It does make some changes to levels and mechanics but largely for the betterment of the game while keeping story and iconic moments intact. \n\nBy all means, buy this if you wish or play the original Half-Life but I can't say it is quite as enjoyable of an experience in 2022 as Black Mesa would be.\n\nBlack Mesa: https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/","timestamp_created":1647378821,"timestamp_updated":1647378821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565122008323669434","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112253812","author":{"steamid":"76561198416113197","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":477,"last_played":1612651058},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1647374716,"timestamp_updated":1647374716,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112245893","author":{"steamid":"76561199053207229","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":874,"last_played":1649058164},"language":"russian","review":"топ не за свои деньги\n","timestamp_created":1647364183,"timestamp_updated":1647364183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112238823","author":{"steamid":"76561199098321337","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1649948682},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogue o half life normal ao invés de jogar isso","timestamp_created":1647355049,"timestamp_updated":1647355049,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112223219","author":{"steamid":"76561198365122597","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1649502424},"language":"english","review":"It's buggy, and you should play half life first, but it's pretty fun for a second playthrough.","timestamp_created":1647326382,"timestamp_updated":1647326382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112195072","author":{"steamid":"76561199174371188","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":873,"playtime_last_two_weeks":66,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1659822976},"language":"brazilian","review":"sim\n","timestamp_created":1647295212,"timestamp_updated":1647295212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112132982","author":{"steamid":"76561199068848865","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45,"last_played":1658934236},"language":"english","review":"n","timestamp_created":1647200936,"timestamp_updated":1647200936,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112122428","author":{"steamid":"76561199104122270","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":688,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1656932826},"language":"russian","review":"почему все хейтят хл соурс прикольно же","timestamp_created":1647190553,"timestamp_updated":1647190553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mqaNwv8CfKPbqwM="}
