Not only did we get that. We also got another co-op campaign with its own story and puzzle, and were surprisingly long and fleshed out as well. Later on they also added a community support so that we can make our own chamber and share it with the community. After a long time i have actually played a game that was genuinely funny and the co-op was magical as it can bring two people together like no other co-op game can.

Portal 2 takes the original game and expands on it, incorporating more of a Half-Life feel while retaining the humor and puzzle-focus of the first. Actually, scratch that, it's funnier and more puzzling than the first game. After playing Portal 1, I was left with the impression that it would be a real challenge to expand on the game without it being instantly repetitive, but Portal 2 proved me very, very wrong. The scene direction is cinematic and engaging right from the start, the atmosphere is incredibly immersive - gigantic areas surrounding the puzzles simply dwarf the player. There's a real feel of insanity to the place [i](almost reminiscent of Bioshock at times)[/i], a story that gives you an actual purpose and drive to move forward, and most importantly, despite being much longer than Portal 1 - not once did I get bored.\n\nThe puzzles are obviously the main focus of the game and for the most part they're fun and full of [i]\"ah-hah!\"[/i] moments. Most of the puzzles are fairly simple, maybe requiring a few minutes of thought. More than a couple of times I got stuck on a puzzle for an hour or so, decided to leave the game and come back to it with a clear head and solved it almost immediately - this is a game where over thinking a puzzle makes it appear harder than it really is, and to me that speaks volumes about the effort that went into its design. If you find yourself doing something tedious, you're probably over-looking the simple solution. There [i]ARE[/i] occasions where this doesn't seem to hold true, where even upon solving a puzzle I was left with the impression that I must have done it wrong, but these events are few and far between and still manage to elicit a sense of achievement.\n\nThe acting is fantastic and the dialogue is hilarious throughout - I haven't laughed quite this much at movies in recent years, let alone at game dialogue, but I was hooked on the characters from the beginning. For me though, [i]THE[/i] most remarkable aspect of the game is the sound and music. The audio is immediately noticable in quality, with each area corridor and texture having a fitting reverb, and the soundtrack reflecting your actions. Different portions of the same room can feel drastically different to eachother just through the audio, and it really helps to give the game a sense of scale and forboding. Simply put, the audio comes across as more clever than the rest of the game at times, which is something I had never really experienced before.\n\n[b]To summarize[/b]: Portal 2 took an already near-perfect game and improved it in pratically every way. It's probably in my top 10 games of all time now. I couldn't recommend it more.","timestamp_created":1394403926,"timestamp_updated":1398900447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9403578","author":{"steamid":"76561198063544301","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":8524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8164,"last_played":1493254004},"language":"english","review":"My ony problem with Portal 2 is that it ended.
