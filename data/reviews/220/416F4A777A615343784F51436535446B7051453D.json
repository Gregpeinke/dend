Pretty good. High resolution, high poly, map detailing was good, everything was drawn well.\n\nGameplay: 10/10. Weapons, enemies, and maps are balanced, unique, and just plain fun. I rarely got stuck, and everything was just fun to do. There are some mechanics that were just fucking amazing (not gonna spoil though). There aren't any damage sponges or overpowered weapons, and there are no direct weapon upgrades (as in every weapon is useful in some situation). The levels are well designed and there are plenty of enemies to keep things interesting. I would go so far as to call the gameplay \"really fucking awesome\". I'd give it 15-20 hours playtime (took me 20, but i kinda suck at it).\nOn to one of my few big complaints: the vehicle sections. They're good, but they just get repetitive. It's boring. I still enjoyed them overall, but towards the end of each one i really just wanted it to be over.\nThe final boss sucked. It was easy, boring, and anticlimatic. I say this as someone that's not very good at FPS.\n\nMusic: 10/10. During some intense fights, music will play. It's awesome. The music is good. Not much to say.\n\nActing: 2/10. I'm writing this for the sole purpose of ranting about how ridiculously shitty the acting is. The voice acting, the expressions, the movements, the timing, and the script itself are just terrible. It's cringey on top of annoying on top of i hate these characters. Breen and the G man are exempt from all of this, they're awesome. Alyx is partially exempt, she was bearable. Same with Father Grigori. But Barney, Eli, Dr. Kleiner, and all the NPCs were just the fucking worst. On second thought, Breen was really fucking perfect and awesome. He almost makes up for the other characters.\n\nStory: 10/10. Answers almost every question half life left, then makes twice as many. It's dramatic and full of world building. There are tons of areas that tell a story, just cool tiny details in general. It really makes you hate the combine. The story itself is good. Pretty simple, kinda standard dystopian sci-fi. Now that i think about it, it's not the actual story i'm talking about, it's more just creating a world and making you feel like this is a real universe. That's what gets a 10/10. Really, the story gets like a 5/10. [spoiler]I wanna give an example of what i'm trying to say: Towards the end of the game, i walked into an apartment with a dead, rotting corpse sitting relaxed in an armchair. His arms were on the armrests, he was sitting back, and his TV was on. The combine had stormed in there and shot the guy dead before he could get up or react at all. He was 100% innocent, and he died watching propaganda. It was just murder for the sake of murder. That's the kind of shit i consider really good wordbuilding.[/spoiler]\n\nDifficulty: Pretty easy. There were a couple hard parts, but nothing that was [i]hard[/i] hard. Then again, i played on easy, so i guess it's exactly what it says. Not much got boring, everything still had some challenge to it, even if i wouldn't call it hard.\n\nConclusion: 9/10. Don't wait for a sale, the game is 100% worth it. It's really good.","timestamp_created":1531310072,"timestamp_updated":1531310072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43462236","author":{"steamid":"76561198139013128","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":657,"last_played":1533836423},"language":"russian","review":"Хороший экшон,тупые союзники боты","timestamp_created":1531306507,"timestamp_updated":1531306507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43462143","author":{"steamid":"76561198152924278","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1009,"last_played":1645675039},"language":"russian","review":"Достойная игра.","timestamp_created":1531306114,"timestamp_updated":1625060566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43462066","author":{"steamid":"76561198024095245","num_games_owned":1498,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":543,"last_played":1374790054},"language":"english","review":"Don't buy this, the game was never completed.
