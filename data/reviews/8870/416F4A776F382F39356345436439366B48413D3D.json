But unlike the original Bioshock You can't carry all your weapons and it's much more  linear. The first issue you would notice with the game is that the citizens in this game are set-dressing as they offer nothing and do nothing but stare at you. The story of this game is all over the place and you can tell that it revels in being overly complicated. It's not enough that they involve you going to other universes but also all the universes that are in the game doesn't make sense. For example, at one point in the game you go to a universe where Booker is helping a revolution on Columbia but that  Booker died so though the rest of the game you stay in that universe but yet you don't meet the Elizabeth of that universe. Just some of the bigger plot holes of this game.

Очень классный сюжет, лучше чем у первой части даже. Первую часть очень ждал, прошел 3 раза, вторая послабее была, а вот третью практически не ждал, делали долго, да и другие игры были. Но результат потрясающий, все сделано в фирменном стиле, даже то что игра вобщем то про тоже, что утопию не построишь не сказывается плохо - все воспринимается не как \"опять про тоже самое\", а как фишка. Чтобы вкурить все детали сюжета пришлось лезть в википедию, в нем куча нюансов и роль персонажей не всегда до конца понятна. Возвращение в Рапчур на 5 минут - не думал что вызовет такие эмоции, надеюсь DLC будут классными.\nОчень рекомендую.\n\n==================\nДопишу про Episode 2\n==================\n\n10/10 Дополнение на уровне Half Life Episode 2, с той лишь разницей, что это финальная глава серии и финальная игра Irrational games. Левин расставил все точки в сюжете и в сюжетных линиях персонажей - получилось жестоко. Весь второй эпизод пропитан безысходностью, буквально все вокруг говорит - этот город поглотит всех кто в нем живет. Отлично дополняется история Фонтейна и Райана, становиться еще более понятно, почему в оригинальном Биошоке населению так конкретно свернуло крышу - вся монструозность этих двух полностью раскрывается именно здесь. Финал потрясающий и просто опустошительный, продолжения не будет, у Левина хватило яиц сделать именно финал, без всяких лазеек, если кто-то и будет продолжать франшизу - это будет другой Биошок. Изменился и геймплей, теперь это стелс, временами кривоватый, но все равно играбельно, понимаю, Элизабет, палящая и дробовика направо и налево, выглядела бы немного странно. Советую всем, причем советую пройти все с самой первой части, на мой взгляд вторая часть немного выбивается и всего повествования, вся суть содержиться в первой части, Infinite и эпизодах, они и заканчивают линию первого Биошока.","timestamp_created":1382902052,"timestamp_updated":1396215197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7496758","author":{"steamid":"76561197993361570","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1655,"last_played":1497817772},"language":"english","review":"This game is by far the best game I've ever played.

Отличный сюжет который запутан, но тем не менее хорошо подан разработчиками (давненько я такого не видел). \n\nПерсонаж Элизабет это вообще отдельная тема, мало того что она очень обаятельная, так она \"живая\", создается даже некое впечатление что играешь в кооперативе. Отличный звук с хорошим позиционированием (объемностью) не у каждой игры оно хорошее. Графика тоже на уровне. Ни одного бага и ни одного вылета за всю игру, это отлично. Отличная механика и геймплей. Хорошо продуманная концовка которая гарантированно вас удивит и оставит под впечатлением (Кстати после титров будет продолжение кому интересно посмотрите). \n\nКогда все вокруг очень хорошо отзывались об этой игре я не понимал, не верил, что, не ужели игра так хороша ?

However, once I decided to finally just get past the checkpoint system and play the game, I was rewarded with one of the most gripping stories and emotionally complex characters I've ever seen in a game. While there are things from the first Bioshock I feel are superior (save system, hacking minigame, more than 2 weapon slots), Infinite's story and atmosphere are stellar. It also has probably the best ending I've ever seen in a video game.
