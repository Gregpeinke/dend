These platforms are also capable of moving through portals if placed correctly. The game also introduces levitation holograms which can also be used through portals to reach new areas without relying on momentum-conservation through portals. \n\nStory-wise, the developers decided to add a very loveable character named Wheatley, a worker bot that runs on rails with a thick English West country accent. He follows you along through your quest to once again escape from Aperture Laboratories until he unfortunately reincarnates an old nemesis. \n\nIt was very refreshing to finally quit doing trials over and over again in white rooms. In this game, you learn about the history of Aperture Laboratories, the birth of GLaDOS, the creator of Aperture, other test subjects, etc. In the first game, you only got to see glimpses behind the walls of the testing chamber. In this game, about 80 percent of it is spent in the chambers themselves. \n\nOver all, the game is a vast improvement on the first game. In terms of time-frame, it took twice as long to beat and I haven't even TOUCHED the co-op portion of the game yet. If I ever get to it, I'll put my 2 cents on that as well. If you are a hardcore puzzler, I'd say buy it ASAP. If you're not very good at puzzlers and get irritated when you can't figure out the solution, I'd say wait for a sale to pick it up.","timestamp_created":1453419136,"timestamp_updated":1453419136,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470446318387985229","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20668305","author":{"steamid":"76561198143997493","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":2772,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":512,"last_played":1574098761},"language":"english","review":"After I played both Portal and Portal 2, all I can say is 10/10.\n\nGood storylines, gameplay, music and everything.\nEverything is so clever and brilliant.\n>Portal\n>Artificial intelligence\n>Momentum\n<And other science stuff..","timestamp_created":1453414375,"timestamp_updated":1453414375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20667630","author":{"steamid":"76561198090580645","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1365,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1587606434},"language":"english","review":"Portal 3 please?","timestamp_created":1453411732,"timestamp_updated":1453411732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20667580","author":{"steamid":"76561198171648301","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":254,"last_played":1491533189},"language":"english","review":"Fun Game If You Want A Game That Can Run On A Not So Good Computer","timestamp_created":1453411556,"timestamp_updated":1453411556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20667565","author":{"steamid":"76561198102710123","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":400,"last_played":1629153596},"language":"polish","review":"Bardzo dobra gra logiczna, niebanalne zagadki, elementy zręcznościowe, wciągająca historia.

Je dirais même qu'il s'agit de deux incontournables du jeux vidéo.\n\n\tQuel défaut pourrait-on trouver à Portal 2 ? Certains le trouvent trop court. Je ne trouve pas qu'il soit court, il faut une bonne douzaine d'heures pour finir le solo, ce à quoi s'ajoute un mode coop scénarisé d'une grande qualité aussi. Sans compter le contenu du workshop, qui en fait un jeux au contenu infini, étant donné que chacun peut créer ses propres salles  de test, voire campagne, grâce à un éditeur de niveau très puissant directement intégré au menu principal. En plus de cela, cet éditeur est facile à prendre en main (ensuite bien sûr, il faut avoir les idées, mais tout est fait pour que n'importe qui puisse créer ses propres puzzles).\n\n\tL'histoire prend place immédiatement après la fin du premier (qu'il faut avoir fait pour comprendre le scénario, mais aussi parce qu'il est excellent). Le scénario distille des indices sur l'univers de Valve (puisque je le rappelle, Half Life et Portal partagent le même univers) et on en apprend plus sur Aperture et un peu sur Black Mesa. Il faudra faire preuve de beaucoup d'attention dans les détails et bien écouter les dialogues pour comprendre un peu mieux cet incroyable background que Valve à créer. D'ailleurs, Valve nous prouve qu'ils sont des développeurs de génie. Et ce, pour tout un tas de raison.\n\n\tCelle qui m'a le plus surpris, c'est la gestion du moteur source, qui a tout de même 12 ans à présent. Bien sûr, il s'agit d'une version améliorée, mais au fond, c'est le moteur que Valve à utilisé en 2004 pour Half-Life 2 (et CS:S), et il est toujours aussi magnifique. La gestion de la physique donne lieu une mise en scène à couper le souffle. Les animations sont incroyablement fluides, la lumière hyper réaliste. Valve à créer un moteur qui ne vieillit pas, et qu'il maîtrise, bien sûr, à la perfection. On en a plein les yeux.\n\n\tEt plein les oreilles. Valve livre une véritable leçon de sound design. Une leçon de jeux vidéo d'ailleurs, car la mise en scène est irréprochable également. Pour en revenir au son, il faut bien se rendre compte que chaque action, chaque objet, chaque élément de gameplay est accompagné d'un instrument qui s'ajoute et se retire naturellement à la musique du jeux. Musique d'ailleurs, comme pour le premier Portal, géniale.\n\n\tL'humour est...fabuleux, là encore. On ne cesse de rire grâce aux personnages, aux dialogues très bien écrits, aux situations,  au scénario en lui-même quelque part. Le tout aurait pu être très sérieux (c'est d'ailleurs le cas, je vous rassure) mais l'humour est superbement dosé. Désolé, difficile d'échapper aux superlatifs quand on parle de Portal. Point très important : le doublage français est EXCELLENT. Enfin un jeux en anglais d'origine qui profite de doublages français aussi bons que les doublages originaux.\n\n\tJe ne trouve réellement pas  de défaut à ce chef-d’œuvre du jeux vidéo. Le gameplay est tout simplement parfait. Le level design en général, et les puzzles plus particulièrement, sont toujours aussi bien conçus (un peu facile par moment, mais suffisamment robuste pour proposer au joueur une période de réflexion indispensable à la résolution de l'énigme). \n\n\tPortal 2 est sorti en 2012, et depuis Valve ne développe plus de nouveaux jeux (en tout cas, aucun n'a été officialisé), trop concentrés sur Steam, Counter Strike : Global Offensive, le moteur source 2, leurs machines (steam link, steam controller) et surtout les chapeaux ! Pourtant je nourris encore l'espoir qu'il sortiront un nouveau jeux scénarisé (pourquoi pas une nouvelle franchise). Il est clair et net que Valve à révolutionné le jeux vidéo, et chacun de leurs jeux, autant solo que multi, sont des perles.\n\n\tValve, chapeau.
