After becoming a huge fan of this game a year or two later after its release, I played it many times over, and even had 2 Portal-themed birthdays and owned a plethora of Portal merchandise plastered all over my room.\n\nI had a sudden urge to go back and play the game after many years from my other playthroughs, and I was [i]not[/i] disappointed. This game has some of the best art, graphics, voice acting, gameplay, lore and story of its entire decade. It truly was even better than I had recalled, and it might possibly be my favorite game ever. Because of this, I was intensely compelled to write this review, and am so glad I was able to enjoy this game.\n\nTL;DR: Best game [b]EVER[/b].","timestamp_created":1586075975,"timestamp_updated":1586075975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66654337","author":{"steamid":"76561199041303422","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1650135063},"language":"german","review":"sqwaecws","timestamp_created":1586074033,"timestamp_updated":1586074033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66654279","author":{"steamid":"76561198449315815","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":725,"last_played":1586195682},"language":"russian","review":"нормас","timestamp_created":1586073953,"timestamp_updated":1586073953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66652987","author":{"steamid":"76561197972556970","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":846,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":531,"last_played":1602129253},"language":"english","review":"Significantly better than Portal 1 in every way.","timestamp_created":1586072300,"timestamp_updated":1586072300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66651254","author":{"steamid":"76561198089677112","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1379,"last_played":1657251764},"language":"english","review":"Classic game, all i have to say.","timestamp_created":1586069978,"timestamp_updated":1586069978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66651193","author":{"steamid":"76561199027869959","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":598,"last_played":1656297418},"language":"english","review":"great game, lots of laughs and makes you feel like a real genius when you figure out the puzzles","timestamp_created":1586069884,"timestamp_updated":1586069884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66651146","author":{"steamid":"76561198005149469","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":2650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1581,"last_played":1618941698},"language":"english","review":"its an nice game","timestamp_created":1586069830,"timestamp_updated":1586069830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66651107","author":{"steamid":"76561198163929301","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1187,"last_played":1610732257},"language":"english","review":"Seems okay","timestamp_created":1586069779,"timestamp_updated":1586069779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66650132","author":{"steamid":"76561198126791191","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1653346521},"language":"english","review":"I beat this on my xbox, and have played co op on computer with my friends.
