Despite being the latest game in the series, however, it plots back chronologically in a superb effort to connect the overlapping BioShock story. At first glance Infinite does not look like a BioShock game; its colourful and vibrant, the exact opposite of its predecessor games and their Rapture setting. And although this may throw some newcomers off at first, Infinite is in fact more BioShock than anything before it.\n\nPersonally, I found BioShock: Infinite to be my favourite in the series. The explored relationship between our two protagonists, Booker and Elizabeth, only grows stronger and more complex as the game progresses. Despite the game leading into other arcs, I believe Infinite's core values is what these characters explore in each other. This is a form of development and connection we could not experience in the previous BioShock games due to the lack of characters we could cling on or relate to. Infinite grasps at our ways of old and challenges the player to think outside of the mindset they are usually in, in their day-to-day lives. Granted, despite how amazing I believe this game is, it definitely is not perfect. The lack of a weapon wheel and the step back from BioShock 2's ergonomically stunning gameplay are the two major downfalls of BioShock: Infinite. Of course these changes force the player to strategize differently from how they are used to, but they are not welcomed changes. It is for these reasons I would instead rate BioShock: Infinite a 9/10.","timestamp_created":1562233967,"timestamp_updated":1562233967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53491546","author":{"steamid":"76561198827661762","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":144,"last_played":1557338711},"language":"english","review":"Terrible controls, UI and shooting.","timestamp_created":1562233591,"timestamp_updated":1562233591,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53486828","author":{"steamid":"76561198187494163","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1192,"last_played":1562291712},"language":"english","review":"I think this game is a little overrated, but it is a fun and unique shooter nonetheless.

[b] Immersion [/b] like nothing else and a world unlike any other.\n\nDespite taking mechanics from the previous Bioshock games such as Vigors (Plasmids), Handymen (Big Daddies) etc, the game feels fresh and original unlike anything else. \nThe world of Columbia is a stark contrast to the City of Rapture, just as it is meant to be. \nRapture was claustrophobic, dark and dank exactly as one would imagine an underwater city to be but Columbia feels open and airy, the city painted by bright colours and it's people dressed in beautiful clothing. Buildings keep bobbing up and down, giving you the sense of a city that's floating in the air and the NPCs are dressed in beautiful timely clothing. The interiors of the city are even more astounding and I found myself reading up on the lore continously whenever I wasn't playing and had a bit of free time. \n\nThe [u] gameplay [/u] is goddamn amazing. Having played the previous two Bioshock games on my console when I was a kid, I can confidently say that Infinite had the best shooting mechanics and the best Vigor/Plasmid mechanics as well out of all three games. Irrational took their formula and bettered it in every manner imaginable and it had me going back to the Clash in the Clouds DLC to get my dosage of the combat after I finished the story missions itself.\n\nElizabeth as a companion and as a character was done beautifully. She has her own story arc which was amazing and gameplay-wise, she's the best. She throws you ammunition when you're low (which has been a lifesaver for me on more than one occasion), money from time to time and she can open up \"tears\" in areas, giving you a much needed box of ammunition or healthpack or bringing a turret that could help you thin out the herd of enemies you're facing up against. And on top of all those amazing things, you don't have to worry about her at all while in combat. \n[b] Elizabeth is INVINCIBLE and CANNOT be killed which means no QT events during combat to save her and no having to look out for her which gives you much more freedom while fighting. [/b]\n\nThe [u] story [/u] is umm... very unusual.\nI saw a video by Crowbcat on YouTube (https://youtu.be/muJYTeQlvC4) and it showed how much we missed out on, how many ideas Irrational had but could not include in the end product and it made me sad over how much we missed out. That being said, the story is still amazing and I am definitely going to play the entire game again on the highest difficulty. \n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this game to everyone who enjoys story-based single player games and it's a must have for every system, especially considering the dirt-cheap price that Steam is selling it for.","timestamp_created":1562175696,"timestamp_updated":1562175696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53391239","author":{"steamid":"76561198145538603","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":838,"last_played":1562099178},"language":"schinese","review":"天空一如既往是悲伤的颜色，即便如此，云依旧美的如同幻觉。即便这是欺骗但是她愿意，\"你必须跳下悬崖，在堕落空中生出翅膀“","timestamp_created":1562175424,"timestamp_updated":1562175424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53390926","author":{"steamid":"76561198080699690","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3079,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2545,"last_played":1576172701},"language":"russian","review":"Советую пройти всю франшизу BOISHOK!

If you played the original Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite + the 2 dlc episodes, you will see how well written the plot and the story as a whole is. But you don't need to have played anything else. I haven't and I enjoyed the game a lot. I promise you, if you like nice gameplay with cool visuals and mind-boggling story, you are likely to enjoy this game.","timestamp_created":1562163900,"timestamp_updated":1562163900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53361304","author":{"steamid":"76561198112284866","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":754,"last_played":1562514087},"language":"german","review":"Dieses
