Шутерная составляющая ни капли не устарела, да графика 2004 года уже выглядит не впечатляющей на сегодняшний день, но она по прежнему достойная, учитывая возраст игры. А физическая модель так и по сей день радует летающими телами комбайнов на орбиту земли, от взрывов гранат!!! :) Движок Source на мой взгляд прекрасен. \n\nО плохом. Некоторые моменты игры очень просели, в плане интереса, на сегодняшний день. Момент на катере с воздушной подушкой, сплошная духота, если раньше он вызывал напряжение и интерес, то сегодня только скуку и раздражение, но это чистая вкусовщина.\nИграть рекомендую исключительно на англ. озвучке с русскими субтитрами. Русская локализация к сожалению в игре УЖАСНА, не плохая из-за подбора актеров, хотя и это тоже, она УЖАСНА и в техническом исполнении. Обрывы речи посреди предложения, повторение одной фразы по два раза и это только самое такое, что запомнилось.\nПо продолжительности, игра, вполне достойна, хотя укоротить выше описанный момент, это примерно от 30 до 1:30 часов и игра ни капли бы не потеряла. \n\nК покупке рекомендую!!! Игра и по сей день даст прокекаться огромному количеству шутеров выходивших после неё. ДА ЧЁРТ ВОЗЬМИ, это классика которая стала культовой и она должна быть у любого уважающего себя геймара, который любит шутеры :)","timestamp_created":1622506489,"timestamp_updated":1646432886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92963845","author":{"steamid":"76561198038321117","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1447,"last_played":1656204326},"language":"latam","review":"Juegazo, Revolucionario en cuanto a narrativa y jugabilidad.

2 is probably the best Valve Game ever produced next to Counter-Strike and Team Fortress. Whether you're fighting 10 combines or trying to speed-run with a palette, we're still playing the same base game and having a fun time. Now enough about me rambling, I'll go ahead and check of certain features which make this game good. \n\nPrice & Release: Half-Life 2 is 10 dollars and throughout my time on steam, I haven't really noticed it being on sale. The game also has expansions such as episode and episode 2 which are both 8 dollars. The game along with it's expansions will cost you 26 dollars. However, if you buy the orange box then you'll get it for 20 bucks (along with Portal and a free hat in TF2)\n\nOptimization: I don't think I need to explain this one. Half-Life 2 is a 2004 game and 17 years later it runs really well even on potato computers. However the game can lag sometimes if you set it DirectX to 9, as on default it runs on Directx8. \n\nGraphics: I'm extremely impressed that Half-Life 2 is able to have really good graphics for a 2004 game. Even on low graphic settings, the graphics are just extremely beautiful. However one thing to note is that they can be buggy and get ugly sometimes. For example if you change chapters or reach a new location, the graphics change to something more haggard with a gaudy color correction. The way to fix that is to do \"mat_fullbright 0 in console and doing -dxlevel 90 in the launch options of the game in your library.\"\n\nGameplay: Okay so we all know that Half-Life 2 is practically the father of PC Gaming when it comes to gameplay. Theres a variety of weapons that you unlock as you progress through the game from your generic 9mm pistol to an RPG or an extremely useful gravity gun. Another mechanic thats really cool is being able to pick up certain items by the press of a button, for example you can press E to pick up a crate and the gravity gun to pick up and yank large objects such a cabinets. This game also isn't \"easy\" but it's also not Dark: Souls level hard. It requires you to use your brain and figure out where to go as well as the best strategies to utilize. \n\nStory: This game probably has one of the best stories. You start off as Gordon Freeman with no hud until you meet Alyx and the rest of the team to get your suit. Then the game just progresses from there as Gordon fights off mobs of Combines while bumping into civilians seeking help once in a while. The ending is fantastic and I can't say its bad.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is probably the best games I've ever played. 11/10 I would really recommend it if you have 10 dollars lying around.","timestamp_created":1622480133,"timestamp_updated":1622480133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92942360","author":{"steamid":"76561199006063297","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":2206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2120,"last_played":1629970844},"language":"koreana","review":"내가 해본 게임 중에 레전드 중 레전드","timestamp_created":1622478286,"timestamp_updated":1622478286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551234126091003418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92941917","author":{"steamid":"76561198188465255","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":701,"last_played":1622472031},"language":"russian","review":"Легендарная игра!

из самых крутых фишек Half-Life 2 неимоверно качественный гейм-дизайн. На самом деле перед нами навороченные американские горки, в которых режиссёр держит руку на вашем пульсе. И поверьте это не вы играете в HL2, а она с вами. Разработчики создали удивительную иллюзию свободы выбора и открытого мира, но на самом деле вы движетесь исключительно по сюжетным рельсам практически не сворачивая. Талант разработчиков проявляется в интересной задумке - жанровой мимикрии. Half-Life 2 как будто дразнит нас периодически превращаясь в гонки, тактический шутер или например в полноценный хоррор в Ривердейле. Более того, несмотря на всю крутизну Фримена, он не воспринимается как волк одиночка, в мире Халфы он просто символ, который показывает людям что они способны на самопожертвование. И все эти декорации нужны только для обретения веры, ведь штурм Цитадели начинают люди сами без Аликс и Городна. Всю патовость подобной ситуации демонстрируют перестрелки с Альянсом, они сложны не только из-за сообразительности соперника, но в первую очередь из-за смертности символа, которая периодически кстати случается.\nВторая наиболее успешная фишка - гравипушка. Кто мог представить, что физика игры получится настолько передовой? А самое забавное во всей этой ситуации, новомодная приблуда породила невероятно успешную серию логических игр. При этом в самой Half-Life 2 пушка умудряется создать десятки крутых моментов. После её получения как-то сразу пропадает интерес к остальному вооружению (хотя все пушки отлично проработаны от внешнего вида до баллистики) и здорово что именно ей уничтожается финальный босс.\nHalf-Life 2 отлично играется и поныне, в этом ей помогает правильный ритм, ураганные этапы своевременно разбавляются расслабляющими переходами. В игре здорово подогревается исследовательский интерес с помощью кучи секретов и несложных головоломок. В то же время любители пострелять найдут для себя немало виртуальных тиров и организованных противников. Half-Life 2 практически без оговорок лишена слабых мест, единственная претензия звучит по поводу последнего уровня и босса. Уж больно однообразным получился процесс, да и схватка могла выйти по ярче. Но учитывая общий нарратив и слив кода игры аккурат перед выходом, думаю это вполне простительная оплошность. Про DLC рассказ наверное будет отдельным постом, так как это не рядовые дополнения, а вполне полноценные проекты.\nЗа мультиплеер ответственность возложили на Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. Но все понимали, что к уровню популярности Контры его не довести. Поэтому если честно основные имеющиеся режимы Deathmatch и командный Deathmatch уже тогда попахивали нафталином. А вот третий режим Puzzle был куда любопытнее, ведь там с помощью моей любимой гравипушки необходимо было решать задания в команде. Но к сожалению весь процесс быстро скатился в вечное проектирование мостов, а в напарники набирались личности с деструктивными наклонностями и это погубило неплохую задумку.\nНу и напоследок. Пропускать игры уровня Half-Life 2 настоящее преступление, будьте законопослушными. Ну и те кто давно не играл, обновите рецепторы качественным продуктом. 9.5.

Released back in 2004 it surprises me with its visuals and story. For me this is the best game created back then. The gun play is not that impressive compared to the games we have today but Half-Life 2 is still the most played game after so many years. People often get back to feel the nostalgia and to remember of how good this game was. If you want to understand the full story of Half-Life series i suggest you play it from the first Half-life (1) all the way to episode 2. For a new player this game is excellent and you will spend alot of time playing it. Everything about this feels amazing – the sounds,the characters,the story. It’s truly a masterpiece for it's time. Do i suggest this game? Yes i do. You can buy it for 1-2 dollars on a summer sale. They are also many mods for this game – One of the mods is called MMOD ( This mod changes the weapon animation,explosions without changing the main story. For those who want the game to be little bit destructive. You can find many more mods on the Mod DB site as also on Steam.
