Portal 2 가 2011년작이라는 것이 믿기지가 않을 정도이다.\n\n2. 난이도.\n\n-포탈 1은 쉬운 감이 없잖아 있었다. 하지만 1에서는 포탈건이라는 개념 자체가 생소한 부분도 있었기 때문에, 이 개념을 처음 접하는 사람에게 있어 포탈 1의 레벨 디자인은 안성맞춤이다. 포탈 2는 포탈 1의 후속작인 만큼, 포탈건과 포탈의 개념에 적응한 사람들이 많았다. 그걸 의식해서인지 포탈 2의 난이도는 1보다 조금 더 높아졌다. 그렇지만 이번에도 클리어하기 어려운 수준은 아니었다. 밸브의 레벨 디자인이 돋보이는 부분이다. 처음에는 뭐가 뭔지 모르겠다가도, 부딪히고, 실험해보고, 시도해보면 어느새 정답에 도달해 있다. 이것저것 해보다가 깨달음을 얻듯 찾아오는 정답들은, 문제 하나하나를 해결할 때마다 카타르시스를 가져다 준다. 포탈의 난이도는 걱정할 필요 없다. 네가 정말 바보가 아니라면, 여러가지를 시도하다보면 정답에 향하게 된다. 걱정 말고 부딪혀라. 내가 헤맸던 부분은 퍼즐이 아닌 문 틈 사이로 났던 길 뿐이었다. \n\n3. 엔딩\n\n-엔딩 자체는 매우 깔끔하다. 3이 나올 여지는 없다. 엔딩을 말하자면 스포니 그때 들었던 감정만 열거하자면, 당혹스러웠으나 행복했고, 뿌듯했으나 아쉬웠으며, 증오했으나 동정했다.\n2019년에 엔딩을 보았으나, 1년이란 시간이 지난 지금에도 엔딩의 느낌은 잊을 수 없다.\n\n4. 멀티플레이\n\n-멀티플레이와 싱글 플레이는 시간대가 다르다. 싱글플레이 이후의 시간대가 멀티플레이 부분이니, 멀티플레이를 하기 전 싱글 플레이를 하는 것을 먼저 추천한다. 멀티플레이도 굉장히 방대하고 재미있다. 그러나 친구와 같이 할 땐 비슷한 문제 해결력을 지닌 친구들과 플레이하길 바란다. 심하면 싸우는 경우가 생길 수도 있다.","timestamp_created":1596799926,"timestamp_updated":1596799926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73909296","author":{"steamid":"76561198017188470","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5845,"last_played":1596964213},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un juego original, con un fundamento tecnológico muy futurista.

[/h1]\n\nНо Эта игра просто бомба. Для 2012 года это супер-пупер-высший-класс. В эту игру можно играть вечно. Сюжет хороший, отличный, плюс он ещё во вселенной Half-Life. Перепроходить игру можно бесконечно, хоть каждую неделю. Проходиться игра за вечер. За один стрим можно пройти, а если стрим хороший, то и первую часть.\n\nСама задумка просто супер. Игра настолько популярна, что так запала фанатом, что каждый геймер и просто тот кто смотрит YouTube и никогда не проходил Портал, знают эту вселенную. Пасхалки почти повсюду. \n\nПервая часть была скучноватой, но это сюжет, но всё равно очень хорошая, но перевод портит ощущение, но игра здесь не причём, это всё дубляж. Но минус 1 части, не было ко-оп режима, Мастерской, сюжет слишком короткий, но это ладно. Но это был 2007 и игра хорошая.\n\nИ теперь почему Вторая часть Portal - это шедевр. Почему в эту игру можно играть бесконечно (причина 1 была названа в предыдущих обзацах) а другие причины - это \n\n                                            [/h1]    Возможны небольшие СПОЙЛЕРЫ   [/h1]\n\n                                            [/h1]     Игра с игроками  [/h1]\n \n\n Кооперативный режим. (почти никакого сюжета) Просто приятно. Хороший миссии, и отличная идея вставить в игру Атласа и P-body из конца игры и вставить в игру мультиплеер. \n\n                                   [/h1]   Мастерская [/h1]\n\nМастерская. Карты от игроков. Это супер. Качай карты, проходи их, пока другие будут их создавать, и так ты никогда не перестанешь играть в эту игру. По сколько карты от других игроков, есть там и много г♥♥♥♥. \n\n                             [/h1] За что мы отдаём свои деньги [/h1]\n\nДонат! Денег не жалко, игра стоит мало, все во лишь 250 рублей! и Это КРУТО! а знаете что КРУЧЕ? То что Я купил игру за 25 рублей со скидкой 90%, и ты можешь тоже!  правда для первой части это может быть многовато, но это же шедевр. ТАК вернёмся к названию абзаца. Донат - он тут дешёвый, и это кастомизация персонажей в ко-оп и совместной игре в картах из мастерской. Это раскраска и шапки, а так же аксексуары, по типу усов и очков. (точнее очка, ведь у них по одному глазу, как и по одному очку) и ещё можно купить действия и танцы.\n\n               [/h1] Бонус [/h1]\n\nВ гласном меню есть такая приятная кнопочка - \"Дополнительное\". Там небольшие видео по игре, которые объясняют некоторые вещи в игре и просто хорошие дополнение к сюжету. А так же КОМИКС, который вышел перед выходом Второй части. Называется \"Лабораторная крыса\".
