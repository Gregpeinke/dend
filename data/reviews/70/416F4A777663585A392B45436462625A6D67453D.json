Vous en sortir vivant ! Pour ça vous aurez plus d'une dizaine d'armes, parmi un certain Pied de biche :)\n\nL'atout du jeu réside dans un savant mélange d'action-FPS et de phases de plates-formes, ce qui était assez novateur pour l'époque (encore aujourd'hui ?) par rapport à d'autres FPS.\nL'IA des ennemis (en particulier des militaires) sait être offensive comme défensive, ils n'hésiteront pas à se trouver une couverture ou à venir vous débusquer quand vous vous cachez.\n\nL'histoire quant à elle est à l'image de tout le reste, très simple mais avec également une très grande part de mystère. Attendez-vous à la fin du jeu, à vous poser beaucoup de questions auxquelles vous n'aurez que quelques réponses dans les prochains Half-Life.\n\nEt cerise sur le gâteau, si vous aimez le jeu, Gearbox (les développeurs de la série Borderlands entre autres) a développé deux \"extensions\" (Blue Shift et Opposing Force) qui utilise aussi le moteur GoldSource (le moteur d'Half-Life).\nEt c'est sans compter la pléthore de mods pour jouer de nouvelles aventures !\nD'ailleurs, certains n'ont tellement rien à voir avec le jeu d'origine et ajoutent tellement de contenue qu'ils ne s'agit plus de mods mais de jeux à part entière.\n\nPour résumer, Half-Life n'est pas un jeu qui prend la poussière au placard, on prendra toujours plaisir à y rejouer de temps en temps :)\n\n[code][url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/snavim/recommended/]Vous avez apprécié cette évaluation ?

And out of the many games I have played from the late 1990's this one holds up exceptionally well. The gameplay starts with a slow opening but picks up well and sets an excellent setting for this sci-fi adventure. This game IS a bit lacking in the music department. Using ambient noise to augment the settings and the dystopian theme of the game. But settings and narrative aside this game sets an excellent example of a game that does not need shoot-em-up action and 4k graphics to be good. (although the graphics DID NOT hold well through the years) Its just enough to overlook.\n\nOverall this game is a MUST HAVE if you are into games like DOOM or other sci-fi shooters. And this game constantly goes on sale. (I got it for just one dollar!). Definitely pick this game up or just go the full mile and purchase the Valve Complete Pack.","timestamp_created":1520805485,"timestamp_updated":1520805485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40752830","author":{"steamid":"76561198320170398","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3909,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1745,"last_played":1569306405},"language":"english","review":"AMAZING\n","timestamp_created":1520805337,"timestamp_updated":1520805337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475609779357910156","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40748846","author":{"steamid":"76561198172777365","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1174,"last_played":1622989410},"language":"turkish","review":"hem nostaji hem her sistemin kaldırcağı ve gordon freeman ın black mesadan kaçışını anlatan muhtişem  oyun","timestamp_created":1520793667,"timestamp_updated":1520793667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40748313","author":{"steamid":"76561198077019172","num_games_owned":508,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":1491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":566,"last_played":1632503559},"language":"english","review":" In HALF LIFE you Play as Gordon Freeman Morgan Freeman's Bastard Child who works at a Super Secret Lab (Area 51) Somewhere in New Mexico one day while attempting to Open a Portal to who knows where the fuck it is everything goes to hell in a Handbasket and Aliens Start Pouring in from your Fuckup.\n\nNow all your friends are dead \nThe Military Wants your ass\nThe Aliens Want your ass\nThe Illuminati wants your ass\n\nyou're a One Man Army Nerd with a bunch of Weapons and your Intelect \nYour Mission Survive and Escape Black Mesa (Area 51) \nDon't expect your MIT Graduation to help you on this one","timestamp_created":1520792392,"timestamp_updated":1520792392,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40746148","author":{"steamid":"76561198090650360","num_games_owned":449,"num_reviews":177,"playtime_forever":937,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":937,"last_played":1520939853},"language":"english","review":"I didn't play [b]Half-Life[/b] when it was initially released, only now did I try it for the first time. And I must honestly say that the hype is deserved. However, the game is not without its flaws.\n\n[u]Graphics[/u]\n\nThe graphics is not the reason why you would want to play this game. It's a game from 1998 and it shows. There are some HD mods that can improve the textures, however buttons and other interactable objects still have no depth and look like they have been painted on the walls.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\n\nThe story is where this game shines out the most. Not as much for what it tells - there are only a few important things going on in the game - but for how it is revealed. The story is revealed bit by bit through observations and short interactions with NPCs. The protagonist is silent. There are no books, no logs and almost no cutscenes. The story is the experience itself.\nHowever, the game does not take itself seriously. There are elements of comedy in some scenes and NPC lines. And for me that is a flaw, because it doesn't fit the overall crisis situation.\n\n[u]Level design[/u]\n\nThe game offers a seamless transition between the levels. They are built in a way that almost always the player intuitively knows where to go and what to do. It is accomplished without any mission logs or map markers. In some situations there is more than one way to go, but no matter which way you chose you reach the intended destination. Furthermore, the level design complements the story.\nThis is some master level level design.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\n\nThe game starts slowly and for about first 15 minutes there's not much going on. But then the pace becomes faster and you face increasingly harder situations with a good balance between shooting and puzzle solving. However, there are some points in the game, when, if you don't have the right type of ammo, you are screwed. Multiple reloads or cheats are required to get past those bottleneck situations.\n\nThe endgame is particularly punishing, and also confusing. There's a lot of platform jumping, multiple enemy spawns and very hard boss fights. I'd say even too hard for easy difficulty.\n\n[u]Other notes[/u]\n-It doesn't feel like the protagonist is walking, but more like sliding. A single press of a movement button takes you quite far. It's just too sensitive. For that reason I experienced quite a lot of problems with ladders and moving platforms, and fall damage was the most frequent type of damage that I took.\n- The grenade throwing is very inaccurate and covers only a short distance.\n- Shotguns and assault rifles have spray patterns.\n- Crouch jumping is a thing.\n- The soundtrack is amazing and available as extra content within the game files.\n\n[u]Final words[/u]\n\nUnless for the annoying endgame that tested my patience, [b]HL[/b] would have been one of my favourite games. But, nevertheless, I still think it's a good game and worth playing. Even in 2018.\n\n[b]My overall rating:[/b] [u]8/10[/u]","timestamp_created":1520786625,"timestamp_updated":1521763547,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":34,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.731385231018066406","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40744464","author":{"steamid":"76561198808490641","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2334,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1619,"last_played":1657810787},"language":"hungarian","review":"the Best Game!!","timestamp_created":1520782736,"timestamp_updated":1542869348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40743951","author":{"steamid":"76561198806987576","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":103,"last_played":1528757842},"language":"schinese","review":"《半条命》开创了FPS游戏众多先河，影响了很多后世的FPS游戏，更是告诉大家，FPS在完美剧情的加持下更加出色。对于一个1998年出的游戏不能要求太多，游戏默认的是中文的配音，赞！虽然能了解是让我干什么，但是游戏内没有什么提示，很容易迷路。游戏的画面就不多说了，毕竟是上个世纪的游戏引擎了，但是游戏性和可玩性放到现在依然很棒！对于一个20年前的老游戏来说，能够做到今天这样就已经非常罕见了，所以评论里说《半条命》是FPS游戏界的鼻祖、神作之类的话一点也不为过。","timestamp_created":1520781551,"timestamp_updated":1520781551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40742884","author":{"steamid":"76561198059862317","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2409,"playtime_last_two_weeks":152,"playtime_at_review":740,"last_played":1660497617},"language":"russian","review":"Легендарная игра 1998 года, с которой началась новая эра шутеров от первого лица. \nГлавный герой - физик-теоретик Гордон Фримен, пытающийся сбежать из огромного научно-исследовательского института Блек Мейза, расположенного в пустыне Нью-Мексико, приследуемый военными и пришельцами, заполонившими комплекс словно муравьи, после того, как эксперимент с таинственным кристаллом из \"пограничного мира\" выходит из под контроля и происходит Каскадный Резонанс... \n\nHalf-Life 1 - первая игра, созданная с нуля тогда ещё молодой компанией Valve - выходцами из Microsoft-а, решившими заняться производством компьютерных игр. Именно с этой единственной игрой за плечами они так стремительно ворвались в игровую индустрию с наступлением нового миллениума. \n\n\n[i]Фримен, ломик, Блек Мейза, хэдкрабы, булсквиды, вортигонты, хаундайи, Ксен, Джи-мен, Комплекс Лямбда, длиннющая поездка на вагонетке на монорельсе, поездка в вагончике из начальных титров длинной в 5 минут... Боже! Сколько же приятных воспоминаний из детства! х3[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Сюжет: 10/10[/h1]\nХоть многие со мной тут и не согласятся, но я считаю, что в отличие от первоначальной трешовой задумки Вельв с космическим байкером Иваном и орбитальной станцией, то, что мы получили в итоге - игра с достойным сюжетом! И ладно, что персонажей тут мало и среди них нет \"индивидуальных\", но зато есть целый пограничный мир Ксен со своей флорой и фауной! А изучая внешний вид пришельцев и их анатомию, можно даже примерно определить их роль в экосистеме того места, откуда когда-то пришёл в Ксен их вид.\n\n[h1]Атмосфера: 10/10[/h1]\nНу тут и добавить нечего: в этой игре идеально всё! Блек Мейза сделана о-о-очень атмосферно! Каждый новый сектор выглядит по-другому, с какими-то уникальными чертами, которых нет у других... И даже Ксен выполнен на удивление хорошо! Хоть многие игроки и жалуются на то, что надеялись увидеть мир пришельцев не только как парящие в воздухе острова земли.\n\n[h1]Геймплей: 10/10[/h1]\nНосится, конечно, наш Фримен как угорелый... но не забывайте о том, что это игра 1998 года, а её движок - сильно переделанный движок от Quake. Для своего времени это был настоящий прорыв! За исключением этого играть в Халф-Лайф 1 очень приятно, а подавляющее большинство багов связано исключительно с переносом игры в Стим.\n\n[h1]Графика: 10/10[/h1]\nКто-то скажет: \"Майнкрафт\", а я скажу: \"Вы сначала посмотрите на графон других топовых игр того времени!\". Тот же Deus Ex 2000 года выглядит намного хуже, чего уж говорить о других играх... Поэтому графика у Халф Лайф 1 - одна из самых лучших для компьютерных игр своего времени.\n\n[h1]Итоговая оценка: 10/10[/h1]\nДа вряд ли вообще есть люди, которые не играли в этот шедевр... Что?

This game is frightening where you have to think. I like that, It helps players Innovate. This game is great, but can be hard at times. \n\n\nHaving fun while playing\n\n\nIf you want to amuse yourself while Playing the game, when you get the crowbar, Dont just kill those Xen creatures, Also kill all scientests, Officers, And whatever you can find, and Just End Their Fucking life. It can be hillarious. Be sure to mess with lots of other mechanics, and Impulse 101 (Cheats are required, for Noobies, Turn on Dev Console and type SV_Cheats 1 first)\n\nFanbase\n\nThis game is a Very Popular game, and the Fanbase Still Kinda Holds up. People have made beautiful stuff out of Half-Life. Thing's like Freeman's Mind (Ross Scott), and Whatnot. Sometimes I parody Freeman's Mind alone and talk to Myself and Commentate my OWN Character. I'm weird. :P\n\n\nUpdates\n\n\nUpdates are never happening, really. The last update we got was like almost a Year ago Where Valve Launches a Wee Patch to It. It also Reached Blue Shift and Opposing Force (Also Good).\n \nGlitches\n\nThere's Barely Any, not Counting the Glitches used for Speedrunning (Bunnyhop, ABH ((Ik It's only in HL2, I dont Care.)), Etc).\n\nHorror\n\nThe horror used in this masterpiece, are creepy feelings and the creatures. It can give a 5 year old nightmares. So that gives something to worry about if Pixels 2 comes to life. Yeah, Don't Introduce it to your younger brother like I did.\n\n\nEngine Quality\n\nHalf-Life runs on gold source, A heavily modified Quake 1 Engine. It has great looks, a fancy health and armor counter in the corner, and some great graphics. just dont think of dark soul- FUCK I TRIGGERED YOUR MIND\n\n\nFinal score: 9.1/10\n\nLast Word: But Seriously why is Half Life Source a Piece of Shit to You Guys?","timestamp_created":1520286434,"timestamp_updated":1566838984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40594532","author":{"steamid":"76561198075895780","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":98,"last_played":1633105785},"language":"turkish","review":"o
