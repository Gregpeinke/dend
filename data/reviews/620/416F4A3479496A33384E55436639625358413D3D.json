You can play the game and enjoy the storyline or take your time finding the hidden secrets within the game. Unlike the first Portal game, Portal 2 has included multiplayer which allows you to spend time with friends solving the maps already created or solving maps created by the community, which gives the game a little bit more so it's never ending puzzle solving fun. The puzzles are not a walk in the park either they have a difficulty to them that challenges the brain and keeps it active. Portal 2 is a favourite of mine and I definitely recommend it to others and puzzle loving players.","timestamp_created":1468647334,"timestamp_updated":1468647334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24347321","author":{"steamid":"76561198116566084","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":2641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":400,"last_played":1641053076},"language":"english","review":"Better than portal 1","timestamp_created":1468646053,"timestamp_updated":1468646053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24347198","author":{"steamid":"76561198011294104","num_games_owned":500,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1887,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1781,"last_played":1380132340},"language":"japanese","review":"前作よりボリュームも増えたよ\n相変わらず全部最高\nCOOPも増えて尚良し\n３早く出てくれ頼む","timestamp_created":1468645201,"timestamp_updated":1468645201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498084276914596558","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24346248","author":{"steamid":"76561198152304375","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1579,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1290,"last_played":1503151266},"language":"schinese","review":"这款游戏值得推荐，如果你作为单机游戏玩，可能看不出他的特点，可是这款游戏联机玩的话，就能看出新鲜感十足，联机玩非常棒","timestamp_created":1468639785,"timestamp_updated":1468639785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24344038","author":{"steamid":"76561198310729976","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3885,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":948,"last_played":1657297973},"language":"english","review":"Great game, one of the biggest obsessions I've had","timestamp_created":1468628102,"timestamp_updated":1642930398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24343434","author":{"steamid":"76561198120758268","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1958,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1491,"last_played":1534126723},"language":"english","review":"I love the new public portal puzzles.

Portal 2 incorporates a campaign that allows you to solve challenging puzzles while treating you to a strong and simple storyline. This review will discuss the campaign, the voice acting, dialogue, and the co-op feature.\n\nPortal 2 features a quality campaign that emphasises creativity through overcoming puzzles and excels in superb voice acting that includes funny humour. You begin the campaign as Chell, a female character holding a portal gun. Chell completes tests using her portal gun while being monitored by AI computer system Glados, voiced by Ellen McLain. Chell completes these tests while listening to Wheatley, a programming core that is voiced by Stephen Merchant, in which he wants to escape the facility. The puzzles are diverse and I do not grasp the notion they are repetitive. They do in fact become more difficult as the game progresses which is due to new things being added to each level that add a new layer of complexity. For instance, some levels feature turrets that can spray bullets at you, which you must destroy before advancing. Portal 2 has a really good ending that ends the story with an amazing final mission that mixes both emotion and intensity. Furthermore, the ending smoothly transitions into the credits that completely alter the atmosphere into a beautiful light hearted finale, complete with a song sung by Glados. Briefly, the single player experience does have some annoying glitches with freezing when pressing R for the feedback prompt and frequent crashing via alt tabbing. These two issues had minimal impact on my experience of the game.\n\nThe dialogue enhances the single player component by incorporating witty humour with dialogue that provides excellent characterisation to the characters. For instance, events showcase characters change of heart and provide some emotion to their robot personalities. This creates a juxtaposition of humans and robots because the game reveals human traits of emotion, self-interest for personal gain, and relationships with other individuals within Glados and Wheatley, both whom are robots. The voice acting in Portal 2 complement the strong dialogue because individually, Stephen Merchant delivers a memorable and excellent performance for Wheatley by striking different voice tones that match different situations within the game. Meanwhile, Ellen McLain provides a good voice line to showcase the personality and character of Glados. The dialogue and voice acting immediately created a sense of whose a protagonist and antagonist in the simple story of hero vs. villain.\n\nThe co-op element of Portal 2 provides more levels to lengthen the game. These levels add some exciting fresh dynamics to each level because you have to cooperate with your team mate and depend on the other to complete levels. For instance, I had to stand on a button while my friend flew to the other side of the window to retrieve the block in order to complete the level.\n\n[h1] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/h1]\nPortal 2 is a good and challenging puzzle game that emphasises creativity and excels in the simplicity of telling a story. The story nicely builds to an excellent climax that feels like a satisfying conclusion to the game. The game features beautiful voice acting and some exceptional performances from Merchant and McLain and strongly delivers in the quality of the dialogue. I am new to the puzzle genre so playing Portal 2 felt fresh and different. There are some issues outlined above in the game, but nothing that detracts from the overall experience. At $19.99, I recommend it. \n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\n[h1] [b] Pros [/b] [/h1]\n\t- The simple story that ends with an excellent climax.\n\t- Excellent voice acting.\n\t- Very good dialogue. \n\t- The challenging and increasingly complex puzzles.\n\t- Length.\n\n[h1] [b] Cons [/b] [/h1]\n\t- Annoying glitches with the R feedback prompt in single player and frequent crashes via alt tabbing.\n\t\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.
