Gone are the dilapidated rooms saturated with flashing/broken/beautiful neon lighting and the local Splicers, as well as the haunted tunnels and macabre buildings that make up the once thriving, bustling world of Rapture. Bioshock Infinite is an all new story set in the clouds of a gigantic floating city called Columbia. A FLOATING CITY. It's based on simpler times, even styled like the old days. You will almost immediately be enthralled with the environment and colors of the city. It was very impressive at the time of release, it was one of the PS3's finest looking titles in my opinion. You will find many familiar gameplay concepts, along with a few, usually warranted, changes and tweaks. The controls are very good, not amazingly tight for a FPS with shooting involved, but good enough to master each gun and Vigor (remember Plasmids? Vigors are the new name) while trying out new creative combos without too much frustration. The enemy variety is pretty neat, at times a little frustrating until you get a few essential pieces of Gear. Equipping different pieces of Gear for INSANE buffs and effects is my favorite addition. I enjoyed exploring every nook and cranny in Columbia trying to collect the best Guns/Customizations and Gear. Even if you ABSOLUTELY HATED Bioshock 1 and 2, I would damn near guarantee that most would like Bioshock Infinite. There's just an irresistible charm to it...don't let this incredible adventure, with alternate endings and possibilities fly away (corny pun intended) from you!","timestamp_created":1609354578,"timestamp_updated":1609356471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83587094","author":{"steamid":"76561198877520951","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":100,"last_played":1657488284},"language":"spanish","review":"OBRA DE ARTE, TODO ENCAJA, NO PUEDE HABER MEJOR JUEGO QUE ESTE","timestamp_created":1609354023,"timestamp_updated":1615097318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83581837","author":{"steamid":"76561198283901732","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":684,"last_played":1609348866},"language":"schinese","review":"流程10+hr，能把如此复杂揪心的故事讲彻底，还能把人设立起来，真的功底深厚。\n画面和画风极强，天空城蒸汽朋克风格的塑造，纸版画风的场景叙事赶超环球影城了。\n\n伊丽莎白太心疼了:(\n\n不是fps硬核玩家，枪战感觉可接受吧，敌人种类少了点，子弹也缺不得不换枪\n\n负面：\n垃圾桶的倾覆者，箱子的破坏者，木桶的好奇大帝，寻尸人，尸体清道夫，锁匠，死路探索者——Booker\n翻箱倒柜的垃圾收集强迫症有点影响剧情流畅度了。","timestamp_created":1609349677,"timestamp_updated":1609349677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83581272","author":{"steamid":"76561198398905549","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1143,"last_played":1609262902},"language":"schinese","review":"从一开始的以为是突突突游戏，渐入佳境之后才发现所涉猎的方面如此之广，宗教、战争、政治问题、种族歧视、贯穿整个剧情的量子力学，以及被这些所有东西所承载的人性。当然还有我们的主角伊丽莎白，完美的搭档,不会挡你准星，在你最危险的时候扔给你血瓶，在你失败之后拉你起来。\n结局之后好几天没缓过来，从没想过游戏原来还能这样去表达，4在开发了，可惜不是原编剧了，还是给予期待吧。\nps:胆子小的慎入1和2，买来之后玩了半个小时吓得不敢玩了...","timestamp_created":1609349209,"timestamp_updated":1609349209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83580924","author":{"steamid":"76561198165269889","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":639,"last_played":1609492200},"language":"russian","review":"Увлекательная игра и сюжет , хочется проходить снова и снова )","timestamp_created":1609348902,"timestamp_updated":1609348902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83579503","author":{"steamid":"76561198261675178","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":2054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":977,"last_played":1640034407},"language":"english","review":"░█▀▀ ░█▀█ ░█ ░█▀▀ ░░\n░█▀▀ ░█▀▀ ░█ ░█ ░░░░\n░▀▀▀ ░▀ ░░░▀ ░▀▀▀ ░░","timestamp_created":1609347638,"timestamp_updated":1609347638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83576564","author":{"steamid":"76561198089249623","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1883,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1596,"last_played":1609549921},"language":"english","review":"yes\n","timestamp_created":1609345167,"timestamp_updated":1609345167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83574459","author":{"steamid":"76561198097914436","num_games_owned":316,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":521,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":521,"last_played":1609338831},"language":"koreana","review":"와....스토리 소름돋는다...강력추천!!!!","timestamp_created":1609343419,"timestamp_updated":1609343419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83572986","author":{"steamid":"76561198834165518","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":1256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1060,"last_played":1614442347},"language":"russian","review":"Однозначно лучший проект своих времен.

I am simply happy I played it, even 2020, this is a must play game if you enjoy a campaign with retro-futuristic scenery, to rescue a dame in distress, and travel it's linear storyline seeking out powers and slaying enemies with various weapontry and abilities.","timestamp_created":1609227592,"timestamp_updated":1609227592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83458273","author":{"steamid":"76561199106295063","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2334,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":441,"last_played":1616432880},"language":"english","review":"Story driven FPS with a captivating aesthetic and a storyline that pulls you in.\nCombat is interesting, and the weapons customizeable/upgradeable.","timestamp_created":1609227279,"timestamp_updated":1609227279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83456968","author":{"steamid":"76561198207067128","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1073,"last_played":1609477228},"language":"english","review":"gAME iS nOICE","timestamp_created":1609225651,"timestamp_updated":1609225651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83454200","author":{"steamid":"76561198023599427","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":738,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":738,"last_played":1609222273},"language":"english","review":"Holds up well","timestamp_created":1609222287,"timestamp_updated":1609222287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83451475","author":{"steamid":"76561198344083833","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1032,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1032,"last_played":1596367781},"language":"koreana","review":"음 갠적으로 불호","timestamp_created":1609218970,"timestamp_updated":1609218970,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83451246","author":{"steamid":"76561198931103178","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1297,"last_played":1622837940},"language":"spanish","review":"juegen esta wea esta bieeeeeen fumada, ah odio a Nintendo XD","timestamp_created":1609218671,"timestamp_updated":1609218671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83450992","author":{"steamid":"76561198808287869","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1593,"last_played":1637211871},"language":"koreana","review":"그냥 명작 말이 필요없는 명작","timestamp_created":1609218383,"timestamp_updated":1609643997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83447706","author":{"steamid":"76561198115034020","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1051,"last_played":1609705414},"language":"english","review":"One of the best FPS games i have ever played.

Now that I have a pc, I am planning on finishing it 3 times again. I won't write an essay here because I can write a book about my love for this game. Since 2013, I have not played a better game then this. The characters and the story resonated with me to a level not a single game did. My attachment to the world and everything around it is immense. People complain about the gameplay but is is simple and clean. If you want intricate combat, maybe this is not for you. However, if you are willing to commit yourself to this world and everything in it, I believe you will love the game. To cut it short, and without sugar coating it, IN MY OPINION, this is my favorite game of ALL TIME and don't see any other game being able to get close. Its been 8 years since I have played it and replayed it, and played over 500 games since, and not one was better. Everyone may have their own approach and opinion to what has happened, and what to think of this game, but this is mine :)","timestamp_created":1609205167,"timestamp_updated":1609205167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83434899","author":{"steamid":"76561198409521896","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":971,"last_played":1511986102},"language":"german","review":"Sehr gutes Spiel!
