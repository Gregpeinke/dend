В нее мы влюбляемся с первого взгляда и на протежение всей игры это чувство все растет, мы переживаем за нее и сочувствуем ее не легкой доле. Давно я в играх не видел столь выразительного персонажа, так же она является полной противоположностью главного героя за которого нам предстоит играть, Букера ДеВитта, который сначала хотет спасти ее из личных целей но постепенно проникается к ней, возможно это последстивия удара гаечным ключом по лицу xD , пожалуй обойдусь без излишних сполеров. (10 из 10).\n-Арсенал- Ооооооо.... Это отдельная тема, эта игра просто порадывала меня многообразием своего оружия в стиле мешения стимпанк и классического оружия. У орижия так же пресудствуют система прокачки, не столь сложная, но она есть это уже огромный \"+\". Если бы на этом все кончилось мы бы остались довольны, но нас ждет еще одна интересная особенность котрая раскрывает новые гаризонты - это \"энергетики\", всего их в игре 8 и каждый открывает в нас различные способности от созавания перед собой энерго поля до управления силой молнии.\n-Графика и Музыка- Многие могут сказать \"графика не главное\" и \"графика портит погружение\" у самого есть такой друг, но графика она увеличивает погружение в столь дивную атмосферу, или же вам приятней играть квадратами?! Графика сдесь яркая и динамичная в тоже время мрачная и душащая, это великолепное сочетание вместе с музыкой делает волшебную картину, видно, что разрабочики не сидели просиживая штаны.\n\nО плюса игры можно говрить часами, но подводим итоги. Мы видим прекрасную игру с сюжетом и продумкой на высочайшем уровне, с бокатым красивым миром и головокружащими возможностями.

Originally, I was a bit skeptical about it, even though I have heard a bunch of people rave about it. I saw that the game was on sale, so I thought, \"what the heck?\" and bought the Season Pass bundle, and I must say this game would still be worth its full price! Amazing gameplay, plot, and scenery! You can upgrade so many things for Booker, like his Vigors, weapons, and stats, not to mention a plethora of other collectibles and secrets to find in the game.\n\nAs an avid completionist, I very much enjoy obtaining all of the collectibles, achievements, and upgrades in my games. However, there a few gripes I have concerning the save system of this game. After I have 100%'d a game, rather than returning, selling, or even restarting the game, I keep it so I may look back and relish my achievements. They serve as trophies to me, so I savor those save files, even though there isn't a single thing left for me to do in that game. Bioshock Infinite™, however, has a very annoying save system that can get in the way of that. You see, one of the achievements in this game is called \"Scavenger Hunt.\" To earn it, you must complete 1999 mode without buying anything from a vending machine. I want to get to get all of the achievements, including that one, but in order to start playing 1999 mode, I would have to delete my old save file because this game only allows ONE save file. I would really love to have that achievement so I may have the satisfaction of getting 100% on the game and Steam™ achievements, but having to give up my old save for the sake of that one achievement is completely absurd! Then how would I be able to reminisce my accomplishments and wonderful memories of that particular save file? The special experience I had with it? This is also incredibly inconvenient for me because I was considering to do a walkthrough of this game on Youtube™, but I still really want to keep my personal save separate. This is why I was hoping for three save files so I may have one for my own normal playthrough the game, another for 1999 mode, and a third one for a Youtube™ walkthrough series. I guess the game must have so much content, that they could not fit any extra save files to it, which I would understand, but still a little disappointed about it.\n\nMy second gripe with the save system, although a lot less significant than the first one, is that if you miss a collectible somewhere in the game, the only way to go back for it is to reload the specific chapter you missed the item in. The catch is though, your data from where you are currently in the game is not carried over back there, because it reloads the data state you were at that time. Luckily from what I have heard from others, it will not make you have to restart all of the chapters between where you currently are and the one you want to revisit. Instead, each chapter acts like its own save file (though as I stated earlier, I would MUCH, MUCH prefer three simple save files that you can revisit old areas with all of your current stats and items to just nab that one elusive collectible you need there or just re-enjoy the scenery and experience there and go back where you are or something, but, oh well). If the collectible that you are missing is to just look at a voxophone, kinetoscope, or telescope to get the Steam™ achievements, it does not matter because the Steam™ achievements kind of have a “global tally” sort of system that counts progress over all of your saves, even if you decide to completely start a new game, the achievement progress will still and only count for the voxophones, kinetoscope, or telescopes that you find in that playthrough, but have not found in your previous playthrough (however, if you do go back a chapter to get a voxophone you missed in a previous chapter and then you go back to the chapter that you are currently working on, I do not believe the voxophone will be viewable on your collected voxophones list on the game menu since it only counts towards the achievement, but not to the game’s saved collection in any chapter files past that chapter, unless you replayed all of the chapters starting from that certain chapter). Collectibles like upgrades, or even just some money you find lying around in that revisited chapter are only saved to that chapter. If you really want to carry those items to where you are currently in the game, you must replay all of the chapters, starting from that given revisited chapter (as I have stated earlier).\n\nMy final and least substantial complaint of the save system, is how often you get to save the game. This is a much more tolerable pain than the ones I have stated earlier, but I will still talk a little bit about it anyways since I am on the topic. Bioshock Infinite™ uses an autosave system and only saves once you have met certain key checkpoints. There is no option to manually save in this game, which can be really annoying if you need to close the game immediately, your computer runs out battery / abruptly terminates the game due to some kind of error, or simply the game or computer just freezes and needs a reboot. You could find yourself losing a half hour or so of progress, which is not devastating, but still enough to be pretty irritating and inconvenient. The game does not even support a quicksave feature (for those of you who do not know what a quicksave is, it is a temporary save on a game so you may continue where you left off like a normal save, but is deleted, or to put it more lightly, removed as soon as you start the game, it is convenient if you need to stop somewhere in the game, but you do not have time to reach an actual savepoint, I apologize if it is a bit of a crude summary).\n\nIf Bioshock Infinite™ could have an update that at least fixes the first two problems that I have wrote, I would give this game 1,000,000/10! If they could even add a quicksave feature, that would be pretty nice, too, but I am most concerned about the first two problems, especially the first one. These save dilemmas can get in the way for some of the enjoyment for OCD completionists, like my self, but that still does not change the fact that this is still a VERY excellent game. I am aware that most of my review has been about the negative, but I still stand by my overall positive verdict for this game because there are still so many excellent aspects of this game, but I believe it would be better for you to experience them yourself than for me to just make a long list about all of them. Even if you are reading this after the Bioshock Infinite™ sale has ended, it is still worth every penny of its full price! Besides, you could also always give a little time and wait for it to be on sale once more. Even if you have never played any of the previous Bioshock™ titles, you will still have so much with this awesome, spectacular game! Give Bioshock™ a try! You won’t regret the experience! Stunning visuals, intense gameplay, a deep story, and so much more to explore in Bioshock Infinite™!","timestamp_created":1395720809,"timestamp_updated":1395720809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476618707180023193","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9624628","author":{"steamid":"76561198083621943","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1037,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":924,"last_played":1395783144},"language":"english","review":"I highly recommend this","timestamp_created":1395720563,"timestamp_updated":1395720563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9624448","author":{"steamid":"76561198043786514","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":806,"last_played":1400221752},"language":"english","review":"The dlc is good too","timestamp_created":1395718024,"timestamp_updated":1631941177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9624428","author":{"steamid":"76561198045662634","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":6149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5800,"last_played":1546918128},"language":"english","review":"A masterpiece, and quite simply the best all-around gaming experience I've ever had.

Floating amongst the clouds, cruising far above sea level, this is a place unlike any you've ever seen. Please enjoy your voyage...\n\nThe third game in the popular Bioshock series, BioShock Infinite breaks away from the underwater setting of the first two games to take players into a floating city held aloft by dirigibles. The game is set in 1912. You play as Booker DeWitt, a disgraced former private detective who's picked up a new case. Your goal is to find Elizabeth, a young woman who's gone missing and return her unharmed. The only problem is that she's being kept on this flying city. Columbia was once a symbol of America's success as a nation, floating around the world as a traveling World's Fair, a marvel of human innovation. But strange things have happened since Columbia's unveiling in 1900, and now the city has disappeared into the clouds. Dewitt knows how to find it, but over the years stories have been told about Columbia having unlawful heavy armament and deranged citizenry. Do not expect this to be a pleasure cruise. but is in my opinion better than bioshock 2 and can definitely stand up to the first with its kckass gameplay, new plasmids, or: vigors that really changes how you upgrade them and choose  which path you decide to play. my favorate aspect of the game is elizabeth who is more of a partner than a nucense and can relate to her as an actual person","timestamp_created":1395710581,"timestamp_updated":1395710581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9623710","author":{"steamid":"76561198068449519","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1831,"last_played":1438816435},"language":"english","review":"Amazing thats all JUST BUY IT","timestamp_created":1395710094,"timestamp_updated":1395710094,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9623671","author":{"steamid":"76561198076819347","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4972,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2094,"last_played":1404689037},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bioshock Infinity é uma obra de arte!","timestamp_created":1395709764,"timestamp_updated":1396139726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9623646","author":{"steamid":"76561198046248465","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2066,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2066,"last_played":1374487047},"language":"english","review":"Can I recommend this game?

Tiene uno, sino el mejor apartado artístico que he visto en un videojuego y el más detallista junto con Deus Ex: HR en ese aspecto. Simplemente espectacular e inmersiva la atmosfera que ha creado Irrational Games, incluida una banda sonora mas que sobresaliente y adecuada para tal.\n\nAunque sea \"otro shooter más\" lo considero otro de sus puntos fuertes, pues aparte de tener un sistema de combate ligero y fluido, el añadido de los \"vigorizadores\" o \"poderes\" les da un toque de variedad y diversión a dichos tiroteos. No os preocupeis por la dificultad, pues en dificultades altas las pasareis bastante canutas\n\nComo punto negativo voy a poner algo que otros pueden considerar positivo, y es lo increiblemente enrevesado de su historia, estoy pendiente de jugar una segunda vuelta, pero he intentado buscar teorias en Internet acerca de ella y hasta dichas teorias son confusas. A día de hoy todavía tengo muchas dudas, pero aun así es una historia atractiva y muy interesante; y aun no habiendola entendido al 100%, no me ha impedido disfrutar de esta obra de arte.\n\nFinalmente acabo diciendo que he podido jugar a las dos partes de Burial at Sea y las recomiendo encarecidamente. No voy a hablar mucho, pues la historia sucede en Rapture y se centra algo más en el primer Bioshock que en Ininite y yo dejé el primer Bio a medio acabar (muy mal, fallo mio) pero me he informado y aclara y CIERRA la saga.
