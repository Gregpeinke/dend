Having only known games where I was in complete control, I went into Portal hoping to be challenged. I was not disappointed. I first opened up this game while I was in the midst of a panic attack during a power outage in my house and I was immediately calmed down. Portal provided the perfect distraction with their somewhat ruthless robot lady friend, GLaDOS, whom I enjoyed dearly and excellent game design. The chambers (puzzles, in this case) were not extremely difficult to tackle so I was able to get a hang of it fairly quick. My only recommendation is to play through the whole game again after you've got the gist of each chamber and the final \"boss\" showdown because the dialogue is exquisite. Personally, I've gone back in many times to try and earn all of the achievements, which has made the experience with this game even better for me. For the TL;DR people who still have not bought this game: Buy it. It's so worth it.","timestamp_created":1568135448,"timestamp_updated":1568135448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55049369","author":{"steamid":"76561198967312784","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":133,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":130,"last_played":1570459180},"language":"english","review":"fantastic
