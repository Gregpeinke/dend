From the beginning of the game to the very last cutscene, the game is steeped in a fascinating atmosphere. You wake up in the mysterious Aperture Laboratories testing facility, being spoken to by an unseen robotic voice who guides you through the various testing chambers of the facility. You'll quickly notice, of course, that she's far from an uninteresting character.\n\nEarly on, you are given a Portal Gun, which is the game's primary puzzle mechanic. With this tool, you're able to create two portals on most surfaces which you can step through. This opens up a huge variety of puzzles, which the game quite adequately explores.\n\nThere are a few other notable items at your disposal, notably the Companion Cube (and movable cubes in general) which also greatly assist the gameplay. You'll also find a number of secrets hidden around the many levels, contributing to the atmosphere and your understanding of the universe that the game has crafted.\n\nThe controls are quite simple, and the graphics hold up fine today. The soundtrack on its own isn't anything special, but the way it changes based on your actions and environment is very fitting. Portal was probably one of the most influential puzzle games ever created; countless games have taken inspiration from it since its release. While it's a short game overall, it's definitely worth playing through.","timestamp_created":1490480642,"timestamp_updated":1521509480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30737624","author":{"steamid":"76561197998662280","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1656416337},"language":"spanish","review":"Grandísimo juego.","timestamp_created":1490480307,"timestamp_updated":1490480307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30734103","author":{"steamid":"76561198114662240","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1538613380},"language":"english","review":"If i were the portal lady i would put a portal on the floor and than a portal above the toilet and doodie in the floor portal to see if i can make the shot so my dad will finally be proud of me and let me borrow his car","timestamp_created":1490468611,"timestamp_updated":1490472127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30732932","author":{"steamid":"76561198201709110","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":110,"last_played":1505583266},"language":"spanish","review":"un poco decepcionante que dure tan poco (2 horas y porque me pare a explorar un poco y a hacer capturas), pero es valve asi que se le permite","timestamp_created":1490465161,"timestamp_updated":1490465161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30726599","author":{"steamid":"76561198276538434","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1309,"last_played":1548435619},"language":"english","review":"The second best puzzle game of all time (first one is Portal 2).

If you get it in a bundle you can essentially get it for the price of a doughnut. \nIt's about 4 hours which although not long again if you get it in a bundle it's so cheap it doesn't matter. This game is good quality.\nThis game doesn't have as many mechanics or as good story telling as portal 2 but again it's still worth it. \nThis game is worth it for at least the unique puzzles alone and a bit of backstory to how portal 2 came to place. The puzzles learning curve may not be as good as portal 2 but it's still decent. It's nice to understand how the mechanics and setting for portal 2 originated in my opinion.","timestamp_created":1489900966,"timestamp_updated":1608528336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537037014961242676","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30607140","author":{"steamid":"76561198062815335","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1489897770},"language":"italian","review":"Un giochino puzzle molto carino, ha delle meccaniche interessantissime, però è troppo breve, persino per un gioco puzzle.\n\nPro:\n- meccaniche fantastiche, sfruttare i portali per interagire in ogni modo con l'ambiente (es. butta un oggetto nel portale per trasferirlo, fai passare i razzi nemici nel portale per aprirti la strada) è la base del gioco\n- non particolarmente complesso, un pizzico di cervello e un po' di pazienza bastano\n\nContro:\n- troppo breve (meno di 3 ore)\n\nTutto sommato, data la durata, lo consiglierei a tutti i giocatori, anche a quelli non particolarmente pazienti.","timestamp_created":1489898247,"timestamp_updated":1489898247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30607090","author":{"steamid":"76561198106546952","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164,"last_played":1533354863},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever if you love a great story, puzzles and just good all around humor, BUY THIS GAME AND PLAY IT!!!!

This game has aged really well. I loved the game then, and I feel the same now; it still has its simple charm, and the puzzles range from very easy to pleasantly tricky. I know some people knock this game for its length, but I think its short duration makes it easy for anybody to jump in and enjoy. This game has a little replay value... probably 4 times or so before it gets old. The challenges add the most value to this game, and I don't think too many people have actually beaten ALL of the challenges. \n\nSimply put, Portal is easily a classic game that can be played by gamers of all ages.","timestamp_created":1489889503,"timestamp_updated":1489893711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30604594","author":{"steamid":"76561198121713640","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":842,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":773,"last_played":1594612071},"language":"english","review":"l;","timestamp_created":1489886251,"timestamp_updated":1489886251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30604049","author":{"steamid":"76561198079703901","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":608,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":583,"last_played":1589858114},"language":"spanish","review":"noobs parad ya con los portales pesaos que mareo 10/10 para cuando regalarme el 2? y glados para cuando mi tarta? xd okno","timestamp_created":1489883724,"timestamp_updated":1490559509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30603808","author":{"steamid":"76561198240238450","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":372,"last_played":1604881982},"language":"english","review":"Completed the game but it didn't give me any other achievments other than the 2 ones in the beginning. 10/10 I want a 3rd one too.","timestamp_created":1489882693,"timestamp_updated":1500628618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42Lf78doCcKLfdA=="}
