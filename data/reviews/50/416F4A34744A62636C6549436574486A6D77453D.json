However it's excusable as the gameplay is what holds it together. Compared to the original Half Life. Opposing Force adds more ways for units that tag along with you to help out, and it also adds more weapons to use. You will still be at home with the fast Half Life gameplay but now with LMG's and some new Zen weapons that add to the momentum based combat. It also adds more enemy Archetypes to fight against later in the game that require you to think some of your movements out a little more instead of just b-hopping everywhere. It's nothing that stands out too much but is a good play through if you already enjoyed Half Life 1's mechanics but wanted more Black Mesa and less Zen.","timestamp_created":1525101628,"timestamp_updated":1525101628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41760054","author":{"steamid":"76561197978013664","num_games_owned":356,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":560,"last_played":1525024765},"language":"english","review":"HalfLife Opposing Force brings the has much action and problem solving challenges as HalfLife, but if you're a fan of HalfLife then you'll enjoy being on the other side of the story, and find the exquisite moments where both storylines touch very entertaining.

Lot of new atractive enviroments - biodomes, testing areas, biolabs, exteriors in desert and even the training mission was fun.

This game is arguably even better than the original Half-Life in a lot of aspects and in any discussion about Half-Life you will have people who will list this as their all time favorite Half-Life game. It's for a good reason obviously considering how much the game expands upon the formula and mechanics of the first Half-Life. \n\nThe game introduces a ton of new content in all aspects. You have a new alien faction known as \"race-x\" that ramps up the difficulty and challenge in the game a ton and in general this game is quite a bit harder than the original Half-Life so I recommend playing it AFTER you complete the original Half-Life, while the game starts out with just normal Xen enemies once the race-x dudes start showing up you are going to realize how dangerous things have gotten when your trapped in a sewer with the big race-x dudes who shoot giant fucking death balls at you that can kill instantly if you are in the direct way of the ball. The game also expands upon the \"black-ops\" by making them a separate faction from HECU and adding appropriate units to replace what would be marine enemies in the original Half-Life. There is also a great number of more companians available to the player including medic's which in addition to being capable of firing back at the enemy also can heal the player and other friendly units, you have engineers who can cut through doors with their blow torch, and of course just normal grunts who dont have any special ability's per say but usually come with a pretty good weapon like a shotgun or assault rifle. You also have a new security guard in addition to your normal Barney's who's called \"Otis\" and he is a pretty amusing and interesting character to have and, again, spices up the content by adding more variety. \n\nThe arsenal the player is capable of carrying has been drastically expanded upon including two different melee weapons in place of half-life 1's single melee weapon and multiple alien and experimental weapons. A big stand out to me was the teleporter gun which can one hit \"kill\" an enemy by essentially teleporting him to a random location presumably somewhere in Xen, but the secondary fire will teleport you yourself to a random location in Xen that can only be accessed in that way and often contains many resources and a teleport on the other side which will get you back into black mesa at a fixed position that is usually later in the level, which is interesting because it essentially allows you to skip whole parts of levels as long as you have the ammo to utilize the alt-fire. There is also a barnacle weapon which the player can use to grapple across gaps and walls at points as well as latch on to enemies and pull it into its maw which the barnacle will proceed to devour, really creative and diverse weapons loadout for sure. \n\nThe story adds a lot of interesting new lore to the Half-Life story besides just a new alien race by clarifying on the relationship between the soldiers and the black-ops and a pretty disturbing plot point of what happens to the marines who fail to evacuate or are left behind after the order to pull out comes out. It also expands on the character of the G-man giving new insight into his \"personality\" and actions as well as expanding on the ending to half-life by showing what happens to black mesa itself after everything is said and done. \n\nThe multiplayer has also been expanded upon with many maps and game-modes that the original Half-Life simply does not have. \n\nThe only bad part of playing this thing is after playing such an awesome game your going to be tempted to recall the current state of gearbox software and feel a bit of despair at the whole thing. Its like if somebody who you like and highly respected joined a skinhead gang, became a gay prostitute and contracted aids and than went around snorting cocaine and beating up homeless people and stray dogs and puppy's before shooting up an old folks home before blowing himself up and screaming \"hail Satan\" as his last words.

Immersive, interactive, destructive, physically correct, and grotesquely violent, [i]Opposing Force[/i] ensures a quality game of [i]Half-Life[/i] as a reality.\n[b]+[/b] Gordon could break boxes with the crowbar, but Adrian Shephard can turn Headcrabs (amongst other small creatures) into a splat of guts with the powerful strike of a wrench. The player gets a thorough story of a tale of one soldier of the Opposing Force who finds himself to be fighting for survival, and while the secondary characters that tell the dialogue are still designed to be \"there and done\", the exchange of conversation and dialogue has notably been improved.\n[b]+[/b] Graphics are equally beautiful as the original, and the level design is agreeable and additionally, thanks to the utilization of some of the additions of new content, has some of the trickiest and most well-planned level architectures and puzzles ever.\n[b]+[/b] For an expansion pack, we got an abundance of new weapons (up to 23 according to the game files and in multiplayer compared to the original's 14--with 5 being entirely new weapons and 4 essentially being re-editions--though there are only 17 in single-player), enemies, personnel with their own abilities for helping the player, and ways of physically interacting with the world, notably the climbing of ropes, which I find to be among the most pleasing additions to the game. Gearbox obviously tried so hard to make the game not feel too familiar to the original that they would add the new stuff and replace some content with better versions. The Barnacle as a weapon is a very special surprise to me, we have teleporting guns, there are replacements such as the revolver being placed by the more-functional Desert Eagle, and we are fighting primarily against a race of aliens known as Race X, comprising species other than those in the original game, not to mention that the flashlight has been replaced by night vision.\n[b]+[/b] As a bonus for enthusiasts of multiplayer, functionality is expanded to not only include Deathmatch as in the original [i]Half-Life[/i] as well as additional levels, but Capture the Flag as well.\n[b]-[/b] Sadly, there are cases where there are under-demonstrations of the improvements such as the ropes as well as over-demonstration of certain improvements at a time that can render the game a bit repetitive, specifically late in it. I have had a lot of fun with the improvements, but with about 7 hours of campaign, I am left disappointed with the feeling of missing out on the full potential.\n\n[b]CONCLUSION:[/b] [i]Half-Life: Opposing Force[/i] offers ideas that further demonstrate the capabilities of the GoldSrc engine and successfully build on the original game, in the same way that made the original popular to begin with.\n\n[b]SCORE: 90%[/b]","timestamp_created":1521855031,"timestamp_updated":1525742124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40977834","author":{"steamid":"76561198257882992","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54,"last_played":1652021422},"language":"english","review":"It's ok.","timestamp_created":1521738035,"timestamp_updated":1521740832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483228385448455811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40973513","author":{"steamid":"76561198405776393","num_games_owned":329,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":161,"last_played":1607103869},"language":"russian","review":"Жду Half-Life: Opposing Force 2\n\nИгра хоть и является обычным аддоном для культовой игры, но сомневаюсь, что у OF меньше фанатов чем у HL.\nGearbox сделали нам Blue Shift и Decay, где мы играем за работников Black Mesa.
