I couldn't tell you if it's better or worse, but it's just a bit different. While the first game was mostly small rooms and thinking puzzles, This game is large rooms with less thinking and more story. There ARE still times that the game is like the first, but most of the second half of the game is spent looking for the Portal-compatible surface that you missed in order to advance the story. The coop mode is a great game to play with a friend(or little brother). If you only have one copy of the game, you can use two controllers (or remap the first controller as the second, while player 1 uses the KB & M) to play splitscreen mode, which is unfortunately a rare find in modern day multiplayer games, especially on PC. If you don't have a friend who has or wants to buy the game, that's okay, it's still a good purchase.

That’s why success of the first part of the Portal was a surprise even for the VALVe. Therefore seriously question arose about the Portal 2. And what we got? Let's see.\n\n　STILL ALIVE?\n\n　　The game begins with the fact that Chell along with her new partner, personality module Wheatley, is trying to escape from an abandoned Aperture Science laboratory. Throughout the game, the plot makes a interesting twists. Individual deserves compliments perfect finale, after which there remain only a warm feeling. In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.\n\n　ONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER\n\n　　One of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.\n\n　ENDLESS TESTS\n\n　　In game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard). In no case do not miss the community maps.\n\n　Multiplayer:\n　　Online: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ \n　　Co-op:    ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O\n　Storyline:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O\n　Graphics:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O\n　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺\n\n　\n\n　Complexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned (if you have good friend for the co-op) in the one-two walkthrough.\n\n　　　　[i]VALVe made another good\n　　game.

Ich feier die Source Engine generell total, da sie auch auf schlechteren Rechnern ruckelfrei läuft und trotzdem super aussieht. Portal 2 an sich macht einen Total süchtig und es ist sehr abwechslungsreich. Die Story vom Singleplayer ist super durchdacht und auch perfekt umgesetzt. Beim Co-Op ist zwar weniger Story mit drin, dafür macht es aber mega Spass seinen Kumpel mal zu trollen ;) Super Spiel nicht nur für Leute die gern Rätseln sondern auch für andere","timestamp_created":1403027861,"timestamp_updated":1403027861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501039505004882813","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10505307","author":{"steamid":"76561198068930266","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":61442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":581,"last_played":1650101312},"language":"spanish","review":"Una obra de arte.","timestamp_created":1403023345,"timestamp_updated":1403023345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10505189","author":{"steamid":"76561198119610358","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1838,"last_played":1656589056},"language":"czech","review":"Portal 2 je úžasná logická hra plná napínavého překvapujícího a dojemného děje.\nRozhodně doporučuji!","timestamp_created":1403022771,"timestamp_updated":1403022802,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10505028","author":{"steamid":"76561198116727932","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":4674,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1869,"last_played":1589415182},"language":"english","review":"After Playing this, I can't stop saying SPAAAACE!!!","timestamp_created":1403021712,"timestamp_updated":1403021712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10504606","author":{"steamid":"76561198076502564","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":7093,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3117,"last_played":1597494171},"language":"finnish","review":"jes!","timestamp_created":1403019139,"timestamp_updated":1403019139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543396234512329102","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10503933","author":{"steamid":"76561198108557278","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":26979,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18799,"last_played":1656158099},"language":"english","review":"EDIT FROM THE FUTURE:  Most of this is me being a nerdy scallop.

Portal was an awesome game, now you make it even better with a deeper story, better graphics and more testing elements. My favorite, besides a portal? Lasers or light bridges, can't pick. There is so much more to this game than beating it. You find all the hidden areas, make your own test chambers, get all the achievements and other things. Just like Portal. But the one thing that makes me really mad is when people dont even play portal 1 and say they hate portal 2. Don't believe them; they only say that because they dont know the story. You should make a thing where you cant buy a sequel for a game unless you bought the original and beat it.
