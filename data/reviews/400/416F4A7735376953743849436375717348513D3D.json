Glados is one of the best virtual characters in recent years. That computer has more personality than many humans from other games.\n\nThroughout the game the player acquires a portal gun. This gun allows you to create portals, to enter and exit portals in order to go forward in the game, which requires solving logic puzzles to advance. You will  acquire a good sense of physics, position and movement.\n\nThe game is a marvel of Valves creativity. Many would prefer to kill zombies in left 4 dead , but personally, I think games like Portal are those who write history. The game lasts a few hours and when it finishes,  with music and lyrics, it makes you want to stand and applaud. No other game in recent years has touched me so much when it ended. It is an ode to creativity.\n\nIts sequel , Portal 2, expands the concept of the game and makes it much longer, making it a standalone game. The Portal 2 was named Game of the Year in 2011 for various publications.\n\nThe game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360 before being ported to MAC OSX.\n\nNow that I've finished the review I want my cake ! .\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nESPAÑOL\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPortal es un videojuego de lógica y estrategia en primera persona desarrollado por Valve en 2007 y lanzado en un paquete llamado Orange Box. \n\nEl jugador despierta en una sala de cristal, el centro de desarrollo de Aperture Science, donde es sometido a una serie de experimentos hasta que …… no les voy a arruinar el juego....\nEn cada experimento lo va guiando una voz, que es Glados, la computadora central del centro de desarrollo. Glados es uno de los mejores personajes virtuales de los últimos años. Esta computadora tiene más personalidad que muchos humanos de otros juegos.\n\nA lo largo del juego el jugador adquiere una pistola de portales. Esta pistola de portales le permite generar portales para entrar y salir por donde le es posible e ir avanzando en el juego, que requiere resolver acertijos lógicos para seguir adelante. Para ello hay que adquirir un buen sentido de la física, la posición y el movimiento.\n\nEl juego es una maravilla de la creatividad de Valve. Quizas muchos prefieran matar zombies como en el left 4 dead, pero personalmente creo que juegos como el Portal son los que escriben la historia. Finalmente al terminar en unas pocas horas, con musica y letra, dan ganas de pararse y aplaudir. Ningun juego posterior a portal me emocionó tanto. Es una oda a la creatividad.\n\nSu secuela, el Portal 2 amplía el concepto del juego y lo hace mucho más largo, convirtiéndolo en un juego independiente. El Portal 2 fue nombrado Juego del Año en 2011 por diversas publicaciones. \n\nEl juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, PS3 y XBOX 360 para luego ser portado a MAC OSX. \n\nAhora que terminé el review quiero mi torta!.","timestamp_created":1385437795,"timestamp_updated":1385955527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":215,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.85685354471206665","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7756861","author":{"steamid":"76561198049329102","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":543,"last_played":1385500640},"language":"brazilian","review":"Portal, zerei este game a 3 dias e tenho muito a dizer.\nQuem já jogou e curtiu Half-Life provavelmente vai gostar de Portal. \nNo começo o jogo pode pensar que só mais um arcade cheio de quebra-cabeças com uma narração de voz feminina computadorizada, não muito interessante(mas engraçada), mas logo na metade, se não me engano, já da para começa sentir a \"alma\" do jogo, como em Half-Life. O jogo possui uma história um tanto misteriosa com pequenas menções a Half-Life, pois os dois se passam no mesmo universo. O que mais me impressiona é que o jogo tem um incrível clima de filme de ficção-científica, aquele sobre testes em humanos e maquinas, e tudo isso sem uma cutscene durante todo o jogo (somente a do final).\nConcluindo, é um ótimo jogo, recomendo a todos, principalmente aos fãs de Half-Life e até mesmo aos fãs de jogos com quebra-cabeças interessantes.\nZerei mesmo o jogo, mas se escrevi alguma besteira na Análise me avisem nos comentários.

The game starts out perfectly, with you waking up in a chamber to a female voice talking to you over the speaker. As you progress through the game, there's this creepy ambiance that never leaves. The OST also fits the game perfectly. It's not meant to distract from the game, it just compliments it. The lore behind this game is some of the best out there. If you have somehow never played this game, you owe it to yourself to try it. Not only is it fun, but it's a nice brain workout to just sit down and solve some puzzles. The game mechanic is so simple yet so unique that it makes this game amazing.","timestamp_created":1384999102,"timestamp_updated":1573008981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7705631","author":{"steamid":"76561198110343112","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":177,"last_played":1414259466},"language":"english","review":"good game i highly recommend you get this","timestamp_created":1384982548,"timestamp_updated":1384982548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7704687","author":{"steamid":"76561198087703901","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":523,"last_played":1578023113},"language":"english","review":"um dos melhores jogos do universo,inclui outros universos tambem.","timestamp_created":1384973387,"timestamp_updated":1384973387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7702839","author":{"steamid":"76561198113789889","num_games_owned":1038,"num_reviews":99,"playtime_forever":22,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22,"last_played":1383942578},"language":"english","review":"The cake is a lie.\n\nPortal is a puzzle game from Valve, originally packaged with The Orange Box, and was a surprise hit from the pack with such hits as Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, Half-Life 2 Episode 1 & 2. \n\nYou are Chell, and you are an Aperture Science experiment, and you are guided through the test trials by GLaDOS, the lovable, but hated robot who's funny jokes and ironic sense of humor makes the game a lot more funny and hilarious at times, considering you are the only human in the whole game, no other humans are present in the game, but GLaDOS makes the game great.\n\nIn the later parts of the game, it can get quite challenging, but never so challenging that you would have to resort to YouTubing a guide, at least not for me. Portal was the best game out of The Orange Box, in my honest opinion, and for the price of £6.99, you can't go wrong with a bit of GLaDOS and cake. (P.S.
