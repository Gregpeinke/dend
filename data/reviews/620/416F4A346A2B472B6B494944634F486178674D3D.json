I loved the first one, and fully expected those feelings to carry over to the sequel. And it does have a lot going for it, you can really see the dedication the developers put into it and the lengths they went to to expand every part of the experience. We learn much more about the game's lore with Aperture Science, what they're actually about, and the true nature of GLaDOS. There are a bunch of new puzzle features like bounce gel, energy bridges, and stuff like that, which are very interesting and can be fun to play around with. And the game has more of a clear-cut, interesting story beyond just \"do tests (and try to escape).\" To be fair that is the basis of this game's plotline just as much as the first, but there is more depth to it, twists and turns, and more characters. \n\nMy main issues with the game are 1) It is not nearly as intuitive in design as the first one, and 2) It is way too dark for the majority of the game. \n\nIn Portal 1 the levels were generally very bright and clinical, you could see everything in a room and could much more easily parse out what the mechanics of the level were. In this one it feels like I'm constantly straining my eyes to try and figure out where I am or what the room around me looks like. There are long linear chase scenes where you race across catwalks and whatnot in the facility, and they made me feel frustrated and like I was missing things because I could hardly see where I was going. The problem was most egregious in the lower levels (pun intended) where large complex puzzles had to be solved in very low light. Several times I got stuck because I couldn't see where I was or got confused because I thought there was somewhere in the darkness I was supposed to try and reach, but there was nothing there.\n\nThis ties into the level design in general. In Portal 1 I enjoyed all of the levels (although I was impatient in the first couple levels to get a fully functional portal gun) and only got truly stuck one time. In this game I got stuck much more frequently and found myself getting more and more frustrated. With the first Portal I played the whole thing in only a couple of sessions and could hardly tear myself away from the game. With this one I found myself wanting to play it less and less. By the last third or so of the game I was no longer having much fun. I wanted to get to the end and see how the story concluded, but I wasn't enjoying myself on the levels themselves. I think this is related to the level design (being poorly-lit among other things) but also because I think the 2nd Portal game is much harder. There are a lot more mechanics and machines to remember and they interact in interesting ways. This isn't necessarily a bad thing (in fact it's probably a really good thing) but it got overwhelming for me and lessened my enjoyment.\n\nThe first portal game was generally a pretty relaxing experience for me; as previously mentioned I only got stuck once in the whole game and it was generally pretty simple for me to determine how to beat each level with some low-stakes experimentation. It was fun to see how the different mechanics worked together and it never took too long to determine the way forward. Maybe it's just that it was easier, and I'm sure many other players will welcome the added challenge. But each room took so much longer in Portal 2, and I died much more frequently. I got frustrated, and it honestly diminished my enjoyment. Say what you will about me complaining that a game was too hard, but I really liked Portal 1 because I thought it had a very good balance between interesting, complex levels and difficulty. This game lacks that, at least for me.\n\nP.S. As a result of me taking so much longer to complete levels, as well as the greatly expanded NUMBER of levels in the 2nd game, it felt very very long to complete. If the levels were all as fun and intuitive as the original this wouldn't be a problem, and I understand to a point why there were so many because it introduced so many other kinds of mechanics and machines. It's wonderful that the developers wanted to include so many new and unique ideas. But it just seemed like way too much for me. If you see my # of hours played you'll see that this took twice as long to beat as the original. And honestly after all of that I feel too burnt out to really muster any enthusiasm for repeating the experience, much less recommending it to others.\n\nTL;DR- respect the developer's efforts to expand the experience, but found the game frustrating, counter-intuitive, and not as fun as the original.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Played the game through again, got a better set up where I could see the dark parts of the screen better. Its still kind of an issue in my opinion, but not a major one. Anyway, the game grew on me. I helped my little brother in his playthrough it as well, and we had fun. So I suppose I WOULD recommend it to others, as long as they understand that this game is noticeably more challenging than its predecessor.

Portal 2, there's little one can add about it that hasn't been said before. It might feel a bit short, but the comedic factor, soundtrack, atmosphere and gameplay ALL make up for it. Besides, there's even a co-op mode with plenty of missions (too bad I haven't anyone to play it with). You might need to buy the original Portal game to fully understand the story, but it's quite straightforward to understand even if you don't want to play through the first game. All in all, I'd honestly recommend this to anyone.","timestamp_created":1658411595,"timestamp_updated":1658411595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119199248","author":{"steamid":"76561198398811756","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":11344,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11344,"last_played":1652347526},"language":"english","review":"Best voiceover in a game.","timestamp_created":1658410699,"timestamp_updated":1658410699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j+G+kIIDcOHaxgM="}
