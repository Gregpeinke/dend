Personally, I feel the vehicle sections do not live up to the quality of the rest of the game. On the technical side,  I did experience the occasional crash and gamepad detection bugs. \n\nThose faults pale into insignifcance on playing though. Half life 2 pulls you in and doesn't let go. It's understandable why the world awaits Half Life 3 so keenly. I'm still  keeping my fingers crossed, but then again how to do you fulfil the weight of expectation that has built over time, and add to the legacy of such a classic?\n\nHalf Life 2 truly has stood the test of time.

Например, я запомнил, что если не прописать команду ai_что-то там, то боты просто стояли на месте и ничего не делали. Но даже после использования команды, они все равно в некоторых сюжетных местах вставали в дверях и отказывались идти куда-либо дальше. Такие моменты я преодолевал с помощью чита на прохождение сквозь стены, потом отключал его и продолжал играть дальше. Еще помню, что у меня не работал режим форсажа на багги, из-за чего я никак не мог перепрыгнуть разломы в некоторых участках трассы. На помощь опять же приходили читы. Тем не менее игра тогда оставила неизгладимые впечатления. Просто потому что это был крутой графоний, занимательный геймплей, а еще меня тогда очень поражала натуральная физика, которую до того я в играх не видел. Какого же было мое удивление, когда проходя HL2 в 2017, я испытал теже чувства неописуемого восторга. Графоний уже вроде как не удивляет. Он хорош, но все же. Физика... Ну этого мы уже насмотрелись. Может быть сюжет? Да. Но не сам сюжет (хотя лично мне он очень по нраву), а его подача. За всю игру наш альтер-эго не произносит ни одного слова при общении с другими персонажами. Его называют молчаливым героем... Как бы не так. Просто этот ход дает возможность отвечать нам самим, дает возможность вжиться в роль Гордона Фримена. Мне это очень удавалось так ненавязчиво в процессе игры, когда я замечал за собой, как разговариваю с монитором, отвечая на вопросы или реплики героев по ту сторону экрана. Ну а еще конечно же геймплей. Я прокрутил в голове множество игр, в которые мне довелось сыграть, и лишь единицы могут похвастаться подобным HL2 разнообразием игрового процесса. Только вот у Халвы при этом очень простая механика. Серьезно! Никакого тут тебе пианино на клавиатуре, никаких сложных правил. Разберется даже маленький ребенок. Именно эти два аспекта, по моему скромному мнению, и цепляют в этой игре. Именно все это и делает HL2 одной из лучших игр на ПК.","timestamp_created":1504160729,"timestamp_updated":1504160729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34626591","author":{"steamid":"76561198239855160","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1046,"last_played":1468668092},"language":"english","review":"REST IN PEACE, GORDON FREEMAN.

Можете хейтить меня  за такой отзыв фанаты этого переоцененного треша. В детстве не доиграл этот кал, ибо было дико скучно и однаобразно, и тут решил пройти её до конца, подумав ну бля стал взрослее, как-то может пойму ВЕЛИКИЙ СМЫСЛ ИГРЫ, ТАЙНЫ, СКРЕПЫ... Ниxyя, игра как и была для меня пустышкой в 2004-2005, так и осталась таким же трешом.","timestamp_created":1504136145,"timestamp_updated":1504136145,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.378223925828933716","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34620648","author":{"steamid":"76561198059797801","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1501906128},"language":"english","review":"This game is fun and has tons of cool mods which is really cool","timestamp_created":1504134208,"timestamp_updated":1504134208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468136519193649292","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34619934","author":{"steamid":"76561198304330664","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":6632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4730,"last_played":1616113364},"language":"english","review":"Oh my god this was the best game in the whole freaking world I cant belive its even real I just play this game over and over sooooo upset that there wont be a part 3...

I'm not going to pretend to know whether or not a lot of the mechanics in this game were revolutionary, but I have a good feeling that this game is the reason FPS games are where they are.\n\nThis game just feels original, it feels like it introduces a lot of what we've seen in FPS games even into the modern era. Somehow, it feels way ahead of its time even though it's not a terribly old game still. There are your regular FPS mechanics, driving mechanics, and even group-commanding mechanics all in this game. Even the gravity gun reminds of my recent trips through Portal, and how \"specialty\" weapons can really influence a game and its play.\n\nAll of these things may have existed in games, but this seems to have made them all so much better at the time of its release. You can really tell that this game influenced many of those that followed it. I'm not going to say anything else about the story or the game at this point you haven't heard elsewhere.\n\nIf you want to play Half-Life 2 & haven't ever, just play it NOW. I have no idea what all of the controvery stems from, but just based on this experience I'd have to say it's one of the best games to have ever been installed on my PC. I'm so glad I didn't let all of the negative reviews/comments about the developers keep me from this game.\n\nI'm not from this day forward going to speak towards this game and how amazing it is. It's already well known and popular.\n\nWhat I'm really glad to be able to say to others, is that I've experienced this game in full in my lifetime.","timestamp_created":1504131168,"timestamp_updated":1504131168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477707028388977051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34618994","author":{"steamid":"76561198043285035","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1444061539},"language":"english","review":"A classic game and so much fun.","timestamp_created":1504128629,"timestamp_updated":1504128629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129016876220703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34617242","author":{"steamid":"76561198334624852","num_games_owned":270,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":961,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":810,"last_played":1504123071},"language":"brazilian","review":"Uns dos melhores FPS já feito na historia! tem um enredo muito bom e meio confuso mais com o tempo você entende e a jogabilidade... rapaz e bem fluida e ''rapida'' o jogo e de 2004 mais ainda consegue ter graficos incriveis no ultra! recomendo fortemente essa obra de arte!","timestamp_created":1504123977,"timestamp_updated":1504123977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34616137","author":{"steamid":"76561198293906479","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1058,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":971,"last_played":1504620539},"language":"english","review":"Overall great game.
