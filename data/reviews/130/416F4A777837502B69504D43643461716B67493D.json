seems to have learnt from the issues from HL and HL:OF. Blue Shift has short but sweet story, includes good level design and gameplay. My major gripe with the original was sometimes the game expecting you have more health, making it difficult to progress through the game, this is far less noticeable here. Overall, this game got it right. A \"harder\" game isn't a better game, and Blue Shift was challenging enough to make it engaging, and sometimes unforgiving but at a good level. The end I believe was more entertaining, with more ass-clenching, and less grind. Easter eggs were on point and you never really lose the picture of the objective, it feels in your scope and achievable.

Связано это с тем, что Гирбоксы взяли на себя слишком много и превратили Халфу в военный шутер, надобавив странных оружий, уродливых врагов, и разбавив все это командирским экшеном в стиле Дельта Форс и прочего такого.\nИ несмотря на то, что народу в целом понравилось, Габен доволен не был. Поэтому было принято решение еще раз удлинить Халфу и добавить в нее еще парочку приключенских карт\n\nНа этот раз нам придется играть за одного их охранников (одного из клонов Барни, а точнее за его оригинал)\nКто не в курсе - Барни должен Гордону пивасик и так и не вернет.\nСложность этого дополнения в том, что нас обделили крутой броней, крутых пушек не дают, а поскольку Джимену на нас откроенно плевать, на нас будут сыпаться все бедствия этого мира. Кругом враги, экшена много, а вместо энергоячеек брони, приходится подбирать аккуратно снятые бронежилеты и шлемы с наших павших клонов-охранников.\nИ поскольку Барни не крутой капрал и уж тем более не ошарашенный ученый с ломом в руках, спасать мир он не намерен, а просто хочет свалить из лаборатории, пользуясь хаосом вокруг.\n\nИз плюсов:\n  1)Детализация уровней, на этот раз пустые корридоры Блэк Месы наполнены всяким декором, можно смотреть на ученых и охранников в рубашках, да и вообще начало игры, довольно уютное и обыденное, что радует глаз\n  2)Отсылки к оригинальной игре и Шепарду\n  3)Измененный и слегка усложненный геймплей\n 4)НеПиСи играют бОльшую роль\n  5)Сюжетная составляющая здесь довольно крепка\n\nИз минусов:\n  1)Дополнение еще короче прошлого, здесь всего треть времени геймплея от оригинальной игры\n  2)Экшена можно было бы еще больше\n  3)Новых оружий нет\n  4)Очень много болтовни\n  5)Очень много беганий взад-вперед\n\nЗаключение:\nВ целом дополнение удачное, фанатам должно понравится, но обычному игроку покажется все странным и несуразным, однако могли сделать и лучше. Но слава богу что остановились на создании дополнений...а хотя нет, не остановились\nЕсть еще богомерзкий Decay, с расчетом на двух игроков, есть кстати неофициальный ПК-порт этого дополнения, но если быть честным - оно того не стоит. Если уж сильно хочется ознакомиться - рекомендую посмотреть на Ютубе, правильное кооперативное прохождение\nА что касается Блу Шифта - 7/10","timestamp_created":1593950348,"timestamp_updated":1593950348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72078713","author":{"steamid":"76561198833076449","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":786,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":70,"last_played":1611735073},"language":"english","review":"If you like Half-Life 1, buy this.

The reason being that this was supposed to be an expansion exclusive to the dreamcast, similar to what Half Life Decay was for the PS2. The dreamcast port eventually being canned meant that they were going to move the expansion to PC but to compensate they added the HD weapons pack. This isn't well liked in the Half Life Community as it changes many weapons and doesn't fit with the theming of the game. This game although being short is worth the 2-5 bucks you can find it for.","timestamp_created":1593742611,"timestamp_updated":1593742611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71914565","author":{"steamid":"76561198190041086","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":224,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":224,"last_played":1593735708},"language":"english","review":"barney very anti gay man","timestamp_created":1593735840,"timestamp_updated":1593735840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71913575","author":{"steamid":"76561198400743692","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":307,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1651443219},"language":"english","review":"play before opposing force","timestamp_created":1593734438,"timestamp_updated":1593734438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx7P+iPMCd4aqkgI="}
