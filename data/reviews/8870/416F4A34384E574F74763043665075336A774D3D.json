It's called \"Infinite\" for a reason. I like how it has a totally different conflict but you can tell that it has the resemblance of the first BioShock.\n\nI also really enjoyed the gameplay here much more. Very beautiful environment and pretty much interactive, with fairly responsive NPCs as well. I didn't mind exploring every edge of the environment. I have a lot more fun the way the world's much more wider, as it gives me more dynamic movement in combat, not to mention about railing through the Skyline as well. The atmosphere's so dynamic, you can get amazed with the beauty of the world at some time and then get horrified with how terrible the situation is.\n\nDespite of being horrified, at least in this BioShock I got Elizabeth with me mostly all the time! Each BioShock is almost like a horror game, and having even just a single companion gives a lot more comfort. The way she accompanies feels very much alive, interactive, and helpful, not just another burdensome heroine.

нравится, как игра превращается в кошмар. Сначала все выглядит отлично, но потом вы начинаете замечать, что что-то не так все чаще и чаще. Проходит совсем немного времени, и вы думаете: \"...Ну, не могу дождаться, чтобы узнать, насколько все здесь запущено\". Через некоторое время вы сталкиваетесь с такими вещами, как расизм и неэтичные эксперименты, и это становится все более напряженным. Что касается геймплея, то он великолепен. Разнообразное оружие и способности можно найти по мере того, как вы рассказываете историю и исследуете город. О, и Элизабет, помощник нпс, играет большую роль в сюжете. С точки зрения игрового процесса вам не придется нянчиться с ней, так что это не совсем миссия сопровождения на протяжении всей игры. Летающий город выглядит потрясающе и выполнен в стиле 1910-х годов с великолепными иллюстрациями. Графика по-прежнему выглядит великолепно для игры 8-летней давности, выпущенной в 2013 году. Потрясающий саундтрек, от которого в некоторых моментах мурашки по коже. Но самое лучшее - это потрясающий сюжет, который продолжается на протяжении всей игры. Они выходят в полную силу в конце, с удивительными поворотами. Вы ожидаете, что в конце будет поворот, но не готовы к нему, когда он появляется. Концовка Infinite действительно бьет нас по лицу.","timestamp_created":1638255487,"timestamp_updated":1638255487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104800718","author":{"steamid":"76561198840690043","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":984,"last_played":1631785101},"language":"schinese","review":"一言以蔽之：这不是游戏，这是艺术（当然是个好玩的艺术）","timestamp_created":1638254650,"timestamp_updated":1638254650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104800146","author":{"steamid":"76561198106158333","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":340,"last_played":1638254134},"language":"english","review":"One of the Greatest games of all time.

I snatched this game up while is was on sale and man oh man, it's worth every penny. I clearly did not remember the story well. Now that I'm much older and wiser - I was able to pick up on so many little details that I completely missed on my first playthrough years ago. The story line of this game is one of the best story lines I have ever had the pleasure of playing through. It's incredibly deep, complex and plays with so much emotion. This game will forever be in my top 10. \n\nBottom line: if you're looking for a shooter with good mechanics - look elsewhere. This is a 10 year old game and definitely feels like a 10 year old game. I'm sure you'll be able to find a call of duty on sale for the same price elsewhere. HOWEVER, if you're looking for a story that will make you laugh, cry and ponder, then look no further. \n\n8.9/10 would recommend","timestamp_created":1638203165,"timestamp_updated":1638203165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104715838","author":{"steamid":"76561198271637027","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":486,"last_played":1658347238},"language":"german","review":"geil","timestamp_created":1638200908,"timestamp_updated":1638200908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104713423","author":{"steamid":"76561198194539089","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1305,"last_played":1638199713},"language":"schinese","review":"方丹！看我回到一代敲不敲爆你狗头就完事了！","timestamp_created":1638199756,"timestamp_updated":1638199756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104711925","author":{"steamid":"76561198120123659","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1803,"playtime_last_two_weeks":27,"playtime_at_review":872,"last_played":1660325646},"language":"english","review":"Love this game","timestamp_created":1638199108,"timestamp_updated":1638199108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104710172","author":{"steamid":"76561199210591188","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":700,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":700,"last_played":1638196984},"language":"schinese","review":"一口气玩完满满都是震撼，开头坐火箭上哈利路亚的时候是真的有被惊到，很难想象这是13年的游戏、伊丽莎白这个NPC是我玩过所有游戏中最喜欢的NPC，有求必应，走位时还不会碍着你，永远跟这你走，能与场景进行互动，人物塑造的也很完美。武器与技能繁多互相搭配玩法多变，独特的美术风格和极佳的叙事","timestamp_created":1638198367,"timestamp_updated":1638198367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104710076","author":{"steamid":"76561199182876487","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1638198300},"language":"schinese","review":"值得购买","timestamp_created":1638198325,"timestamp_updated":1638198325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48NWOtv0CfPu3jwM="}
