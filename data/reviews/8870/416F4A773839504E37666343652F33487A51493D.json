I played it on normal difficulty and there has been a solid 3 hour pace of me not even getting close to dying which feels pretty mundane but the thing is, this game doesn't try to be that it's just a simple linear game with basic gameplay that is essentially fun, accompanied with a nice story.\n\n\n-pros \n\n-it's simple fast forward with beautiful visuals that intrigue you in it's world \n-the combat feels nice\n-the world building is great\n-Elizabeth throws you ammo, food, and salt (in-game mana).  ( (it gets repetitive & boring after a while even tho it's cool) )\n\n-cons\n\n-too simple even for a game that's trying to be simple\n-lacking side missions and dialogue that would elevate the atmosphere of the lore\n-the money... I haven't ever used one bit of the money i had in this game and i finished with 5k or something more, it essentially is useless and not really a game changer.\n-no inventory! picking up stuff feels oddly chore-ish and it bores you.\n\na solid 7.9/10","timestamp_created":1614447102,"timestamp_updated":1614447102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87555440","author":{"steamid":"76561198145514343","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1738,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1203,"last_played":1614586573},"language":"english","review":"The story is great","timestamp_created":1614447062,"timestamp_updated":1614447062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87555039","author":{"steamid":"76561198128227911","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":945,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":85,"last_played":1651074847},"language":"english","review":"Elizabeth.","timestamp_created":1614446602,"timestamp_updated":1614446602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87554168","author":{"steamid":"76561198060323365","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":920,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":349,"last_played":1615001940},"language":"english","review":"Good Game","timestamp_created":1614445632,"timestamp_updated":1614445632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87554162","author":{"steamid":"76561198408521843","num_games_owned":319,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":844,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":469,"last_played":1614509332},"language":"russian","review":"[h1]Давайте убьём всех чтобы найти человека да бы отплатить карточный долг?
