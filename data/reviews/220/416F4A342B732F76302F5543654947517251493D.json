BUT i will say this game blew me out of the water, the at direction i thought was amazing and the enemies felt like nothing i've experienced before.. maybe it's because im more of an open world kind of guy yknow?\n\nbut here's a better review: Half Life 2 is a well designed and well directed first person shooter which allows and even encourages you to be creative in order to fully enjoy the presentation laid out before you. In another game like Doom or Cod you'd be either constantly running around and shooting enemies or hiding in cover to wait for your regenerating health, sometimes do a simple flank or do dodge. In Half Life 2 you use your bug bait to make antlions a distraction for your enemies and use your grav gun to create makeshift cover to try and throw a grenade at your enemies. The levels are huge and well designed and i never felt like i would get lost inside them, i somehow felt like the game easily showed me where to go without waypoints or a minimap, not to mention each level tells you to as said before) use the systems laid out for you and situations presented to you to complete several tasks.\n\non story and art design: even though the textures can look..well.. dated.. it's still a really beautiful game due to it's art direction and level design, the aesthetic of the combine arsenal somehow feels alien yet human at the same time, City 17 feels like im in some crappy soviet apartment and the final chapters made me feel like i was really in a war zone. the designs of the combine and enemy behavior are also well made, with most (most) enemies feeling and looking unique, and Combine tech feels less like it's made of steel but more like some kind of fungal like metal.\n\nanyway, in conclusion:\n\nthe gameplay is very fun, and on normal difficulty it's actually pretty easy, but easy in a challengy way. The graphics are still good and the story is also great, go buy it... 10/10","timestamp_created":1605007580,"timestamp_updated":1605007580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79041070","author":{"steamid":"76561198879220944","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":750,"last_played":1605639503},"language":"english","review":"I approve","timestamp_created":1605003583,"timestamp_updated":1628012894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79039716","author":{"steamid":"76561198396840461","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":745,"last_played":1605524662},"language":"english","review":"Certified hood classic","timestamp_created":1605000973,"timestamp_updated":1656501632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79039096","author":{"steamid":"76561198371536205","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1017,"last_played":1604999268},"language":"english","review":"Finally finished Half Life 2. It's a fairly difficult game but insanely fun. I can't believe how the the ending hits you like a bus.\nI don't really mind the very dated graphics, it's gameplay and story more than make up for it.

I think the only downside I can think of so far is I experienced a map loading glitch early-game which forced me to actually noclip to get by, but otherwise everything works as it should.","timestamp_created":1604941532,"timestamp_updated":1604941532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79004268","author":{"steamid":"76561198249973054","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2862,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2862,"last_played":1549031537},"language":"spanish","review":"ta weno","timestamp_created":1604940428,"timestamp_updated":1604940428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79004088","author":{"steamid":"76561199003409357","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1784,"last_played":1654948247},"language":"russian","review":"Тут всё идеально, кроме страйдеров и всё что связанно с уничтожением ракетницей.\n","timestamp_created":1604940196,"timestamp_updated":1604940196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79003575","author":{"steamid":"76561198300871204","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1456,"last_played":1551022324},"language":"polish","review":"Klasyk, gra nadal świetna i mimo lat potrafi wciągnąć.","timestamp_created":1604939505,"timestamp_updated":1604939505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79002643","author":{"steamid":"76561198215425821","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1313,"last_played":1653101455},"language":"english","review":"Played it twice in about a week! great game  i have to get like three more achievements","timestamp_created":1604938232,"timestamp_updated":1604938232,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79002110","author":{"steamid":"76561198017520291","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":984,"last_played":1605049463},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 2 is the sequel to Half Life developed by Valve. The game is a FPS, but the gunplay in 2020 is rather tame. Weapons do not have a lot of recoil and shooting feels too easy. Thankfully, about a third of the way through, you are given the gravity gun. The gravity gun turns almost any object into a physics based weapon and allows for a much more varied combat flow. There's even an achievement for completing a level with only the gravity gun. The game is set 20 or so years after Half Life 1 and features a world taken over by the Combine, an interdimensional alien empire. Humanity surrendered to the Combine not long after they invaded. You play as Gordon Freeman and aid the resistance to free Earth. The game has a hyperspace arsenal allowing you to carry and swap between multiple weapons at a time. It also features two vehicle heavy sections using a car and an airboat. I prefer the car. You visit a variety of locales including abandoned towns, prisons, coastal villages, cities, and the Combine Citadel which serves as their HQ. A complete casual playthrough can last about 8-10 hours.\n\nWeapons include a crowbar, SMG, pistol, magnum, shotgun, grenades, RPG, and an AR. A crossbow can be used for sniping. Music is subtle and fitting for the sections it is used for. \n\nIt's probably Valve's trademark game and you are on Steam. Give it a shot.","timestamp_created":1604937470,"timestamp_updated":1604937470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79000942","author":{"steamid":"76561198382274247","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1421,"last_played":1595367164},"language":"english","review":"The best Half Life game I played next to Alyx.\n(If you do wanna buy just wait to get the valve complete pack on sale)","timestamp_created":1604935980,"timestamp_updated":1604935980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79000758","author":{"steamid":"76561198106057473","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43,"last_played":1605111956},"language":"turkish","review":"Günümüz oyunlarında olmayan akıcılığa ve merak uyandıran senaryoya sahip güzel oyun","timestamp_created":1604935753,"timestamp_updated":1604935753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79000204","author":{"steamid":"76561198279889868","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1545286171},"language":"russian","review":"Революция №2.
