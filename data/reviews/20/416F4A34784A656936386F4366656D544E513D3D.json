Unfortunately the only two active servers left are horrible.\nOne is Drippy's 2fort, and for sad reasons, they only play the map 2fort 24/7, with these super annoying sounds, weird technocrap, general random strange crap happening. 2fort used to be one of the best maps, but TFC made so many more maps, and these guys just rather stick with 2fort only in the worst possible ways. Players usually 3-8 during low peak and 5-20 during high peak.\nThen there is EVIL-Battlezone X. They do go through some maps but their tendency is also to stick mostly with 2fort. Here the admins are mostly not really smart people, they love to ban and kick the few players left that play this game, for the smallest little things (building SG too close to spawn, etc). Less populated than Drippy's, usually around 4-10 players during peak hours.\nThere is alternatively also a BOT server, it can have 3-24 players against bots.

El Scout, no solo posee gran velocidad, sino, también tiene la \n     posibilidad de esquivar grandes cantidades de daño de ciertos enemigos, gracias a su increible velocidad. A parte de \n     poseer gran velocidad y esquiva, el Scout posee una escasa cantidad de salud, haciéndolo sumamente vulnerable a \n     ciertos tipos de daño, tanto a cohetes como a balas.\n\n2) El Soldier: \n     El Soldier es una de las clases con más puntos de salud que se encuentran entre todas las clases disponibles. Esta \n     clase posee un lanzacohetes, una escopeta y una palanca, aunque, su velocidad de movimiento esta entre \n     lenta / intermedia.\n\n3) El Pyro: \n     El Pyro es un pirómano que posee un lanzallamas, una escopeta, una palanca y un lanzacohetes que prende en \n     llamas a los enemigos. El Pyro suele emplear su lanzallamas junto a enemigos con grandes cantidades de salud, \n     mientras que el lanzacohetes, es para un área repleta de enemigos. Al quemar a un enemigo con el lanzallamas, \n     este arderá en llamas durante varios segundos, restándole dos (O más) puntos de salud por segundo, al igual \n     que sucede con el lanzacohetes, solamente, que el impacto de la explosión del lanzacohetes hace un daño en \n     especifíco, y la combustión viene después, haciéndo la msima cantidad de daño y por segundo.\n\n4) El Demoman: \n      El Demoman es un experto en demoliciones, que posee un lanzagranadas, un lanzabombas lapa, una escopeta, \n      y una palanca. El Demoman utiliza su lanzagranadas para un área repleta de enemigos, o un enemigo en común.\n      El Lanzabombas Lapa se utiliza para pegar bombas lapa en ciertas áreas y zonas, hasta que un enemigo se acerque \n      al área repleta de bombas lapa, y el Demoman las haga explotar cuando el quiera, produciéndo una cantidad \n      exagerada de daño, llegando a matar al enemigo.\n\n5) El Heavy: \n     El Heavy es la clase con más puntos de salud entre todas las clases disponibles. El Heavy posee una poderosa \n     metralladora automática con una gran tasa de disparo, una escopeta y una palanca. A comparación con el resto \n     de las clases, el Heavy es la clase más lenta del videojuego, pero el daño que hace es destructivo.\n\n6) El Engineer: \n     El Engineer es una de las clases más fundamentales en un equipo. El Engineer es un ingeniero que posee un \n     menu de construcción, en el que, puede elegir que construir, un Arma Centinela (También conocida como Torreta), \n     un Dispensador y un Teletransportador. Un Engineer le aporta mucho a su equipo al tener este tipo de \n     construcciones puestas y construídas tal como estan, pero estas construcciones pueden ser destruídas por los \n     enemigos. Al construir una construcción cualquiera, el Engineer gasta una cantidad especifíca de metal de \n     construcción.\n\n7) El Medic: \n     El Medic es la clase curativa de todos las clases disponibles. El Medic posee un dispositivo curativo para curar a sus \n     aliados de equipo, y para envenenar permanentemente a sus enemigos, a menos de que el enemigo muera de \n     cualquier forma, o simplemente, envenenado, aunque esto se puede evadir, siendo curado por otro Medic aliado. \n     A parte de poseer un dispositivo curativo, el Medic posee una pistola de jeringas, una escopeta y una palanca, \n     haciéndolo una clase con variedad de armas para prolongar su duración en el combate, y seguir curando a sus \n     aliados de equipo, conllevándolos a la victoria. Como habilidad pásiva, el Medic regenera +2 puntos de salud por \n     segundo si es que ha sido hérido por cualquier tipo de daño.\n\n8) Sniper: \n     El Sniper es parte de las clases más débiles del juego, pero con paciencia, esta clase puede llegar a aniquilar hasta a \n     un Heavy de un solo disparo a la cabeza. El Sniper posee un rifle de francotirador, una metralleta automática \n     (Es como un tipo de SMG), una escopeta y una palanca. El Sniper puede matar a cualquier clase con un disparo \n     cargado a la cabeza de un solo tiro (Headshot cargado), pero esto requerirá de un poco de paciencia, para así, \n     cazar a la víctima con éxito.\n\n9) Spy: \n     El Spy es parte de las clases más débiles del juego. Tal como dice su nombre, el Spy es un espía, que se dedica a \n     engañar a los enemigos, disfrazándose de ellos, al igual que fingir una muerte para que nadie sospeche de nada.\n     El Spy posee una pistola que dispara dardos que tranquilizan al enemigo, reduciéndo su velocidad de movimiento \n     y provocando alucinaciones por un corto plazo, un cuchillo para matar a un enemigo al instante, \n     un menu de disfraces para disfrazarse del enemigo que se desea ser, entre otras cosas más.\n\nTeam Fortress Classic es un videojuego excelente por si disfrutas de los videojuegos clásicos online, y con una \ncomunidad un poco activa, que suele crear mapas, armas, etc, para el videojuego, que no suelen consumir \ntanto espacio (Depende, pero la mayoría, no consume tanto espacio).\n\nMi calificación para este videojuego es de: 9.0 / 10","timestamp_created":1426209916,"timestamp_updated":1426210071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560000002384185791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14844360","author":{"steamid":"76561198069102301","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":8,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1426114441},"language":"english","review":"dont buy it doom is better","timestamp_created":1426114495,"timestamp_updated":1426114495,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.432448089122772217","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14815769","author":{"steamid":"76561198098789173","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":978,"last_played":1427605803},"language":"brazilian","review":"No começo achei o jogo irritante sabe, não matava ninguém, era um saco jogar.

No. This game is obviously a good little shooter that was once THE king of online gaming before the mod known as Counter-Strike came along and it was replaced by the admittedly better Team Fortress 2. But why did I not recommend it? Because fifteen years ago this game was FULL of players well into the 2000s. Now only a special few still play the game. It's a shame because its actually quite a nice little gem to have in your inventory and show off to your friends.\n\nPros:\n- A good selection of weapons that you wouldn't find in Team Fortress 2 (Pyro has a fire nuke!)\n- Pure nostalgia entering servers that are 10 years old and still have Scatman music playing in the background.\n- One shot snipers.\n- Much harder to play and understand. Very rewarding.\n\nCons:\n- Unfortunately those same weapons I mentioned before do barely any damage. (Pyros Flamethrower does 3dmg!)\n- Serious balance issues (Pyro is the worst class in the game)\n- GRENADES. THEY SHOULDN'T EXIST IN A GAME LIKE THIS.\n- Hardly anyone plays anymore.\n\nOverall you should spend that five bucks if you truly want to see what this game is about. Otherwise I would be recommending Team Fortress 2 or any of the other First Person Shooters.\n\nAlso to any Aussie players, there is one local server but it has a password on it.

It is the sequel to the popular Quake mod, Team Fortress, now remade with the Half-Life engine. And it is the prequel to our favorite Party Simulator, Team Fortress 2. Matches in Team Fortress Classic pit two teams against each other, with each team member having access to nine distinct classes. Competition takes place in a variety of scenarios, usually capture the flag, VIP protection, or territorial control. Since its release, the game has undergone significant upgrades to player models and game modes.\nI'll just say it right now guys, this game is GREAT. The classes, the graphics (Aged rather well, considering it was 99), the fast action and variety of weapons etc. I think it's actually near perfect.....Gameplay-wise.\nWhat really brings the game down to me is the fact that now it's almost empty. If you want proof, open up Counter Strike 1.6 and take a look at the servers. Then, open up TFC and take a look at the servers. Sad, sad indeed. And the only servers with actual people are full of people that are probably going to kick your ass big time, no mercy will be shown, so you have 3 choices: Get good, get good or GIT GUD, these guys can't even be considered simple veterans, these guys probably know the game better than the creators themselves. The game is really different from TF2 so don't think it's all going to be sunshine and rainbows, the gameplay is faster, no hats, no other weapons and the game doesn't get all the updates and attention TF2 receives every day. You know what this means? Almost no people in the servers and unbalanced gameplay at some points because of no patches (Grenades, Bhopping and MEDIC, GODDAMN IT MEDIC). However, if you want to play a solid FPS, that, in my personal opinion, would be way better than Counter Strike 1.6 (Yes, I f.u.c.king said that.) if it only had more people. PLAY THIS, it's an absolute must for any FPS fan and an overlooked, underrated gem nowadays.\n9/10","timestamp_created":1424168179,"timestamp_updated":1447584199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":17,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550431787967681885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14508261","author":{"steamid":"76561198116821133","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":409,"last_played":1658364202},"language":"english","review":"I need medical attention/10","timestamp_created":1424137779,"timestamp_updated":1424137779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54173356294631958","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14495227","author":{"steamid":"76561198095177418","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":90,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":90,"last_played":1418906505},"language":"english","review":"My eyes","timestamp_created":1424072020,"timestamp_updated":1424072020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495646476745605469","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14467053","author":{"steamid":"76561198163316342","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":312,"last_played":1639017439},"language":"english","review":"This game is the second in the long history of the fortress games.\n\nTeam Fortress Classic will go down in history as one of the fathers of class based shooters,\n\nQWTF and the games it spawned (tfc,tf2,ff, etc) have changed the way we look at team strategy in videogames.","timestamp_created":1423936475,"timestamp_updated":1423936475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14457638","author":{"steamid":"76561198041155549","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":45,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35,"last_played":1440488365},"language":"english","review":"it's like tf2 but without hats\n\n0/10 garbage","timestamp_created":1423888407,"timestamp_updated":1423888407,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.418531030416488647","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14457299","author":{"steamid":"76561198142163112","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":90,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56,"last_played":1449333252},"language":"english","review":"it's tf2 with 1999 old school graphics and quake physics","timestamp_created":1423886171,"timestamp_updated":1423886171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14442356","author":{"steamid":"76561198064153655","num_games_owned":336,"num_reviews":223,"playtime_forever":73,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":73,"last_played":1423751484},"language":"english","review":" Being able to choose among several characters which has their own specialty in FPS game was very tempting.

(You can check for players with the in-game server list, bots won't be shown.) TFC offers one-of-a-kind exciting fast paced gameplay with tons of tactics and ways of playing the game. Easy to get into and enjoy, hard to master. However, you're bound to have fun along the way.\n\nDespite old age, the game has a timeless design with a completely customizable appearance; you can choose from many custom models, sprites, skins, textures etc. There are active community servers hosting many of thousands of custom maps total with official game modes like; Capture The Flag, Control point, Attack/Defend, Escort, Deathmatch as well as custom ones like King of the Hill, Hold or Score Ball etc.\n\nIf you're interested in skill jumping (with weapons) there are servers hosting maps made for conc-, grenade-, rocket- and pipe jumping. There are also a lot of movement skill maps where you can climb, bunnyhop, strafe, surf, ramp slide and even water glide (shark) on a few servers. Or if you just want to play some random fun maps and mess around, there's escape, puzzle, hide & seek, sniping, role-play, secret hunting, low gravity and so on. As for mods, there's NeoTF (which gives you extra abilities and buildables), AdminOP (Ent Mod, Radio Mod, Hook Mod) and others.\n\nIt's not just one of, but [i]The[/i] most popular online multiplayer game of all back in 1999 before CS took the crown. Nowadays, there are barely any FPS games that don't get boring after a few hours. TFC will have you keep coming back for more, time and time again.
