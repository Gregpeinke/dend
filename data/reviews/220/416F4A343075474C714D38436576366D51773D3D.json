Даже сегодня, играя в данное творение от Valve, можно получить немалое удовольствие. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] ПЛЮСЫ [/th]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n+ Разнообразный геймплей. Стрельба периодически сменяется заездами на багги \\ катере. И всё это дополняется не очень сложными головоломками. Причём сам шутер, как основополагающий элемент, довольно бодрый (отчасти благодаря большому выбору арсенала). Ну и конечно весьма прикольная фишка (практически не имеющая аналогов) с возможностью \"управлять\" муравьиными львами\n\n+ Даже по нынешним меркам очень приличная графика, с не менее хорошим дизайном локаций\n\n+ Потрясающая атмосфера. На протяжении всей игры можно пронаблюдать становление подпольного сопротивления, перерастающего в полномасштабную войну (пусть и в пределах одного города) с захватчиками альянса. И конечно отдельных хвалебных слов (именно за атмосферу) заслуживает глава № 6 \"Мы не ходим в Рейвенхолм...\"\n\n+ Великолепное музыкальное сопровождение, достойная локализация, качественный звук в целом\n\n+ Неплохие второстепенные персонажи, оптимальный набор противников\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] МИНУСЫ [/th]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n- Довольно посредственный сюжет, которого по большому счёту и нет вовсе\n\n- Не слишком равномерное распределение геймплея по главам. В начальной стадии игры много серых, однообразных  тоннелей. Через чур затянутая поездка на воздушном катере. Скучные заключительные две главы в цитадели.\n\n- Слабый внутренний дизайн цитадели. Явно переборщили с минимализмом. Что странно, ведь кабинет доктора Брина проработан довольно неплохо\n\n[b] PS. [/b] Лично для меня Half-Life 2 не является супер-эталоном жанра, однако пройти мимо этого проекта, не отметив его высокого качества, конечно же, нельзя. Всем любителям шутеров обязательно к прохождению! \n\n[i] Моя оценка: 8.3 из 10 [/i]\n\n[h1] Итак, это вы, доктор Фримен.

This game was the blueprint for every FPS game released since 2004. The utilization of the Source engine allows for many new feature such as the physics puzzles. Maybe one day of Half-Life 3 will be released. Maybe not. However this game is amazing and definitely worth a buy. Especially since it is only $10 and even cheaper when it goes on a sale. It is a must have for every PC gamer.","timestamp_created":1440215934,"timestamp_updated":1523322147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17654206","author":{"steamid":"76561198170046059","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":940,"last_played":1516146208},"language":"english","review":"Good Game it Was Worth it payig 5 bucks for the orange box in Steam summer sale","timestamp_created":1440210790,"timestamp_updated":1440210790,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484848499298095703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17653703","author":{"steamid":"76561197996672909","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4874,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1121,"last_played":1626475306},"language":"english","review":"I first played this game on Xbox many years ago.
