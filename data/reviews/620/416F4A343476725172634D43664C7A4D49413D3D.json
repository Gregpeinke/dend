This game has one problem, I have no idea what to play now, it completely demolished my brain into a state of mind in which no game will ever seem great compared to this.\n\nThe previous game, had two problems. 1, it's too short. 2, it has very little story behind it. Portal 2 fixes both those problems. There are three large parts to this game, 9 'chapters' as it calls it, each three chapters is longer then the first game, I took 13 hours to beat it, and, I might be a moron, but it's also awesomely long. Now the story to this masterpiece. I won't spoil it, but it explains everything. GLaDOS, How she took over the facility, why she called it hers, and why the blue robot thing is hiding under your bed.

Lastly, thanks to the Steam Workshop there are an infinite amount of community made chambers waiting for you.","timestamp_created":1388859217,"timestamp_updated":1388859217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.59358513355255127","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8556017","author":{"steamid":"76561197998956228","num_games_owned":293,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":950,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":837,"last_played":1496256885},"language":"german","review":"wow mega ;)","timestamp_created":1388852821,"timestamp_updated":1388852821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8555942","author":{"steamid":"76561198088726073","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":900,"last_played":1442020184},"language":"danish","review":".","timestamp_created":1388852545,"timestamp_updated":1388852545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8555497","author":{"steamid":"76561198120117883","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":140,"last_played":1593928798},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo epico com uma historia epica, jogabilidade epica... um dos melhores jogos que ja joguei, no momento o melhor jogo da minha estante","timestamp_created":1388851140,"timestamp_updated":1388851140,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8555357","author":{"steamid":"76561198075830302","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1202,"last_played":1387452804},"language":"russian","review":"отличная головоломка и сюжет!","timestamp_created":1388850648,"timestamp_updated":1479976182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8554587","author":{"steamid":"76561197991692963","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1981,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1491,"last_played":1561854767},"language":"english","review":"This is almost better than Half-Life 2.
