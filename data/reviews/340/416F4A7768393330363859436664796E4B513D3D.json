Изначально, Lost Coast являлся частью главы Шоссе-17 в Half-Life 2, однако был вырезан и не вошел в релизную версию игры, из-за некоторых технических ограничений и ограничений по срокам разработки. После выхода второй части, Valve решили использовать данный уровень, для демонстрации новых технологий(преимущественно HDR), в Source. Также эти технологии и эффекты активно использовались в последующих играх этих разработчиков.\n\nСюжетно данная игра должна была повествовать о Гордоне Фримене, который находясь на затеряном побережье, должен ликвидировать расположенную на территории церкви установку, запускающую капсулы с хедкрабами на соседний посёлок. Ко всему прочему, планировалось сделать несколько логический заданий, основанных на взаимодействии с единственным дружественным персонажем на уровне(Рыбаке). Однако в последствии было принято решение отказатся от этой идеи.\n\nПомимо улучшенного качества текстур и моделей в демо уровне была представлена система динамического освещения. Данная система заключалась во многих незначительных аспектах, которые тем не менее сильно улучшали графическую составляющую игры. В игре применялись такие эффекты как: отражение мира в воде, отражение мира на мокрых скалах или на мокром берегу, лучи света падающие на модель и правдоподобное отражение её тени. Также был введён эффект при котором, выходя из темного участка, на ярко осветвлённую местность происходит ослепление, с постепенным уменьшением яркости, наподобие тому, как и происходит в реальной жизни, когда глаза постепенно привыкают к яркому свету. В одном месте даже была применена технология, при которой искажалось изображение через стекло окна. Можно снова увидеть так понравившеюся разработчикам ещё со времён первой части \"арену обрывов\", где необходимо пробиратся по узким уступам, на горной местности, встречая противников то сверху, то с боку, то сзади. Что кстати заставляет применять соответствующую стратегию для тактически правильного ведения боя. Прислушиватся ко всем звукам, смотреть не только по сторонам, но и вверх.\n\nLost Coast является первым проектом Valve, где разработчики впервые начали использовать систему комментариев. Данная, интересно-реализованная система является эдаким звеном между игроками и разработчиками, которые путём диалогов поясняют или рассказывают об создании и реализации тех или инных ключевых моментах игры. Включив данную опцию, можно узнать немало интересного о создании этой карты, несостоявшихся планах и других интересных вещах.\n\nИз вышепрочитанного можно сделать вывод о том, что игра преимущественно сосредоточена на графической демонстрации, однако свои 5 мин экшена в перестрелках с солдатами Альянса вы там тоже найдёте :D\n\nУчтите, что игра не продаётся отдельно, а входит в состав паков [url=http://store.steampowered.com/sub/715/] Half-Life Complete [/url] и [url=http://store.steampowered.com/sub/29197/] Valve Complete Pack [/url].
