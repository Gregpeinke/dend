They were atmospheric and full of suspense as you explored that ruined world.\n\nInfinite , I didn't like.. It was a bright functioning society and to be honest I felt like an asshole going around shooting people, didn't gel with or care about Booker one bit.\n\nControls were spongy (try running while strafing) , story didn't grip me and I just didn't feel like I wanted to succeed.\n\nThe SJW BS didn't help either, white conservative people = bad.\n\nI lasted about 6 hours before uninstalling.. No real enjoyment, just felt like grinding. such a dissapointment from the first 2 games, avoid unless you're some fat purple haried weirdo who wants to see a functioning society be destroyed.\n 2/10... trash game which killed the

The setting of Columbia is an exciting and breathtaking one.  The story, characters and game play all work.  I found myself not able to put this one down when.  What was great was this game transformed the bioshock franchise from what it was to an anthology series with each new installment going forward (presumably) telling a new story unhindered by the continuity of the \"rapture\" games.  While I normally dont like \"escort missions\" in games but I fell hard for Elizabeth <3 The games plot was an emotional rollercoaster that really knew how to tug at the heart strings (hence i cant say much about it without ruining/spoiling it lol) while i loved this game i did have some gripes.  The lack of a final boss really hurt the game as it made the game feel incomplete despite a well crafted ending.  My biggest single complaint though was Burial at Sea Episode 2.  Everything about this dlc pack was wrong.  from needless tie ins to rapture, retconns of the games main story, to retreading old ground. not to mentioned the name \"episode 2\" implies there was supposed to be more dlc that never came to fruition so this was a failed attempt episodic gaming avoid the dlc like the plague.  if you have to play burial at sea episode 1 (it doesnt add anything  but doesnt detract either, and i think theres some multiplayer maps and guns worth while at least) DO NOT PLAY episode 2 it ruins the end of the main game that was so great","timestamp_created":1593638328,"timestamp_updated":1593638328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71832060","author":{"steamid":"76561197991647809","num_games_owned":591,"num_reviews":96,"playtime_forever":948,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":948,"last_played":1593630956},"language":"english","review":"An epic game.
