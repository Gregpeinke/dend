The sequel to one of the greatest single player first-person shooters ever made. Unlike with that game, I wouldn't say that this game hasn't aged well, but rather other games have done what this game did better since this game came out. Although this is an FPS, you aren't just killing things then entire time. Sometimes you have to drive a vehicle and sometimes you have to solve a puzzle. One of the most prominent features of this game is the Gravity Gun. You can use it as a means of simply moving something somewhere else, or use it as a weapon by launching it at your enemies. This game graphically set the standard for what a 7th generation game should look like, and I still think this game is worth playing for the unique experience it offers. Highly recommended for fans of first person shooters.","timestamp_created":1456622172,"timestamp_updated":1456872330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21512243","author":{"steamid":"76561198201056521","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":136,"last_played":1528750220},"language":"italian","review":"ho gicato il primo half-life decenni fa.Me ne sono innamorato.Quando è uscito Half Life 2 nel 2004 lo presi subito.Purtroppo l'Hardware del mio vecchio pc non mi permise di godermelo bene allora.Oggi grazie a Steam , sul nuovo Pc portatile potrò godermi le Avventure di Gordon Freeman con la grafica al massimo.Ottimo gioco che ha rivoluzionato il genere degli FPS","timestamp_created":1456619520,"timestamp_updated":1456619520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21511379","author":{"steamid":"76561197960312678","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":89,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":89,"last_played":1455461984},"language":"english","review":"No need comment","timestamp_created":1456616610,"timestamp_updated":1456616610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21510571","author":{"steamid":"76561198257390989","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":823,"last_played":1522275081},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um jogo muito bom, com ótimo enredo, além de gráficos bons para sua época, e uma jogabilidade boa.","timestamp_created":1456613767,"timestamp_updated":1456613767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21510120","author":{"steamid":"76561198120271072","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":4500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1286,"last_played":1652089456},"language":"english","review":"I don't really know where to start...So much happens in this game...So many good things about this game.

I found the first game to be charming and wonderful. Half life 2 ups it up, now including combine, new cities- all things that werent in the first game, its no longer a game of survival, its to save the human race. Not much progression, basically go to point A to point B while doing various tasks in between to get there, but its what you do that makes the game fun, and how you do it. For example in ravenholm, you can go through normally, or you can entirely rely on the gravity gun (Also gets you an achievement) to manipulate the enviroment to your needs. It has the standard weapons, pistol, shotguns, automated weapons, grenades, etc,  but most of them are set apart in a way where no weapon feels the same- the pistol feels weak but does well in a pinch, the revolver is slow and overpowered (not taking ammo into account) the overwatch has a lower clip, reserve, and slower than the SMG, but its more powerful, as well as different alternates. The shotgun, well, is burst damage, like the revolver. The intelligence in design is great as well. Theres not much that is very well hidden, just a few lambda caches. This makes it so it gives rewards to those that explore. The combat is also great, not too much ammo, not too much health, and not too much enemies. You will be fine on normal mode as long as you stay keen on your ammo and health. I really enjoy this game and recommend all of those that heard about it to play it. Of course, this is just my opinion, but I still recommend to play it.","timestamp_created":1456593802,"timestamp_updated":1464215329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21501211","author":{"steamid":"76561198068598423","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":563,"last_played":1456587326},"language":"english","review":"Such an impressive game in every aspect imaginable, a must play!","timestamp_created":1456587361,"timestamp_updated":1456587361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505494534969329834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21499747","author":{"steamid":"76561198142527347","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":5340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1847,"last_played":1641982653},"language":"french","review":"Très bon jeu, bonne immersion","timestamp_created":1456582984,"timestamp_updated":1456582984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21499500","author":{"steamid":"76561198136484478","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":102,"last_played":1518539171},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 2... so full life?","timestamp_created":1456582393,"timestamp_updated":1456582393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21499368","author":{"steamid":"76561198037965617","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":229,"last_played":1509851974},"language":"spanish","review":"Hermoso juego que nunca olvidare <3","timestamp_created":1456582005,"timestamp_updated":1456582005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21495316","author":{"steamid":"76561198103638402","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":172,"playtime_forever":580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":578,"last_played":1550447205},"language":"english","review":"For a game from early 2000s this is one of the cleanest and funniest game in a long time.","timestamp_created":1456568591,"timestamp_updated":1456568591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21494853","author":{"steamid":"76561197998819735","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2569,"last_played":1627939060},"language":"russian","review":"Не самая лучшая игра во многих аспектах, бетка была гораздо лучше.
