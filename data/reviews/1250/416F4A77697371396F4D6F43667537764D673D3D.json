Each zed is unique and will try to eat you in some fashion. Where the basic clot is no threat alone, being cornered by a fleshpound can definitly ruin your day.

It's primary charm is the insane clusterfuck that is usually the staple of ANY game that involves close-ranged combat, and other players are not your friends; they're on the same side, but damned if you didn't have to fight them as well. The following are a list of well-known player archetypes for this game: Demolition specialists that can't aim for shit and will (repeatedly) fire grenades into the back of your head instead of the scrake in front of you, commandos who think they're all that and attempt to fight and aggravate big creatures that is the purview of the sharpshooter instead, sharpshooters who dual wield because they want to do close combat, supports gunning down everything like rambo with their shotguns, medics who solo the entire game because of their body armor, and berserkers being (usually) the most competant player of the bunch. What does this mean? This means that your survival is dependent on people who may or may not knowingly screw you over because the mechanics are not outright defined for new players.\n\nFor those who do not know the following, take note: When a berserker is stunlocking a creature with melee, shooting it will cause the creature to break out of stun and maul both you and the berserker who was tanking it. Please do not shoot the creature if you see a berserker stunlocking it.\nAdditionally, if you are a commando and you have been forced into a situation where you had to shoot and taunt the fleshpound to prevent your idiot teammates from dying, congratulations. You've become a Killing Floor veteran.\n\nIf you want to play alone, this game is really boring and you should probably get some friends. If you play with other people, this game can be rage-inducing, very fun, or both. You have been warned.\n\nAlso, when are they going to release KF2 and add the PPSh in?

Rating 7.5/10 very good game.","timestamp_created":1418488651,"timestamp_updated":1419324427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13347226","author":{"steamid":"76561197972420581","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":72,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":72,"last_played":1401343008},"language":"english","review":"Nao gaste seu dinheiro nisso, nem q esteja em promoção","timestamp_created":1418488135,"timestamp_updated":1418488135,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457274824380874634","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13346898","author":{"steamid":"76561198142180583","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":773,"last_played":1498527944},"language":"brazilian","review":"Eu Axo Esse Game Bem Foda Mais Se Tivesse Mais Atualizaçoes Ia Cer Bem Legal","timestamp_created":1418486949,"timestamp_updated":1418486949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13346868","author":{"steamid":"76561198082507104","num_games_owned":346,"num_reviews":91,"playtime_forever":1588,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1384,"last_played":1420203842},"language":"russian","review":"GOOD ИГРА ))) ИГРАЙТЕ УБИВАЙТЕ ЖЕНИТЕСЬ))\n","timestamp_created":1418486788,"timestamp_updated":1418486788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13346585","author":{"steamid":"76561198031914180","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":999,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":789,"last_played":1451277101},"language":"brazilian","review":"mais ou menos so comprei por causa da promoção","timestamp_created":1418485734,"timestamp_updated":1418485734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13346342","author":{"steamid":"76561198058207891","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1183,"last_played":1564001063},"language":"danish","review":"The Floor possess no threat, and cannot be killed.","timestamp_created":1418484802,"timestamp_updated":1418485536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544498205184936523","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13346155","author":{"steamid":"76561198055954762","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2985,"last_played":1462148539},"language":"spanish","review":"Hiper megaaaa juegaso!","timestamp_created":1418484052,"timestamp_updated":1418484052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13345827","author":{"steamid":"76561198053870965","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":186,"last_played":1629477448},"language":"english","review":"blat blat. for 2 hrs","timestamp_created":1418482610,"timestamp_updated":1418482610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13345753","author":{"steamid":"76561198127577151","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4955,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4686,"last_played":1418756245},"language":"english","review":"игра охренительная всем кто не пробовал советую","timestamp_created":1418482288,"timestamp_updated":1418482288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13345543","author":{"steamid":"76561198161602487","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":26742,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9979,"last_played":1547903597},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра!

Sin embargo, esto no significa que sea un mal juego, y más adelante explicaré mi comentario anterior. \n\n[h1]¿Qué es Killing Floor?[/h1]\nSe trata de un juego fps cooperativo, donde un equipo de jugadores debe enfrentarse a enemigos tipo zombies/monstruos en distintos modos de juego, existiendo así modos de oleadas dentro de un mapa, como también cumplimiento de objetivos dentro de un mapa lineal. \n\n[h1]¿Qué me gustó?[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]La rapidez con la que se juega. Me recuerda a lo rápido que era entrar a CS 1.6, seleccionar un servidor y jugar.\n[*]Bajos requerimientos. El juego no tiene una gráfica de última generación, ya tiene sus años, por lo tanto podrá ser accesible para la mayoría de los que deseen tener un juego multijugador-cooperativo online.\n[*]Dificultad. En ciertos mapas, en dificultad \"Normal\", las cosas se pueden complicar muchísimo. \n[*]Integración a Steam. Existen cromos, y un montón de logros.\n[*]Sistema de juego. Las armas y movimientos son buenos, tiene lógica que andar con cuchillo en mano te hará andar más rápido, clásico. También me pareció \"original\" la capacidad de tirar dinero para que otro lo recoja. Así como subir de niveles e ir mejorando en cierta rama que preferimos (Francotirador, Comando, etc).\n[*]La música. Es rock, con eso ya no hay más argumentos.\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]¿Qué cosas no me gustaron?[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]Las interfaces, principalmente porque son muy básicas. Y cuando son básicas pero funcionables, está bien, pero en KF lamentablemente no siempre es así. Por ejemplo, cuando deseas buscar un servidor, seleccionas que se ordene por ping, y jamás ordena correctamente. Tampoco hay un buen filtro, a pesar de que el filtro de búsqueda de servidores tiene muchas opciones, ninguna es sobre regiones que no quiero ver, ni tampoco sobre servidores en lista negra.\n[*]Apropósito de servidores en lista negra. Ya me pasó una vez que entré a X servidor, y luego todos mis niveles volvieron a 0, sin la posibilidad de subirlos otra vez. Tripwire jamás dio solución a esto.\n[/olist]\n\nEn general, Killing Floor es un juego que te hará pasar buenos momentos.
