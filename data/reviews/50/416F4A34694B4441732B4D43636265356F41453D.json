This is definitely the better and longer expansion of the two, as Opposing Force adds many new weapons, enemies, and concludes with a new boss fight. The gunplay and \"puzzles\" hold up to the original game, and Opposing Force also features a squad-like system, where you can lead other HECU Marines through Black Mesa. The ally AI is pretty braindead, but at least you're not alone the entire time. The roughly 4 hour campaign is worth playing through at least once, and this game also features multiplayer deathmatch servers, if that's what you're into.","timestamp_created":1528863491,"timestamp_updated":1528863491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42688271","author":{"steamid":"76561198839364505","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":2662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":785,"last_played":1610945323},"language":"english","review":"This expansion pack is fantastic as it contains everything which makes the original game so great such as the terrific level design and the brilliant puzzles, the constant suspense in the way of coming face-to-face with a creature by walking around a corner or a creature spawning next to you or behind you, the linearity which still leaves you with lots of freedom, the great AI of the Black Ops, and the little touches of seeing civilians occasionally die around you as you progress through the levels. Since I already elaborated on these points in my review of Half-Life, however, I don't want to repeat myself, so I'll like to elaborate on a couple other things I liked about this game. When I fought against the marines in the original game, it seemed like they were the villains, but the elaboration of the Black Ops in this game (they were introduced in the main game, but we didn't know much of anything about who they were as we didn't have access to the Marines' equipment) made it seem like they were the true villains. It was an interesting shift which made me question my reaction to the main game. I also liked the extra insight on the G-Man. While most of the details on his character are ambiguous (as they were in the main game), we learn a couple other details about his character (more specifically, actions he takes at the end of the game) which further hint at the bigger picture suggested in the first game. I did notice a couple bugs in this game though. For instance, it was sometimes difficult to get the Marines to follow you as they'd often get stuck. Also, my mouse occasionally flashed on the right hand side of the screen. Other than these minor bugs, however, I'd say this game is worth buying.","timestamp_created":1528851409,"timestamp_updated":1532026709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42687899","author":{"steamid":"76561198114563111","num_games_owned":432,"num_reviews":206,"playtime_forever":610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":501,"last_played":1622140188},"language":"english","review":"An expansion to the awesomely awesome game that is Half Life. \n\nThis time the story of Half Life is told from the perspective of a HECU marine. \n\nIf you enjoyed Half Life, you'll enjoy this.

It follows the misadventures of Adrian Shephard, a military goon turned Gordon Freeman-esque action hero after getting sent in to neutralize the events of the original Half-Life.\n\nA solid campaign and thrilling techno score will probably be the most engaging parts of this product, although the original game still had both. The new editions to the mix aren't considerably interesting, and a few of the added monsters are more frustrating than enjoyable. I thought the final boss was pretty interesting looking but critically easy to fight and not particularly interesting gameplay-wise. The new perspective, that is, a soldier, doesn't really contribute much with anything. I was hoping to see some ally soldiers who would fight alongside me, and although I did find a few, they were largely pointless, dying as easily as the security guards from Half-Life 1. Ultimately, this product just feels pointless, even if it does provide more of the quintessential Half-Life experience.\n\nPlot-wise, this game is fairly barren as well. If you can't get enough of the G-Man, perhaps just look up his final speech on youtube, because although it is a creepy and enjoyable speech, it isn't enough. The only context in which I'd recommend this game is if you can't get enough of the original Half-Life flavor in your noggin. Fortunately for Gearbox, a lot of people can't, and neither could I.\n\nAs it is, it's a tough-as-nails corridor shooter with aggressive ai and a pretty well utilized score. More than enough to recommend it, but not exactly with flying colors. I wish I could say it was imperitive to the Half-Life sandwich, but this dressing is more of a side.","timestamp_created":1526978858,"timestamp_updated":1526978858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540000021457672119","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42124358","author":{"steamid":"76561198277085801","num_games_owned":313,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":1101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":432,"last_played":1575909432},"language":"german","review":"Die \"Half-Life\"-Spielreihe war vor einiger Zeit DAS Aushängeschild von Valve. Um \"Half-Life: Opposing Force\" handelt es sich um die erste von zwei (Standalone-)Erweiterungen von dem Spiel \"Half-Life\" aus dem Jahr 1998. Unter einer \"Standalone-Erweiterung\" ist dabei ein eigenständiges Spiel gemeint, welches jedoch komplett auf dem Hauptspiel basiert. Um damit die Handlung und Thematik von \"Half-Life: Opposing Force\" nachvollziehen zu können, wird daher empfohlen \"Half-Life\" davor gespielt zu haben.\n\nDie Erweiterung kam Oktober 1999 heraus, also knapp ein Jahr nach dem Hauptspiel. \"Half-Life\" an sich, als auch die Erweiterung \"Half-Life: Oppsoing Force\" kann man vor allem in das Genre des Ego-Shooters einsortieren, allerdings besitzt das Spiel auch eine Vielzahl an Rätsel-/Puzzle-, Parcours-/Jump 'n Run-, als auch Adventure-Elementen. Da neben dem Erledigen von Gegnern, auch Hindernisse unter komplexe Situationen bewältigt, wie auch verschiedenste Rätsel gelöst werden müssen, um beispielsweise Türen zu öffnen oder Sprengfallen zu deaktivieren. Die Handlung, wie auch der Stiel von \"Half-Life\" ist sehr Science-Fiction basiert.\n\nDer Protagonist dieser Erweiterung ist ein U.S Marine. Die Storylines des Hauptspiels und der zwei Erweiterungen spielen zur selben Zeit und am selben Ort, quasi parallel. Der Spieler schlüpft in die Rolle des Corporal Adrian Shepard, der auf eine für ihn unbekannte Mission in die geheime Forschungseinrichtung \"Black Mesa\" geschickt wird. Auf dem Flug zu der weit abgelegten Forschungseinrichtung stürzt der Hubschrauber mitsamt der ganzen Besatzung ab. Corporal Shepard ist dabei der einzige Überlebende. Adrian Shephard wird nun ähnlich wie Dr. Gordon Freeman aus dem Hauptspiel \"Half-Life\" von den außerirdischen Lebewesen angegriffen und von dem \"Black-Ops-Spezialkommando\" konfrontiert, die den Befehl erhalten haben, die gesamte Forschungseinrichtung Black Mesa ausnahmslos samt allen Personen und Kreaturen auszulöschen. Auch hier taucht der mysteriöse \"G-Man\" ständig auf und beobachtet den Protagonisten.\n\nMeine Persönliche Bewertung nach meinen Kriterien*:\n\nStory 69,5 / 115\nGameplay 13 / 40\nGrafik und Gestaltung 9 / 25\nSound 6,5 / 30\nAtmosphäre 12 / 20\nSonstige Besonderheiten 9,75 / 20\n\n*Bewertungen unterliegen hierbei zusätzlich (1) dem Vergleich zu neueren Spielteilen und (2) aus der Sicht der heutigen Zeit!\n\n\nDa die Erweiterung von der Handlung, als auch spielerisch, sehr ähnlich zu \"Half-Life\" ist, werde ich nur auf explizite Neuerungen in der Standalone-Erweiterung eingehen.\nWie man meiner Bewertung entnehmen kann, ist die Punktzahl besonders bei den Punkten: Gameplay, Grafik wie auch Sound recht negativ. Der Grund dafür ist einfach, dass ich das Spiel nur aus heutiger Sicht bewerten kann. Nicht falsch verstehen. \"Half-Life\" wurde 1998 veröffentlicht. Es ist einfach älter als ICH. Dafür, dass das Spiel noch so eine gewaltige Playerbase, wie auch Fans besitzt, hat es meinen Respekt verdient. Für damalige Zeit war \"Half-Life\" bestimmt sehr revolutionär und was besonderes.\n\nDie Handlung und Umsetzung von \"Half-Life: Opposing Force\" wurde aus meiner Sicht sehr stark umgesetzt. Es wurde sehr viel mit dem Aspekt der Kreuzung zwischen den Games gespielt. So kreuzen sich viele Handlungsstrenge miteinander, sodass man Kern-Situationen aus \"Half-Life\" aus einer anderen Perspektive sieht. Durch die Erweiterungen hat der Spieler dadurch die Möglichkeit mehr Informationen über das missglückte Experiment, als auch über Black Mesa zu erfahren. Da \"Half-Life\" im Endgame nicht besonders auf das Schicksal der Forschungseinrichtung eingeht, erfährt man nun durch diese Erweiterung, was abschließend mit Black Mesa geschieht und ein wenig über den G-Man.\n\nTechnisch wurde im Gameplay auch einige kleine Neuerungen hinzugefügt. Neben einigen neuen Waffen wie der \"Marine-Pistole\", die ein Laservisier besitzt, gibt es zwei neue Spielmechanik. Der Protagonist ist nun in der Lage an Seilen hochzuklettern um Hindernisse zu überwinden. Ebenso trifft Corporal Shepard während des Spiels des öfteren Soldatenkollegen, mit dem er sequenziell zusammenarbeiten muss um entweder große Angriffswellen zu überstehen oder verschlossene Türen von einem \"Pionier\" aufschweißen zu lassen um voran zu kommen.\n\nAbschließend kann ich einfach nur erneut sagen, dass obwohl das Spiel nun mehr als 20 Jahre alt ist, dennoch empfehlenswert ist. Erwartet jedoch nicht extrem viel, da es logischerweise mit heutigen Spiele eher weniger mithalten kann, was es jedoch auch nicht muss. Genießt einfach die Handlung des Spiels!","timestamp_created":1526750292,"timestamp_updated":1619794647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42109970","author":{"steamid":"76561198356149742","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":226,"last_played":1649811159},"language":"english","review":"Nice game but I wanted to see Shepard put his pet fish on his dick like a nice sock.","timestamp_created":1526694543,"timestamp_updated":1526694543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42106115","author":{"steamid":"76561198061229039","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":495,"last_played":1526673732},"language":"english","review":"Just finished this one more time, 20 years after release.
