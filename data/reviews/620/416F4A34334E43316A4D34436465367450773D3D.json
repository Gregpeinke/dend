I'm not going to spoil anything here i'll just sum things up.\n\nThe game is longer and at times that can be a bad thing because some of the challenges start to ware a little thin, and you spend varous parts of the game looking off into the distance for a protal compatable surface.  Its bigger but a little unwieldy but its still tons of fun and manges to add some new physics to the mix.\n\nThe gameplay its self is pretty much the same.  there are some new physic elements that add to the mix and these are handled very well though when you add them to portal use things can get kind of overwhelming, fortuantly they gradually easy you in to how they work just like they did with portals, unfortuantly that means your going to have to go through gradual tutorial style puzzles mulitpule times in the game.  Not a deal breaker but it does make the game drag a little between the funny bits.\n\nThe humor is still dead on.  the writting is great.  and i can not stress enough how awsome cave johnson is.\n\nthats really all i can say about it other than it has a co-op campagin now thats actually alot of fun too.  Well designed, not too hard and more funny bits.\n\nSo yeah if you liked the first one...you've already bought this one.

Play it.  Play it now.  Easily one of my top three favorite games of all time, Portal is amazing in every way.  From creative dialog to the now-famous mechanics, there’s not much I can say about this game in a broad sense that has not already been said.  Both the single player and co-op modes are fully realized and are a ton of fun to play through, time and time again.  It’s one of those games you can play thirty times and still find humor or something new in it.\n\nNow the thing I can really say stuff about - the achievements.  I’m a hardcore completionist, and my work on Portal was some of the most fun I have had, grinding at the same level over and over again.  To get all 51 achievements, you not only need to complete both the single player and co-op campaigns, but you also must discover more obscure things hidden within levels.  The non-story based ones range in difficulty from fairly simple (if you know what you’re doing) to brutally complicated (Still Alive and Smash TV - I’m looking at you here).  It took me 30 hours to complete all the achievements.  With this in mind, it’s clear to see that it’s a doable task, yet not the thing for everyone. (but let’s say that the joy I got upon getting that last achievement was pretty great.)\n\nSeriously go play this game now, your life will never be the same.\n\nOverall rating: 10/10","timestamp_created":1434992829,"timestamp_updated":1434992829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16625029","author":{"steamid":"76561198043259752","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1992,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":619,"last_played":1564612898},"language":"spanish","review":"Sin duda, el mejor juego del mundo.","timestamp_created":1434992543,"timestamp_updated":1434992543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16624587","author":{"steamid":"76561198157337069","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1508526649},"language":"polish","review":"Może Być gram Często jak mi sie nudzi","timestamp_created":1434991504,"timestamp_updated":1434991504,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474452555179595947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16624574","author":{"steamid":"76561198094263847","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":2439,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1030,"last_played":1587379516},"language":"english","review":"***This review is for the story mode of Portal 2 only***\n\nThis is overall a worthy successor to Portal. In terms of gameplay, at least. The puzzles are infinitely more fun and varied, and there is so much richness that comes with the section of the game devoted to backstory. \n\nSadly, it all comes at the expense of altering the tone of the whole game. Your original antagonist, GLADoS, is back--but is nothing like the cold, humourless, emotionless AI who ran the facility in the first game. There are some possible fridge logic reasons for this, but nothing is stated in-game about her personality change. It's a jarring note and it almost destroys the first game's experience as a result. Almost.\n\nThe othe rmain character, a robot which helps you escape the crumbling facility and get to safety is called Wheately. Wheatley is funny in a bumbling way, completely at odds with the tone of what Portal was. In a roundabout way, his manner can be related to the plot, but it doesn't fit with what you are expecting. You find yourself impatiently waiting for him to finish his jabber, instead of enjoying him as part of the experience of the game. In another game, he would have been a star.\n\nBut Cave Johnson... ah, Cave Johnson. You rich, crazy, authoritarian, smooth-voiced genius, you. Did I mention the crazy? Although you never meet him, his voice dominates the midlle part of the game and is a much-needed return to the casual disregard for human life and the black humour that made the first game what it was.\n\n\"If you don't have tumours, don't worry. If you sat on a folding chair in the lobby and weren't wearing lead underpants, we took care of that too.\"\n\nIf you didn't play Portal, you will love this game unreservedly. If you did play Portal, you will enjoy it. \n\nIf you want to play both games, my recommendation is still that you play Portal first. I did and I think if I had done it the other way around, I would have been disappointed in the first game. Whereas I played them chronologically and it allows for greater appreciation of the first game, if at the expense of the second. And the first game is important, even though this review is about Portal 2. It's the blueprint that 2 is based on. It's the skeleton, where Portal 2 is the flesh.

After you escape the building, you are somehow found by the labrotories and, of course, GLaDOS. You are put into a deep sleep, and like, three years later or something like that, you wake up in a dark dusty, dirty room, not like the one you went to sleep in. Then another character comes into the story. A core named Wheatley comes knocking on your door. You want to know who it is, so obviously, you open it. He comes in, talks for a bit, and then the room starts moving, smashing into walls, until you jump out. Then you are put into a whole lot of test chambers. I could beat most of them, some of them it took me a bit to figure them out. What I really didn't like was how Wheatley, my favorite character, turns into the bad guy. I've beaten the game, and my favorite chapter is 'The Part Where He Kills You', so sometimes, if I don't want to play from the beginning, I will play that chapter. So, my favorite part of that chapter is when I'm in his lair. I know what to do, how to do it, but I think it's cool when I shoot a portal to the moon, and everything gets sucked in. It really stands out to me when GLaDOS deletes Caroline, and her voice changes, I don't like how she gets rid of me. I like the ride up, the singing turrets and all that, I don't like how I'm in a feild with no city around me, or no building around me. If she was going to get rid of me, why not leave me close to a city? I really think they should make a free Portal three game of me getting back into the building, hanging out with GLados, Wheatley coming back and apologizing and bemcoming friends with us again, and let me be able to go out to the city, live in a house, and be able to visit GLaDOS and Wheatley. I really want to see what happens after that. I don't like how GLaDOS got rid of me, and how there's no city near me, and how I don't know what happens after that. I really want Valve to make another Portal.\n\nWhat do you think?","timestamp_created":1434987144,"timestamp_updated":1434987144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16622590","author":{"steamid":"76561198177508610","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":488,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":117,"last_played":1598444625},"language":"czech","review":"naprosto bižská logická hra :)3","timestamp_created":1434986752,"timestamp_updated":1434986752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16622270","author":{"steamid":"76561198178558006","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":501,"last_played":1438551334},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom","timestamp_created":1434986012,"timestamp_updated":1434986012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16621588","author":{"steamid":"76561198154795905","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":494,"last_played":1578601103},"language":"english","review":"be ready for some racism and some bullying :*","timestamp_created":1434984307,"timestamp_updated":1434984307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16621363","author":{"steamid":"76561198152039731","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1390,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":959,"last_played":1533834313},"language":"french","review":"A lot of fun","timestamp_created":1434983575,"timestamp_updated":1434983575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16621328","author":{"steamid":"76561198025490199","num_games_owned":726,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1782,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":835,"last_played":1639794265},"language":"spanish","review":"Yo no tengo las palabras adecuadas para describir u opinar sobre este juego, solo me queda decir... obra maestra.\n\n10/10\n\nLo rePito, lo repetí y lo repetiré xd","timestamp_created":1434983484,"timestamp_updated":1479925848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16620659","author":{"steamid":"76561198086090119","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":5482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5482,"last_played":1429520029},"language":"english","review":"BEST GAME EVR 10/10","timestamp_created":1434981512,"timestamp_updated":1434981512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16620618","author":{"steamid":"76561198064821509","num_games_owned":512,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1812,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":322,"last_played":1548163443},"language":"turkish","review":"Platform Oyunlarını Çok Severim Ve Puzzle Ve Platform Türünün En İyi Oyunlarından Biridir Tavsiyem Oruçluyken Oynamayın Çünkü Başınız Çok Kötü Ağrır :D 7,75 liraya değer Coop Bölümüde Çok İyi Arkadaşlarınızda Güzel Vakit Geçirmek İçin Oynancak Oyun","timestamp_created":1434981371,"timestamp_updated":1434981371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16620493","author":{"steamid":"76561198176743473","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":67884,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8201,"last_played":1655157023},"language":"english","review":"I almost back out of the purchase but I'm glad I didn't.

I recommend you buy when it goes on sale (it's not exactly worth the normal price). One flaw that it has is that the single player mode is quite short (I only got about 12 hours out of it). Luckily there is a fun multiplayer mode for you to enjoy so that kind of makes up for it. In conclusion, if you like puzzle games and you want a fun adventure in both single player and multiplayer pick up this game on sale (I got mine for 3.99, I regret nothing).\n\nI would rate Portal 2 8.9/10. The graphics, controls, plot, and audio are fantastic. But the time it takes you to beat the single player mode is so short that I couldn't give it a 9. Basically if they upped the single player mode by making the game about 4 times longer (with new and innoveative things as the game progresses) I would give it a 10/10.","timestamp_created":1434942402,"timestamp_updated":1434942402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16610613","author":{"steamid":"76561198169281292","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":945,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":368,"last_played":1600830874},"language":"english","review":"I love this game with a burning passion \n-Onion","timestamp_created":1434942377,"timestamp_updated":1434942377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16610367","author":{"steamid":"76561198120429318","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":977,"last_played":1634097253},"language":"english","review":"If you've ever wanted to be insulted by a megalomaniac potatoe while falling down an endless pit, this is the game for you.

Pretty good.\n\nThis is a solidly built game with not a single bug that I noticed and is perhaps one of the more simultaneously stressful and exhilarating games I have recently played (so stressful that like the first Portal game, I do not see myself ever wanting to play this game again). I think it is also the most topsy-turvy, vertiginous game I have ever played (even more so than Forsaken in some ways). The plot is simple (with basically the same goal as the first Portal game, to escape the facility). The graphics are wonderful (and interestingly styled, in an ultra-utilitarian and extremely clean and often stark manner), the gameplay is intellectually challenging (and often mind-bending), but I found the characters to be largely irritating distractions with primarily unfunny jokes. Generally the game feels like whoever wrote the dialogue for it may have thought that they were far more funny than they actually were. The game feels full of itself oftentimes. Most jokes fell flat (for me) though the ones that were funny really were excellent in an absurdist sort of way. The funniest thing in the game, the corrupted fact core, I have posted in the comments below. Overall this game is a very oddly balanced combination of intellectual challenge, stress, fun and irritation. Playing it I found to be a sort of intellectually masochistic experience...probably a fun enough game to play through once...but I would not want to repeat the experience.\n\nPros: Great, interestingly styled, clean graphics, no bugs at all, great controls, great sound, interesting (though occasionally annoying) music, lots of intellectual, mind-bending challenge throughout, intense (but up to and past the point of being stressful), If you are good ad 3-dimensional visual-spacial reasoning this game will make you feel very intelligent as you run through the game solving puzzle after puzzle in 10 minutes or less, good ending which makes me want to go outside and not be in by my computer for a while. A great final-boss level with an excellent, surprising, truly funny ending, the designers left the best parts of this game to the end.\n\nCons: Linear gameplay with puzzles which mostly have only one essential answer, only 1 ending, graphics can seem a bit stark at times (though this is part of the game's inherent uniqueness, irritating, largely unfunny characters, If you're good at the game the game can be quite short (but I got the game for only 5 dollars),","timestamp_created":1434940544,"timestamp_updated":1434940544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16609894","author":{"steamid":"76561198045233393","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":344,"last_played":1435099579},"language":"french","review":"J'ai peux d'idées à écrire sur ce MAGNIFIQUE JEUX. : j'ai fini le Single et le COOP et je vous dit ...
