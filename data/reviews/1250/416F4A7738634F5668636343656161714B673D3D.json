Experiments on living humans go terribly wrong in England and now 'specimen', crazy deformed humans or zombie like monsters, are roaming the cities and suburbs of England. \n\nKiling Floor is a very funny game to play with friends. Just like Left for Dead (2), you must fight enemies (zombies and monsters called 'specimen') to finish missions. Enemies come in waves with a boss fights at the end. You can play this game also in singleplayer mode. \n\nAfter each wave, you can go to the weapon store where you can buy weapons and other equipment for your character. KF is addictive because you can upgrade your character and increase your skills and perks. The game doesn't offer great graphics, but they are good enough if you set them on ultra. \nTeamwork is the key in KF. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPositive:\n* co  - op action;\n* different weapons and characters;\n* 'light graphical game' which means it can be played on older computers;\n* teamwork is the key to win;\n* quite funny. \n\nNegative:\n* No story/bad story; \n* graphics aren't that good;\n* dated gameplay;\n* some bugs; \n* not much content.  \n\nVerdict: Mediocre. 6 out of 10 or 3/5.","timestamp_created":1404641617,"timestamp_updated":1425981097,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11098902","author":{"steamid":"76561198025982251","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1544102342},"language":"russian","review":"Cool game!","timestamp_created":1404641462,"timestamp_updated":1404641462,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11098803","author":{"steamid":"76561198110437278","num_games_owned":277,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2674,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1218,"last_played":1471503742},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1404640848,"timestamp_updated":1404640848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11098782","author":{"steamid":"76561197982324785","num_games_owned":691,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1040,"last_played":1420208793},"language":"english","review":"Very fun and intense FPS with great holiday themed updates to give you more creepy fluff to run away from.
