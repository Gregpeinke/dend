Even thought this is a game from 90's, where the graphics aren't as good as the graphics of our day's or the action isn't so epic as today's games. Like i wrote even thought it's a old game, Half-Life still a game that feels not so old. Because it's the basic of all today's and will be the basic of future games for sure. I hope this review will just push a bit in the decision of playing this game. Also check the dlc (Half-Life: Opposing Force and Half-Life: Blue Shift) and of course the sequel.

verdad esperaba más de este juego, dado a que Half-Life es una franquicia de culto, aunque eso no significa que el juego sea malo.\nLa historia no es nada del otro mundo, eres un cientifico que, tras participar en un experimento de teletransporte, se abre un portal que trae a criaturas de otro mundo, y tu objetivo es evitar que la situacion vaya a más, realmente yo creo que el fuerte esta en lo que va pasando a lo largo de la historia, ya que al tener que recorrer el masivo centro de investigacion de Black Mesa es normal que pasen muchisimas cosas, la unica parte que destacaria, ALERTA DE SPOILER, es el viaje a Xen, ya que ahí es donde aparece lo más interesante del juego, pero no se equivoquen, la historia pese a no ser la gran cosa, funciona muy bien como introduccion al universo de Half-Life, nada que objetar personalmente.\nEn cuanto a gameplay, lo resumire, es Call of Duty, pero con varias armas nada genericas y movilidad frustrantemente resbalosa y rapida, las granadas estan en slots de arma, o sea que tienes que equipartelas en la mano para lanzarlas, lo que significa quitarte momentaneamente el arma, lo que te quita manejo comparado a un Call of Duty promedio, y la linterna funciona como el culo, ya que en vez de emitir luz hacia el frente desde el personaje, lo que hicieron fue que aparezca luz justo en la ubicacion en donde esté el cursor, o sea que si apuntas al final de un tunel oscuro, la luz te aparecera en la otra punta, dejandote a ti a oscuras, sin contar con que, ALERTA DE SPOILER, en los ultimos capitulos te dan un modulo de salto largo, que se maneja muy mal, ya que tienes que apretar adelante, agachar y saltar a la vez para que funcione bien, y como imaginaran eso lo hace muy incomodo de jugar, aun así no es un juego imposible, y la frustracion solo se presenta cuando toca hacer zonas de parkour, de resto la jugabilidad es muy disfrutable para la época en la que se hizo.\nEn cuanto a apartado visual, pues no me veo en derecho a quejarme, es un juego muy viejo, es normal que se vea así.\n\nUna buena forma de introducir el universo Half-Life, sin embargo, esta lejos de la perfeccion como tantos presumen, pero aun así lo recomiendo.","timestamp_created":1628177402,"timestamp_updated":1628177402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503759443759918213","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96992094","author":{"steamid":"76561198374148455","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":177,"last_played":1650431192},"language":"schinese","review":"20年前玩的盗版

Ailelerine çocuklarını fellik fellik aratmıştır. Şakası bir yana ciddi anlamda başlayalım.\n\nHalf Life, bir gizli araştırma üssünde meydana gelen bir kaza sonucu ortaya çıkanları anlatan, bunları kahramanı Gordon Freeman’ın gözünden anlatan 1998 yapımı bir FPS oyunudur. Kısaca bahsetmek gerekirse, spoiler vermemeye çalışarak, araştırma üssüne bir taş benzeri bir madde ulaşmıştır, maddenin uzaydan geldiği varsayılmaktadır ve M.I.T’den mezun olan Gordon Freeman’ın ekibi olan olağandışı maddeler ekibine üzerinde deney yapılması adına verilmiştir. Ardından yapılan deneyde bir aksaklık olur ve macera başlar. Bundan sonrasını anlatacağım merak edenler için. Altta bir link verip oraya yazmayı planlıyorum. Oyunun altında oldukça ve oldukça sağlam bir hikaye var.\n\nBiraz da oyunun tarihinden bahsedelim. Valve’in çıkış oyunudur Half-Life. Gabe Newell ve bir kaç arkadaşı eski Microsoft çalışanıdır. Windows 95 ve 98’de çok büyük katkıları olduğu söylenir Gabe’in. Microsoft ekibinden daha önce ayrılan bir ekip id software’i kurmuştur. Çıkarttıkları oyunlar ile iyi bir başarıya imza atmıştır. Bunu gören Gabe, id Software’dan olan arkadaşları ile iletişime geçer ve Microsoft’dan ayrılır. Ardından Quake’in oyun motorunu düzenleyerek ilk Half Life’ı yaparlar. GoldSrc adlı oyun motoru ile Half Life sunulur. Half Life FPS tarihindeki ilk hikayeli oyun olma tahtına da sahiptir. Ondan önceki oyunlar sadece vur ve ilerle mantığında idi. Valve, Half Life ile yepyeni bir FPS devri başlatmış ve çok çok büyük bir başarıya imza atmıştır. Ardından kendi source motorları ile tekrar ele almışlardır.(1.6 sürümü source ile yapılmıştır.)\n\nOyunun havası oldukça kasvetli. Her an her yerden saldırabilecek düşmanlar, her tarafta onun dışındaki cesetler, çok az canlı insan, havalandırmalarda geçen yollar,kısıtlı cephane.. Oyun atmosfer olarak size o an oradaki insanın psikolojisi nasıl olursa aynen onu yaşatmakta. Karakter Gordon Freeman ise soğukkanlı ve kolayca bağ kurulabilecek bir karakter. Kısacası oyunu oynamaya başladığınızda kendinizi oyunun içerisinde hissedeceksiniz.\n\nSingle Player’dan sonra efsanevi multiplayer’ına geçersek, Multiplayer’ı da Single Player’ı kadar efsanedir. Oynanabilirliğin çok yüksek olması ve kısa sürede adapte olabilmek oyunu daha da çok oynanabilir yapmıştır. Hala daha oynayanı vardır.Çünkü onun deneyimini ne battlefield’dan ne call of duty’den yada başka bir fps’den alabilirsiniz. Bambaşkadır.\n\nOyun kısmından çıkarsak, Valve geliştirdiği bu motorun üzerine bir çok oyun daha oluşturmuştur. Şüphesiz bunların en meşhuru Counter Strike’dır. Ardından Ricochet, Team Fortress, Deathmatch Classic gibi oyunlarını da eklemiştir. Bir kaçını yeni versiyonları ile günümüzde görmekteyiz.\n\nHalf Life’ın başarısının hemen ardından Valve, Orada olanları farklı gözlerden anlatan Half Life Opposing Force, Half Life Blue Shift, Half Life Decay oyunlarını da çıkartmıştır.\n\nArtıları ve eksileri ile özet geçersek\n+Mükemmel bir senaryo\n+Oynanabilirliğin çok yüksek olması\n+Harika atmosfer\n-Oyunun artık eskimiş olması (Aslında bu bir eksi değil, oyunun yeni source ile yapılmış hali olan Black Mesa Source’u oynayabilirsiniz.\n\nDaha önce oynamadım, oynamak istiyorum diyenlere şiddetle tavsiyemdir.

Gun's sound awesome, aiming is awesome, levels are awesome, enemy design is awesome, story is awesome, NPCs are awesome, movement is awesome, and on sale, this game is less than 2 dollars. I promise your PC can run it, and I promise, from the moment you start playing, you will not stop until you beat it.","timestamp_created":1628014375,"timestamp_updated":1628014375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96881842","author":{"steamid":"76561199042915850","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":1656145569},"language":"polish","review":"its very good game 10/10","timestamp_created":1628011187,"timestamp_updated":1628011187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s+nBhvsCcsvJ8QI="}
