It was a ground-breaking game with great graphics, brilliant physics and, most of all, a first-rate story (I played it whilst writing up my PhD - but not in physics). I genuinely considered this to be the greatest games ever produced. I was thrilled therefore about the second one - Half Life 2. This had amazing reviews, but sadly this did not deliver anything like the experience of the first game. It has many, many great features: the artistry, particularly of the backgrounds, is stunning, the sense of movement and scale is dramatic, the life-like physics of the world through which you travel is amazingly realistic. It is a very fast paced romp through some beautiful sets with an awful lot of shooting bad guys (the main function of an FPS I suppose). BUT it is so fast that you have no time, no breathing space, to appreciate the beauty of the your character's surroundings. Unlike Deus Ex (albeit a later game) where you are encouraged not to kill, but rather to be stealthy and explore, there is none of this in Half-Life 2. To be honest it became quite boring and repetitive shooting your way around yet another ruined street scene to then be hurried on to the next one to do exactly the same. Personally I love exploring these strange virtual worlds (I like shooting bad guys too, preferably by sniping them) but I was not given the opportunity to do so here (I understand I might be in the minority here). That is a great shame. My biggest gripe is about the STORY. Half-Life 2 has no story (regardless of what the adverts say). Here was a great opportunity to get to know some of the characters and weave an interesting story around them (as in the first game) with surprises and twists (as in the first game). Here the characters merely guide Gordon down a long and bloody road. I had hoped that the ending would reveal something. Who, for example, are the Combine? But the ending a huge anti-climax. So to conclude: I would recommend this if your only interest is a fast-paced shooter. For that it is very good. BUT if you want more subtlety and particularly story than that, then I would leave Gordon and his suit behind.","timestamp_created":1422102186,"timestamp_updated":1422102290,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14142125","author":{"steamid":"76561198056891305","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":957,"last_played":1473356342},"language":"english","review":"Half life 2, and its episodes are the best games I have ever played.

Having to glitch: In the airboat you need to put crap in a box to make the board raise so you can ramp over a wall. Simple, except there wasn't enough crap to put in the box.
