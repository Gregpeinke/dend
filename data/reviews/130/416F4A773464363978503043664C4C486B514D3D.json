Not only did I not found Blue Shift that difficult on \"normal\" but I also loved the game, completed all the way through this time around, in two sessions no less, it wasn't that long of a game, but it was the perfect length for the kind of game I was looking forward to.\n\nAs for the game?\n\nBlue Shift is Half Life but you play as Calhougn, Calgouhn? I don't know; look! you are one of the officers trying to escape the facility, throughout the game you'll go through a multitude of different set pieces, gunfights and more.\n\nYou'll battle aliens, marines, and even like in the original Half Life game, at one point and time you'll even abandon earth to go different alien dimensions similarly to how you did at the end of the original game.\n\nIs all well and good though, the game is perfectly well balanced and frankly, the only there were only two small parts that really bothered me about the game... well three, if you count some bugs here and there.\n\nThe first part was when you visit the alternate, alien, Xen dimension, the game developers went out of their ways to implement some pretty annoying platforming; is a short area, but an annoying one at that.\n\nThen there's the freaking level design and puzzle design at times; there's a point were I got lost near the start of the game because I couldn't find a ladder that was placed in the worse place it could be; literally a place where not only did the ladder  camouflaged with the tank in was placed on because of its colour; but also it was placed exactly in the one part where you wouldn't look because of the game's narrow fov and quick camera movement & angle.\n\nAs for the puzzles?\n\nThere was only one fairly near the end of the game that pissed me off; there's a bunch of dynamite planted on a door that you're supposed to blow up, this dynamite is connected to a trigger but there's a problem.\n\nThe cable is connected with? broken! now how the fuck do I attach it?\n\nWelp, it turns out I wasn't supposed to attach it at all, instead what I was supposed to do, was get a barrel from a corner of the same room, drag it to complete the missing link between the two cables, and then somehow trigger the freaking thing.\n\nThis made me lose about 15 minutes or so while I was exploring the same areas trying to find a solution as to where to go, or what to do; it got pretty annoying.\n\nOn the plus side there was an IGN guide that was actually quite good for once and I enjoyed both reading it as well as using it to complete the game, despite not really needing it after this \"barrel\" puzzle.\n\nOther than that the game is what you would expect, it plays like Half Life, it looks like Half Life, the soldiers that you run into are a bunch of assholes, and the scientists and aliens are all cool.\n\nGenerally it's a great recommendation, and probably the first Half Life game of the classic trilogy that I've actually completed through and enjoyed at its fullest.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'll experiment once more, by playing through the other two classic Half Life titles on \"normal\" or harder.\n","timestamp_created":1639538885,"timestamp_updated":1639538885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105847906","author":{"steamid":"76561199070782145","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1639534383},"language":"brazilian","review":"Obviamente, não poderia faltar o ponto de vista de um guarda comum do complexo Black Mesa.
