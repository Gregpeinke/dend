The game combines strong FPS mechanics, weapons, and Vigors with a strong environment giving the player a great deal of immersion. The best comparison I can draw with this game and another is Metro 2013, the game has a servicable main storyline, nothing spectacular and arguably inconsistent//self contradicting, but immerses the player with well concieved and beautiful environments where NPCs behave as you would expect them too, and the dialogue is superbly written. The side narratives in this game are the most interesting aspect of it, the stories of minor characters and the two conflicting populations will keep the player entralled. The music in this game is also quite well done, despite it being overshadowed by the visual spectacles and dialogue. With solid graphics, gamplay, audio and an unquestionable ability to immerse the player, Bioshock Infinite is a game which will appeal both to players looking for a strong FPS experiene as well as  a those looking for an immersive storytelling experience.","timestamp_created":1381791337,"timestamp_updated":1381791337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521842539310455322","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7389672","author":{"steamid":"76561198024513621","num_games_owned":362,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":867,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":719,"last_played":1381710442},"language":"czech","review":"9/10","timestamp_created":1381790597,"timestamp_updated":1388876921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7389086","author":{"steamid":"76561198079146467","num_games_owned":390,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1414536623},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра!

Both are complex and advanced for their time, not only in gameplay, but also in story and technology. This set the bar high for Bioshock, and despite some flaws, both 1 and 2 manage to stand out as solid games. Certainly not as expectional as SS2, but close enough to land them on most \"must play\" lists. With Infinite, another attempt was made at reaching that bar, and I believe it not only failed to reach it, but didn't even reach the level of its family in Rapture. For a game praised up and down for being polished, I found flaw in almost every system. The graphics are stunning, except for the low resolution textures, sky boxes and other backgrounds that abound (although not as badly as they do on the console versions). The attention to detail is excellent, if you ignore the fact that from no other levels can you see the Hall of Heroes, Battleship Bay, Comstock House, etc, Columbia is just a boring backdrop. The gunplay is state of the art, if you can come to terms with using some combination of the hand cannon, carbine and machine gun the entire game. The powers are fresh and interesting, if you like \"hold the button to create a trap!\". The game is difficult! I used those 3 weapons, no powers, didn't buy any food/ammo/etc from machines and didn't die a single time on hard. 1999 mode is supposed to be the answer to that, but it's locked from the start of the game. The story and characters are gripping and the best part! Oh my... Let's look back, remember in Bioshock, the last 1/3 or so of the game, after you do a little \"office golfing\"? Pretty forgettable, right? All of Infinite feels like that, with the exception of a few strong moments (Slate stands out). What little characterization the main characters have comes so slowly it's hard to care, and then to complicate things further, information found in the voxaphones (recordings) throughout the game is ignored 9/10 times, despite being in many cases much more interesting than the story the game is feeding you. Infinite tries so hard to show shades of grey, but instead almost every character and plot point feels cliched or under utilized. All that to say nothing of the last hour or so of the game, any good will built up is quickly destroyed with a lazy copout explanation (quantum physics, I ain't gotta explain shit!) and more plot holes than most fan fictions. The final moments feel like nothing more than an attempt to tie this game to older, better games, while leaving room for sequels and DLC (it'll come out eventually?). All that said though, Infinite is by no means a bad game, it's still one of the most fun and interesting games to come out this year. It is certainly not however the game that every ass kissing review and award makes it out to be. Pick it up, preferably on sale, and find out for yourself, but in my opinion, the much better (and cheaper) Bioshock 1 and System Shock 2 more deserving of your time and money.","timestamp_created":1381608873,"timestamp_updated":1385425186,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7371572","author":{"steamid":"76561198010181365","num_games_owned":648,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":667,"last_played":1381607279},"language":"german","review":"Sehr schönes Spiel, die Athmosphäre ist klasse und zieht sich schön durch die wirklich großen Level.

The first bioshock called heavily upon Ayn Rands works and nearly everyone who came to rapture became enthralled with it. Bioshock infinite continues this tradition faithfully although I am not sure what literary works (if any) Infinite calls upon to create columbia. There seems to be a big narrative on extreme nationalism as well as racial and class conflicts (specifically mirroring those in the United States about 100 years ago), although you still get the feeling that Irrational was treading a little too carefully on material that demands raw, unsettling truth. On the other hand there is this cool quantum conundrum going on that unfolds which is cool and culminates into one of the best endings to a video game I have ever seen. Now since it decides to play around with quantum mechanics, naturally a game company's story writers are going to get shit wrong, so it requires a little suspension of disbelief (something I would think gamers would be good at). As for the gameplay, well....it kinda blows. The gun play is reduced to one dimensional tactics of only having 2 weapons at a time (2 weapons that are usually bullet flingers), as opposed to the large array of fun diverse weapons in Bioshock 1 (and even the gunplay in that was kind of weak so you see my point). There also seems to be an overabundance of \"press x to do y\" rather than using the already existing gameplay mechanics to interact with the environment. The one gameplay mechanic that does feel pretty good is the skylines. It is pretty fluid and kind of over powered (which is a good thing). Overall you choose whether you think it is worth playing. I would still say I enjoyed it and the revelations toward the end make a second playthrough feel very different.","timestamp_created":1381549367,"timestamp_updated":1381549367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7364556","author":{"steamid":"76561198035054806","num_games_owned":658,"num_reviews":201,"playtime_forever":435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":138,"last_played":1500086265},"language":"english","review":"Dizzing, beautiful, and subtle creepy.. everything you've come to love in a Bioshock game. \n\nBest of all the first 6 months of bugs is over!

And after two hours of thinking about what has happened I will admit, this is the first bioshock game that I have finished and I belive that it is a monument to how games should tell stories. Developers, take notes.  Most games aren't remembered for the stories because they are usually rubbish, but when they are worth your time, they are made to keep the player in awe, wonder, mysterym and suspence like Bioshock: Infinite . If I could relate this game to anything within popular culture, I would discribe the genious mind fuck to be similar to Fight Club, the atmosphere and gameplay keeps you on your toes like the Bourne Ultimatum, the imagary is as stunning as The Lord of the Rings, and the story is on par with Final Fantasy X and Inception. The constant worring of falling off of the floating cities, the integration of Bioshock 1 and Infinite is great for veteran and new plaers, and the sudden hostility toward your character at the beginning are just a couple great components of this game that makes this is one for the history books. Once you spiral into the world of Infinite, there is no goingback, but forward to know what happens next.","timestamp_created":1381527834,"timestamp_updated":1381527834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7363008","author":{"steamid":"76561198042975436","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":747,"last_played":1578277618},"language":"english","review":"Spoilers*\nThis game is terrible in comparison to its predecessor. The two gun limit discourages experimentation, upgrading guns, and limits strategy so the devs had to make every encounter possible for any combination. Where as in the first and second game you could use eight different weapons to tackle a tough fight in a multitude of ways, from booby traps to full on assault or sneak attacks. \n\nThe vigors which are this games plasmids have a total of 3 I actually used in combat with the others being fillers. Storywise it is never explained what they are made of, how they are made, and why does almost no one use them? In rapture they were a part of the world and its history and if you removed them the story would make no sense. In Columbia they are just there and could be removed with almost no impact, and obviously put in the game so that people could say \"It has vigors which are like bioshocks plasmids!\"\n\n Elizabeth who is your companion for almost the whole game has two major flaws that destroy her character\n1.She has lived in isolation in a tower her entire life, only meeting a giant mechanical bird once in a while but she has the social skills of your average teen\n2.She has a power to open a hole to ANYWHERE at ANY TIME and never uses this to escape said tower even though less than 10 minutes after meeting her it is clear she can travel through them.\n\nBooker Dewitt is no genius either. At one point he sees a sign that clearly implies if you have a mark on your hand, expect harsh treatment. What does our hero do when he sees this mark on his hand? He just goes \"huh\" and leaves it in plain view which backfires on him no less than 5 minutes later, with him only covering it if his hand gets stabbed. On top of this he never shuts up, constantly talking and showing what the player is supposed to be feeling.\n\nThe plot makes no sense, where your character entered an alternate universe to get his daughter from himself to pay his debts, and ends with your omnipotent daughter killing you to prevent you from kidnapping her from yourself. Literally a paradox on top of misunderstanding the multiverse theory. \n\nThe city you are in for the entire game ditched the idea of balloons holding them up for atoms being held up in space due to \"quantum mechanics\". Basically anything that could be questionable is dismissed by quantum mechanics, with almost no explanation other than that. The second antagonist of the game which is songbird, a giant metal bird, is one of the biggest disappointments in the game. Throughout the entire game he is heckling you and trying to take back elizabeth and eventually you would think you fight this monstrosity right? Wrong, you get to throw him at a blimp every five minutes in a survival battle against a bunch of mooks and then he dies through one of the BIGGEST ASSPULLS I HAVE SEEN.\n\nElizabeth using her new godlike powers, transports you and songbird into Rapture, and he drowns under the ocean. Thats it. One of the biggest obstacles in the game is killed through almost no player interaction.\n\nAlso on a slightly more sensitive matter, racism. The game tries to be mature by having blacks serve as low class workers for whites and generally being like the south before the civil war. But it never does use the N word, in fear of backlash even though it was used commonly back then. The game gives you a choice at one point to throw the first baseball at a interracial couple during a fair which COULD have been a good choice, to either sacrifice your morals to fit in, fight for whats right or be neutral, but no matter what you do, you are railroaded into fighting a bunch of cops only armed with nightsticks.\n\nTL:DR its a over-hyped linear shooter with terrible mechanics, a hastily put together story, wasted potential and has no need for the bioshock title other than brand recognition because releasing this game on its own would have been to \"risky\"\nIf you think this game is good, playthrough the first bioshock game and then this one and compare gameplay differences and look at the story again","timestamp_created":1381527361,"timestamp_updated":1403232389,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7362696","author":{"steamid":"76561197978563642","num_games_owned":378,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":563,"last_played":1526762324},"language":"english","review":"Possibly one of the best games I've ever played!

Ein richtig geiles Spiel, Leute. 9/10","timestamp_created":1381426154,"timestamp_updated":1381426154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7353773","author":{"steamid":"76561198001131043","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2047,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":678,"last_played":1538076042},"language":"english","review":"Get it.

The visuals are gorgeous, the female sidekick is likeable and doesn't piss you off, and the story is engrosing.
