Here my thought about the game.\n\nFirst time we enter the game in the ocean and then we proceed to lighthouse, here my message for you guys who don't like a horror game, in the lighthouse there's some kind of murder/creepy vibe that waiting for you but trust me there is nothing there, just go to the top of the lighthouse and you'll see the great opening of the game.\n\nQuick review from me, the game has a new element to play with voiced main protagonist compare the first 2 Bioshcok games, because in the first two bioschok they don't give the main characters dialogue. and there's one companion with you in this game which is the girl that we're looking for. one thing that i didn't like about this game is the gameplay, if i have to choose bioshock 1 or this game in the gamplay i rather choose the first bioshock. i dont know maybe i just dont like the mechanics of this game but hey, the story is really good and things that makes me love this game is every dialogue the  main protagonist and the girl have. in some cases i felt like i don't play bioshock games when i play this one because the settings is different because it's based on float city columbia, and even though the story is really good but it kinda leave me hanging with confusing in the end (you will know it if you play it).\n\nP.S the scary things in this game it's not much because the game time is usually at a daytime and a little bit storm. all i can say is of course there's a jumpscare waiting for you, here's the thing, if you really- really easily get jumped, i'm gonna say that this game has 3 jumpscares but in my cases there's one jumpscare that really made me scream out loud and pause a little bit. so be prepared in every places you got into, and always be prepared when you want to look what's behind you.\n\nThat's all for me, Bioshock Infinite it's still good to play with some unique characters.","timestamp_created":1609050177,"timestamp_updated":1609050177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83265303","author":{"steamid":"76561198287054338","num_games_owned":368,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":7462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1386,"last_played":1657026019},"language":"schinese","review":"为毛玩着玩着启动不了游戏了，无法完成安装，卸载重装也没用？","timestamp_created":1609044648,"timestamp_updated":1609249691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83263494","author":{"steamid":"76561198412404617","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1611817303},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩！！！！！！！！！！！！\n","timestamp_created":1609042767,"timestamp_updated":1609042767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83262348","author":{"steamid":"76561198953129270","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1609099321},"language":"spanish","review":"jugue

Всегда есть маяк. Всегда есть человек, всегда есть город... [/i]\n\nЯ готова простить этой игре все на свете...\nДаже те \"богоподобные\" ремастеры первой и второй частей, которые через колено запускались вместе с русификатором, а потом еще и вылетали, а если очень повезет, то зависнет всё и вся на твоем компе.\nНо, я не хочу об этом, потому что я забыла все, когда увидела титры после второго эпизода дополнения в 3-ей части Биошока. ДЕВАЧКИ, ЭТО ШЕДЕВР!!!! \nИтак!!!\n\nНебезызвестная серия игр, от которой я слышала только хорошее и смутно представляла себе беззаботные прогулки по утопичному миру и его исследованию, но не тут-то было. Игра с разворота спускает нас с небес на землю,но только не на землю, а под воду...и вот ты в \"Восторге\", а потом не успеваешь и глазом моргнуть, как оказываешься в парящей в облаках Колумбии. Интересно, правда? Очень!\nВ этой серии игр прекрасно все:\n- затягивающий и ненапряжный геймплей\n- внимание к деталям\n- выбор всевозможной оружки и усилений\n- прокачка оружки и усилений\n- интересные перестрелки, а в последнем дополнении неожиданно добавляется [spoiler] стелс [/spoiler] (оаоаоаоа)\n- завораживающая утопическая атмосфера\n- хорошо прописанные персонажи\n- сочная, яркая и мрачная (где это требуется) графика\n- ИСТОРИЯ!!! вот то, что отличает эту игру. Сюжет, который длится на протяжении всего времени прибывания в игре. Тебе не дают про него забыть. Ты видишь его буквально перед глазами: когда убиваешь мутантов, когда исследуешь локации, когда читаешь постеры и слушаешь аудиодневники...он всегда окружает тебя, он всегда рядом.\nЭто тот случай, когда ты ничего не понимаешь до самого последнего, но тебя по голове бьют какие-то флешбеки, ты вот-вот должен что-то уловить, но ниточка выскальзывает из твоей руки и ты идешь дальше и в какой-то момент игра вываливает на тебя все и ты такой сидишь: \"Ахиреееееть\" Все эти хитросплетения, диалоги, отсылки; когда игра сама себе на своем пути подсказывает и указывает, когда высмеиваются эти вечные \"иду туда, не знаю куда\" и \"а кому вообще можно доверять\". Эта игра в первую очередь про сюжет. Сюжет интересный и затягивающий. Без всяких новомодных лоров. Здесь тебе не нужно убивать дракона 3 часа для того, чтобы отрубить ему хвост,а потом в описании прочитать, что этот дракон пролетал над тем самым королевством в то самое время, когда на свет появился кто-то.\n\nХватит слов.

No fue sino hasta esta tercer entrega que Bioshock llamó mi atención. Aunque lo cierto es que no me encantó en un primer instante. \nHasta entonces tan solo había visto algunos vídeo análisis, y ciertamente me agradaba el aspecto, pero no me esperaba aquí una obra maestra ni nada similar. Hoy doy gracias por haberme equivocado.\nCuando compré el juego no tenía ni la mas mínima idea de que no sólo esta entrega, sino toda la serie de Bioshock se convertiría en una de las mejores sagas que he tenido el placer de conocer, y disfrutar. \nAquí, sin embargo, nos compete Bioshock Infinite, este se ha ganado a pulso mi titulo personal de la mejor entrega de de la saga. No sin esperar, desde luego, ciertos recelos de muchos de los de aquellos que guardan con nostalgia el recuerdo del Bioshock original, pero yo empecé mi experiencia por el final y tal nostalgia no existe en mí.\nAsí pues, Bioshock Infinite tiene, sin duda alguna, una de las mejores narrativas que he vívido nunca en un videojuego.

Considering I am playing this for the first time in 2020 and broken overhyped games like Cyberpunk 2077 are the norm these days, it is not an overstatement to say that they don't make games like Bioshock Infinite anymore. \n\nPolished, balanced, beautiful and simple. \n\nThe visuals and art style holds up ridiculously well , they weren't going for photorealism and that is why the game looks great. They decided to go with unique shaders and textures which really is a class of it's own.\n\nThe bioshock franchise always had great environmental and musics, Infinite just does it better than the previous games. \nWhilst this isn't the undersea dystopia we all know and love, I've come to find this completely different world up in the skies to be just as charming if not more charming than Rapture. In rapture it was always doom and gloom, anywhere you went people tried to kill you and splicers are everywhere, what makes Columbia unique is that, Columbia is not yet a post-apocalyptic post civil-war city. You can go about seeing people enjoying time at fun fairs and running shops at times and it really brings life to this new world we have the opportunity to exist in for that 10 or 15 hour. The game is also very decently paced and lengthy. \n\nI can only say that the only downgrade from previous bioshock games is the lack of manual saving, sometimes the checkpoints are too far apart and it can be very inconvenient.","timestamp_created":1608874413,"timestamp_updated":1608874413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83087192","author":{"steamid":"76561198064189638","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5799,"last_played":1582370786},"language":"english","review":"The only problem with this Bioshock Infinite is that it's the last Bioshock project that Irrational Games and Ken Levine will ever put their hands on. \n\nIn terms of raw, plot-driven, story-rich, chaotic storytelling, this game absolutely nails it. 7 years and multiple playthroughs later, I still love this game. At the prices you can generally pick this game up for these days, there is absolutely no excuse for you not to have a copy. It would not be an exaggeration to say that this is easily one of the best single-player games created in the last 10 years, if not ever. \n\nI truly find it to be a shame that in a world of franchise gaming, we're seeing 30 different Assassin's Creed games, 40 different NBA 2K games, and low effort military FPS sims constantly, but high-quality passion projects like this that can truly stand the test of time are always getting fewer and further between. I hope that whatever Ken Levine's new \"Ghost Story Games\" Studio is working on manages to reignite my love for video games the way that this project did all those years ago.\n\nIf you're sick of dime a dozen battle royals, \"open-world\" games full of pointless and generally boring side quests with a lacklustre main story, and want to play a game that actually asks something of you as the player in a thoughtful and meaningful way, then look no further. I can attest to replayability even being quite enjoyable with diverse upgrade paths. All you have to do, after you give Gabe Newell your paltry $8.50, is sit back and enjoy the fact that you somehow managed to go 7 years without playing this modern classic, and can now experience the joy of your first Bioshock Infinite playthrough - hell, go play the first one while you're at it, but skip the 2nd one as it was not actually developed by Ken's team and it has always shown.","timestamp_created":1608870314,"timestamp_updated":1608870314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83086985","author":{"steamid":"76561198825224987","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":528,"last_played":1608869931},"language":"schinese","review":"枪手感还行，就是好像没有按住瞄准？\n没有按住瞄准有点难受","timestamp_created":1608870048,"timestamp_updated":1608870048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83085798","author":{"steamid":"76561198343268770","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":558,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":558,"last_played":1595167235},"language":"schinese","review":"挺好玩的","timestamp_created":1608868379,"timestamp_updated":1608868379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l+eBzPYCdp75vAI="}
