A great game, but I’m with the general consensus: the first title, Opposing Force, is far superior in terms of length, plot and variety of enemies, weapons, physics and combat mechanics.\n\nBlue Shift’s strength lies on the fact that you’re not a hero, nobody special, and your mission is just to survive. Plain and simple. No fanfare, no final boss, no special reward, nothing. And that is very well executed; you get to play the commoner, the one lower than even the grunts from Opposing Force.\n\nIt was an interesting approach to the franchise, where you build down, not up. The more you play, the less relevant the protagonist in question is.\n\nSo again, this is a good title, well worth checking it out. Blue Shift stems from a different time and approach to franchise building. A time that, hopefully, we’ll see a resurgence in the future.","timestamp_created":1610547455,"timestamp_updated":1641427512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84614040","author":{"steamid":"76561198363197400","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1610546410},"language":"schinese","review":"蛮好玩的，因为听不懂英文个别地方比较烧脑，流程较短，还是蛮有魅力的。","timestamp_created":1610546878,"timestamp_updated":1610546878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84612600","author":{"steamid":"76561198366666965","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":26,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26,"last_played":1607179944},"language":"koreana","review":"HALF-LIFE: BLUE SHIT 아니냐?\n파란똥 겜","timestamp_created":1610545253,"timestamp_updated":1610545253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460636496543884277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84612571","author":{"steamid":"76561198297682072","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":39,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1609677156},"language":"polish","review":"Gra byłaby świetna, gdyby nie w obecnym patchu, który całkowicie usuwa celownik, uniemożliwiając strzelanie do przeciwnika.
