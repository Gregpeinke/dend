I even got Cave Johnson's quote about life and lemons on my ipod case.  \n\nBut my favorite thing about Portal isn't just the characters, it's the atmosphere of Aperture Laboratories too. I like the feeling of being alone in this enormous abandoned science facility with only a few robots and a Companion Cube for company.  Portal is just one of those games you never want to end.\n\nSo yes, I would highly recommend Portal/Portal 2.

It's been a long time. How have you been?\"\n\nSe fosse pra escolher uma palavra que definisse esse jogo, seria: Genial! Mas é óbvio que essa obra-prima da Valve merece mais, então, aqui estou eu refazendo minha análise ridícula de 3 linhas sobre esse jogo brilhante... Porque ele merece, me fascinou de uma forma que poucos fizeram.\n\nNessa sequência, mais uma vez no comando de Chell, além de mais uma vez se deparar com as conhecidas test chambers, você vai poder ter o prazer de caminhar por entre as instalações da Aperture Science, de vasculhar o cerne de um passado há muito esquecido, de imaginar como aquele lugar em ruínas foi um dia e como se tornou o que é, criar suas próprias teorias... sensação de déjà vu, e eu ADORO isso! Posso até dizer que foi essa sensação que me fez gostar de games, levando em conta os primeiros pelos quais me apaixonei. Portal já era considerado um grande game, mas diante de Portal 2, percebemos que era como um protótipo. E a Valve fez um trabalho maravilhoso, não somente dando continuidade a primeira ideia já vitoriosa, mas fazendo algo muito mais f*cking awesome, jogando bem no meio da sua cara, o tempo inteiro, a grandiosidade do título e uma história bem elaborada, cenários vastos e polidos de encher os olhos, e coisas que mal esperávamos ao jogar o primeiro. Além de sugerir o entrelaçamento com o universo de Half-Life, o que faz tudo ficar muito mais interessante! As dublagens foram muuuito bem trabalhadas e as falas são super cômicas, até hoje dou risada das coisas que a GLaDOS fala, como \"Well done. Here come the test results: \"You are a horrible person.\" That's what it says: a horrible person. We weren't even testing for that.\" XD E sobre jogar com um amigo, digo também que o modo cooperativo é realmente muito bom, é à parte da campanha mas não deixa nada a desejar, vai exigir muito de você e do parceiro, mas no final sempre vale a pena! E quando o instinto assassino bate, nada melhor do que jogar esse modo! 8D MWahahaha!\nÉ isso, Portal 2 é um \"must have\", atinge um outro patamar no estilo \"puzzle\"! Recomendado, finalmente.

And you know what, it isn't, at least to me. Yes, the single-player campaign is roughly 3 times longer than the original, but that's still only 6 hours of content. That's why I waited for a sale that gave me enough of a discount, and 5€ is much more justifiable for this game, but only because I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in the co-op part of this game. If I did, I'd say 10€ or 15€ would've been ok, but I won't touch that mode at all because I like to play with myself, so I'm left with another comparably short single-player campaign.\n\nBut on to the meat of the game. It seemed to me that the first part was really slow, possibly to accommodate new players who haven't played the original and even later on many of the puzzles were very obvious. I really only got stuck on one puzzle and that was because I missed a small surface that you could actually put a portal on and thus had to consult a walkthrough, but the rest were fairly easy. Still, the mechanics they've added definitely expand on the possibilities of the basic gameplay. I liked manipulating the gels, but again, the placement of tubes basically made the solution extremely obvious and the challenge wasn't so much figuring out what to do, but in what order, which basically involved trial and error. This is the problem with a puzzle game that has one and precisely one solution and which absolutely has to be in first-person. But I really liked the boss fight at the end, it's a really good demonstration of using all of the available elements and all the skills the player has acquired over the course of the game and designing the battle around that, similarly to what the original did. It should be an example to designers around the world, that a boss isn't just a regular enemy that has more health, but a final exam on what we've learned up to that point. \n\nThe environment design is pretty damn well executed. I especially liked the shift to the older abandoned tracts of the facility with the 50's and 70's inspired looks. In fact, the whole visual design is really pretty to look at, although the draw-distance is pretty damn horrible with all that fog they introduce in the broken and open sections of the facility. And I felt that the game underutilized the whole background of the chambers and maintenance areas to flesh out the world a bit. The original basically had the same layered concept the Half-Life games have, where you can either experience a very simplistic story on the surface, or you can investigate further and find a lot of hints which build the world, and this seemed absent in Portal 2. Still, there is a bit of world-building, though mostly through the audio logs of Cave Johnson and some of the dialogue form GLaDOS and Wheatley, though I felt that the ending, similarly to the original left me with little closure overall. I actually read this right now and saw that they changed the ending of the original from merely lying outside the facility to actually being dragged away again, which explains why Chell is back inside the Aperture Laboratories. But again, the ending in Portal 2 is a bit lacking. \n\nSpeaking of the characters, they're all very well realized. It's a lot of fun listening to these guys with their quirks. I especially enjoyed Cave Johnson's way of expression and his inflection during the various audio-logs. Though all of the voice-acting was top-notch.\n\nOne thing that did irk me greatly were the loading times. Seriously this game loads after every single room and it really breaks the flow at times. And if you die, the reloading of the level also takes ages. I assumed Valve would finally learn something but the loading times were even worse than in Half-Life 2. \n\nOverall I'm very pleased with this game. I wish it were a bit longer and introduced more new ideas, but then again, drawing it out too much just leads to repetition.","timestamp_created":1404159447,"timestamp_updated":1404159447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10983679","author":{"steamid":"76561198098355219","num_games_owned":374,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1994,"last_played":1649599705},"language":"english","review":"The single most amazing game I've ever played.

The first character you meet is a core named Wheatley who is voiced by the British comedian Stephen Merchant which makes the whole Portal 2 experience a lot funnier with his little comedic phrases and his comedic timing provide a hilarious world to traverse through. The second character is the main central core with the power to control everything in the testing facilities and her name is GLaDOS, she was the main villain in Portal and she is back with her brilliant sarcasm and her heart piercing insults in Portal 2 and it is brilliant how it ties in with you re-uniting with this core who you last destroyed in Portal.\n\nThe Portal 2 multiplayer is fun, challenging and everything is better when you are overcoming a challenging test chamber with your robot buddy! The co-operative missions put a brilliant twist on things making you work as a team and it is as good as the singleplayer if not better because instead of two portals to work with, you now have four which makes the puzzles a lot more challenging but you can balance it out between eachother.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone, mainly because of how fun it is for all ages and the humour in the game is brilliantly scripted. The characters are really detailed and the world is just fascinating because at one point you could be in some of the chambers that you destroyed in the last game and then you could be in some beautiful, refurbished test chambers so the environment never gets bland or bleak, this game always keeps you on edge and it never gets old!","timestamp_created":1404157743,"timestamp_updated":1404157743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+dmU98YCeYTzKQ=="}
