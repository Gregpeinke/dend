Her oynadığım oyun aslında bir kült yapımlar idi. Rahmetli Babam bana ilk NFS : Hot Pursuit oyunu vermişti 2004 yılında ve hep onu oynar idim. Özellikle bana verdiği Demo CD'leri de dahil. Hayatımda hep en iyi oyunu araştırmış ve istemiş kişiyim. Nedense günümüz oyunların bir çoğu malesef Lootbox veya Pay to Win olayı var. Gerçekten benim yıllardır kalbimi kıran şeydi. Rahmetli Babam'in bana bıraktığı Demo CD'lere bakar iken bir tanıdık sima görüldü : Half-Life.\nBenim yaşımdakiler çoğunlukla PUBG yada Fortnite oynar yada artık tadı olmayan COD'i bile. Ama ben hayatım boyunca hiç Half-Life oynamadım. Hep Youtube'da izlerken kişiler hep Half-Life'a gönderme yapıyordu. Bende gene anlamaya çalışıyordum. Resmen hayatımın en büyük boşluğu idi. İşte onu dolurmaya bu sene başında karar verdim. 30 Aralıkta, kış indirimlerden faydalanarak Half-Life tüm paket aldım. Ocak 1'den itibaren oynamaya başladım ve baktım ki... Ben aslında büyük bir yapımı kaçırdım. O kadar Thief serisi, Deus Ex serisi veya diğer kült yapım serileri oynarken neden bunu oynamadım? Hele şükür oynadım da, hayatımda olan bir boşluğu doldurdum. Daha Half-Life 2'e yeni başladım ama diyeceğim birşey var...\n\nSiz olun, böyle yapımları aynı bir film veya kitap serisi gibi kaçırmayın.

Some glitches (got stuck in a door, alien carcass made it impossible to push boxes out a door to get to the next area), but nothing that can't be solved by loading a previous save (you might want to save often just in case).

It's evident that this project has included great writers, programmers and people who are familiar with physics and cosmology. Together they built a game that started dictating what one FPS game should look like. In addition to an extremely thoughtful and intriguing story, much attention has been paid to the visual side of the game and to the mechanics that are very smooth. It's also evident that the developers have known exactly how to psychologically keep people playing their game by adding hooks to the story that are hard to let go. One of these hooks is definitely G-man who, with his mystery, certainly makes most people want to know what or who he is. And so you keep playing, in the hope that the questions will get answers. Another interesting method is to worship the protagonist Gordon by the characters around him (\"Oh, Gordon came! Now everything will be fine!\"). And since the player experiences Half-Life through the eyes of Gordon, all this glory passes over to the player, which in turn promotes the continuation of the game. I know it's also present in other games, but in Half-Life it's somehow especially in the foreground. But nevertheless, the whole game is well thought out and so it's no wonder that it was such a great success.\nAnd when the expansions of most games can't keep up with their predecessor, Half-Life's expansions continue the series's success story. Although one obvious negative aspect when talking about Half-Life always comes up. Namely that it was never really finished. For over a decade, people have been waiting for Episode 3 or Half-Life 3.

Although I have played that beautiful game until the residue processing part, it is pretty normal that i couldnt understand a single shit about the game because of playing the game at a small age. Having half life last year i finally decided to play it again: Ended up staring at the credits in awe. Despite being an old game, the experience felt utterly good and satsifying in almost every aspect for me.\n\nBeing someone who played some other FPS games such as Crysis, Darkness 2, Battlefield and a bit of Quake 2 i discovered that i was not really into FPS genre. I want to admit Crysis was a really a magnificent game with an impressive atmosphere but still i was bored in some parts of game. However if we think that the graphics were decent to its age, Half-Life is a continously exciting game. The main difference from a typical run'n gun game with a good story is Half-Life always gives something fresh such as adequate functional weapons, realistic areas, significant enemies and some interesting events as you go on. The new features like twitchingdisgustingwearablehomingflylauncher may feel a bit newfangled but they always have a relatable place in story and after some point you just adopt them. When I look back to the scneario it feels kinda cliche-ish nevertheless it was good written and the genious story telling of the game made that stereotype conpiracy story into a great adventure.\n\nOnly unpleasant moments i can remember is when I faced a bug at Gonrach episode (no puns intended here) and i had to look at walkthrough videos to realize it was a bug. Because of that bug it was the only episode I wanted to quit in eshaustion and thought that i was stupid so couldn't find a way out.

It satisfies every science-fiction, and fast-paced action urges all in one, while also still keeping your interest with the mystery of it's world. Between the portals, the Xen world, the ominous G-man, and the funny scientist you can save or watch them turn into grindmeat, Half-Life just can't get old unless it's the only game you play which is unlikely these days. \n\nThe graphics are late 90's what else is there to say. I personally love the simple polys and turn off the HD models once in a while just to remember the original look and to go back in time. I loved Quake and Doom as well since I was 10, and started Half-Life later on in High school actually in 2014 when I was 16 or so. My cousin gave me the PS2 version, and I wasn't attracted to it immediatly because I felt it would never live up to Quake 1 atleast. Boy was I wrong! The love and praise for this series was obviously well deserrved and I'm glad I realized it eventually. \n\nHalf-Life is even better than Quake and Doom, I know it was made a bit after each one so it has technological advantages. BUT! I love how the game feels alive, the ai isn't F.E.A.R level, or super smart but they are fun to mess around with noinetheless. I replayed this game more times than I ever did with the Quake and Doom series. What Half-Life has that these games do not, are actually interesting characters, plots, and concepts. \n\nGman is an easy character to immediatly be curious about, Gordon Freeman is a badass through and through even though he may seem like your typical silent protaganist, he's you sort of. The scientist are not unique but are sometimes funny and sympathetic figures strangely. I always try to save as many scientist and guards as I can, usually I can save 100% of all the characters which is what makes the game feel great. There will be scripted events but you can definetly break the scripted events and it just adds to the fun. Most shoooters don't have this extra side sweet. \n\nThe gunplay is MAD ADDICTING! The weapons are all unique and all have a distinct purpose. The impact of them against the Xen and soldiers feel 100% fluid. The blood and gore is like Quake 1, not too extreme though I'm sure there are good mods to make it even bloodier. \n\nIf you turn off the HD Models, your M16 will change to the original SMG MP5, the Glock will turn into the Beretta, the shotgun is the same except more blocky. Now this may seem like a weird aspect to cover but for me I like when I have the option to play like the original first version. I'm an originalist to the T. I play with the HD Models sometimes, but I have to play with the low poly ugly original stuff too. I'm not so picky like other people when it comes to HD, beautiful, blah blah. I appreciate games in their rawest, imperfect form!\n\nHalf-Life is a must play, and if you haven't touched this masterpiece, you are missing out big time!","timestamp_created":1547146335,"timestamp_updated":1547146335,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48228579","author":{"steamid":"76561198195844330","num_games_owned":368,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1101,"last_played":1658743434},"language":"spanish","review":"Tenes que matar personas tu nariz contra mis bolas","timestamp_created":1547145689,"timestamp_updated":1604610566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549504935741424561","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48227022","author":{"steamid":"76561198040541967","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1596,"last_played":1562525816},"language":"german","review":"This game made me the gamer i am today!\nIt was the first first person based game of this kind with this kind of storytelling!\nAll in all just a true piece of gaming-history","timestamp_created":1547139573,"timestamp_updated":1547139573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48226113","author":{"steamid":"76561198367481073","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":815,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27,"last_played":1624980204},"language":"english","review":"I Love it.
