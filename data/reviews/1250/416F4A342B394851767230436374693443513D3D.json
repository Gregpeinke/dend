Don't let the 2009 graphics put you off - this game is still fresh and fun several years later. As of 2013, Tripwire Interactive (the developer of KF) is still providing regular content updates that help keep the game interesting.\n\nHow is the game itself? As I said before, the graphics are somewhat dated, but not to the point of being ugly. The sound design is fantastic. All of the weapons have a unique look and feel to them. The one commonality between all 40-some weapons is that they are all very satisfying to use. Even though some weapons cost more than others, there really aren't any weapons that are flat-out better than others. Every weapon is meant to fulfill a certain role and cater to different play styles.\n\nAs of now, there are seven classes or \"perks\" in the game. Each perk has its own special abilities and strengths. For example, the Firebug perk gets a incendiary grenades and extra damage with fire-based weapons, while the Medic perk gets healing grenades and more effective heals. No matter what your playstyle is, KF has a perk to accommodate you.\n\nTeamwork is at the core of this game, especially on higher difficulty levels. Generally speaking, if teammates do not support each other, the entire team will fail. The diversity of enemies and map layouts forces teams to be just as diverse. A team that cannot adapt to sudden changes in enemy forces will most likely die horribly.\n\nAs you can probably tell by my total play time in this game (365 hours as of this posting) this game has immense replay value. My recommendation to you is to buy this game on sale and play it with some friends. If you enjoy dark, gritty, and intense co-op shooters, you will not be disappointed by Killing Floor.","timestamp_created":1365092409,"timestamp_updated":1480006082,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529411792755126953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"266473","author":{"steamid":"76561197967106777","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":26491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23341,"last_played":1647161353},"language":"english","review":"Been playing this game since mid 2009 ....
