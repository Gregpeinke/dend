J'ai pourtant bien aimé Half-Life 2, mais je n'avais jamais pris le temps de me lancer dans les deux épisodes. C'est donc avec 14 ans de retard que je découvre ce premier épisode et je n'ai pas été déçu. Evidemment, le gameplay a un peu vieilli ici et là, surtout parce qu'on a devant nous un jeu d'environ 7h qui se déroule surtout en couloir.

Merece mucho la pena y deja en evidencia el mundo de los DLCs que vivimos ahora.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1603271290,"timestamp_updated":1603271290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77906565","author":{"steamid":"76561199026013278","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":123,"last_played":1603411247},"language":"russian","review":"КОНЧЕНАЯ ИГРА ПРОСТО, ПРОХОЖУ ОДНУ ГЛАВУ 1 ИЛИ 2 ЧАСА!!!\nЕДИНСТВЕННАЯ ЧАСТЬ ХАЛВЫ КОТОРУЮ Я НЕНАВИЖУ","timestamp_created":1603262253,"timestamp_updated":1603262253,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77896075","author":{"steamid":"76561198971812306","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":689,"last_played":1657943203},"language":"english","review":"It's a very fun game","timestamp_created":1603239174,"timestamp_updated":1638328262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77893077","author":{"steamid":"76561198800048789","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":343,"last_played":1587871367},"language":"english","review":"It's pretty good","timestamp_created":1603233108,"timestamp_updated":1642316915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77880071","author":{"steamid":"76561198449315815","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":331,"last_played":1543964472},"language":"russian","review":"на разок сойдёт","timestamp_created":1603214041,"timestamp_updated":1603214041,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77858356","author":{"steamid":"76561197991398159","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":922,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":788,"last_played":1605689650},"language":"english","review":"Great stuff................Enough said","timestamp_created":1603177648,"timestamp_updated":1603177648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77817060","author":{"steamid":"76561197991464617","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":242,"last_played":1603122016},"language":"english","review":"Its Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1603122082,"timestamp_updated":1603122082,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77805774","author":{"steamid":"76561198258780753","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":589,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1620692422},"language":"turkish","review":"bu oun 1 kre oynamalık bidaha oynaran sıkılıon amk bu nasıl zevk alın bunu\n","timestamp_created":1603105325,"timestamp_updated":1603105325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77782165","author":{"steamid":"76561198219427511","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1590117905},"language":"brazilian","review":"Y E S","timestamp_created":1603054782,"timestamp_updated":1603054782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77773541","author":{"steamid":"76561199000511976","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1603043175},"language":"czech","review":"Upřímně říkal jsem si jestli dokážou udělat něco horšího než první díl Half-Life, ale oni to dokázali. Alyx se stala díky tadytomu jedním z nejotravnějším a nejvíc zbytečným charakterem který mě pořád blokoval v cestě. Prvních 20 minut hry s vylepšenou portal gunou byli skvělé, ale potom se z té hry zase stala repetetivní a frustrující střílečka.\n40%","timestamp_created":1603043583,"timestamp_updated":1603043583,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wfy1nvUCda7XqAI="}
