Mało jest gier które mogą zachwycić fabułą jak i wysokim poziomem grywalności. Jeżeli chodzi o oryginalność pomysłu przeniesienia rozgrywki z podwodnego miasta do podniebnego, może wydać się pójściem na łatwiznę. Jednak pierwsze kroki w Kolumbii zapierają dech w piersi i wiele razy zdarzyło mi się zatrzymać i podziwiać pełne życia miasto. Oczywiście nie można pominąć postaci Elizabeth z którą naprawdę się zżyłem i nie raz mi pomogła i zaskoczyła w czasie rozgrywki. To gra która szokuje zakończeniem i ma się chęć odpalić od nowa. Gdzie na początku myślałem że to nieistotne sceny, to jednak wszystko miało jakiś sens. Gra się z przyjemnością, można doczepić się jak wszędzie jakiś rzeczy, detali jak np. brak możliwości samodzielnego zapisywania gry co bardzo osobiście nie lubie.

The gameplay is decent, but doesn't break any new ground from the previous Bioshock games. What I found completely lacking was replayability. If you are fine with playing through the a ~11-12 hour game, then never picking it up again, then maybe you won't mind so much, but for something I paid $50 for, I felt slightly cheated. Maybe if you can get it on a sale at $10 or under, but at full price, there's just not enough enjoyment there.","timestamp_created":1412974235,"timestamp_updated":1412974235,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447522252798080444","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12439539","author":{"steamid":"76561198150830407","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":725,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":565,"last_played":1448775226},"language":"english","review":"Cool game, short story","timestamp_created":1412972637,"timestamp_updated":1412972637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12435552","author":{"steamid":"76561198125839685","num_games_owned":320,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":7953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4563,"last_played":1552548385},"language":"russian","review":"11/10! \nПоставить оценку ниже не позволяет совесть!","timestamp_created":1412951479,"timestamp_updated":1479935645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":125,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.793880999088287354","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12434746","author":{"steamid":"76561198107427789","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":859,"last_played":1465573415},"language":"russian","review":"На протяжении всего того времени, которое я провел за прохождением этой замечательной игры, я старался делать так, как ведет меня судьба Букера.

After several playthroughs, and a complete understanding of ALL the gameplay mechanics, i discovered that, despite the more simplistic style of gameplay, i found it to be more enjoyable than the first 2.  Don't get me wrong, Bioshock 1 is an absolute classic in every regard.  Infinite has something going for it though:  Vigors.  I found myself using all the vigors in a single playthrough at some point.  I cant say the same for Bioshock 1 or 2....the vigors were just that much fun to use.  \n\nThe story took a playthrough or 2 to fully understand because i missed a couple minor details in the first run.

However there are 2 aspects of the game which imo make it an above average shooter- the story and the game companion.\n\nThe story is a deep, memorable, open for interpretation type, borderline philosophical, which sticks with you for some time even after you close the game. It did however take me 2 playthroughs to completely understand it, but i value the effort put into the story and how throughout the game they slowly reveal details to you, just to give you a totally unexpected finale.\n\nAs for the follower/game companion, this game offers the most likable and usefull companion ive ever seen in a singleplayer game. I personally dont like followers because in most games they just block me in corridors, alert enemies to my presence, set off traps or make stupid remarks. Luckily Liz doesnt do any of these things and she also throws you ammo/health during combat when youre low, which makes you want to keep her around. \n\nThe game comes with 2 DLCs- Clash in the Clouds (combat challenge based) and Burial at Sea. While ive enjoyed the main game and CitC DLC very much for above stated reasons, the events that take place in Burial at Sea DLC were at least from my point of view very confusing and anticlimatic. Probably because i havent played BioShock 1 or 2 prior to this game, and their stories are bound.\n\nCONCLUSION\nNot to bother with numeric evaluation, lets just say i find this game to be exceptional.

I also played through Infinte on Hard difficulty.\n\nThe combat is fast and frantic, the powers are varied and have enough rock, sissor, paper mechanic to usually have a purpose. But you'll end up finding a play style that works for you and stick with it, but the game does a good job of having dip and troths, limitting ammo in areas to force you to adobt other methods.\n\nAdmitidly I got a bit distracted half way through my playthrough, and took a long break. It stuggled to keep me engaged during the 'gun shop' mission arc which I ended up moving on to other things.\n\nThats the only negative, and is reasonably personal. The positives are, an amazing art style. Quite simply the best companion AI I've ever seen (Dont look beyond the curtain, theres lots of tricks that make it work, but work it does), and a delightfully well orchastrated storyline. I would not stop short of calling this a masterpiece of interactive media, for It is. It's taken a lot of the story telling design theory of Half Life 2, and poslished, refined and tightened it to new heights.","timestamp_created":1412713949,"timestamp_updated":1412713949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12403339","author":{"steamid":"76561198056820570","num_games_owned":519,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":615,"last_played":1409247229},"language":"english","review":"Excellent world, quite good story, beautiful design, but very bad FPS.\nThis game shows promises since its very beginning. You discover a new weird world, that seems quite open and free. But soon, the game become a long, linear and boring FPS in which only the amount of ennemies and the size of their HP bars  are made to bring challenge.  The AI is one of the dumbest I've ever seen, and you only have to keep putting dozens of bullets in every ennemy.\nThis new universe would have make the game interesting (and to be honest, it is the only thing that made me keep playing) if it was well used. But what you have is only some voice records to make you understand the story (classic, and quite good way to learn, however). No break in the game, no time to stop killing, no time to look and think about what is happening.\nThe game is short, but it's okay for a FPS. Still, there is more than enough time to watch those poor bugged ennemies. In every gunfight, there are braindead guys standing in the middle of your sight and waiting to be killed. You don't even have to think, you can trick ennemies without trying. Bossfights are ridiculous, you can just stay at a good distance and kill everything without being annoyed.\nSo, Bioshock Infinite could have been a very good game, but it's actually crap. I can't understand why people love it.","timestamp_created":1412711279,"timestamp_updated":1412711279,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48342972993850708","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12402809","author":{"steamid":"76561198030325673","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":244,"last_played":1410891516},"language":"german","review":"Die Story nimmt einen von der ersten Sekunde an mit, die Einführung in die Welt, die Kräfte, die Charaktere, das Leveldesign - für alles gibt es eine in die Story eingebettete Erklärung.
