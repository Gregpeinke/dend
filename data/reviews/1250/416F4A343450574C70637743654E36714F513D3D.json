It's absolutely false advertising.  Not even once, do you get to kill a floor in this game. Not once!.  However, if by fluke or purpose, it turned out to be a very pleasing co-op survival horror game!  \n\nKilling Floor is a very typical survival horror game in which you fight off waves of increasingly difficult, zombie-like monsters, to ultimately reach the last wave and battle a boss.  Surprisingly enough, this game can run on some of the most low-end basic computer set-ups around without much of an issue, and the graphics are fairly good.  The controls and the gameplay are really fun, however the UI and the voice acting of the Trader in the game could certainly benefit from a overhaul (although I think the voice acting was intentional).\n\nThat said, I do not recommend that anyone purchase this game after this review has been posted, due to the fact that the sequel is on the way and the servers for this game are already beginning to die.  There are plenty of servers to connect to with OK ping here in the eastern US, but I have noticed that the number of players is dropping significantly since the game was released, which spells disaster for the servers in the future, even more so considering that sequel is nearing release this year.\n\nIf this game goes on sale from here on out and you're interested, pick it up for sure, otherwise, look into the sequel instead.\n\n8/10.","timestamp_created":1427388868,"timestamp_updated":1427388868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15062075","author":{"steamid":"76561198075232431","num_games_owned":406,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1325,"last_played":1558990845},"language":"russian","review":"Искал сервер что бы поиграть с другом час, нашел зашел даун слил игру.\nПолучаешь 6 уровень халявная пушка, и 5к часов задротства.\nНашел игру зашел сервак упал.\n11 шестых уровней из 10","timestamp_created":1427388308,"timestamp_updated":1427388308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487684726715087891","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15061917","author":{"steamid":"76561198159292848","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":264,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1430072868},"language":"russian","review":"Fresh Meat!!","timestamp_created":1427387421,"timestamp_updated":1427387421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15061742","author":{"steamid":"76561198173227175","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":609,"last_played":1467319661},"language":"english","review":"i love the game\n","timestamp_created":1427386573,"timestamp_updated":1427386573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15061603","author":{"steamid":"76561198002302287","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10276,"last_played":1495748386},"language":"dutch","review":"Still one of the best zombie shooter out there.","timestamp_created":1427385834,"timestamp_updated":1427385834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15061357","author":{"steamid":"76561198097066101","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":874,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":158,"last_played":1576770089},"language":"english","review":"Played this game's pirate version five years ago, and now i'm not sorry for buying it. This game is made even for those PCs, which don't have extra settings, that's why it is something like CSS , where people can feel themselves quite free. The in-game atmosphere doesn't seem so nervous as you might think, but... it's better to steel yourself, that is my advice, chiefly if you play alone...\n\n+ Good coop.\n- There are a lot of mods (like in CSS), but i don't like them. That's just my personal attitude towards it.\n\n+ Good music. It is awesome!\n- Give more awesome music!\n\n+ A pretty good warehouse - there are a lot of weapons, you can find everything.\n- I would like to carry more, than 15 kg of extra weight.\n\nMy review for this game is positive because i liked it very much.

The challenge of fighting a horde of enhanced zombie creatures really shows once you attempt the higher difficulties. It's very easy to get surrounded and overwhelmed by the horde. But rather than rage quit, it feels a lot better to continue trying until you get it right.\n\nHowever, if I may offer a slight demerit, leveling up perks can be a pain in the tuchus with more people. You end up being overshadowed by the higher-leveled players. If you want to enjoy the wondrous custom perks those guys at Guardians have made, well good fuckin' luck. Everybody's gonna pick the overpowered class and steal all the damage. And those servers that allow the default perks to level up to 60 or somewhere around there? Well, the maximum players on those servers reach up to 35 as far as I can tell, so the lower level players won't get a single point of damage on anything. Fuckin' imbalanced Sentries. On the offchance you can get a brief moment to yourself on one of these servers, good luck fighting a horde of uber custom zeds on Hard - Hell on Earth difficulty.\n\nBut, as I said, it's a minor stain on an otherwise-perfect killing game. And on the brighter side, if you're new to a Guardians or extended perk server and there are other, much higher leveled players, then all you have to do to even have a remotely good time is sit back and let them do ALLLL the work.","timestamp_created":1427315315,"timestamp_updated":1427315355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15051606","author":{"steamid":"76561198135777581","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":157,"last_played":1418671247},"language":"english","review":"so monsters with bangos check.evil baby dolls chech. monsters that scream relly loud check. good game check.","timestamp_created":1427314564,"timestamp_updated":1427314564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15050976","author":{"steamid":"76561198186584927","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":912,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":760,"last_played":1518984159},"language":"russian","review":"Клёвая игра, выживание с настоящими людьми - командная игра.
