I got this for 3RMB ($0.4) during the summer sale since I had some extra money to spend at the end of the sale and I was not disapointed with it. Initially, I held it off for about 1 or 2 weeks so that I could find to right time to play it as I already had high expectations for it and that decision paid off. I played it one afternoon, long after the sale had ended, in an air conditioned room all alone with headphones and had one of the best times of my life. Moving away from the sentimental value of it, I enjoyed the puzzles and the gameplay of Portal and just like most valve games, even though some may perceive it as just another puzzle game, it has its own unique story and twists.
