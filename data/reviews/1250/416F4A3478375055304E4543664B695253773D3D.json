Fine graphics, scenaries, weapons and with a community support. The wheel of selection is rude because mixes the weaponry with tools and many times causes confusion. But has a great defect and designers lie about it: the vanila game is just not optimized to single player. At normal difficulty, win solo is a question of pure luck by the random and quite cheater generation of foes, and strongly depends on of a certain class perk. Although is possible change this by installing \"Faked Players\" Mutator from Workshop, is not a fair play solution by the bad design of difficulty, turns on game too much easy. In any case is more expensive than alternatives, buy with high discount.","timestamp_created":1451164268,"timestamp_updated":1451481223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501396536827087402","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19964628","author":{"steamid":"76561198048255971","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":147,"playtime_forever":106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":106,"last_played":1447487910},"language":"russian","review":"Игра не забыта","timestamp_created":1451141154,"timestamp_updated":1451141154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513900101184844971","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19959790","author":{"steamid":"76561198047606562","num_games_owned":506,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1890,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1786,"last_played":1459276140},"language":"swedish","review":"Just awesome!!!\n","timestamp_created":1451130683,"timestamp_updated":1451130683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19958493","author":{"steamid":"76561198121430092","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1971,"last_played":1554025830},"language":"russian","review":"Не качаются перки.

К тому же  вышел клёвый сиквел.\nМногие скажут, что KF очень похожа на Left 4 Dead 2 (тоже одна из самых моих любимых игр, ну что тут поделаешь - нравится мне зомби тематика ) - тоже зомби, тоже кооператив, да и вышли игры в один год. На первый взгляд так и кажется, но чем дальше, тем больше различий. Хотя одно отличие сразу бросается в глаза - в L4D все уровни связаны, есть некий сюжет, а здесь просто большой набор разнообразных карт для зачистки от зомби и монстров пострашнее. К тому же, в отличии от L4D здесь присутствует элементы rpg, существует несколько навыков (снайпер, техник, медик, подрывник, берсеркер, коммандос) и каждый навык вы можете прокачивать (6 уровень навыка - максимальный). Это меняет концепцию игры просто кардинально. Каждый навык владеет определённым оружием, у каждого навыка свои способности и умения, то есть геймплей очень разнообразный, скучать тут точно не придётся. Вообще прокачка сделана очень тонко и умело, уверен, что вам захочется прокачать до максимума хотя бы один класс, так как с каждым уровнем открываются всё новые геймплейные фишки. Да и пройти какую-нибудь карту на высоком уровне сложности с непрокачанным персонажем вам просто не получится. Так что стимул прокачки определённо есть всегда.\nИграть в KF просто нереально весело. Особенно если играете со своими друзьями, плюс ко всему на фоне играет ураганный и драйвовый саундтрек. Несомненно, к игре можно придраться, например, здесь довольно устаревшая графика (даже для 2009 далеко не передовая), но вообще не хочется этого делать. Игра великолепно справляется со своей задачей - она веселит. Да и контента в игре очень много (несколько игровых режимов, куча карт, очень много оружия), благо разработчики на протяжении почти 6 лет игру периодически обновляли и добавляли много всяких интересностей.\n9\\10","timestamp_created":1450904918,"timestamp_updated":1450904918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572448849678039551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19883103","author":{"steamid":"76561198115089788","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":25017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6198,"last_played":1647925824},"language":"english","review":"this game is amazing but how do you get the holiday events to work like chrismas zombies.Please help me","timestamp_created":1450897210,"timestamp_updated":1450897210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19876131","author":{"steamid":"76561198238489164","num_games_owned":818,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":10748,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54,"last_played":1611251284},"language":"brazilian","review":"ihi","timestamp_created":1450883694,"timestamp_updated":1450883694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19874876","author":{"steamid":"76561198143584622","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2413,"last_played":1609359369},"language":"russian","review":"Эта игра иделаьна.

Eventually shit happens and the zombie like clones invade merry old England.\n\nGameplay:\n\nYou have to kill waves of enemies. At the end of each wave you can use money you collect from the zed's bounties and the round survival bonus to purchase better guns. armor, nades, ammo and more. You will need it because this game gets more hectic as the waves progress. \n\nYou have six different classes to pick from: Medic, Berserker, Sharpshooter, Commando, Demolitions, and Firebug. I have only tried 4 of these. The Medic class improves your medic gun recharge rate (you can heal others and yourself faster). It also allows you to carry a Medic gun which allows you to kill zeds and with the alt fire heal your teammates. The Sharpshooter increases the dmg per shot, lowers recoil. It can get so powerful that you can headshot scrakes and husks and (with the crossbow) fleshpounds. The commando is the assault rifle class. Commando also lets you see invisible enemies like Stalkers and the patriarch from far away. With different classes you can play however you feel like playing. Each class also has a level up feature.\n\nThere are many different types of enemies. Clots and Gorefeasts are your basic walk up and hurt you enemies. Crawlers and Stalkers are fast. Bloats are slow but can vomit corrosive acid on you. Sirens and Husks can hurt you from far away. Scrakes and Fleshpounds do massive melee damage and rush you. The Patriarch is the final boss of each game. He has a melee attack, a chaingun, and a nade launcher. He can turn invisible and heal himself. He also talks and some of the things he says are funny.\n\nI didn't like this game at first because it is difficult starting out. With low level perks if you join mid game you really have to rely on the money of others to survive. Joining a game and then dying the round you join in is so disheartening. But if you keep at it you will have fun with this game.","timestamp_created":1450589907,"timestamp_updated":1450589907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19795437","author":{"steamid":"76561198132631058","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":739,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":723,"last_played":1486454581},"language":"koreana","review":"2보다는 이쪽이 사양이 낮아서 좋아","timestamp_created":1450580322,"timestamp_updated":1450580322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19793103","author":{"steamid":"76561198197776803","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1114,"last_played":1492864054},"language":"english","review":"A fun and kinda scary game.\nThis is my version on how the game basically works\n\n1.You kill whatever those creatures are.\n2.Earn money to buy guns\n3.Kill more creatures\n4. a) You probably got lost in the map and cant find your team mates and struggle to keep yourself alive\n    b) You stick with your team mates and then die from something\n5.
