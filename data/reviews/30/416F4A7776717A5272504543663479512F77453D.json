It has a perfect balance between tactics, teamplay and all out shooting.\n\nThis game is straight forward and is an excellent online FPS game.\nThe player control of the models and guns is tight - extremely tight. It feels seamless between one's choice of movement and the actual gameplay. In this sense you feel in complete control, and thus the behaviour of your players feels like a true extention of oneself.\nThe game lends itself well to teamplay with excellent voice over microphone. The sound in the game is very good, and listening is a critical part of playing well.\n\nThe Day of Defeat community is extensive and skilled and has produced an enormous amount of modified material. There are tons and tons of player that created custom maps which are equal in quality to the core of 20 stock maps which come with the game.\n\nEven though this game came out a long time ago, there's still a lot of active servers worldwide.The skill level of the player base is fairly high, but DoD players are usually well-helpful to new players.\nIf you like running and gunning in a WW2 environment, you gotta give this game a try. You can also play it offline by installing free bots to learn with.","timestamp_created":1592019846,"timestamp_updated":1592019846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.611536204814910889","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70698697","author":{"steamid":"76561198870239358","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1642107947},"language":"english","review":"Day of Defeat?

It's sort of sad because it has better mechanics than counter-strike, but was always CS's red headed step child. Capturing flags, fragging noobs and stomping on bads was the name of the game. Day of Defeat had a tremendous competitive group of people and culture. we attended major and global LAN tournaments for tens of thousands of dollars and talked so much ♥♥♥♥ online you can still hear the echo's of uBad's, KTE's and lolumad's to this day. Day of defeat represented a golden age for competitive online league play. When the unforgivable act that was Day of Defeat:Source came out and destroyed competitive games forever by being so atrocious, it destroyed our beautiful and pure game, that there was never a Day of Defeat: GO as an appology should never go unforgiven. DOD 1.3 is the best competitive game in the history of esports, long forgotten to the likes of realism nerds, over controlling server admins and bad decisions by valve. May the DOD Help Dog never be forgotten, May your k98 be ever accurate and one shot kill, may you prone in corners your enemies will never see.

Somit ist der Kern des Spiels eine damals herausragende Engine, die sowohl grafisch als auch mechanisch neue Maßstäbe setzte.\n\nWir sind im Zweiten Weltkrieg und spielen entweder auf Seiten der Alliierten oder der Achsenmächte. Wir suchen uns eine Klasse aus - vom normalen Infanteristen über den MG Schützen bis zum Scharfschützen und Kommandanten ist alles notwendige vorhanden - und kämpfen auf verschiedenen Maps darum, die Oberhand zu gewinnen und Flaggen einzunehmen. \n\nDas Spiel ist direkt, schnörkellos und relativ schnell. Dennoch sind gute Kartenkenntnis und ein gemeinsames Vorgehen hilfreich für eine erfolgreiche Partie. Sicher ist es aber kein Hardcore-Shooter. Es geht weniger um Realismus als um das kompetetive Spielerlebnis. Und das kann der Shooter auch heute immer noch vermitteln. Es gibt auch noch Server, die besucht werden. So findet man - zumindest zu den üblichen Spielzeiten - eigentlich immer eine Partie. \n\nDie Grafik ist natürlich nicht mehr aktuell, aber sie funktioniert noch erstaunlich gut. Ebenso ist der Sound nach wie vor gut und auf Zweckmäßigkeit ausgelegt. Alles was wir hören, gibt uns sinnvolle Informationen über die Bewegungen der Mitspieler. Eine Partie \"Day of Defeat\" macht einfach Spaß und mir - das ist sicher Geschmackssache - auch mehr Spaß als \"Counter Strike\" und sicher mehr als eine Partie eines modernen \"Battlefield\" oder \"Call of Duty\". Denn bei \"Day of Defeat\" kommt es primär wirklich noch auf Skill an. Jede Klasse ist sinnvoll und hat ihre Stärken und Schwächen. Und auch als Neuling hat man dasselbe Equipment wie die Veteranen. \n\n[h1]Wertung:[/h1]\n8/10 Atmosphäre\n-/10 Story\n7/10 Grafik\n7/10 Sound\n8/10 Spielmechanik\n8/10 Balancing\n7/10 Spielspass\n\n[h1]Fazit:[/h1]\nOld-School Spielspaß.\n\n[h1][b]7/10 Gesamtwertung","timestamp_created":1589648921,"timestamp_updated":1589648921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653885126113891602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69230195","author":{"steamid":"76561198101213667","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1281,"last_played":1612041346},"language":"swedish","review":"classic fun","timestamp_created":1589627924,"timestamp_updated":1589627924,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69189809","author":{"steamid":"76561198046420493","num_games_owned":299,"num_reviews":103,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1593640399},"language":"english","review":"This game still has people playing it, and there is a bot mod that fills up the server making it incredibly fun to play!","timestamp_created":1589566786,"timestamp_updated":1589566786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69178431","author":{"steamid":"76561198313992148","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1527,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1424,"last_played":1629999169},"language":"english","review":"if you thought team fortress was valves forgotten franchise youve got another thing coming.\nthis game has a playerbase so small that i knew everyone in less than a week. get this game!","timestamp_created":1589552811,"timestamp_updated":1589552811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69045010","author":{"steamid":"76561198329170534","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":122,"playtime_forever":61,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61,"last_played":1503228690},"language":"english","review":"I had more fun with this version that DOD2 so thats cool.","timestamp_created":1589341163,"timestamp_updated":1589341163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68961558","author":{"steamid":"76561199010400564","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":13310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2108,"last_played":1656985310},"language":"schinese","review":"经典游戏补票","timestamp_created":1589211029,"timestamp_updated":1589211029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68922281","author":{"steamid":"76561198926994977","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1589223178},"language":"turkish","review":"arkadaşlarınızla ve serverlarda admların önce sülasinden sövmeye başlayarak alabilirsiniz silahlar sekiyor (otomatik olanlar) indirimde alın 1 tl bişi zaten","timestamp_created":1589142646,"timestamp_updated":1589142646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68866895","author":{"steamid":"76561198976869609","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":120,"last_played":1631719401},"language":"russian","review":"Игра жива, это очень меня радует, можно даже наткнуться на русские сервера, в общем, для тех кто не знает ничего об игре- это некий team fortress в стилистике 2-й Мировой Войны.

yes i would i played it for 3 hours and i actually had tons of fun sure i only played against AI which means i either destroyed them or got destroyed (like i said before the AI either gets stuck on doors or it reads your mind knowing where you will be coming from and what you will be doing before you actually do it) and i couldnt play with any people which again sucks but hey playing with the AI isnt that bad if you want a cheap realistic WW2 game then you should buy this game when its on sale you can even gift it to your friends so you and your friends can play together","timestamp_created":1587727449,"timestamp_updated":1587727449,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67922675","author":{"steamid":"76561198042158596","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":111,"playtime_forever":32,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1516102110},"language":"russian","review":"типа Батлфилд на движке кс 1.6, прикольно","timestamp_created":1587719513,"timestamp_updated":1587719513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67908533","author":{"steamid":"76561198104198503","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":430,"last_played":1590730552},"language":"english","review":"oneof the best games try it out even though its old\n","timestamp_created":1587696137,"timestamp_updated":1587696137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67890696","author":{"steamid":"76561198434443963","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3316,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2898,"last_played":1655210021},"language":"turkish","review":"OYUN ESKİ AMA GÜZEL","timestamp_created":1587668173,"timestamp_updated":1587668173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67814552","author":{"steamid":"76561198399990321","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":561,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1647278855},"language":"english","review":"Good Game! ;)","timestamp_created":1587558727,"timestamp_updated":1587558727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67740485","author":{"steamid":"76561198139527915","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":108,"playtime_forever":277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1589250371},"language":"english","review":"yeah its kinda fun","timestamp_created":1587452999,"timestamp_updated":1587452999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67736804","author":{"steamid":"76561198122982708","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5769,"last_played":1587579700},"language":"english","review":"old school gaming feel good graphics mostlt friendly people\n","timestamp_created":1587446184,"timestamp_updated":1587446184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67672355","author":{"steamid":"76561198397883506","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1017,"last_played":1594204756},"language":"swedish","review":"bra skjutar spel","timestamp_created":1587368863,"timestamp_updated":1587368863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67638870","author":{"steamid":"76561198132590018","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":224,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19,"last_played":1648400402},"language":"spanish","review":"Me encanta el juego, pero no se que pasa en mi pc que no me deja girar el raton de izquierda a derecha ni de arriba a abajo, alguien me puede ayudar?
