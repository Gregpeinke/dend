É um bicho bem chato que apela pra ficar summonando soldado. E ainda por cima você deve enfrenta-lo 3 vezes sendo a alteração mais notável o cenário. Talvez seja cholo meu, mas eu não curto esse.\n\nEm relação às dlcs eu gostei delas.\nO Confronto Nas Nuvens é um tanto divertido, mas você pode se estressar com os desafios de mérito já que quando você falha um você tem que iniciar todo o conjunto de ondas (há 4 de 15 ondas) só pra poder tentar de novo, e considerando que o desafio ridículo de finalizar dois Handymans enquanto eles estão distraídos com seu chamariz (não é muito difícil de errar o timing) isso pode ser um grande problema.\nO Burial At Sea me decepcionou por não possuir plasmídeos de verdade.

Though to be fair to him, the general reception to Bioshock 2 goes a long way towards proving him right.\n\nIt's hard to talk about Bioshock Infinite without writing the equivalent of a graduate dissertation on it or oversimplifying it in a way that feels completely disingenuous. This game's story is so convoluted that organizing my thoughts and feelings on it in a comprehensible way is difficult, and I'm starting to believe that was an intentional effect. There's no easy way to structure a review or analysis of a piece of media with a story this needlessly complex, so I'm not going to structure it. I'm going to shit my thoughts and ideas out into cyberspace and hope for the best. Just like my four favorite storytellers; George Lucas, M. Night Shyamalan, Hideo Kojima, and Ken Levine.\n\nCombat in Bioshock Infinite is at best a sidegrade on Bioshock 2. It's definitely better than Bioshock 1's combat, but by no means is it any better than 2's. Infinite adopted the many improvements 2 made on 1's combat but contributed nothing interesting of it's own. I think another big part of why Infinite's gameplay doesn't feel any better than 2's is because of just how different the weapons are from the previous two games. And the worst part about the change is how forgettable Infinite's weapons are as a result. Combat in 1 definitely has some problems but I fucking remember all of it's weapons. Even if they weren't all great they were at least visually satisfying. Some developers still don't understand that it's okay to make the combat in their single player game unbalanced in favor of the player so long as it's really fun. Irrational did that on accident in Bioshock 1 but didn't in Infinite. It's possible for developers to take balance a little too far, and Infinite's combat is so over tuned that it often feels like a chore.\n\nColumbia as a setting isn't as good as Rapture. Rapture has that quality of almost feeling like it's in the realm of possibility, and it makes all the difference. In reality it would probably be easier to build a city on the moon than it would be to build one at the bottom of the ocean, but Rapture has enough science behind it to make it feel like a place that could exist. We could send submersibles to the bottom of the ocean in 1959, it's not a gigantic stretch of the imagination for a city to exist down there. Columbia is an entire flying city that exists nine years after flight was discovered. I know that for some people this seems like a silly thing to complain about, but believability is an important part of immersion and immersion is a major reason why Bioshock 1 is celebrated. \n\nWhy did they make the Vox Populi seem like communists but then refuse to fully commit to that idea? The color of their political movement is red and they talk vaguely about overthrowing the rich who've oppressed them but that's about it. Why don't they ever talk about seizing the means of production? Or any of that other crap economic determinists love to use as an excuse for starving people to death? The most you hear about the class system of Columbia is a few lines about how evil the money men are and some muttering about destroying the factories. Why would you invoke the signs of that ideology in such a toothless and unsatisfactory way, Ken?\n\nYou can't use racism as a story element but then decide to not accurately depict just how truly fucking terrible it was during that era. Show all of it or none of it at all. You're doing a major disservice to the real life people who were forced to live through it by pulling your punches here. It also makes your story seem brittle and feckless to the audience. Americans are aware of racism and it's obvious to us when a depiction of historical racism is leaving out the worst parts of it.\n\nBioshock Infinite feels much more linear than the previous two games. Obviously all three of the Bioshock games are linear, but Infinite really feels like it. The problem here is player choice, or rather, the severely reduced amount of player choice. In Bioshock 1 and 2 the player has choices to make. Where to go in a level first, how to deal with the sisters, when to harvest them, how to ambush the big daddies etc. Those kinds of choices may not seem like a big deal, but when the player has literally zero meaningful choices to make the result is a game that feels exactly as linear as it really is. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to see why not having choices is fun, but as far as I'm concerned the illusion of choice is a shitty waste of the player's time. It's a shallow and lazy attempt at giving the player a false sense of agency over the story. Elizabeth giving you a bunch of excuses for why you don't have choice just makes it more infuriating.\n\nI hate songbird so much. Don't fucking tempt me with a potentially awesome boss fight and then refuse to give it to me. It's the video game equivalent of blue balls. What's even worse is how Ken uses songbird as his handy dandy improbable story device. The fucking thing always shows up at the perfect moment. FUCK JESUS fucking CHRISTS smelly COCK shit with the goddamn POPe tagteaming a fucking DEAD BELUGA WHALE in it's gigantic rancid ASSHOLE and BLOWHOLE I fucking hate songbird. Ken Levine is a fucking HACK.\n\nBooker being Comstock is not an interesting twist. He's also annoying as fuck. The story and characters in 1 are bad but at least Jack was mercifully silent, even if it was for no good reason. And Delta is a big daddy so he literally can't speak. Can you imagine what those games would be like if either of those characters were talking to themselves all the time about what's happening and what they need to do? \n\n[i]Holy shit, my dad is Andrew Ryan?! And I've been under hypnotic compulsion this whole time?! No way!!! I have to escape!\n\nMy daughter is going to get turned into a container for the tang from Neon Genesis Evangelion?! Shit! I have to get to her as soon as possible and get us both out of Rapture!\n\n\nWait a minute, that card...[/i]\n\n\nFuck it, time to wrap it up. I'm tired of spending mental energy on this.\n\nI don't know whether to recommend this game or not. The main reason why I don't like it is the story, but I'm very aware of the fact that most gamers seemed to like it explicitly for the story. I think the main reason for that is they see the story in video games as fluff and really only care about the gameplay and visuals. That, or they're simply blinded by love. Don't misinterpret what I'm saying, I'm not saying everyone who likes the story of Infinite is stupid, I'm saying that the people who like Infinite, whatever their reasons for liking it may be, are a little too willing to overlook the problems with the story. Or maybe they just don't care enough about video game stories to bother with thinking about them beyond the surface level. I'm not leveling a value judgment at those kinds of people either, that way of enjoying games is perfectly valid as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI've said it before and I'll keep saying it until game developers start taking it to heart; if your game has a story there is no reason not to make it a good one. Bioshock Infinite's story is weak, toothless, needlessly complex, desperate, contrived, melodramatic, and boring. So I guess for the zero people in the world who care about story in video games but haven't played Bioshock Infinite yet, I wouldn't recommend it to you. For everyone else, that is, the gamers, this game is perfect for you.","timestamp_created":1631922296,"timestamp_updated":1653067944,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99526225","author":{"steamid":"76561198021996279","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":147,"playtime_forever":79,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":79,"last_played":1631918545},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bom","timestamp_created":1631918931,"timestamp_updated":1631918931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99526131","author":{"steamid":"76561198281797910","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1290,"last_played":1631917147},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏剧情内容经不起推敲.明显就莫名其妙的漏洞。游戏中端感觉就是纯粹为了迎合title而不断穿越。作为一个没接触过系列的玩家。整个通关游玩过程，吸引我的只有游戏开头和结尾。[strike] 还有科学家兄妹的对口相声 [/strike]。关卡设计也不是很好.探索区域是半开放式的那种。这游戏差不多也就值打折期的40块钱...算是中规中矩吧。\n游戏中的时间旅行，或者叫时间跳跃.不同世界线这个概念.区别于其他游戏或者书中的设定.dlc1中甚至去到了男女主角从未存在过的50年后","timestamp_created":1631918773,"timestamp_updated":1631918773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99525129","author":{"steamid":"76561197999232155","num_games_owned":480,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":600,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":479,"last_played":1633552809},"language":"english","review":"I'm writing this review from a standpoint of having played the original System Shock and BioShock games, the game strips out many mechanics which helped it stand out from more modern shooters.\n\nI'll give a list of my thoughts of what I feel has been set back in the base game at the very least:\n\n- Lack of self-dependence. In previous game entries the game design allowed the player to store necessary items to allow the player to decide when to use them as they were not frequently found. In Bioshock 1 and 2 we could see stripped back inventory but it still at minimum allowed many weapons and access to multiple hypos to use on a whim. In Bioshock Infinite this system is entirely gone making it entirely up to enemy corpses, container loot, and Elizabeth to keep the player alive which can get pretty extreme with weapons that have arguably less damage per second than others later in the game. This can also can be pace breaking since you break combat to receive a piece of loot from Elizabeth at seemingly crucial points where you stand still staring at Elizabeth completely invulnerable to everything around you while you receive whatever it was that was given to you for like 3 whole seconds.\n\n- Lack of ammunition options means tanky enemies will be very bullet spongy and leaves limited solutions to tackle difficult encounters, using Telekenisis in Bioshock to levitate explosives was a pretty neat option that could have seen additional potential in future titles, placing trap bolts (or trap rivets) to prepare for incoming enemies, using shotgun ammo to quickly take advantage of hazards, or just straight up using armor pierce if nothing else was a nice change of pace compared to that typical problems. Bioshock infinite removes all this and leaves any sort of opportunities like that entirely up to Elizabeth's reality tearing mechanics and vigors ONLY (and with only specific vigors like Shock Jockey or Devil's Mark), meaning if you're missing one of those there is no way to deal with a tough enemy encounter in a satisfying manner. You will pray that you can take advantage of a medkit tear or tear that distracts enemies briefly.\n\n- Too much open space with hitscan attacks. this at times can make it incredibly annoying to see what you're dealing with in a large amount of arenas you end up in with too much open space, the sky rail system suffers from this problem since enemies are incredibly accurate no matter how fast you are moving even if conditions appear somewhat favorable. You can be on a sky rail and keep grunting in pain from damage not knowing what it was that attacked you unless you're able to see how much your shield / health drained from the top of the screen.\n\n- Vigors, while implemented pretty well into the game. They rarely can be used because of the above mentioned lack of independence on the player making it seem like quite a missed opportunity to make it a focus of combat to help this game stand out.\n\nAs a result I cannot recommend the game, it has the title of what has been a decent game series but ultimately strips it's recognition away and seems more of a typical shooter with gimmicks applied on rather than the opposite where the additional features lent itself well to the gameplay. I cannot speak for the DLCs as of writing and I will write reviews for them seperately in time. I recommend checking out System Shock 2 or any of the BioShock titles other than this game as I have played them all and thoroughly enjoyed them myself, so steer clear of this game if it's your first time to the series.","timestamp_created":1631917032,"timestamp_updated":1631917331,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509767115116119385","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99522963","author":{"steamid":"76561198067965729","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1192,"last_played":1631910983},"language":"english","review":"The gameplay is the story and the story is the gameplay.
