It's a fun adventure about Gordon Freeman told trough his eyes and the horrible events that took place at Black Mesa research facility. It has flaws that have not aged well. The movement is very loose and sensitive, it has some trial and error aspects that take you out of the experience a lot. As for horror it has it's moments but I would not consider it a horror game. The atmosphere is amazing and adds to the horror. My favorite part is the start area of the game because of the atmosphere. Overall I recommend at least one play trough of Half Life. You won't regret it because it's a classic and fun gaming

I had little indication, other than NPCs, to give me some sort of meaning and goal in this game. Working with the NPCs, half of the time, resulted in me herding the AI like cattle to their proper position. I appreciated how the enemies had variety; this really added to the sense of feeling alone as Freeman. The ending is very underwhelming, considering that the devs had to rush the last few levels out.
