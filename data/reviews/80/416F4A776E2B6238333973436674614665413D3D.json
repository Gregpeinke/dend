There's also something very charming about late 90s and early 2000s game graphics that makes the game enjoyable. In the singleplayer mode, you lead your own counter-terrorism team, which is great, even if you enjoy playing on the side of the terrorists. The teammates will have three attributes: Skill, Co-op, and Bravery. I don't know what these do, so you'll have to put up with my thoughts. Skill determines tactics, Co-op determines how likely they will respond to and obey commands, and Bravery determines if they camp or face the enemy head-on. I haven't played multiplayer yet, but if you suck at multiplayer (I know I do), then this game is for you. Even if you enjoy multiplayer, I still highly recommend this game and that you play it's singleplayer.","timestamp_created":1496699447,"timestamp_updated":1496699447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32203111","author":{"steamid":"76561198272644973","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":32,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1612027219},"language":"swedish","review":"dåligt jävla spel det suger funkar fan inte","timestamp_created":1496680332,"timestamp_updated":1496758627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32186754","author":{"steamid":"76561197992740167","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":301,"last_played":1496603197},"language":"french","review":"super mode solo et tout un multiplayer.","timestamp_created":1496616157,"timestamp_updated":1496616157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32161960","author":{"steamid":"76561198143352177","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1496525770},"language":"portuguese","review":"real game","timestamp_created":1496525787,"timestamp_updated":1496525787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32145986","author":{"steamid":"76561197988648056","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":14,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1483973140},"language":"russian","review":"Я хз зачем я ее купил.\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1496473639,"timestamp_updated":1496473639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32134194","author":{"steamid":"76561198136006392","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":42,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":42,"last_played":1496576674},"language":"english","review":"Not so good :/","timestamp_created":1496425059,"timestamp_updated":1496425059,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495591163635253906","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32131501","author":{"steamid":"76561198392166288","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":22,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1496512462},"language":"russian","review":"Круто.

Die Grafik ist ein wenig besser, es gibt neue Maps und Charaktermodels (jemals eins für T und AT) und man kann jetzt kleinere Singleplayer-Mission absolvieren, die aber nie komplexer sind als \"töte 3 Gegner mit Waffe XY\" oder \"gewinne eine Runde in 60 Sekunden\". Wer CS 1.6 schon besitzt braucht diese Version ganz sicher nicht.\n\nAllerdings kommt dieses Spiel noch mit einer Dreingabe: Counter Strike Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes. Dabei handelt sich um eine komplette Singleplayer-Kampagne mit dem typischen CS-Gameplay. Blöd nur, dass die Qualität der Level  ziemlich schwankt, die Synchro FURCHTBAR ist und das ganze Spiel extrem von Bugs durchzogen ist. Hier zwei Beispiele: Direkt in der ersten Mission gibt es eine Stelle wo ein Soldat einem eine Türe aufmachen soll und den Rest des Levels begleitet. Wenn man Pech hat, bleibt er allerdings mitten in der Tür stehen und man kommt nicht durch! Wenn man ihn erschießt, hat man die Mission verloren und selbst wenn den Abschnitt neustartet, bleibt der da immer noch stehen. Einzige Möglichkeit: die komplette Mission nochmal machen.\n\nHier sogar noch ein krasserer Bug: Ich bin an einer Stelle gestorben und ratet mal wo ich respawnt bin? In HALF-LIFE. Ja, richtig gelesen, ich war plötzlich in einem ganz anderen Spiel (Wer mir nicht glaubt, ich habe einen Screeshot davon gemacht)!!!! Ok, ich verstehe ja warum das passiert ist. CS ist nunmal eine HL-Mod und wenn man sich CS runterlädt, lädt man sich die HL-Ordner auch automatisch runter. Aber einfach mal in ein ganz anderes Spiel geschmissen zu werden, grenzt ja mal wohl an einer Frechheit und ist ein Bug von einer Magnitude, wie ich es vorher noch nie gesehen hab.\n\nFazit: CS 1.6 + Mittelmäßiger Kampagne mit schlimmer Synchro und den krassesten Bug aller Zeiten. Nicht empfehlenswert.","timestamp_created":1495732266,"timestamp_updated":1495732454,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530148804187774658","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31953145","author":{"steamid":"76561198067567275","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":92,"playtime_forever":78,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":78,"last_played":1489791120},"language":"english","review":"My

Condition Zero ist der Nachfolger des ersten CS und war das erste richtige Spiel der Reihe, keine Modifikation für Half Life 1. Wobei es weiterhin auf HL1 basiert. Als Spiel für LAN oder Online hat es sich nie durchgesetzt, CS (in der finalen Version 1.6) blieb dominierend und wurde erst später durch CS Source abgelöst. Die inhaltlichen Änderungen zwischen CS und CS:CZ waren zu gering um den Kaufpreis zu lohnen. Interessant an dem Spiel war und ist vor allem der Einzelspielermodus. Der ermöglicht es die aus CS bekannten Karten mit Bots zu spielen und so die Karten kennen zu lernen und quasi für CS 1.6 zu trainieren. Dafür ist das auch immer noch witzig, die altbekannten Karten mal wieder gezielt in Ruhe bespielen.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j7kfk85Llw","timestamp_created":1494448795,"timestamp_updated":1494448795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519047379493713379","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31667850","author":{"steamid":"76561198273675452","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":38,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1558889262},"language":"polish","review":"Powiem ze tak średnio mi sie podoba to jest takie rozmaicenie Cs 1.6 ;/","timestamp_created":1494432344,"timestamp_updated":1494432344,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31659124","author":{"steamid":"76561198052631357","num_games_owned":678,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":452,"last_played":1578547143},"language":"german","review":"mod kevlar fehlt.","timestamp_created":1494390443,"timestamp_updated":1494390443,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31649029","author":{"steamid":"76561198285779542","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1581054767},"language":"russian","review":"Заебись чётко !
