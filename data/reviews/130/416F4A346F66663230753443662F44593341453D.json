If you played Half Life: Opposing Force, you know it gave us new weapons, gameplay elements, story, and lore. Now with Half Life: Blue shift, you get to see the events of Half Life from a new perspective; through one of the security guards Barney Calhoun. This time, with less variety of weapons, shorter story, simpler puzzles, Blue Shift isn't really as big of a banger than the original Half Life, nor Opposing Force. But still, it introduced us to a new character, Barney Calhoun who will be a reoccuring character in future Half Life titles.\n\nThanks to Blue Shift and Opposing Force, Gearbox Software got kickstarted to bring us good quality games, however only a few games such as the Borderlands series is magnificent. Thanks to Valve, they are going to bring back Half Life with Half Life: Alyx. It's not what the fans asked for, we wanted Half Life 3, but we will take it. Finally after 12 years, Valve is back to working on Half Life.\n\n\nEdit 18/05/2020\nValve released Half-Life:Alyx, if Half-Life 3 were to ever be released, Valve stated themselves they want it to revolutionize the video game industry so we all have to be patient.","timestamp_created":1575210916,"timestamp_updated":1589834433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533073961734771729","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58894699","author":{"steamid":"76561198976791301","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1575225165},"language":"russian","review":"Э  ежжи где пива?","timestamp_created":1575205883,"timestamp_updated":1575205883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58892782","author":{"steamid":"76561198109574775","num_games_owned":387,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":355,"last_played":1575210140},"language":"english","review":"I would've recommended it at first.

It's a great game, but it's just a SHORT expansion pack. Don't expect it to be what it isn't. This isn't Half-Life 2, it is Half-Life: Blue Shift ... a short little expansion that gives you another several hours of the Half-Life universe to enjoy through the eyes of a different character.

A short game that has the player in the perspective of a security guard working in Black Mesa during the resonance cascade event. That security guard would later play a crucial role in Half Life 2, whilst (almost) all of the characters featured in the game will see not seen in future titles in the series. \n\nThe game has you fighting against the some usual sets of enemies from Half Life, but since the game is much shorter than its predecessors, you don't fight as many and some only a little bit (see tank, Xen related bad guys etc.). Most of which are HECU marines, some basic aliens along with headcrabs. You also don't get all of the weapons featured from Half LIfe, such as the experimental/prototype weapons. \n\nPuzzles are rather basic at times and you might get lost or confused at some levels with varying pathways (which are no more difficult than any other levels from Half Life). Storyline is basic and you later have to commit to starting some machines by manual operating some valves and levers and pressing some buttons here and there to progress the plot. What's interesting is that some of the plotpoints of the final missions will be very familiar to keen Half Life 2 fans-no spoilers here!\n\nWhile this game is short and rather lacking compared to the original Half Life title and Opposing Force sequel, it's still got some fun to it if you enjoy rummaging through Black Mesa. Just don't expect a game of high stature or much replay-ability.\n\nI suggest getting this game on sale if you haven't got it bundled with other Half Life games. Despite its rave reviews, its a few hours long at most and feels more like a mod rather than a stand alone title. \n\nThat being said, its a game if you enjoy the Half Life franchise and you have a couple hours to waste-\n\nI recommend.","timestamp_created":1574740671,"timestamp_updated":1574740671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.679768800735473633","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4off20u4Cf/DY3AE="}
