Os jogadores podem assumir dois exércitos diferentes: os americanos e os alemães. Dentro de cada time, é preciso escolher a classe, entre seis: Rifleman, Assault, Support, Sniper, Machine Gunner e Rocket, cada um com um arsenal exclusivo. As partidas são divididas basicamente em dois objetivos (de acordo com o mapa), que são a dominação de pontos estratégicos como praças e igrejas (sendo que alguns requerem a presença de dois membros do time) ou a destruição de tanques e armas antiaéreas.\n\nIsso faz com que o jogo ganhe um grande apelo estratégico, quase que forçando os times a trabalhar em equipe e usar o microfone com grande freqüência para planejar ataques combinados. Os mapas são grandes, com diversos caminhos e detalhes, que fazem a diferença na hora de tomar e defender os territórios. Em DoD:S, um time com organização e trabalho em equipe garante facilmente a vitória. \n\nQuando Day of Defeat: Source foi lançado, muitos não demoraram a reclamar a respeito da falta de conteúdo, com muita razão, é claro. Mas alguns anos depois (o jogo foi lançado em 2005), a Valve corrigiu esse erro adicionando vários mapas oficiais, além da possibilidade dos servidores rodarem mapas personalizados. Mesmo sendo um jogo antigo, o tempo foi piedoso com ele, que ainda é capaz de impressionar pela simplicidade dos cenários e pela boa iluminação. As texturas são bem nítidas e a água tem uma qualidade muito boa com reflexos e a simulação do efeito da difração.\n\nSendo essencialmente um jogo focado no trabalho em equipe, Day of Defeat pode decepcionar um pouco quando jogado com um número pequeno de pessoas. É bem menos divertido, e como o jogo tem poucos servidores localizados no Brasil - e os que têm jogadores costumam ficar lotados - vale mais a pena tentar jogar servidores estrangeiros, mesmo que enfrente algum lag.","timestamp_created":1458296910,"timestamp_updated":1517316189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60120844841003418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21897217","author":{"steamid":"76561198139906685","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2420,"last_played":1523526819},"language":"english","review":"Fun as for sniping :P","timestamp_created":1458272840,"timestamp_updated":1458272840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518348574638366699","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21889682","author":{"steamid":"76561198020031991","num_games_owned":276,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":5761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5685,"last_played":1458235413},"language":"czech","review":"Dokonalá multiplayerová strieľačka zasadená do prostredia druhej svetovej vojny.

Разработчик - всеми известная VALVE, которая выпустила эту игру в 2005 г. на движке Sourse. По своей сути DoD - это та же CS, только на тематику Второй Мировой Войны. На выбор нам дается две стороны: вермахт и союзники. Каждая сторона разделена на 6 классов, каждый из которых имеет свою экипировку, достоинства и недостатки. Задачи перед вами будут стоять разные, в зависимости от карты. Это либо типичный захват точек, либо уничтожение/защита объектов. Так чем меня зацепила на столько простая игра? Так простотой и зацепила! Любителям Battlefield 3 и отличного графона тут не место!
