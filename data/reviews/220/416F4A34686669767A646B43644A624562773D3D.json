Яичные желтки и половину сахара поместить в миску, вилкой растереть до появления белой пены. Белки взбить в миксере в пену, постепенно прибавить к ним вторую половину сахара, продолжая взбивать. В результате должна получиться устойчивая белая масса, которую следует аккуратно вылить в желтки, перемешивая ложкой сверху вниз. Муку смешать с крахмалом, просеять в яичную смесь, перемешивать тесто от краёв к центру, пока не разойдутся все комочки. Вылить тесто на противень, застеленный пергаментом и в течение 8-10 минут испечь корж при среднем жаре (170-180 градусов). \n2. Готовый корж снять с противня вместе с пергаментом, перевернуть его на чистый лист бумаги, посыпанный сахаром или сахарной пудрой, бумагу, на которой он выпекался, снять. Накрыть бисквит сбрызнутой водой салфеткой и дать ему остыть.\n3. Малину промыть (ели Вы используете замороженные ягоды – разморозить), положить ягоды в дуршлаг и подождать, пока с них стечёт лишняя жидкость. Немного ягод отложить в отдельную посуду, остальные размять вилкой. Сливки взбить в пену с сахарной пудрой, выложить их в малину, перемешать. \n4. Бисквит смазать ровным слоем начинки, свернуть рулетом и поместить швом вниз на поднос или блюдо. Посыпать изделие сахарной пудрой и украсить ягодами.

It still holds up in a number of ways but some aspects of it haven't aged so well.\n\nGraphics:\nActually not that bad for a more than 12 year old game, none of it looks painfully dated to me, but of course it fades in comparison with more recent titles.\n\nAudio design:\nVoice acting is competent, I wouldn't go further than that. With the exception of G-Man who sounds like a caricature of himself in this game. The sounds of guns make them feel kinda lame (along with the fact that most of them indeed ARE lame), which is a shame (no rhyme intended). The soundtrack doesn't feel very fitting to me in a number of places but it's used quite sparingly so it's not too bad.\n\nStory:\nWhile it is connected to HL1 via some references and familiar characters, I wouldn't really call it a SEQUEL in terms of story, it's more like a new story in the same universe. I never saw any implication of the dystopian reality of HL2 being a result of the Black Mesa incident. The buildup to the climax is actually fairly well done, the path from being an unarmed guy running for his life to starting a rebellion and taking down the corrupt dictator is nicely executed I'd say. There are also some twists which I won't go into detail about so as to minimise spoilers.\n\nGameplay:\n• Arguably THE biggest contribution this game brought to the genre is its physics engine, which allows for a number of puzzles (which are, however, often still hardcoded to an extent) as well as ways of using the environment to your advantage, especially after you've got the Gravity Gun. The downside to this is that in a number of places the game really, really wants to shout \"LOOK WE HAVE PHYSICS\" in your ear and it can get annoying when you see a door behind a pile of props for the XYZth time and think \"Yeah I get it, I have to punt these with the gravity gun until I can pass, could we just skip this part?\", but still, it's a nice addition and one of the things that still set this game apart from the vast majority of other FPS titles.\n• Most of the weapons feel really weak because most things are bulletspongy, and I hate bulletsponges. It's probably to incentivise creative use of the gravity gun, but you don't always get suitable props to use with it. Oh and you can't carry nearly enough ammo for the weapons that ARE worth using. I mean you can't even take down one gunship with full rocket launcher ammo so you need to rely on conveniently placed infinite ammo boxes. Why not just make the rocket launcher a mounted weapon if you can only really use it where the game wants you to?\n• Level design can be somewhat confusing occasionally but I always managed to find my way to the destination so it's not frustratingly convoluted. In fact it's fairly linear, it's just not always obvious where you're meant to go (and I'm not saying that's a bad thing, I hate when games hold your hand too firmly all the way through). There are also a number of \"secrets\" (which is a term I use loosely for things that you're likely to miss if you're only interested in getting through the level), some of which require a bit of puzzle-solving to get to. I like games that reward exploration.\n• Friendly NPCs (and antlions) can be extremely annoying because they are solid objects and love to get in the way.\n• The first driving portion can be frustrating as you're relentlessly getting attacked by a helicopter you can't destroy yet. This disincentivises exploration which is one of my favourite things in the game.\n\nSo yeah, while not as perfect as some people would have you believe, this game is definitely worth playing.","timestamp_created":1484517329,"timestamp_updated":1484517329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50134044885635376","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29283235","author":{"steamid":"76561198050605488","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":836,"last_played":1484509325},"language":"english","review":"First time playing, the graphics in this game are great especially considering it's age, I was very surpised it ran so well on my archaic laptop.

Оружие.\nКак и в предыдущих частях серии, меня выматывают все эти автоматы, которые наносят урон роя комаров. Ваншотят тут только револьвер, граната, арбалет и ракетница. Остальным хоть в самую макушку врагу стреляй - ему дофени.\n3. Концовка.\nКонцовка непонятная вообще. Какие такие рекомендации? О чем ты вообще, придурок в костюме? Очень надеюсь, что Episode One решит эту проблему.\n\nВ целом игра понравилась, много драйва и экшена.

Впервые взялся проходить её в 2005 году, и тогда это было для меня нечто, потому что я был знаком с первой частью игры и был в предкушении новой части. Недавно решил вспомнить былое и перепройти её ещё раз. И сейчас с уверенностью говорю что, игры того времени не могли даже рядом стоять с Half-life 2. [i]По графике, анимации и физике ей не было равных, а говоря про ИИ противников - для того времени это был топ. Прекрасное музыкальное сопровождение, волнующий и красочный сюжет и захватывающая дух атмосфера.[/i] Однозначно, игра заслуженно получила награду как [b]Лучшая игра десятилетия[/b] в 2012-м.\n-
