If you hate this game it means you are more modern and not really into technology from the past.\n\nAnyways this is my review of Team Fortress Classic :)\n","timestamp_created":1399240225,"timestamp_updated":1399240225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9991671","author":{"steamid":"76561198046751027","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":499,"last_played":1397056989},"language":"english","review":"bad version of tf2 that stupid elitists try to pretend is good","timestamp_created":1398972933,"timestamp_updated":1398972933,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.446936726570129395","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9967565","author":{"steamid":"76561198086128901","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":152,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":150,"last_played":1443341180},"language":"english","review":"fix the game for me cause i can't see anything in the main menu plz fix it","timestamp_created":1398740083,"timestamp_updated":1408169833,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9959739","author":{"steamid":"76561198134250620","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":244,"last_played":1471953981},"language":"russian","review":"рассмотрим плюсы и минусы\n\nплюсы\n-можно вспомнить детство \n-не надо заморачиваться с шапками и оружиями как в ТФ2 \n-много оружия\n-10 классов(именно 10, есть гражданский)\n-есть гранаты\n\nминусы\n\n-старая графика\n-быстрота действий\n\nпо моему игра очень классная. много в неё не посидишь, но поиграть стоит.","timestamp_created":1398670133,"timestamp_updated":1398670133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":81,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.673426330089569092","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9956866","author":{"steamid":"76561198122440191","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":17,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1419005657},"language":"english","review":"wwwtttttfffff what going on here","timestamp_created":1398637618,"timestamp_updated":1398637618,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474853634834289551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9933038","author":{"steamid":"76561198006033753","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":2497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2487,"last_played":1424924582},"language":"english","review":"Worth a play if you're big on TF2.

Actually this was before even hats existed, before it was even F2P. Hell, there was no custom weapons and only stock!
