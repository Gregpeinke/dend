Второй эпизод вышел в 2007 году и на данный момент является последней частью в серии.\n\nНачиная со второй части, игры серии Half-Life заканчивались на довольно остро-сюжетных моментах. Так случилось и в конце первого эпизода. Игра оставляла несколько не решенных событий, тем самым заставляя ждать следующий продукт Valve с нетерпением. Надо сказать, что второй эпизод не стал исключением и закончился на таком же остром, трогательном моменте. Так же сюжетно, игра постоянно держит в напряжении. А эффектное начало и трогательная концовка, заставляет по настоящему сопереживать.\n\nПо части геймплея игра во многом осталась такой же, как и предыдущие части. Перестрелки с солдатами Альянса, убийство зомби и мутантов, решение всяких простеньких задачек и езда на машине. По сравнению с тем же первым эпизодом, карты и локации стали куда больше и масштабнее. При этом появились большие, открытые локации в лесной и горной местности. Даже снова дадут покататся на машине, как это было во второй части, с багги. \n\nВ игре не появилось нового ожидаемого оружия. Разве что специальные бомбы для страйдеров, которые можно было использовать исключительно в последней схватке с ними. Да и врагов тоже новых не особо много. Среди Советника, Стража и Охотника, можно выделить лишь последнего. Который встречается не в одиночных эпизодах, а создавал проблемы на протяжении всей игры. Охотники чем то напоминают министрайдеров. Однако они более подвижны и быстры.\n\nПонравилась фишка с прикрывающей из снайперки Аликс, ещё со времён первого эпизода. И если в прошлом эпизоде, данная геймплейная фишка продолжалась не более 5 мин, где требовалось пройти одну улицу, то во втором, развитие этой идеи было на порядок выше и длилось дольше. Для этого был выделен целый, небольшой район, в котором затаившиеся зомби выходили из-за угла, в больших кол-вах и прикрытие снайпера было быолее чем уместно.\n\n[h1] Хорошая игра, однако эта часть не продолжала и не развивала идеи второго Half-Life. Практически всё осталось на том же уровне. Те же враги, то же оружие. Чем игра запомнилась, так это сюжетом, динамикой происходящих событий и трогательной концовкой.\nИ вот прошло уже почти 7 лет, а ни третьей части ни третьего эпизода нет. Ждём, надеемся, верим...\n\nОценка: 8/10 [/h1]","timestamp_created":1401432646,"timestamp_updated":1419160096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":142,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.822120845317840576","comment_count":15,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10260355","author":{"steamid":"76561197992766056","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":458,"last_played":1475853368},"language":"spanish","review":"Ya con ser un Half-Life es garantía de juegazo.

Во-первых, подкрученная графика, по сравнению с предыдущими шедеврами смотрится намного лучше, в данной серии игр графон абсолютно незначителен, но факт остается фактом, графика стала красивее, мелочь, а приятно. Во-вторых, Аликс, ох уж эта Аликс, лицо стало более проработанным, ее реакция на диалоги окружающих заставляет следить на мониторе лишь за ней. Касаемо разговоров, столько комментариев по ходу прохождения этого эпизода от нее прежде не слышал, например, когда она шутит аля: \"Гордон, может подвезешь?\" (или что-то в этом роде) когда садишься с ней в машину, нюанс, вроде этого, радует и погружает в игру все сильнее и сильнее. В-третьих, порадовали элементы открытого мира при перемещении на полуразваленном автомобиле, исследовании секретных мест с припасами, там же были неожиданные нападения со стороны комбайнов и охотников и, конечно же, битва при Белой Роще. В-четвертых, заметил, так сказать, зачатки некоего РэдФэкшена с разрушаемостью некоторых объектов, тоже +. \nВ заключении хотел бы сказать, что прошел оригинальную игру с дополнительными эпизодами в здравом уме лишь сейчас, когда она вышла, мне было лет 12 и тогда я ее оценивал скорее как бездумный шутер. Теперь заявляю, что это надо покупать, в это надо играть и играть в уже более зрелом возрасте, естественно, с обоими эпизодами.","timestamp_created":1400520942,"timestamp_updated":1400521067,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517597079277038574","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10151699","author":{"steamid":"76561198041157909","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1307430000},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1400356913,"timestamp_updated":1400356913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10150500","author":{"steamid":"76561198062974038","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":437,"last_played":1481432027},"language":"spanish","review":"esta muy bueno aunque no es el final de toda la saga esperemos que saquen la ultima parte :D","timestamp_created":1400349710,"timestamp_updated":1400349710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503100454807281494","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10137116","author":{"steamid":"76561197964510978","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":714,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":691,"last_played":1467504320},"language":"english","review":"It's half life.
