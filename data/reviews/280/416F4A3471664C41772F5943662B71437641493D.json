Evidently this resulting in a slightly better looking but completely broken game. \n\nNow I'm a big Half-Life fan, I make an effort to replay it at least once a year and I actually beat the normal Half-Life like 5 days ago and yet last night I beat Half-Life source in one sitting and you know what? I had an enjoyable time. \n\nThe gunplay, although very different from the original, is WAYY more fluid, and similar with that of Half-Life 2. The ragdoll physics of the enemies is also very satisfying and lead to a more responsive experience (although again, less authentic).\n\nOn top of that there are tons of small things that make the game much more graphically pleasing from the shininess of metals, the source water effects, and the dynamic lighting of the flashlight, it all looks very nice even if a bit out of place. \n\nIf you are wanting to experience Half-Life for the first time I beg you to just buy the original and play that first. If you aren't willing to play a game that old but still want a half-life experience, buy Black Mesa. If you're a Half Life fan that's looking for a refreshing way to experience the classic and don't care much about broken AI and funny glitches this should be an enjoyable experience.","timestamp_created":1609184823,"timestamp_updated":1609184823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83408911","author":{"steamid":"76561197960807022","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":993,"last_played":1609178691},"language":"polish","review":"Zbugowany ten source i niewiele wnoszący poza wodą i modelami broni w HD.","timestamp_created":1609179154,"timestamp_updated":1609179154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83398847","author":{"steamid":"76561197967480316","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":123,"playtime_forever":39,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1609170806},"language":"russian","review":"Half-life переделанный на движок Source.","timestamp_created":1609171036,"timestamp_updated":1609171036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83380210","author":{"steamid":"76561198978019408","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1712,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1074,"last_played":1643128589},"language":"english","review":"its good some glitches but its good and the ragdoll is hilarious","timestamp_created":1609154363,"timestamp_updated":1609154363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83375933","author":{"steamid":"76561198803552703","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":1238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":777,"last_played":1620412137},"language":"latam","review":"Tomate esta reseña simplemente como un \"Si\", haber el juego en si no es gran cosa lo unico que hizo valve es agarrar las fisicas, iluminacion, efectos y un par de cosas mas del motor Source y las mezclo con Half Life 1 por lo que los modelos y las texturas siguen siendo lo mismo.

I finished it recently and  i just...\n\nLook, i know that i'll get hated for this, but Half-Life just fails to deliver to that title of greatest game franchise ever made.\n\nThe pacing is absurdly slow, the enemy placement reeks of old games with inexperienced devs, the gunplay is just not enjoyable, and the game can be stupidly confusing sometimes about what you have to do. I had to start over in multiple chapters because some important NPC died before telling me what to do.\nThe maps are huge and yet so claustrophobic, which completely breaks the immersion. The world presented by the game just doesn't feel real, it just feels too much like a videogame, and ironically it's the opposite of what i've been told it is.\n\nHalf-life is old. If this review was a retrospective i'd give it a straight 10/10, but from a modern point of view, it just fails to deliver on several aspects.\nI don't know. maybe i'm just too young. I want to love this game, i really do, but it just isn't enjoyable for a modern player who didn't grow with it. I felt like i was experiencing a time capsule from an era that i'm glad is over.\n\nI will give HL1 ONE good point though, and it's that it just has this made by Valve feel to it that i really enjoy as a PC gamer. Appart from that, HL is just not good.\n\nTL:DR : Half Life 1 is an old game, in all the bad ways.","timestamp_created":1609009873,"timestamp_updated":1609009873,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83215685","author":{"steamid":"76561198038865361","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1478,"last_played":1610678732},"language":"english","review":"Classic FPS, ask your father why this game is great.","timestamp_created":1609001561,"timestamp_updated":1609001561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83214634","author":{"steamid":"76561197997095067","num_games_owned":380,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":326,"last_played":1609000404},"language":"english","review":"Sadly this is a buggy throwaway project from Valve.

So if you grew up with this game, you are probably used to the controls, it is as you remembered, but for modern players, or people who are used to more ease of life controls, yeah no, avoid it.","timestamp_created":1608598880,"timestamp_updated":1608598880,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82851388","author":{"steamid":"76561198058955770","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1612134854},"language":"english","review":"Very glitchy compared to the original.
