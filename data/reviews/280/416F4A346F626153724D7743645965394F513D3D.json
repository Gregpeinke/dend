Не главное от слова совсем. В этой игре Valve заложили механики, которые используются до сих пор. Все вымерено насколько тонко и идеально,что прям хорошо. \n\nСюжет\nДа он есть, и самое прекрасное, что вы и есть сюжет. Тут нет киношных вставок (кроме одной), все остальное вы сами путешествуете и воссоздаете сюжет.  Если коротко, мы играем за молчаливого физика Гордона Фримана, который на научной станции Черная Меза участвует в эксперименте, как вы понимаете неудачно. Потусторонний мир прорывается к нам, и тут начинается экшен.\n\nГрафика\nДаже сейчас, не смотря на угловатость, несмотря на старую морально графику, в игре можно провести и залипнуть не один вечер и перепройти её пару тройку раз. Она обладает атмосферой и это круто.\n\nГеймплей\nНе так уж прост, тут есть интересные механики. Но по сути это шутер, но эталонный.\n\nЗвук\nМне везде понравился. Жаль я не помню музыки.\n\nИтог\nИгра, которая прошла проверку временем. Для меня однозначно шедевр, и рекомендован к покупке и ознакомлению.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=879236373\n\n\n[h1] Подписаться на обзоры [/h1]\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35534108-OpaGen-Review/] Куратор  [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/OpaGenReview] Группа с обзорами [/url]\n","timestamp_created":1434396609,"timestamp_updated":1565464623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16425543","author":{"steamid":"76561198035414065","num_games_owned":323,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":1800,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1800,"last_played":1434396047},"language":"english","review":"I put about 30 hours into it, and while it could've aged better, it is still better than a lot of AAA shooters.","timestamp_created":1434396008,"timestamp_updated":1434396008,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16405353","author":{"steamid":"76561198006468180","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":874,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":865,"last_played":1585846186},"language":"english","review":"Yeah yeah yeah, it's bloody Half-Life I don't need it explain.","timestamp_created":1434330824,"timestamp_updated":1434330824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16400635","author":{"steamid":"76561198071105130","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":252,"last_played":1467377012},"language":"english","review":"Unlike the original Half-Life, which is in my opinion the best game of all time, Half-Life: Source is a buggy piece of shit with broken AI, broken hitboxes, sentences.txt written by an intellectually disabled dead squirrel, broken weapon recoil, shitty standard HL2 user interface, ear-rape inducing SteamPipe save-load freezing which often results in the game crashing, poor optimization, shitty (optional) HD weapon models that look like they were ripped straight from Gamebanana in 2002, broken multicore rendering which causes strange graphical glitches in certain areas of the game and it uses the shitty default Source 2K4 movement system and footstep sounds along with poorly implemented Half-Life 2 water textures and HL2 barrel models that don't fit with the rest of the game.

Half-Life: Source is an update using Valve's source engine. While it's mostly the same, from level design, weapons, ect. there are minor differences such as updated water, better lighting and ragdolls. But this version has a lot more bugs than it's Goldsrc counterpart. Some that i came across were a floating scientist in the Anomalous Materials chapter, invisible barnacle tongues and the tentacle in Blast Pit not doing any damage (although that might not be a bug as I've heard that it was severely nerfed and can barely hit you). As for which version you should get for a first time player, it's kind of a toss-up. On one hand, Source looks slightly better, can be played in widescreen and has the updated water/lighting, but the original has much less bugs and has many more mods.

I can answer that question with one word.\n\nNo.\n\nMy friend had been pestering me for months to play this game. I had heard so many wonderful things about it, “It’s the greatest game of all time”, “It has an amazing story” are just two of the many great claims I’ve heard about this game. I’ve got to say, I’m extremely disappointed.\n\nAfter launching the game, I’m greeted by some pretty abysmal graphics. The original game was released sometime around 1996, so poor graphics are to be expected in the original version of the game. What’s not to be expected is for there to be poor graphics in the remake/remaster of the game (Half-Life Source). If the graphics are this bad, I might have well just played the original version.\n\nAt first I put this aside; a game with bad graphics doesn’t always equal a bad game. I decided proceed through the “tutorial” area until I actually reach the real part of the game (in which you get your first weapon). I was quite frustrated to find out that I had to use a crowbar as a weapon, which in my opinion is quite a bad design decision. You are going to get a gun later in the game anyway, so why not just provide a gun earlier in the game? Another thing I can't work out is why did they put glasses on the main character? It doesn't seem very badass for the main character to wear glasses.\n\nI then struggle to play though the game due to the dry story and boring combat mechanics. I honestly don’t know why everyone thinks the story to this game is so amazing. A science laboratory gets filled with aliens and you need to escape that laboratory. The story doesn’t get any more complicated or in-depth than that.\n\nYou also see a man in a suit from time to time. I don’t see the point in this since you never get the chance to fight him. He is clearly the bad guy in the game, but instead of fighting him at the end of the game, you just speak to him instead. What a disappointment.\n\nTake my advice. Save your money and spend it elsewhere.","timestamp_created":1432073270,"timestamp_updated":1432073370,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.306641519069671631","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15902327","author":{"steamid":"76561197994005948","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":872,"last_played":1428807811},"language":"english","review":"The only reason, the ONLY reason I am giving this game a negative recommendation, is because Black Mesa is now available on Steam.

The most noteable changes are to the water, the ragdoll physics and the map lighting (in some cases). \n\nThere are plenty of other minor things that you will notice after playing through once, it's like a new layer of polish, but nothing that would make me recommend buying this version over the original game as unfortunately the Source port has also caused a large number of bugs and errors to arise that were never in the original version. While some of the new features and mechanics in the Source engine are nice, the game hasn't really been updated to take those aspects into account, and thus, more problems popped up. \n\nSo I have mixed feelings about [b]Half-Life: Source[/b], but I'd say that this version is worth playing through at least once if you are a Half-Life fan, it has a slightly different feel to it but ultimately I'd say to just stick to the original version of the game instead.

There really is no difference between this and Half-Life other than chapter selecting, gmod compatibility, and source enging modding and editing etc. \n\nEdit:\n\nWith the current EA release of Black Mesa it made me think. A bunch of people on the BM forums are complaining about how it's a paid mod and all that junk, but really BM is a giant remastering, a complete overhaul built from the ground up in a whole new light, and yet Half-Life: Source still lingers around and has no real fresh thing about it other than it's simply on the source engine and there is no mod community for it at all.\n\nPeople should be getting pissed off at this than BM, because this has more reason for it. If BM was released by Valve, or just suddenly popped up without anything previously knowing about it, it would have no hate whatsoever. \n\nHalf-Life: Source should not be sold separately because it has nothing to it that's worth a full 10 dollar price tag on it's own. It should just be bundled and sold with the original Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1430851084,"timestamp_updated":1430851084,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":135,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.70135951042175293","comment_count":18,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15692030","author":{"steamid":"76561198114545657","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3514,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":800,"last_played":1566539885},"language":"english","review":"better than the original, you get slightly better graphics, better lighting, slightly better damage system, and you can load each chapter individualy insted of starting at the begining every time.","timestamp_created":1430780361,"timestamp_updated":1430780361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15688739","author":{"steamid":"76561198134993949","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1897,"last_played":1456665293},"language":"brazilian","review":"Excelente jogo.

Life 1 on Sauce\n\nhonestly, this is a downgrade to half life.\nIt still uses the old weapon and character models wich have a bit better looking textues.\nBut valve has made new models for the original game wich look way better already.\nAlso, this version has more bugs and gliches (taking damage by not moving obejects, textures go apeshiet,etc)\n So there's not point to play it.\n\nJust spare youself the money and buy the normal half life if you don't have it already.\n\nit's still a great game but my negative review is towards the unnecessariness of this

Half life, possible one of my favorite game and game series of all time. I decided to pick up the old half life and try playing through it again on hard mode and it was quite a challenge for me, but a fun one nonetheless. If you have not played this game yet and are considering buying it, ask yourself this: Do i like shooters? Do i lke survival horror shooters? Do i enjoy a game with fast paced action, linear movement of story, easter eggs, fun, and a game that is just so good that i cant possibly resist playing it? If you answered yes to any of those questions then this game is right for you. A word of advice though, this is the source version so while osme textures are improved there are an abundance of bugs, glitches, and new errors. if your willing to look past all that (which is easy to do) then buy this version. If not then just buy the original half life. Either way I highly recommend this game as it is easily a lifetime classic.","timestamp_created":1428079541,"timestamp_updated":1428079541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15179248","author":{"steamid":"76561198042795542","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1171,"last_played":1402190456},"language":"english","review":"There are legions of fans all over the Internet praising this game left and right for its innovative approach to telling a story in an FPS setting. I'll concede that point, but I'll also say that an FPS is mostly about gameplay and immersion, not about story. The gameplay in this game is pretty atrocious, because a lot of it involves jumping puzzles.\n\nJumping puzzles, with rare exception, DO NOT WORK in an FPS. They don't. They. DON'T. If you make a jump in real life, you have a bunch of senses other than sight helping you land where you want to land. In an FPS, you've got limited sight and none of the other senses. Now I was going to give this game a pass, since it came out early on and maybe the developers simply didn't get this as they were breaking new ground in the FPS genre. But then I read that the sequel also has jumping puzzles, so they clearly didn't learn their lesson.\n\nA second flaw is the \"realism\" of the game. You fight a branch of the military at several points and they'll set up ambushes or minefields in which you don't see either of them coming. You need to navigate a minefield completely blind, which is realistic, but let's consider the fact that a theoretical physicist with little to no combat training fighting hordes of aliens and the military, in reality, is going to get his bullet-ridden ass handed to him in approximately 12 seconds. You pretty much need to abuse save/load to get through this game, which isn't fun at all.\n\nAnd what the flaming hell was up with losing all your equipment halfway through the game? That served exactly no purpose at all except to piss the player off. Really? The soldiers set up an ambush, like all the other ambushes Freeman had no trouble getting through, but this time they turned off the lights! Gasp! So much for realism and storytelling.\n\nYeah, I'm not playing the sequel or the sequel to the sequel.","timestamp_created":1428030524,"timestamp_updated":1428030524,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15167600","author":{"steamid":"76561198013541593","num_games_owned":487,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":290,"last_played":1428205792},"language":"english","review":"Despite what the autists in the review slot say.
