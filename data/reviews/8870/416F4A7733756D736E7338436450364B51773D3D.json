You can now only carry 2 guns at a time and the powers feel very weak, I barely even used them.\n\nThat out of the way, I absolutely loved the setting and the story of this game.

Unlike the first two games, now you're not a survivor or a Monstrous-like creature who roam an underwater city, now you're Booker DeWitt, a war veteran with unknown debts and now tasked to rescue a girl in a flying city, Columbia.\nColumbia, unlike rapture, is a beatiful city. Everyone's happy until you showed up and accused for being a false sheperd. Now the whole city is your enemy, and you must fight your way to save Elizabeth, a Mysterious girl guarded by a giant steam-powered beast known as The Songbird and of course the ruler of the city, Comstock.\n\nThe game now is not about survival, it's about a fight. So, you're not spending time collecting medkits and eve or planning an attack on splicers like the first two games, It's a whole different genre. In Bioshock: infinite, the combat is fast, more weapons and ammunitions so you don't need to save ammunitions like in the first two games. Also there are Vigors, pretty much like Plasmids, but with the fast combat system, using these superpowers is much more fun as you can combine one vigor with others. and you don't have to worry about the Salts (Eve version of Bioshock Infinite) or ammunitions and medkits, because Elizabeth is one of the best NPC Companion ever (She'll find those things in a fight) \nAnd for the world and the story, it's pretty good. The vibe and the music of the game is awesome. I like the bond between the two main characters and i think many people would agree with me that this game has the most Mind-Fu** ending ever. \nOverall this is a very good game, you don't have to play the first two games to understand the story, Recommended!","timestamp_created":1440400087,"timestamp_updated":1440400087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508515834808349609","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17688361","author":{"steamid":"76561198161691115","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1069,"last_played":1623356752},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegaso!!!

Since I finished it a little over a month ago, I've spent countless hours thinking about it. It really stays with you. A lot of people complain about this game and proclaim that the original BioShock is far superior. And although I immensely love the original BioShock and could agree that certain aspects of it are better (being able to hold more than two weapons, the Big Daddies), I can't seem to understand how someone could not appreciate the intense, emotional, and plain awesome story this game and its DLC deliver. While on the subject, I highly recommend Burial at Sea Episodes 1 & 2. It brings it to a conclusion that I personally found more satisfying than that of the base game, although I may be in the minority there. I find the gunplay to be an improvment, mostly because it uses BioShock 2's gun and plasmid (vigor, now) in seperate hands mechanic comapred to BioShock's nonsensical constant right clicking to switch. It also has Aim Down Sights which I always love. Anyway, I rate 9.5/10, and would like to conclude by reminding you that whatever problems you may have with the story/ending, no sane person can truthfully say it's better than the \"ending\" of the original, because that ending is just plain terrible.","timestamp_created":1440375644,"timestamp_updated":1440375644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17685248","author":{"steamid":"76561198164600715","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1937,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1384,"last_played":1531323215},"language":"schinese","review":"被剧情的结尾镇住了，这里就不剧透了 画面音效方面做得 无与伦比  9/10","timestamp_created":1440369675,"timestamp_updated":1440369675,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17684779","author":{"steamid":"76561198101017222","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":737,"last_played":1439504238},"language":"english","review":"Not as good as people say...","timestamp_created":1440367315,"timestamp_updated":1440367315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17682746","author":{"steamid":"76561198028325277","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1331,"last_played":1441398816},"language":"english","review":"This game is brilliant.

Tem uma boa variação de armas, vigores (poderes) e combinações desses vigores para causar um dano maior. Assim como os outros BioShocks, é EXTREMAMENTE recomendável que se explore o máximo possível do jogo para um maior entendimento. A coleta de Voxophones (Diários de Áudio no BioShock 1 e 2) e atenção na conversa entre Booker e Elizabeth desvenda os mistérios do jogo.\n\nApesar de ter Elizabeth ao seu lado, ela é extremamente útil nos combates. Ela costuma jogar em sua direção sais (com eles você utiliza os poderes), kits médicos, munição e dinheiro. A melhor parte disso tudo é que ela se protege sozinha, assim, você foca somente nas batalhas.\n\nA DLC Burial at Sea episode One e Burial at Sea episode Two são cruciais para o entendimento da saga BioShock, pois no final do Infinite há um buraco na história que é preenchido com as DLCs (Essas duas DLCs poderiam tranquilamente serem transformadas em um novo jogo pelo tamanho de ambas). Então antes de jogar Burial at Sea, é recomendável que já tenha jogado BioShock 1 ou já tenha conhecimento do que ocorre nele.\n\n\"A mente do paciente irá lutar desesperadamente para criar memórias onde elas não existem\", Barreiras para viagem transdimensional - R.

На дворе 1912 год, наш главный герой частный детектив, который задолжал в азартных играх и вот ему выпадает шанс, чтоб ему простили все долги. Для этого ему поручают задание выкрасть девушку по имени Элизабет и вот нашего героя доставляют до места назначения к маяку. И теперь наш герой уже один поднимается по маяку и на самом верху маяка находит странное кресло. Букер садится в кресло, и оно внезапно катапультирует его в какой то капсуле в небо и вот перед нами открывается потрясающий вид на летающий город Колумбию. Затем капсула приземляется, в какую то церковь, и тут начинаются наши приключения...\nПлюсы игры:\n+ Самый главный плюс этой игры - это, конечно же, потрясающий сюжет! Но если вы захотите узнать больше о здешней жизни, нужно будет собирать голософоны и просматривать короткие ролики в киноскопах;\n+ Графика просто радует глаз, иногда открываются такие пейзажи, что прямо завораживает дух;\n+ Саундтрек красив, особенно мне понравился в трейлере игры;\n+ NPS сделан на ура! Каждый простолюдин чем - то занимается, что - то говорит, да просто живёт обычной жизнью. Все основные герои этой игры сделаны хорошо, каждый чем - то цепляет себя, но Элизабет заслуживает отдельного внимания! Этот герой запоминается нам с первой встречи, она постоянно что-то говорит, исследует окрестности, подкидывает нам припасы во время ожесточённого боя, да и так подкидывает денег, короче я хочу сказать, что разработчики очень хорошо постарались над этим персонажем, и у них это получилось!\n+ Атмосфера в этой игре хорошо проработана, даже гуляя по Колумбии, хочется обойти каждый угол, каждый закоулочек, да и просто наслаждаться здешними красотами;\n+ В нашем арсенале много всякого оружия от крюка до гранатомёта и ещё 8 плазмидов, но всё это будет открываться по развитию игры. Так же можно будет покупать улучшения для оружия, плазмидов и комбинировать плазмиды которую будут наносить ещё больше урона. Ещё в игре, есть улучшения в форме одежды, которые вы будите находить в разных местах и они будут вам давать полезные свойства;\n+ Враги разнообразные, есть обычные солдаты с дубинками и автоматами и т.д, а есть враги, которые только используют плазмиды, например: Поджигатель и Ворон. Есть ещё автоматические турели и ракетницы, но самый сильный враг в игре - это Механик.\nМинусы игры:\n- Да какие вообще минусы могут быть в этой игре?! Даже, если они и есть я их просто не заметил или не обращал внимания, потому что они просто не заметны.\nВывод: получилось потрясающее завершение этой замечательной трилогии BioShock, в которую просто хочется уйти и никогда не возвращаться с этих замечательных улиц Колумбии. Игра полностью заслуживает оценку 10 из 10.","timestamp_created":1440105954,"timestamp_updated":1460032718,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.71184539794921875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17631133","author":{"steamid":"76561198111434933","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":621,"last_played":1591966132},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра от 2K Games, сюжет хороший но в конце игры путаешься, но перепройдя концовку стоновится все ясно.Гемплей и Графон на 9/10.Советую играть.Игра просто Супер!","timestamp_created":1440088021,"timestamp_updated":1440088021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50276869535446167","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17630591","author":{"steamid":"76561198010323831","num_games_owned":668,"num_reviews":156,"playtime_forever":239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":142,"last_played":1501229632},"language":"russian","review":"вас посылают найти телку на облака и блять все начинается против вас все рушится + еще вы через измерения хуярите это ваще жопа ебаная но игра супер не смотря на это концовка огонь но не понять ее может только спермотозоид","timestamp_created":1440085137,"timestamp_updated":1440085137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497340470552444458","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17627564","author":{"steamid":"76561198072932659","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":348,"last_played":1465042776},"language":"russian","review":"Рекомендую однозначно!

Just wow. When Bioshock Infinite released, I neglected to play the game because I refused to play games with a controller, and the only computer in the house was a toaster. After playing through it I can safely say that this has got to be one of the most finely crafted games I've ever played. The guns are all punchy and fun to use, the difficulty curve is perfect, and the story is perhaps one of the most well done I've ever seen in a video game. Elizabeth is, hands down, the most useful tag-along character I've ever had the privilege to play with. She never gets in the way, can take care of herself in a fight, and tosses you ammo, coins, and health items seemingly whenever you need them. This isn't to say that she eliminates the difficulty, or that the game is too easy. I played on normal mode, and the difficulty seemed very well balanced. There were some very close calls many, many times throughout the game. I did encounter a few deaths, but pretty much all of them were my fault. I never really encountered any bugs, other than getting stuck on the geometry a few times, though none required a reset and I was free within seconds. If I were to complain about a few things, I would say that I wish that a little bit more emphasis were put on the vigors within the game. As cool as they seemed when I got each one, I found that I rarely used any of them on more than a few occasions. although this could be entirely because I was having too much blasting away enemies with my hand cannon. Another VERY small gripe I have is with some of the unusual choices for keybinds. I found that I had to do quite a bit of tweaking to some of the core buttons in order to reach a typical FPS setup, but since they can be rebound, that's hardly a complaint. I can't really find any other complaints that are worth mentioning. This game is so fun, so interesting, so beautiful, that I can whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone who plays FPS's, and I would recommend anyone who can get their hands on this game, give it a whirl.

It is so addictive. And the end of the game is so incredibly amazing and mind blowing that I'm was still in shock three weeks later... One might say I was still in \"BioShock\". (Pun intended) But seriously... I occasionally get chills down by back when I think back to this game. This is a must play game. I have not played BioShock 1&2 yet, but I have then in my library and I'm going to play them when I have time.\n\nSome of my friends say that they don't like BioShock Infinite because it does not seem as \"dark\" as the first two, but I disagree. This game is \"dark\" but in a mental way. I don't know if the first two are \"dark\" mentally, visually or both. But I can say that this game is very mentally \"dark\". It starts off very nicely and quiet and evolves to something that is really, really \"dark\". \n\nThe game looks amazing visually. I played trough the game in medium quality (because my pc was crap) and it looked amazing. I changed the quality to max sometimes just to look at the scenery in HQ and that looked even better. Even in the lowest quality (but still at 1920x1080) it looked very beautiful.\n\nPros:\n- Elizabeth (You will understand in time)\n- Looks amazing\n- Runs smooth (Even on my useless 6 year old office PC I had when i played this)\n- Full controller support (Playing the game with a controller instead of mouse and keyboard is heavily recommended because your hands are more still which allows me to get immersed fully and i hope it does the same for you)\n- Fair price\n- AMAZING story (My opinion)\n- 12-18 hours gameplay (Estimate based on my time)\n- Good world layout (there is no ingame map because you don't need one. I thought i was lost once! And it turned out I went the correct way. So the world is mostly open and is almost impossible to get lost in) \n\nCons:\n- Replayability is not really an option (for me at least). The story in the game unfolds in a way that for me makes it so there is no reason to play it again.
