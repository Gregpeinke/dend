Solo que falta el 3 (que no, que no es Hunt Down the Freeman joder). En fin; con un gameplay de unas 9 horas aproximadas, historia increíble, combates \"epicos\"(solo los minibosses son epicos de verdad como la Hormiga León guardián) y el todopoderoso GMAN convierte a Half-Life 2 a uno de los mejores juegos de la historia.
