Arada zekice şakalar koyulup sade bir Puzzle oyunu gibi hissetmiyor.\n\n     Tabi ilk başta amacınız sade bir puzzle oyunu ise 2. oyun daha kolay olduğu için size yeterli gelmeyebilir.

The Graphics are as sharp as ever for a 4 year old game and feel crisp and sharp, the storyline picks up after the events of portal and it quickly becomes clear that the dark humour that was heavily present in the original game has not escaped the sequal expect plenty of Laugh out loud moments . the controls are on the nail with only a couple of occasions I can recount where the controlling of the character was ever an issue, its one of those games where if you screw up you know it's on you rather than the game. \n\nI hold only one personal issue with this game and that is that to me it doesnt quite feel as tight as it's predecessor. while I love the idea of a free and sprawling game with which to use the portal gun once the free roaming levels begin I feel the game slows down a touch as your forced to think of unique solutions to getting to the next level of the game. the chambers feel fine but these underground sections never hung as tightly to me. though I suppose it's the rose tinted glasses talking for my preference for the original Portal. \n\nPick this game up. it's essential playing if your a gamer. if you havent played the original Portal then good lord go and play that first because it's beautiful. if you have played the original portal why are you reading reviews for the sequal this should be in your download cue already...it may not be a perfect game to me but it's a bloody good one.","timestamp_created":1439072109,"timestamp_updated":1439072109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484311044216156006","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17449356","author":{"steamid":"76561198157039714","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3097,"playtime_last_two_weeks":169,"playtime_at_review":1540,"last_played":1660421264},"language":"english","review":"fun but hard","timestamp_created":1439070360,"timestamp_updated":1439070360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17448953","author":{"steamid":"76561198120064409","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1322,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1322,"last_played":1435237446},"language":"russian","review":"Очень интересная и увлекательная игра.

Są to 2 oddzielne tryby i nie wpływają na naszą przygodę, którą przykłądowo zaczeliśmy w trybie jednoosobowym. Gra posiada BARDZO rozbudowaną fabułe. Jeśli nie grałeś w 'Portal\" to radzę najpierw uruchomić poprzednią część po to, aby poznać cała wcześniejszą przygodę. Kolejna odsłona dodaje ze sobą nowe dodatki z którymi spotkamy się na poziomach. Grafika jest piękna, sam system działania gry jest genialny. Główny robot GlaDos, którego spotykamy już w pierwszej części, ma teksty które rozbawią nie jedną osobę. Każdy poziom kryje w sobie coś nowego, dzięki czemu ta gra staje się jeszcze bardziej ciekawsza.\nSerdecznie polecam tą grę. Cena 15 euro - czyli około 62 zł.

Portal 2 doesn't have the same emotional feel, satisfying conclusion, or wry seriousness throughout. The problems start from the beginning and really don't let up, although the puzzles are interesting enough to keep that part of your mind engaged. \n\n-----SPOILER ALERT-----\n\nApparently many years have passed and animals have evolved so that they terrify humans, and humans now worship giant apes - or something. That's farcial, and this underlying lack of seriousness leaves you rolling your eyes at the sophmoricism on display throughout the game. Of course, GLADOS wakes up and must be killed all over again, but this time she is not killed, but reduced to a potato. Yes, you read that right. More farcial humor. (She's also feasted on by a bird later on.)\n\nThe geography doesn't make much sense, either. Parts of the game are set in a giant salt mine, which exists apparently in the middle of nowhere, Iowa. Seriously. There's no evidence that any mining activity takes place in the local area. \n\nThe puzzles are ok, with none of them as difficult as the last few in Portal, which is kind of disappointing. I'm no masochist, but I found if I didn't get the puzzle in 20 minutes, if I slept on it, I'd figure it out the next day. It wasn't terribly challenging. The atmosphere is appropriately eerie and occasionally unsettling. \n\nThe game is also way too long - it's at least 8 chapters, and I only kept playing to see what the ending was. Unfortunately, the ending is completely unsatisfying. Once you reach it, you end up opening a portal to the moon (funny how the Portal gun fizzles out after distances even half that everywhere else in the game), and chucking Wheatley into space. If that wasn't bad enough, then after you reach the surface, you're treated to more silliness - Wheatley floating in space, talking, and Glados singing a song. It reduces the whole impression of something meaningful and sinister created by the first game to some spat between frenemies in junior high. It's ridiculous. \n\nSo while the puzzles were fairly enjoyable, and the atmosphere generally involving, everything else about the game was sub par.","timestamp_created":1438909503,"timestamp_updated":1438909503,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447548359632492065","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17421605","author":{"steamid":"76561198046183234","num_games_owned":816,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":648,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":648,"last_played":1527450464},"language":"spanish","review":"Un gran juego de manos de Lord Newell, excelente modo cooperativo y una campaña inolvidable","timestamp_created":1438904563,"timestamp_updated":1438904563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17420445","author":{"steamid":"76561198074821514","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":748,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":727,"last_played":1446318883},"language":"english","review":"Immerse yourself in this challenging puzzle game based around inter portal travel through Apeture science test chambers.
