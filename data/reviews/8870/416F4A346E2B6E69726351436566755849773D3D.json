Mas em vez disso vamos dizer o seguinte: o primeiro Bioshock foi um dos melhores jogos desta geração. Em comparação, Infinite parece um salto quântico.\n\nNa superfície existem muitas diferenças entre os dois jogos, mas as semelhanças também são muitas. Ambos decorrem numa utopia, governada com punho de ferro por um líder visionário - e possivelmente louco. Ambos passam-se no passado. Ambos combinam armas de fogo com poderes sobrenaturais. E ambos arrancam com um farol no meio do oceano.\n\nMas onde Infinite realmente marca a diferença, não apenas do seu antecessor, mas de praticamente todos os FPS do mercado, é na narrativa. É um complicado quebra-cabeças que se revela lentamente, mas com segurança, através de diálogos entre as personagens principais, monólogos dos inimigos, diários de áudio, conversas entre os habitantes do mundo e ainda através do ambiente.\n\nO ano é 1912 e a localização é Columbia, uma cidade que voa pelos céus e que é dominada por uma forte comunidade religiosa, que se despediu da \"Sodomia por baixo de nós\", porque aparentemente o americano comum é excessivamente pecador e não é patriota que chegue. O auto-proclamado profeta Comstock é quem reina em Columbia, e é adorado como um deus.\n\nApesar de Booker ser o protagonista jogável, de muitas formas é Elizabeth a verdadeira estrela do jogo. É encantadora, divertida, adorável e de confiança. Vão passar a maioria do tempo com ela enquanto tentam escapar de Columbia. Considerando que qualquer jogo com um foco evidente em companheiros controlados pela IA tem tendência para correr mal, este foi um enorme risco por parte da Irrational.\n\nMas perseguiram esse objetivo sem olhar para trás e foi uma aposta ganha. Elizabeth é um auxílio, não uma responsabilidade e quando não estiver por perto vão sentir a sua ausência. Nunca fica no caminho e não existe um único momento em que tenham de a proteger. Ela sabe bem tomar conta de si.\n\nA liberdade de escolha em relação ao combate é fantástica. Existem metralhadoras, caçadeiras e espingardas. Depois podem evoluir para a artilharia pesada, com lança-mísseis e granadas. Tudo isto pode ser melhorado com clips de munição maiores, dano extra, carregamentos mais rápidos e outras características semelhantes.\n\n\nA interação entre armas de fogo e os Vigors é fabulosa e só melhora com o facto dos ambientes realmente encorajarem a um movimento permanente. As Skyways, longos cabos construídos para teleféricos que se estendem pelas inúmeras ilhas flutuantes, podem ser usadas para deslizarem através de um gancho que apanhem logo no início do jogo. Assim podem tentar alcançar uma posição mais vantajosa ou escapar de uma situação perigos. Além disso, muito do equipamento (peças de roupa que fornecem vantagens passivas), oferece bónus à utilização das Skyways. Por exemplo, uma das peças permite o carregamento automático das armas sempre saltam para um cabo e outro oferece invulnerabilidade temporária no momento em que saem de um cabo.\n\nA combinação de excelentes armas com mecânicas de jogo alternativas é uma combinação rara hoje em dia. Infinite até supera o original por não incluir as batalhas de Boss dispensáveis que se tornaram numa das queixas mais frequentes de Bioshock. O único problema é possivelmente o nível de dificuldade algo baixo. Os veteranos de FPS devem experimentar o nível Hard sem grandes receios.\n\nMas Bioshock Infinite oferece mais do que apenas ação. Columbia é um local vibrante e excitante que esconde uma multitude de segredos e merece ser explorado, e a vossa curiosidade será recompensada com equipamento, dinheiro, diários e melhoramentos. Completámos o jogo duas vezes - a primeira acabou por ser algo apressada, ocupando cerca de oito horas. Na segunda vez explorámos cada cantos e examinámos cada porta fechada. O tempo de jogo aproximou-se mais das 16 horas, o que diz bastante do conteúdo presente em Columbia.\n\nAo mesmo tempo, o ritmo é quase perfeito. A ação frenética é equilibrada com sequências mais calmas, onde o jogo permite que os jogadores visitem áreas povoadas sem grandes incómodos (a não ser que roubem alguém ou ataquem um guarda). Existe muito para ver e descobrir.\n\nColumbia é um local memorável e deve muito ao grafismo que permite um ambiente estupendo. A iluminação é impressionante, desde os raios de sol que passam pelas nuvens, as velas da catedral criam um efeito magnífico no interior, e o fumo e o fogo que se vislumbra no horizonte é um espetáculo digno. As grandes vistas panorâmicas de estátuas, os espaços abertos, os dirigíveis e os bairros de lata, tudo se conjuga com os detalhes mais pequenos, como as decorações das lojas e os pósteres de propaganda - tudo foi exemplarmente produzido.\n\nO estilo dos personagens é quase caricaturado, o que é provavelmente uma decisão acertada. Os NPC menos importantes e aleatórios não têm o nível de detalhe de Elizabeth, mas os personagens centrais têm todas um aspeto fantástico.\nA atmosfera é acentuada com uma trilha sonora complementar. O argumento é excelente e as interpretações dos atores impressionam, seja a ouvir a conversa de um casal ou nos momentos mais marcantes da história. Mesmo assim convém enaltecer o trabalho e a química de Troy Baker e Courtnee Draper, nos papéis respetivos de Booker e Elizabeth.\n\nA trilha sonora também merece um destaque particular, já que suporta convenientemente os momentos mais dramáticos. Até existem algumas músicas que serão estranhamente familiares aos jogadores, mas se alongarmos podemos entrar no território de pormenores da história.\n\nComo já foi referido, Bioshock Infinite pode durar algo entre as oito e as 16 horas de jogo, e recomendo que joguem na dificuldade Hard, para realmente explorarem Columbia como ela merece. Se o fizerem vão encontrar uma experiência que poucos jogos nesta geração podem equiparar. Os gráficos são espantosos, a atmosfera é estupenda e a trilha sonora é soberba. Mais importante, a ação é fantástica e a história marcante. A Irrational Games criou uma obra-prima.","timestamp_created":1393442337,"timestamp_updated":1393442337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9271243","author":{"steamid":"76561198055394458","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1393154919},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1393441794,"timestamp_updated":1393441794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9270547","author":{"steamid":"76561198069054677","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1465,"last_played":1394108363},"language":"italian","review":"Le variabili in questo gioco non esistono, quindi non ci si deve preoccupare di fare scelte giuste o sbagliate.\nDetto ciò la sceneggiatura è davvero unica, lo stile che lo contraddistingue ha portato alla gloria lo steampunk e i collarini per le ragazze, è meglio di un film e vale ogni centesimo del suo prezzo.\nMai un bug, mai uno script fuori posto, anche il doppiaggio italiano è buono, ma lo consiglio fortemente con le voci originali che stanno molto più nella situazione in cui si trovano.\nÈ una storia d'amore che... non posso dirvi niente, vi tocca prendere il mouse e godervi questo capolavoro!","timestamp_created":1393437812,"timestamp_updated":1393437812,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9269714","author":{"steamid":"76561198029643892","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":621,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":621,"last_played":1374087198},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очень однообразная и скучная, её супер восхвалённый сюжет игру никак не спасает от нудных перестрелок в одинаковых локациях.","timestamp_created":1393432970,"timestamp_updated":1393793080,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517364323139190674","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9269576","author":{"steamid":"76561198110654461","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":720,"last_played":1393433901},"language":"english","review":"this is a great game.but but can get a bit hard at times","timestamp_created":1393431975,"timestamp_updated":1393431975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9268810","author":{"steamid":"76561198048714549","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":992,"last_played":1497357262},"language":"english","review":"its a very good game but i  want more vigers \n","timestamp_created":1393425185,"timestamp_updated":1393425185,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493730425834655762","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9268805","author":{"steamid":"76561198078407567","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":562,"last_played":1509916941},"language":"german","review":"Amazing story and one of the most beautiful worlds i have ever seen in a video game.

Seemed like Heaven. Then your eyes adjusted to the light, and you see that sea of white faces looking hard back at you.\" [/i]\n\n[h1] Fighting/guns [/h1]\nMain part of the game is focused on violence and shooting. First you'll get your hands on the Sky-Hook, which is useful both in combat and when moving around the flying city, and then firearms like the pistol, sniper rifle, shotgun, machine gun and the awesome hand cannon. Weapons and abilities (vigors) can be upgraded. Sky-Hook's can completely change your play style as you shoot and move around Skylines to the other side of the battlefield. This makes combat definitively 3D.\n\n[h1] Vigors [/h1]\nIn the previous Bioshock games we had plasmids in the BioShock Infinite you'll have vigors. Vigors are of various kinds, such as lightning, fire, etc.\n\n[h1] Elizabeth [/h1]\nI've already mentioned Elizabeth, who has the most beautiful eyes in the world and will help you in combat when you're looking for ammo or medical supplies and believe it or not, that will help you a lot in combat.

Comprandolo ero stato messo in guardia sul fatto che questo era probabilmente il più banale e commerciale dei tre titoli intitolati Bioshock, essendo di fatto il terzo episodio della serie. Niente di più errato! Certamente cambiando l'ambientazione e trasferendo la storia su Columbia cambia anche l'atmosfera prevalente, percui si nota sin da subito che gli ambienti non sono più quelli tetri e oscuri di Rapture (anche se con il tempo il paesaggio muta sensibilmente e comunque non mancano certo le citazioni ai precedenti episodi). L'elemento distopico rimane predominante e la trama non manca certo di spessore, mantenendo il giocatore col fiato sospeso fino all'ultimo secondo di gioco. In particolare a mio giudizio di grande effetto è il finale nel quale viene spiegato il complicato intereccio della trama, dimostrando che quest'ultima non è solamente un pretesto per creare un FPS. Consiglio questo gioco a tutti, non solo a coloro che hanno apprezzato i primi due titoli di Bioshock, ma anche agli appassionati del genere Avventura e degli FPS, ne vale veramente la pena!","timestamp_created":1393209258,"timestamp_updated":1393209258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9241118","author":{"steamid":"76561198118514882","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1527,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1195,"last_played":1410716224},"language":"english","review":"I LIKE DIS","timestamp_created":1393203925,"timestamp_updated":1393203925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9241055","author":{"steamid":"76561198023355570","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1573024355},"language":"english","review":"Having played this game on console first, and then PC, I must say it is a true masterpiece.

Während sich die Vorgänger Bioshock 1 und 2 bereits durch eine sehr gute Story und atemberaubendes Setting auszeichneten, setzt Bioshock Infinite diesem noch das i-Tüpfelchen auf.\nDie Spielwelt ist grandios in Szene gesetzt. Ich musste unzählige Male einfach stehen bleiben und mir das Bild bestaunen, welches sich mir bot. Auf der Suche nach einem Mädchen, taucht der Spieler in die Story ein, ist bezaubert von der fliegenden Stadt Columbia und seinen Bewohnern. Allgegenwärtig ist dabei die Macht eines Mannes Namens Comstock. Dieser regiert die Stadt, der gottgleich und allgegenwärtig zu sein scheint und immer als der \"Prophet\" bezeichnet wird. Der Einstieg ins Spiel wirft dem Spieler zunächst viele Fragen auf. Wenig wird zu Beginn erklärt. Doch mit der Zeit setzen sich alle Puzzelteile zusammen und ergeben eine extrem gute Story, wie ich sie selten erlebt habe in einem Spiel, das bis zuletzt hochspannend bleibt. Das Ende ist nicht ganz trivial und einfach zu verstehen, jedoch nicht weniger grandios. Wer hier noch offene Fragen hat kann sich die ein oder andere Erklärung bei Youtube ansehen.\nDas Gamesplay ist sehr gut umgesetzt. Die verschiedenen Kräfte machen Spaß und die Steuerung (vor allem an den Skylines) ist exzelent umgesetzt. Vor allem der Fakt sich nicht um den Schutz seiner Begleiterin zu bemühen, ist ein großes Plus des Spiels. Jegliche Interaktion geht schnell und intuitiv von der Hand. Die Variationen an Gegnern ist ausgewogen, das Design originell.\nDie Gesamte Spielwelt bietet von Level zu Level sehr viel Abwechslung. Was heiter und sonnig beginnt, scheint zum Ende in einen Alptraum zu gipfeln. Das Thema Religion spielt in Bioshock Infinfite eine ganz Zentale Rolle. Die Allegorien zu echten Religionen sind unübersehbar und gewollt. Sie regen zum Nachdenken an und zeigen im Verlaufs des Spiels, was passiert, wenn solche Ideologien Missbraucht werden.\n\nMein Fazit:\nEin MUSS für jeden Gamer","timestamp_created":1393180497,"timestamp_updated":1409002927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9235649","author":{"steamid":"76561198022867449","num_games_owned":359,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":1447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1185,"last_played":1428454382},"language":"english","review":"That, my friend, is what I call: A Masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1393174818,"timestamp_updated":1426095310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9234709","author":{"steamid":"76561197983085357","num_games_owned":671,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1038,"last_played":1393221941},"language":"russian","review":"Это очень хорошая игра с неповторимой атмосферой и захватывающим сюжетом.\n\nПримечательно, что не нужно знать о чем были первые две части, чтобы начать играть в эту.\n\nРекомендую к прохождению.\n\nP.S.

Interested? You should be.\nFollowing a brief (and really not very illuminating) introduction, Booker gets sent up to the lovely flying city of Columbia in a jet-powered lighthouse. Get hyped. Having lit some candles and crossed himself in front of a big statue of a man with a beard, Booker narrowly avoids being drowned by a psychopathic priest and the game begins properly.\nThe flying city of Columbia is a fantastic setting, the seemingly tranquil lifestyle of its citizens at odds with the frenetic run'n'gun action that comes later. Skylines, airships, and vast deserted halls make for spectacular shoot-outs, and it's interesting to note how the sunny floating city becomes a rain-lashed nightmare of destruction as its secrets are revealed.\nAs you might expect, the initial \"press v to mince somebody's face into a lasagne\" gameplay evolves into a fantastic combat system over the 15 hours or so that the main story will probably take you, with a multitude of weapons, powers, and the ability to rip holes in the fabric of reality to wreak havoc upon your enemies. That said, it's almost a shame that you'll almost never use the vast majority of your weapons or powers. It's pretty easy to shred your way through the game using only a carbine, machine gun, and sniper rifle, and the much-hyped Vigors often feel like novelties. That said, what's not to like about abilities called \"Devil's Kiss\", \"Bucking Bronco\", and \"Murder of Crows?\"\nThe plot of the game is enjoyable and never feels tacked onto the gameplay, the two instead complementing each other wonderfully. Although the pace dropped a little towards the endgame (it also ran like a three-legged tortoise with asthama during this bit), the different settings of Columbia that you progress through never feel gimmicky. \nFood, booze, and mysterious potions are key features of the game as it's imperative to keep your health and salts (manna) stocked up as a firefight could be just around the corner. Thankfully, every building in Columbia contains approximately three million trashcans, lockers, desks, and cabinets bursting with food, cash, and health kits. The cash comes in useful when upgrading your weapons and vigors at one of Columbia's automated vending machines. Also, you can go to a pub and, at the cost of most of your salts, get completly wasted, prompting Elizabeth, your [strike] snarky over-emotional bitch [/strike] useful companion to make a [strike] useless and bitchy [/strike] hilarious remark. \nBuy it and remember - don't be a dimwit.","timestamp_created":1393167906,"timestamp_updated":1393696003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9233552","author":{"steamid":"76561198121715796","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":862,"last_played":1431867934},"language":"english","review":"Close to perfection.","timestamp_created":1393164869,"timestamp_updated":1393164869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9231348","author":{"steamid":"76561197993290223","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2013,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1531,"last_played":1559040635},"language":"japanese","review":"FPSです。今回のスローリーはかなり難解ですが、面白いです。おすすめ","timestamp_created":1393152147,"timestamp_updated":1393152147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9231223","author":{"steamid":"76561198109181565","num_games_owned":348,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":437,"last_played":1396175854},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I have ever played.

It feels dumbed down due to console constraints and few things irk me as much as that. This is not saying that the previous titles didn't have heacy tendencies toward console simplification too but it has been kicked up another couple of notches and that is depressing. The game is still worth it for the story and the visuals but only once and the DLC to date is severely lacking.\n\nI was positively drooling to get to revisit an unspoiled rapture but the story so far is short, weak and only very shortly set in an uncorrupted setting. I would have loved for this to approach the playstyle complexity of the original Deus Ex but instead it heads straight to irrelevance. I will recommend it but only when it is on sale.\n\nIn essence this is not your uncles RPG / FPS crossover, infact it is neither FPS nor RPG it is a 3D graphical novel with a limited combat model that feels slow clunky and incomplete. It is also beautiful and enjoyable for a straight playthrough but no more than that.","timestamp_created":1393106173,"timestamp_updated":1393106173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9224121","author":{"steamid":"76561198020666002","num_games_owned":835,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":756,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":523,"last_played":1434482100},"language":"english","review":"Incredible story but mediocre gameplay.","timestamp_created":1393105259,"timestamp_updated":1393105259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n+nircQCefuXIw=="}
