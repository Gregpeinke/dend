Это \"стимпанковское ретро\" захватывает с первых минут и не отпускает до конца. Как и в предыдущих частях музыкальное сопровождениевыше всех похвал, всегда нравилась музыка доносящаяся из радио, приятная будто с пошарпаных виниловых пластинок, добавляет эффект погружения в начало 20 века. Красивое графическое оформление в слегка карикатурном стиле тоже не вызывает придирок, конечно минусы есть, например пластилиновость NPC которые при приближении выдают пару фраз и делают пару неестественных движений, но всё это меркнет на общем фоне. т.к. игра всё равно замечательна. Объективно её оценка 8,5 из 10, потому что всё нравится, всё отлично, но мелкие недоработки всё же бросаются в глаза.\nНо субъектино это 12 из 10, это просто изумительно, последний раз столько эмоций вызывала только концовка Batman Arkham City, я был шокирован и дрожь не покидала минут 10. Огромное спасибо Кену Левину за столь прекрасное творение как Bioshock.\n\nДумаю что данная игра замечательно подходит под номинацию \"Я не плачу, просто что-то в глаз попало\".","timestamp_created":1404594595,"timestamp_updated":1479968483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568627476692199707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11090144","author":{"steamid":"76561198109298528","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1211,"last_played":1606158164},"language":"russian","review":"Игра с первых минут захватывающая своей историей и не перестающая удивлять на протяжении всех  9-12 гимплейных часов .

Стоит только начать обращать внимание прислушаться к аудио дневникам  и разгавором и все эти тему возникнут перед вами . Гемплей же в свою очередь предлагает огромный спектр боевых возможностей широкий набор пушек и вигоров , способность Элизабет открывать порталы для помощи вам , магнитные рельсы для быстрых перемищений по миру ,разнообразные враги с индивидуальным подходом ,ну и многое другое . Да и сама Элизабет евляеться одним из самы ярких персонажей года , живым человеком не только в катсценах но и в самом игровом процессе .

They know that it's one of the most popular games of recent history, and know a lot about the gameplay. So my review is going to be a bit specialized in a way. As an academic that works on video games, I heard some negative things about this game in academic journals and from talking to others. I want to reflect on some of the interesting things about the game. It's hard to do \"pros\" and \"cons\" for such an amazing and beautiful game, but there are some things to discuss:\n\n[u]One of the most beautiful games I've played[/u]: I mean this in terms of graphics, setting, and emotional investment. Columbia is wonderfully bright and vivid, contrasting sharply to the Rapture of the earlier titles in the series. Columbia is also a living and thriving community, making the world feel less lonely and isolating. This has positives and negatives: while it offers something new to explore, it also deviates from the paranoid feelings provoked by Rapture.\n\n[u]It gets boring[/u]: I never thought that I needed to rush through [i]Bioshock 1[/i]. I even resisted such a feeling during [i]Bioshock 2[/i], despite the fact that it was so similar to its prequel. That being said, it might be a good thing that we are probably not getting another Bioshock game. Infinite is engaging, tantalizing, and fun. However, it also gets incredibly repetitive. I feel like I've done these tasks before, over and over again. The game started to get so devoid of purpose or point as I neared the end that I just wanted to rush through to see the ending. The ending is amazing. I cried. But getting there gets tedious. \n\n[u]Daisy Fitzroy is not developed in any coherent way (along with some other characters)[/u]: Previous games in the series did a great job criticizing all sides of the political spectrum: conservative (Andrew Ryan), liberal (Sophia Lamb), and revolutionary (Atlas). Infinite tries to do this formula again, and fails. The Vox Populi don't operate in any interesting or coherent way. They are background noise. Despite Elizabeth constantly saying that Daisy is \"just like Comstock\" and evil, I didn't feel that at all until one important moment later in the game. The game ignored Daisy's background story, even while repeating it constantly. It seemed irrelevant and Daisy ends up just seeming deranged in a way that is never quite explained. Bioshock usually does a good job exploring all dimensions of political positions; Daisy, however, just becomes a caricature.\n\nOne thing I especially didn't understand here is that Elizabeth constantly criticizes Daisy for her violence, while Booker is much more violent and much more destructive (killing indicriminately, uninterested in any ethical reflection) in ways that makes sense for his character, but not a coherent story).\n\n[u]In some ways, much more story-driven than the previous Bioshock games[/u]: While all three of the games are story driven, Infinite sometimes lapses into movie. This is especially apparent at the end. While I was emotionally invested in the ending, a lot of traditional gamers may be unhappy with the endless narrative descent into nothing and the fact that there is no traditional \"boss.\" That being said, the boss that is offered is pretty challenging.","timestamp_created":1404507165,"timestamp_updated":1404507255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11074239","author":{"steamid":"76561198119900456","num_games_owned":410,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":617,"last_played":1407448269},"language":"spanish","review":"Es waifu","timestamp_created":1404506932,"timestamp_updated":1551172109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11074119","author":{"steamid":"76561198027385330","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":567,"last_played":1540562022},"language":"turkish","review":"Alın, İngilizceniz kötüyse türkçe altyazıyı indirin, sonra başkasını çağırın ve oynatın.

I couldn’t tell what was going on myself. Whoever thought of this is brilliant. I’d like to start things visually. The graphics are is amazing I would like to would have played it at Ultra but my PC wouldn’t handle such stunning visuals however I’ve managed and to succeed the game at ‘Very High’ which is close. The graphics any object, human or AI is detailed and it’s just wow. They have put so much effort into this game. The story well-thought out. Even though, I know the story of what’s going on. You literally have to listen to every dialogue, voxphone or anything you can hear or see to know what is going on because you do find yourself getting stuck while in cut-scenes or when a main protagonists or villains are talking. The gameplay was overall okay. The walking was buggy and the guns were good. But I didn’t feel like the gameplay not visuals or story was that good. The Vigors wow some were more interesting than others but wow. I will be defiantly be playing the story again it’s not that long or too short It’s just right. \nBuy it and Play it. Its worth on any platform as-long as you got free-time and good audio quality because I would give this game:\n\n         9.8\n","timestamp_created":1404426803,"timestamp_updated":1404426803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11058042","author":{"steamid":"76561198043282367","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":746,"last_played":1459894686},"language":"spanish","review":"Me ha encantado Bioshock Infinite así como sus DLC que conectan perfectamente con las entregas de Bioshock 1 y 2.

Com um ótimo ritmo, sem ser frenético mas também nunca monótono,o jogo conta com uma das melhores (se não for a melhor) histórias que eu ja vi em um videogame. sou apaixonado pela ambientação de 1920, e Columbia realmente tem um ambiente muito imersivo, com seus diferentes bairros, recriando fielmente uma cidade da época (desconsiderando o fato dela voar né kkkkkkkkk). Quem procura o clima sombrio e tenso de rapture deve se decepcionar, pois essa não é a proposta de infinite.\n Sua teoria de dimensões paralelas é extremamente bem construída e introduzida no jogo, e vai além de um elemento na história, com uma interferência real na jogabilidade na forma das tears, que destacam o jogo de outros do gênero.\n Ele não se destaca como shooter,afinal esse não é o objetivo do jogo, mas o combate não decepciona.  O sistema de combate é mais equilibrado que os jogos anteriores, e conta com mecânicas interessantes como a necessidade de trocar de arma frequentemente, e só poder escolher duas armas, que leva você a tentar criar a combinação que mais se adapta ao seu estilo de jogo (hand gun+carabine ou hand gun+sniper, no meu caso).\nOutro diferencial do jogo são os tradicionais poderes do personagem, agora com o nome de Vigors, que enriquecem o gameplay, permitindo até a combinação de dois vigors diferentes.\n Apesar de não ser tão revolucionário quanto o primeiro Bioshock, esse jogo é talvez até melhor que os outros dois, e outras produtoras tem muito a aprender com Infinite. vale cada centavo gasto. Comprei na steam quando ja tinha zerado as duas vezes, apenas para prestigiar a 2K e o Ken Levine. Ele não é muito longo, mas talvez seja para conseguir manter o ritmo adequado sem \"encher linguiça\".\nComo os outros bioshocks, ele também traz uma série de debates filosóficos, que enriquecem a experiência de jogo, e o diferenciam de outros jogos do gênero. Recomendo o jogo para quem procura um shooter satisfatório, mas quer também uma história elaborada, e uma ambientação original.","timestamp_created":1404426420,"timestamp_updated":1404426420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11057709","author":{"steamid":"76561197960818168","num_games_owned":640,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1404424921},"language":"english","review":"A great continuation of the series, yet you do not need to have played 1 and or 2, you will still be confused and wonder.
