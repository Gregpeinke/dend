A história no início é bastante confusa, porem no final as coisas se esclarecem e com um esforço a mais vc desvenda a trama muito louca do jogo. Não joguei os anteriores porém não é necessário joga-los. A jogabilidade é muito boa e os inimigos não são fáceis, e possuem uma AI muito bem desenvolvida. A variedade de armas é excelente porem para melhor-las da trabalho, assim como os poderes do personagem, que são indispensáveis para continuar a saga, portanto quem gosta de exploração do ambiente vai realmente precisar faze-lo. No geral parabéns aos desenvolvedores, modeladores, artistas gráficos e colaboradores em geral porque é uma obra de arte, porém não achei o jogo excelente nos quesitos combates, combos e jogabilidade em pfs.

This game is definitely worth your time, whether you've played the other ones or not (this one will probably make you interested in the complete series anyway).\nThe story is really good, interesting, engaging and its characters are well written and presented. Pacing is good too, and, while the main story is not overly long, I felt it was about the right lenght and didn't overstay its welcome.\nWhere this chapter and the entire trilogy REALLY shines is in its level and world design. Every environment in the floating city of Columbia is meticulously crafted with care and attention to detail. You will be shooting your way across a hallway full of enemies but you can bet that hallway has a story to tell. You can collect different audio transcripts that enrich the lore of the game world and beautifully craft it to its finest details. By the end of my playthrough I saw Columbia as a fully realised world in itself, where other stories are left to the player's imagination. This, in my opinion, is an incredible achievement for any game and it left me wanting more.\nGameplay is similar to past games of the series, with a combination of range weapons and a wide variety of powers which you can use to blast your way through enemies in spectacular, thrilling style. Every battle is entertaining because of the amount of options the game gives you. You can only carry two weapons at a time, but the rest are usually scattered throughout the map, making the player want to move and explore while fighting, picking and choosing the right weapons according to the situation.\nOne of the main characters, Elizabeth, is your companion throughout the adventure, and she is incredibly useful and well realised. Not only she is a pivotal character in the story, but she helps throughout battles by providing you with ammo or health when you need it, or opening locked doors outside battle, or simply interacting with the environment wherever you go. Essentially you don't feel alone throughout all this, and the bond between the main character and her is really at the heart of this game.\nOverall, Bioshock truly encapsulates the genre of steampunk, with plenty of sci-fi elements that are somehow well placed in a world that resembles America in the 1900s. Adding  to it an emotional, thrilling story with great characters and you have yourself an excellent, albeit fairly linear experience. I would say one thing I was missing was the possibility of revisiting previous areas for collectibles or side stories, but that's just me being greedy. This means, however, that it's easy to miss things.\nOne element that left me slightly confused was that, in certain parts of the story, you are given the choice of whether to spare or kill someone; but that choice ultimately has no consequences, playing perhaps on the theme of the entire game relating to timelines and destiny.\n\nA few words about the DLCs: they are also worth your time. Make sure you play them after the main story. Burial at Sea episodes I-II return to Rapture, the underwater setting of the first two titles in the trilogy and truly completes the story of the two main characters. Episode II especially, is incredible in its departure from the original gameplay, adding more difficulty plus a stealth system, and finishing the entirety of the whole Bioshock trilogy with a surprising, emotional and satisfying ending.\n\nPROS: Story - Gameplay - Music - Characters - Elizabeth - World Design - Lore\nCONS: Too linear at times","timestamp_created":1586374647,"timestamp_updated":1586374647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66909515","author":{"steamid":"76561198344807261","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":362,"last_played":1595018640},"language":"spanish","review":"buenardo","timestamp_created":1586373574,"timestamp_updated":1586373574,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66907945","author":{"steamid":"76561198059381855","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":928,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":866,"last_played":1586374293},"language":"english","review":"This game was literally to kill off the franchise. They gave up with the weapons, the gameplay, the entire purpose of the franchise and it just proves my point about how the gaming industry has fallen so low. Everything is about money now and not anbout the story or inginuity that made people want to play games in general. It seems that whenever money takes over it destroys the premise of what made games great. Bioshock one had an amazing story and gameplay. Bioshock 2 was amazing with what you could do and was great for the story also. As far as this game straight trash nothing that was promised a real lazy writing style and I could keep going but im ending it there. I dont expect anything good from the gaming community anymore unless it is designed from the floor up by people with passion and wanting to see a story come alive.

reference, I have 100% completed this game and all DLC, and will have a little review for each.\n\nInfinite: \nAfter completing Bioshock 1 and 2 just before replaying this game, I can safely say this game is just objectively good. It takes elements from the first two games and greatly improves on them, the combat is more engaging, especially with the Sky-Line mechanics and the environments are just superb, where Rapture is claustrophobic and tunnel-like, Columbia is open with lots of verticality. \nAlthough touching on the environments, they feel hugely disjointed. Rapture felt believable as a connected space, Columbia feels like spaces that each inhabit their own void. You can marvel at 300ft towering structures, go through a door, turn around and find that they are not visible in the distance. Or you can go down an extremely long elevator ride and come out of a 2 story building. Not a huge thing but hurt my immersion quite a bit. \nThe story is good but it does feel like it's completing with Bioshock 1 for the title of best narrative. Unfortunately a lot of the story, especially the end is pretty contrived and overly complicated in an attempt to be deep.\nLastly, I will touch on the 1999 difficulty mode, which is disappointingly easy. If you are half decent at FPS games you will find it no more difficult than hard mode, so I recommend you play on this difficulty.\n\nA Clash in the Clouds: \nFuck this DLC. While it provides the challenge I was craving, the Blue Ribbon achievements are so frustrating to obtain, since if you fail a challenge on say round 13/15, you have to retry all previous rounds to even have another attempt. This can mean 25 minutes of playtime just to try again. \nAnd the AI is both godlike and asinine, there were times I feared for my life and enemies chased me down the map, with laser precision, X-Ray vision and a hunger for blood, while I desperately scrambled looking for medkits. And then there were times where I lost challenges because the AI would fucking jump of the roof to their death without me even being near them, just to spite me. \nIt's a decent challenge that provides some nice artwork and behind the scenes content, but it's not necessary to try to get all 60 Blue Ribbons, believe me.\n\nBurial At Sea - Part 1:\nBlink and you'll miss it, oops it's already over. Okay it's not that bad but reports say if you don't stick around to smell the roses you can beat this DLC in an hour, yeesh. Fortunately the roses smell mighty good, as the first part of this DLC is a tour of Rapture before the fall, and it is stunningly beautiful. Unfortunately it does not feel like Rapture, it feels like Bioshock Infinite with a Rapture modpack.\nThe second half is set in a Department Store, and I hope you like this location because the majority of Burial At Sea is set here. \n1999 mode on in this DLC however is amazing, it's everything I was looking for in the main game. Your ammo is reduced to 2 clips, enemies can drain your health and take a beating. Each fight felt life threatening and I loved it. Strongly recommended playing on this mode if you like a challenge. \nIn terms of story, ehhh, it's basically a prologue to Burial at Sea part 2, so I'll talk more about it in a second.\n\nBurial At Sea - Part 2:\nIt's a stealth game, so the focus is on sneaking. Was the engine built for this? No but it will try its hardest to be a stealth game nonetheless. \nIn this DLC you play as Elizabeth, starring in her self-insert Bioshock fan-fiction where she travels through time, meets Bioshock 1 characters, and though the power of retconning, becomes an integral cog in the narrative of the original game. By the end of the story you'll be told that Elizabeth was basically the reason anything even happened in Bioshock 1, and it doesn't work. It was something best left untold in my opinion and furthermore it tarnishes what the original game. Just let sleeping dogs bloody lie. \nThere is also a lot of elements of Rapture that the DLC tries to tell you were a thing despite not being present in the original 2 games, and I know you have to add content, it bugs me a little that nothing is consistent.\n\nSo I think that's it, for the one person who read the review all the way through, I thank you, for the rest of the TL:DR people I will say this:\n\nInfinite: Play it, it's very good.\nA Clash in the Clouds: Not necessary to play but still fun.\nBurial at Sea: A lot of flaws but it's still Bioshock content I suppose.\n\n","timestamp_created":1586164199,"timestamp_updated":1586164199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66731865","author":{"steamid":"76561198795632216","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1177,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1177,"last_played":1585672840},"language":"french","review":"Super FPS !
