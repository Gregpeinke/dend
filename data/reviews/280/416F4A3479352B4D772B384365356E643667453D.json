Source é um jogo clássico de ação desenvolvido pela Valve[/h1]\n\nO jogo que é um relançamento na engine Source, novamente na campanha te coloca no papel de Gordon Freeman, que após um experimento que deu errado, coloca o protagonista contra uma raça alienígena hostil.\n\nA história então é a mesma do anterior, com apenas mudanças gráficas e algumas pequenas coisas melhoradas graças a engine Source, sem multiplayer e ainda infelizmente nessa versão surgiu novos bugs e alguns bem ruins.\n\nA minha experiência de bugs com o jogo foi a seguinte: \nDe inicio eu achei que ia ser de boa os bugs, já tava sabendo que essa versão tinha muitos, então após iniciar o jogo eu notei que os guardas e os cientistas ficam gritando e gemendo infinitamente, o que foi bem engraçado, depois foi uma ocasião que meu jogo resolveu salvar automaticamente no mesmo segundo que eu iria morrer e ficar repetindo o load game nesse mesmo exato segundo, mas o pior de todos foi o que eu tive no capítulo 5 do \"TEMOS ELEMENTOS HOSTIS\" que por conta de um elevador não funcionar por aparentemente eu ter acidentalmente seguido o caminho errado e dado o retorno, me impossibilitando de usar os elevador pra voltar ao caminho que eu estava originalmente, o pior de tudo foi que eu fiquei quase por 1 hora e meia tentando descobrir que diabos tava acontecendo, pois eu consegui fazer a mesma burrada 2x seguidas, pois apesar de eu ter reiniciado a fase completamente, na segunda tentativa eu aparentemente fiz acontecer o mesmo bug e fiquei preso na fase novamente, até descobrir o que tinha dado de errado, foi algo bem estressante porque eu num sabia o que fazer e isso não nunca tinha acontecido comigo no jogo original psoksspssopsks.\n\n[b]Vale a pena comprar?[/b]\nOlha o jogo é bom, se você tiver gostado da história e jogabilidade do Half-Life original, você também vai gostar desse, mas o que ferra é os bugs, especialmente o que eu citei do elevador, pode ser que não vá acontecer com você  e acabe que só tenha que aturar esses bugs mais inofensivos, mas sinceramente não sei se algum dia eu jogaria de novo esse por conta desse bug terrível, quase que estragou minha experiência de jogo, então eu recomendo você comprar se realmente tiver afim de jogar ou completar a coleção e que esteja bem ciente dos problemas que esse jogo

I to w zasadzie jedyny plus, bo ja doswiadczylem 2 minusow. Pierwszym z nich bylo to, ze nie widzialem modelu broni. Cos sie najwidoczniej z viewmodelem spierdolilo, ale z tym dalo sie jeszcze grac, gorzej z tym drugim minusem. Nim z kolei byly crashe po kazdej probie uzycia Tau Cannon. Nie wiem, czym to bylo spowodowane. Po prostu musialem grac bez uzywania tej broni, co tez bylo mozliwe, ale wystarczylo, ze przez przypadek wzialem do reki te bron i nacisnalem lewy przycisk myszy- won do pulpitu. Nie bylo to az takie straszne w sumie, bo czesto zapisywalem gre, ale orientowanie sie jaka bron ma sie w reku tylko i wylacznie po wygladzie celownika nie jest takie wygodne. \n\n Podsumowujac, ta czesc mozna przejsc na samym poczatku przygody z seria Half-Life, jak w moim przypadku, by jak najlepiej zapoznac sie z fabula, jesli u kogos z angielskim kiepsko, aczkolwiek gra bedzie nieco utrudniona.
