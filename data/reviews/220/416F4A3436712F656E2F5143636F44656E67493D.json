there really is not any other game that comes close to capturing the feel and experience that Half-Life 2 brings. A depressing yet rich atmosphere, a gripping story, a beautiful world that still holds up 16 years later, and throughout it all you play as a theoretical physicist that barrages enemies with a variety of unique guns, a crowbar, and a gravity-gun that allows you to pick up objects and fling them at enemies (my personal favorite). If you have not played this game yet, you're missing out on one of the best FPS experiences of all time.","timestamp_created":1598925944,"timestamp_updated":1598925944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75250304","author":{"steamid":"76561197983117464","num_games_owned":421,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":2513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2449,"last_played":1598929507},"language":"english","review":"Its Half Life","timestamp_created":1598925448,"timestamp_updated":1598925448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75249467","author":{"steamid":"76561198930614809","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":623,"last_played":1599662134},"language":"english","review":"EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPICvEPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPICEPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPICEPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPICEPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPICEPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPICEPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPICEPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPICEPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPICEPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPICEPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPICEPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPICEPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPICEPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPICEPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC","timestamp_created":1598924005,"timestamp_updated":1598924005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75248116","author":{"steamid":"76561199085921916","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":44,"playtime_at_review":2514,"last_played":1660086082},"language":"english","review":"this game is classic","timestamp_created":1598921322,"timestamp_updated":1598921322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75247727","author":{"steamid":"76561198079732661","num_games_owned":450,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":1059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1059,"last_played":1598920340},"language":"english","review":"there is nothing more homoerotic and depressing than barney holding onto gordon's crowbar for 20 years, giving it back to him, fighting striders alongside him while yelling positive and heartwarming things to gordon, but not even being able to say goodbye to his gay lover from M.I.T.  before gordon's crowbar gets zapped forever and gordon escapes into the old, wrinkled hands of g-man.","timestamp_created":1598920511,"timestamp_updated":1598920511,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75247309","author":{"steamid":"76561198367070777","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":885,"last_played":1599877953},"language":"spanish","review":"es realmente el juego mas divertido que e jugado hasta ahora de valve la historia es impresionante y supera con creces a 1","timestamp_created":1598919671,"timestamp_updated":1598919671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75245811","author":{"steamid":"76561198211774765","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2816,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":901,"last_played":1654984506},"language":"english","review":"Fantasic FPS from VALVe's Golden Age.
