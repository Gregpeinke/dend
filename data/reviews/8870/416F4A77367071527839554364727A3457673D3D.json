It has a great narrative, excellent characters, and enticing gameplay. I've played this game 3.5 times through; twice on Xbox 360 and twice on PC (still playing through the second time).\n\nI became emotionally invested in Booker and Elizabeth, and played every second trying to guess what would happen. After playing through this game 3 times, I thought I had seen everything, but I was wrong. Burial at Sea had sucked me into a Rapture I hadn't seen before. I cried during the opening of Part 2, and the ending left me sitting in my chair just thinking about what I had experienced.\n\nAdditionaly, Clash in the Clouds is very rewarding, and unlocking the artwork was very cool. I would recommend this game to anyone, even if they haven't played the first 2 BioShock games. This has a separate story, that focuses on philosophy quite a bit, but playing BioShock 1 will still give you some insight into the story, especially in Burial at Sea.\n\nThis is one of my most favorite games I've had the pleasure of playing.","timestamp_created":1467043412,"timestamp_updated":1480107659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23864956","author":{"steamid":"76561198009176553","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2061,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1756,"last_played":1458349588},"language":"french","review":"Good game","timestamp_created":1467042417,"timestamp_updated":1467042417,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23864892","author":{"steamid":"76561198111913077","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":864,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":864,"last_played":1467042239},"language":"english","review":"Biggest Mind Fuck Ever. 10/10","timestamp_created":1467042278,"timestamp_updated":1467042278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23864722","author":{"steamid":"76561198272891483","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":997,"last_played":1563742816},"language":"spanish","review":"Me encanta su historia.

Ah, Bioshock, its safe to say I am in love with the series now. I cant say which one is the better game, each of them outclasses/lacks something in different aspects if you compare them all, but to me, they all sit on the same high shelf, simply because they all are unique and beautiful in their own way.\n\nSo, Bioshock Infinite...\n\nThe one in the series that gets a bit more hate compared to the other 2, mainly for a few reasons:\n-because its combat was numbed down and is slightly underwhelming\n-extra gameplay elements like puzzles and riddles practically removed\n\n HOWEVER, this game makes up for this with a (yet another) fantastic story, but this time, more rich and in-depth compared to the rest. With great voice acting and design, the characters feel so lively and much more colourful, giving birth to characters that usher in a whole lot (a BIG whole lot) of emotion. Although, emotion is no stranger to the Bioshock series, theres something very special about the feels in Infinite. There is a stronger bond between player and in-game character. Making me really feel a love for the characters.\n\nThe setting of the game is also another counter to its flaws, its a beautiful, stylish environment that also brings a special feeling inside. Its vivid colours are pleasant to look at and the art style is just very pretty. As I played the game it felt like I was walking through a painting of the early 1900s era or living a coloured version of an early 1900s black and white film. The landscape is memorable, the kind that makes me wish these kinds of fictional places exist.\n\nTogether, these elements made Bioshock Infinite an adventure that was very difficult for me to let go off, a story I will remember for a long time, and one that I dreadfully wish I could go through the first time again. \n\nA definite recomendation from me, you wont regret paying even full price for this.","timestamp_created":1467041901,"timestamp_updated":1467042092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23864357","author":{"steamid":"76561198038886919","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":631,"last_played":1466992433},"language":"german","review":"Eines der Spiele mit der besten Story das ich je gespielt hab und das ende ist besonders gut gelungen die haben sich da wirklich mühe gegeben (was heutzutage ja leider nicht mehr selbst verständlich ist).

I gave it a chance and I am absolutely in love with it.\n\nSummary:\n[list]\n[*] Story - 4.5/5.0 [i]Straight-forward, yet complicated.[/i]\n[*] Gameplay - 3.0/5.0 [i]Most weapons are pretty useless. Maybe too easy on Normal difficulty.[/i]\n[*] Music - 5.0/5.0 [i]Elizabeth has a really great voice.[/i]\n[/list]\n\nThe story looks simple at the beginning but slowly gains complexity. Elizabeth, Booker, and the Luteces are all very great characters, but I feel the other ones are sub par and don't leave that great of an impression. I really thought Daisy would be a memorable character but I was disappointed with her character. Personally, I prefer the bright and happy atmosphere of Columbia instead of the gloomy and creepy Rapture. Although the game still has a lot of the gloomy and creepy areas.\n\nThe \"Vigors\" (called \"Plasmids\" in previous games) are all very unique on their own but I never really bothered using them. I probably only used a total of 3 Vigors throughout the game. The guns are also kinda underwhelming. I ended up finishing the whole game with the Carbine and a Pistol since their accuracy is so ridiculous. You can even snipe someone from far away without even zooming in.\n\nThe level design is pretty straight-forward. It's huge enough for you to explore but small enough so that you won't get lost. The previous games had more places to explore though. However, the difficulty is a bit skewed towards the end. Maybe around 70% mark, the difficulty suddenly spikes up then remains like that for the rest of the game. I would prefer the earlier levels to be a bit more difficult though.\n\nThe music is great and I'm absolutely in love with Elizabeth's voice.\n\nI would totally recommend this game for those people who simply want a shooter with great narrative.

game.......Broke me. When I did my first play through back on the old 360, it was amazing. Now, it's even better. On the PC it just seems like there is more character in the physical beings and it's just, different. Almost feels like a different game. I am not gonna spoil anything, but you will start out questioning a lot of stuff and will finish 10000000000 times even worse. From start to finish this game is just spectacular and the ending....man that just, ugh, I don't even know what to say about the ending. All I am gonna say that at no point in this game did I ever go \"oh that's dumb\". And to be honest, this is my favourite game of all time. If you played any of the other Bioshocks, this one is way better. It is definitly the best in the series. Pick it up, full price or not. I dont care. Just experience this masterpiece and know, that the False Shepherd is coming for the Lamb.\n\nUPDATE: I just completed the Game for the Second time and it was even more amazing than my first playthrough. Definitly still my favourite game.\n\nUPDATE #2: I just Completed the DLC Stories (burial at sea episode 1 and 2). They were amazing and completely took me by surprise. They both had different gameplay mechanics from themselves and the main game. They provide a completely new experience and one that you will enjoy. Definitly worth getting the whole package.","timestamp_created":1467023383,"timestamp_updated":1468481383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23857065","author":{"steamid":"76561197968428488","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":645,"last_played":1498066072},"language":"spanish","review":"Es una obra de arte","timestamp_created":1467022468,"timestamp_updated":1467022468,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23857025","author":{"steamid":"76561198122339228","num_games_owned":419,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":289,"last_played":1640954629},"language":"english","review":"Free vigors everywhere, yet only one man uses it.\n\n10/10 would superpower again","timestamp_created":1467022383,"timestamp_updated":1467022383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23857015","author":{"steamid":"76561198133681273","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":168,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43,"last_played":1606214770},"language":"russian","review":"Буке, кач!","timestamp_created":1467022341,"timestamp_updated":1467022341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23856634","author":{"steamid":"76561198095031129","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":742,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":436,"last_played":1467020821},"language":"english","review":"Well, i can definitely say the ending is unexpected, but it all comes together in the end.

Its colorful world and emotive characters demonstrate the developer's desire and ability to craft a living breathing world full of multi-dimensional people.\n\nLike most sci-fi fare the story is a mystery-ride that slowly unravels, but don't expect to solve this puzzle while playing through its significant twists and turns. \n\nIn the end this game spoke to me more as a science fiction experience than simply a shooter. Considering that I can play any number of storyless skill based multi-player shooters BioShock Infinite is a splendid story shooter.\n\n[b]I recommend this game to any fan of the FPS genre, but specifically to fans of story and characters. Bonus points if you are somewhat informed on contemporary physics (but not to the level of Hard Sci-Fi).[/b]","timestamp_created":1466977427,"timestamp_updated":1466977427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23842224","author":{"steamid":"76561198263732735","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":865,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":73,"last_played":1558735476},"language":"english","review":"sexy so so sexy, it runs on my Amd potato rig <3 (it is just a potato, with a ps2 controller plugged in ^^) \n20/1000 would buy again. \nBut i really do love this, like sex but more slow and in the sky.","timestamp_created":1466976036,"timestamp_updated":1466976036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23841946","author":{"steamid":"76561198263340730","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":863,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":763,"last_played":1466886407},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bom","timestamp_created":1466975412,"timestamp_updated":1466975412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23841690","author":{"steamid":"76561198058581103","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1676,"last_played":1407396362},"language":"english","review":"Spent 27 hrs to finish the game (incl. 2 DLC) and then I told myself \"fuck it I am out, not gonna ever touch this again.\"\nLiterally heart-broken\nGJ Irrational Games","timestamp_created":1466974881,"timestamp_updated":1466974881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23841627","author":{"steamid":"76561198064796474","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":637,"last_played":1467162976},"language":"english","review":"Great story, great combat mechanics.
