Games忍不住不跟你分享的点子，它几乎就要跟《银翼杀手》一样令人喜悦。\n\n作为一个DLC，还原一个更高画质的销魂城已经诚意十足，但抛去画面的其他部分就确实不尽人意了。\n\n最终，你在最后可以体验一番伊丽莎白的视角——那个在整个生化冲击系列中陪你度过一半时间的最终要的角色。虹吸塔倒塌之后的伊丽莎白是如此的捉摸不透。算起来，在《无限》和《海葬：第一章》她至少已经成功杀死了玩家2次。——绝对够算得上一个成功的反派。但她却如此令你依赖而又怜惜而又畏惧。Irrational Games在游戏史上塑造出了一个的如此丰满复杂的角色，并悄悄的，把他们自己藏在里面。\n\n伊丽莎白选择了牺牲——至少两次。在《海葬：第二章》里不具有“神性”的她同样因为跨越宇宙而失去了未来的记忆，然而，她已经做出了选择，即便未来已经不在清晰，她知道自己已经做出了选择。她选择抛弃了梦中的塞纳河畔而择葬身海底。同样“没有未来记忆”的玩家则会在《海葬：第二章》中同她一起经历这个已被选择的未来。\n\n于是，伊丽莎白变得像个老女人一样越发的唠叨，在旅途中一点点讲出那些曾经急忙的来不及说的故事，谈到两座城市那些变量，那些常量，谈到那些故事背后的故事。伊丽莎白知道这是最后的一程，正像Irrational Games知道故事走到了结尾；伊丽莎白在那孤独的深海中一直在同“布克”不断交谈，正像Irrational Games一直在孤独的同“你”对话。\n\n哪怕Irrational Games解散，他仍然会选择创造Bioshock，正像哪怕伊丽莎白葬身海底，她仍然会选择拯救莎莉一样。\n\n即便关于那两座城市的故事是那么棒。理想主义者始终敌不过市场经济的事实就跟文章开篇处一样真实。只不过，Irrational Games在这不完美结局的最后一部分把你带回到了故事的开头。像任何痴情男女一样恋恋不舍，带你重新回到初会的瞬间，再次起回忆共同经历过的浪漫。\n\n《无限》为我创造了奇迹。而《海葬》捅破了我的泪腺\n","timestamp_created":1511506922,"timestamp_updated":1511506922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37278835","author":{"steamid":"76561198262016918","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5863,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2180,"last_played":1536964995},"language":"spanish","review":"Uno

Totally enjoyed shooting bad guys while whizzing around on a roller-coaster in the sky. Recommend this game to anyone interested in a story line and fps where sometimes the best solution is NOT to shoot.   Oh! Who cares, shoot em' anyway.

I preordered it and everything. I really loved the other games in the series so I decided I would definitely get this one. I installed it the second I could, expecting it to be good and that maybe I'd put it down after a few hours. The environment was so vibrant and from the very beginning incredibly intriguing. Once I made it into the main sequence of the game I was put in a game world so well thought out that it made any sense of disbelief I had about it wither away. The gunplay was solid, and although at times there was a clunkiness to it, it made no dent in the fun I was having as I blasted away unique enemies with awesome guns and powers throughout the bright and ethereal streets of Columbia. The story kept me on edge almost the entire time and I was eager to find any snippet of information I could about the flying city and the maniacal antagonist, Comstock. Slowly the game drew to a close and everything I thought I knew about the world around me in the game changed. Suddenly my purpose was flipped on its head and I struggled to make sense of things. It was only at the end of the game that all of the questions were answered in such a concise and deep scene that it took me a few moments to process what I had just witnessed. My jaw was left dropped as the noon sun filtered into my room the next day. \n\nHonestly this game was amazing. It was like a great movie and a fantastic book all rolled into one. It left me with a feeling of happiness and simultaneous sadness with its closure that I've not experienced since. With the addition of Burial at Sea things only got better. The gameplay is very much Bioshock and if you like a good story then any sins of the combat can easily be left at the door.\n\nTL;DR\nBuy","timestamp_created":1511492510,"timestamp_updated":1511492510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37251990","author":{"steamid":"76561198107068572","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":644,"last_played":1538046270},"language":"english","review":"Makes

A algum tempo atras - nas epocas de Xbox 360 e jogos pirateados - eu me deparei com o Bioshock 2 comprado pelo meu irmão ( que ironicamente nunca chegou a jogar). \nComo eu era muito pequeno eu não entendia o jogo, so corria e atirava e me divertia muito...\nEm 2011 descobri que sairia o Bioshock Infinite e me empolguei muito.... Tempos de espera depois surge o game na steam e foi a Primeira pré-compra que eu fiz na vida. \nFoi amor a primeira vista... a Historia me envolveu de uma forma que ate os dias de hoje - 4 anos pós o lançamento estou aqui fazendo essa review porque o game me geral não saiu da minha cabeça ate os dias de hoje...\nSem mais delongas, vamos a análise :\n\n[h1] Historia[/h1]\nProvavelmente o que eu mais amo nesse game.\nA história é envolvente, bem feita e vai explodir a sua cabeça, obrigando o player a encontrar respostas e mais respostas nas linhas do game.\nA relação de Booker e Elizabeth se intensifica cada vez mais durante o jogo, você percebe a mudança fisica e mental dos personagens, o sentimento do Booker de culpa e sua redefinição de personalidade, Você sente raiva dos personagens do game, Você fica tenso nas horas tensas, Você sente medo nas horas aterrorizantes, [u]Você VIVE o jogo[/u].\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nNão vou me Aprofundar muito nessa parte porque não vejo motivo pra tal. \nÉ um gameplay muito facil e bem tranquilo de adaptar assim como qualquer shotter. Você pode alterar os controles sempre que necessário para tornar a experiência mais dinâmica. \n\n[h1]Dificuldade[/h1]\nAi varia do player mesmo. Para mim achei o game bem Tranquilo, mas na dificuldade 1999 o Jogo complica e muito....\n\n[h1]GRAFICOS[/h1]\nJogo É MARAVILHOSO ate para os dias de hoje. Columbia, assim como Rapture, possui uma ambientação maravilhosa. A luz na cidade,os cantos, as pessoas, aquela sensação de paz e calmaria... Te faz querer e muito viver na cidade. \nO que eu acho brilhante na ambientação em especial e a LUZ, ela é MUITO BEM FEITA e varia perfeitamente de acordo com o momento no game, de forma a influenciar ate mesmo em como vc julga a cena e a situação...\n\n[h1]FIM[/h1]\nEsse game merece seu dinheiro, seja promo , seja o preço full, ele merece o seu dinheiro.\nA Historia de Bioshock é SURREAL - [b] NÃO SO O INFINITE MAS TODOS OS OUTROS[/b] - e juntos formam uma das melhores franquias existentes na historia. \nSe for comprar, aconselho comprar a franquia toda pra não perder um trechinho da história se quer, vale a pena acompanhar tudo de perto.\n\nBem...
