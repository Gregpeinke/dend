The world building in this game is phenomenal, every single character is wonderful and really add to the story, even the world building through easter eggs and the comic give this game and its story so much depth; the puzzles gradually get more complex and slowly introduce different mechanics while still maintaining the simple idea of only having two portals to work with- each puzzle presents its own unique challenge and they vary enough that they never become boring or tiresome. This game was a pleasure to play and it deserves every ounce of love from its community, I can't believe I waited this long to try it.","timestamp_created":1623449957,"timestamp_updated":1623533934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93589399","author":{"steamid":"76561198342308349","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":815,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":636,"last_played":1624621414},"language":"turkish","review":"Valve'nin düzgün ve bozmadan yapabildiği sayılı şeylerden biri.
