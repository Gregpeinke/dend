Das indizieren wie infizieren klingt ist echt kein Wunder !\n\nAber ich kann darüber hinwegsehen und kann sagen das ich HalfLife mag und ein Remake wie auch schon für Wolfenstein und DOOM wäre echt nicht schlecht !\nIch bin etwas betrübt das ich HalfLife damals nicht gespielt habe da ich es wahrscheinlich so sehr viel mehr und eher zu schätzen gelernt hätte ... wobei das wahrscheinlich auch schlechte Auswirkungen auf meine Sicht der heutigen Spiele gehabt hätte die ich sowieso schon eher kritisch sehe ... liegt vielleicht auch nur am Alter :3 \n\nIch kann das Spiel auf jeden Fall empfehlen wenn ich auch finde das man heute keine 10€ mehr dafür ausgeben sollte - vielleicht motiviert es Valve ja dazu Half Life 3 doch noch zu entwickeln ... wobei ... wenn ich sehe was Valve bisher so raushaut wäre es wahrscheinlich besser wenn sie es lassen !\n\nWas man eben auch keinen Fall erwartet sollte ist ein Spiel das es grafisch mit Spielen aus der Neuzeit aufnehmen kann den das ist ganz sicher nicht der Fall und wird für Leute die nur darauf aus sind oder nichts anderes kennen stark befremdlich sein - so wie ich als ich Spiele aus den 70ern und den 80ern gesehen habe in etwa :D\nWie gesagt - ein Klassiker !\nÜberwältigt bin ich jetzt zwar nicht aber das Spiel hat auf jeden Fall Stil !","timestamp_created":1465304964,"timestamp_updated":1465305145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23434213","author":{"steamid":"76561198127805099","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1462722254},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games of all time","timestamp_created":1465302764,"timestamp_updated":1465302764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492554396390914917","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23429757","author":{"steamid":"76561198152205658","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":3204,"last_played":1659728864},"language":"english","review":"the game won't start up steam should fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1465276096,"timestamp_updated":1465276096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492554396390914917","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23426862","author":{"steamid":"76561198058832034","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":138,"last_played":1586020425},"language":"english","review":"It's half life!

Team Fortress, Counter-Strike and countless amounts of other mods. It had become a hallmark of FPS quality for many years to come until Half-Life 2 came out to raise the bar even higher. This legendary status helps to alleviate the ravages of time the graphics have suffered. But, as any Counter-Strike player will tell you, it is not that bad considering the age of the game, it's still approachable for younger players. The game's design is very variable and interactive, which cannot be said about a myriad of modern shooters. The remarkable sound and authentic music will help to create a memorable, mysterious, sci-fi atmosphere. Xen, being the most criticised part of the game, seemed quite enjoyable to me. It offers a much-needed diversion from the rest of the game, most of which takes place in steel corridors.

Gameplay wise, Half-Life's shooting and combat is smooth, and the interactive environment can cause pretty cool easter eggs, as well as intriguing story pieces to uncover throughout the Black Mesa Facility. Story wise, Half-Life focuses on a silent protagonist, which may seem strange for a story rich game. However, Half-Life's character's silence causes the player to react rather than the character, letting the player feel as if they were in the game, and make choices that reflect on themselves not on the character, which really causes the player to feel as if they form a part of the story.

Bis heute gilt Half-Life als ein Meilenstein und im Folgenden werde ich erläutern, warum diese Aussage stimmt.\n\nStory-5/10\n\nSehr in den Hintergrund gerückt, nur gegen Ende gewinnt die Story etwas an Fahrt dank des G-Man, aber sonst ist die Geschichte im Gegensatz zum Nachfolger nicht weiter von Belang.\n\nGrafik-6/10\n\nTrotz HD-Grafik, sieht Half-Life heutzutage einfach nur noch hoffnungslos veraltet aus. Besonders die Effekte, wie Laserstrahlen, wirken heutzutage geradezu lächerlich. Dennoch wird dies durch das auch noch heutzutage toll aussehende Artdesign wieder wettgemacht.\n\nSound-7/10\n\nDer Soundtrack ist gut, hält sich aber eher im Hintergrund. Sehr gut sind die Geräusche der Gegner und der Umgebung, die einem manchmal einen kalten Schauer über den Rücken laufen lassen.\n\nGameplay-8/10\n\nBeim Gameplay brilliert Half-Life hingegen. Sehr abwechslungsreich und vor allem sehr distinktive Level und Umgebungen machen Half-Life zu einem innovativen und nie langweilig werdendem Abenteuer. Die Shooter-Mechaniken funtionieren einwandfrei und sind sehr flüssig. Besonders das letzte Drittel des Spiels, in dem man auf dem Alienplaneten Xen ist, ist sehr interessant und sorgt nochmal für mehr Abwechslung.\n\nSynchro-6/10\n\nKlingt heutzutage sehr altbacken, da der Sound ziemlich matt klingt. Dennoch hört sich die Synchro sehr gut, obwohl wie auch schon im Nachfolger der G-Man sehr gewöhnungsbedürftig klingt.\n\nGesamtwertung-8/10\n\nHalf-Life ist schwächer als sein Nachfolger, jedoch immer noch auch heutzutage sehr unterhaltsam und definitiv ein Spiel, das jeder Gamer mal gespielt haben sollte. Half-Life legt den Grundstein einer ganzen Shooter-Generation und manifestierte Valve als Spiele-Olymp. Half-Life hat bis heute nichts von seiner Genialität verloren.","timestamp_created":1464469190,"timestamp_updated":1464469308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23258849","author":{"steamid":"76561198089522447","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":119,"last_played":1616187628},"language":"english","review":"get a life they said to me, well i didnt get a life but half one, and its a pretty good one.","timestamp_created":1464463612,"timestamp_updated":1464463612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":42,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524760305881500244","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23256292","author":{"steamid":"76561198135766157","num_games_owned":334,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":1229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":414,"last_played":1586780416},"language":"english","review":"Play this 3 times and you have finished Half-Life 3.","timestamp_created":1464454811,"timestamp_updated":1464454811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23255543","author":{"steamid":"76561198096581997","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":302,"playtime_forever":3323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3323,"last_played":1497828296},"language":"english","review":"a classic","timestamp_created":1464452110,"timestamp_updated":1604417274,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23237150","author":{"steamid":"76561198035101495","num_games_owned":733,"num_reviews":652,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1464367574},"language":"english","review":"A masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1464367653,"timestamp_updated":1464367653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iKTH+dQCfqHSWA=="}
