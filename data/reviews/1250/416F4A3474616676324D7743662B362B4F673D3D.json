If you couldn't tell from what I said earlier, then I absolutely enjoy this game. It is a fantastic game with friends or alone, a 1-6 player zombie survival experience. It is 10 times better than Left For Dead. This statement is subjective however by a technical stand point it is far superior. It is a true survival horror, blood, guts and gore everywhere. The guns are fairly realistic with fantastic recoil and realistic responses. The difficulty is very high and proves a challenge to the best of any FPS players. The game is non linear unlike Left For Dead and offers a lot of playability with 6 classes, 6 levels each and plenty of weapons. This game is fantastic, but the DLC is rather uneeded and overpriced, get the full pack as DLC will most likely not be added after the release of Killing Floor 2.

Всё, в заключении о бедах напишу следующее, KF по-настоящему не хватает шлифовки, солидности, уровня современных стандартов (Даже на тот момент времени) и мне искренне жаль тех, кто имеет хоть какое-то отношение к данному проекту, самих игроков непосредственно и тех, кто пробежавшись глазами прошёл мимо. Это то, что должно было стать несомненно крутым, замечательным во всех смыслах и даже, не побоюсь сказать, прекрасным, но им не стало по ряду причин. Может быть забегу вперед, но уместно было бы упомянуть о намеченном выходе сиквела, в связи с чем надежда не умерла, обратно, она воспряла духом.\n\nВернёмся, и продолжим, но уже о сладком, иначе и не назовёшь. В основном всё то, что будет описано мной в обзоре имеет отношение к высоким уровням сложности и на минуточку, игра может показаться действительно сложной (Если вы конечно не являетесь 1337 персоной или \"играете в пролиге ezggzadrotoff\"), до тех пор, пока не усвоите, либо освоите, кому как больше нравится, установленные истины, а кое-где хитрости. \n\nИтак, для вас сластёны, достаточное разнообразие перков (Классы, профы), под любую манеру игры, отсюда рождается и предыгровое обсуждение, продумывание различных идей с классовыми раскладами, назовём их \"Комбинациями\", с определёнными взаимодействиями и тактиками, связанными с выбором того или иного перка и подбора ему амуниции. Магазин - экономика игры, а она замечательно продумана, уверяю, лучше приходить со списком покупок! :D\n\nМонстры владеют многообразием приёмов (Временами мелькает мысль о том, что орда действуют сообща, тем самым реализуя потенциал своих навыков на полную мощь), не быстры и твёрдо верится, что вы неизбежно контролируйте всю ситуацию, вы здесь босс чёрт возьми, иначе и быть не могло и не может :D Тогда и начинается самое интересное, бдительность спит, а вам начинают доставлять массу неприятностей, пытаясь загнать в угол, не оставив ни малейшего шанса на спасение. По сему требуется максимальная концентрация на игре.\n\nНе можешь - научим, не хочешь - заставим. Тут вам не там, вас вынудят кооперировать свои действия и работать сообща, подтолкнут к мыслям о проявлении заботы к ближнему своему и убедят в том, что командные задачи важнее вашей собственной выгоды. Придётся думать и реагировать, расставлять приоритет целей и координировать действия команды, изучать внутриигровую механику и уметь рассчитывать свои силы. В противном случае пойдёте на корм рыбам...ой, заражённым. Или вы \"волк-одиночка\"?) Не делайте поспешных выводов, вам тоже найдётся здесь место!\n\nИгре подобного плана реиграбельности более чем предостаточно. Ах да, тут и для любителей погорячее или треша, например, открыта масса серверов с индивидуальными настройками и модами. Любителям оригинальности (Классики) хватит с головой: 2-ух режимов игры, разнообразных карт и целого набора, кучи интересных, увлекательных и разнообразных стим-достижений.\n\nИ не хотелось, честно говоря, в своём обзоре затрагивать столь популярный, на сайтах игровой тематики, вопрос, связанный с этой игрой, о проведении параллелей с другим кооперативным монстром - Left 4 Dead, но это действительно актуально, раз обсуждают, поэтому выскажусь.\n\nНикогда не понимал почему два этих продукта постоянно пытаются как-то сравнить между собой, да зомби-апокалипсис, но ведь оба они оригинальны, в корне отличаются и, пожалуй, не имеют достойных конкурентов, у каждого своя изюминка, совершенно различная атмосфера, а самое главное в корне разношёрстный геймплей. И на этом действительно можно поставить точку, как в прямом, так и в переносном смысле, ведь все остальные аргументы и доводы в пользу схожести продуктов будут настолько поверхностными, что списать их можно будет так же легко как отобрать конфетку у ребёнка. В общем с упоением убиваем орды зомби под отличный саундтрек в ожидании выхода второй части, которая должна вобрать в себя всё хорошее, а недочёты исправить.\n\nВсем DOSH! :D\nИ, конечно-же, приятной игры!)","timestamp_created":1429207157,"timestamp_updated":1429207157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503008127212524414","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15402951","author":{"steamid":"76561197979989487","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":134180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":134027,"last_played":1522314200},"language":"english","review":"Endless zombie shooting fun with satisfying guns, amusing voice acting and a lot of different maps to choose from.

Well, you're at the right and wrong place. You've got seven perks to choose from -- \"wahhh why so few that sounds lame.\" LAME? Hell naw, son. \n\nThese perks delve into 6 levels of advancing, and each level dramatically increasing your power as a survival during the Horzine containment outbreak. You've got a job to slaughter each and every zed on the face on Earth. Yeah, even the big guy with the weird eye and freakin' chainsaw arm. \n\nWhen I first watched gameplay of Killing Floor, the players I watched were terrified of the tens of clots slowly limping towards them. Gathering the feeling that I might poop myself as well, I thought I'd give it a go. Today, Fleshpounds are the ones that are terrified of me. \n\nThe content that Tripwire Interactive included in this game are, in no way, pay to win. They are only add-on packs to enhance gameplay with steampunk weapons or ever zed-tuned weapons. All are rad. \n\nKilling Floor 2 Early Access will be released in five days as of writing this review, and I am stoked for what TWI has in store for this game.

I really don't understand it, this game is terrible. The gameplay is repetitive and boring but the most annoying thing in this game is the slow walking. You move like an old grandmother! An old grandmother with one leg! And a doggy attached to her leg! This game should be called \"Walk-like-a-granny-and-her-doggy-simulator\"! I never experienced anything this slow in my life. Playing The Stanley Parabel after this game feels like playing Burnout. I pressed the s***t out of my \"W\"-button to get, by any chance, just a little bit faster than this 0,003 miles/hour! I almost punched a hole in my desk while pressing the walk-button as hard as I could. I have muscle ache in my finger every time I play this game. I even tried to find a cheat to go faster (it works with the negative weight-trick, but it takes so much effort to do it every time)! I can feel my life passing by when I move. No, seriously, I feel my hair and my fingernails grow, I feel getting wrinkles in my skin and my bones getting brittle when I play Killing Floor. This game sucks out your life. But guess what - there is actually a button to go even slower...serious. No joke. I'm not kidding. This is for the real sadistic players who want to experience the full load of perpetuity in slowmo-hell. It's like a neverending commercial for shampoo where a beautiful lady shakes her voluminous hair to smooth jazzmusic. But just without the lady and the smooth jazz. Imagine just this slowmo-loop. And you're in it. That's Killing Floor.\nWhy...why, oh why did you do that, beloved developers? Is this supposed to be fun? Well, It isn't!\n\nAh yeah, and the difficulty...wow. \"Easy\" is really easy, but never think about changing it to \"normal\", because then you will suffer a tragic death in minutes, because these stupid Clots grab you and you have no chance of getting away. Sure you can train to get better and master the normal difficulty, but there are so many better games out there (and faster as well) so I choose another one instead.\n\nBut ther is actually one nice thing in this game: the weapon desing. The weapons are really cool and fun, if the developers would just had invested a little bit more time in the gameplay than just the weapon-designs.","timestamp_created":1428965690,"timestamp_updated":1428965690,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15340377","author":{"steamid":"76561198156052644","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":670,"last_played":1429391749},"language":"english","review":"10 10\n","timestamp_created":1428955742,"timestamp_updated":1428955742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15338602","author":{"steamid":"76561197980482371","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14446,"last_played":1441076075},"language":"english","review":"The game has kept its simplicity and team dynamics over the years.
