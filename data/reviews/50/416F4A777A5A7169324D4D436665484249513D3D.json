Opposing Force is a great expansion to Half Life 1. It takes a different approch on the Half Life series. By making you a soldier for the United States Marines by the name of Adrian Shepard. You have been detached to the Black Mesa research facilty to rescue the scientists and deal with the alien problem. Though not everything goes as planed. When the government sends a strike team to kill everyone at Black mesa including you and your fellow marines. The story is very compeling in this game really wanted to know what the hell was going on and why this was happening and as you discover more things about the story it makes it even more enjoyable. The gameplay is great to it is basicly the same as Half Life 1 so it's pretty good on it's own right. There are less puzzles so if you liked Half Life but got sick of puzzles you should get this. Another good factor of the game is it's weapon varitey, and holy shit there are so many like the Barnicle gun being my personal favorite. One more thing that made this game excellent was it's length, for an  expansion its long it could very well be a hole other game which is good so you get more for what you payed for. Unlike other Half Life expansions such as blue shift, you get a good game but it feels very short and could have had more potential. over all though Opposing Force is a great expansion and I recomended it to new Half Life fans or any FPS fans aswell. My final verdict is a 10/10 Awesome Ass Game!","timestamp_created":1400477591,"timestamp_updated":1400477591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10149488","author":{"steamid":"76561197988125266","num_games_owned":306,"num_reviews":140,"playtime_forever":745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":745,"last_played":1400341916},"language":"english","review":"Another expansion pack for the original HL, this time giving us a look into the \"enemy side\" and the way that the events of Black Mesa affected the Marine Corps called to \"contain\" the situation.

You have the medic who can heal you and your allies, the engineer who can cut through inaccessable areas and your standard infantry solider who helps you during firefights. The friendly AI is quite rudimentary and you will often witness your allies wandering out into the open and getting cut down by enemies.\n\nThe enemies you face are similar to those in Half-Life but with a few interesting additions. The aliens you face are more varied as are the weapons you can use to take them down.

Instead of being a scientist who is trying to fight for his life, you are now Adrian Shephard, A Corporal rank soldier who, alongside his platoon, has been sent to Black Mesa to clean up the problems that have occured there.\n\nAnd the mission goes to hell pretty damn fast.\n\nWhat was supposes to be a simple clean up mission for Adrian suddenly becomes a similar situation that Gordon had - a fight for survival. If Adrian must endure the madness of Black Mesa, he must adapt to his surroundings, use anything he can get his hands on, rely on those willing enough to help and use his military training plus his own wit to it's full potential. So far, Opposing Force does Half Life justice by sticking with a similar story with a lot of great ideas that contrast very well with it's predecessor, so that it doesn't become too similar.\n\nBut what about the gameplay? Does it do justice to Half Life too? First off, due to the fact that you are now a Soldier instead of a Black Mesa Employee, there ane new friendly NPCs, who of which are Soldiers, Engineers, and Medics. All of which are a great help and can back each other up. And due to the way the story starts, you won't need to kill the survivors of Black Mesa (which was what the Military was sent for), the security guards and scientists of Black Mesa will still lend you a helping hand throughout the story. When it comes to weapons, sadly not all of the guns and gadgets that were in the original game make it back. However, all of the weapons that haven't made it back have been replaced with new and, surprisingly, BETTER weapons. Remember the Crowbar? You now have a stronger Combat Knife! How about the .357 Magnum? Now a Desert Eagle, which is faster and comes with a Laser sight! All the new weapons are not just replacements though, For instance, there is a new LMG weapon which is an absolute blast to use and feels completely different from the weapons that were in the original. Overall as far as weapons go, Opposing Force gives you more than just new and improved weapons. Heck I didn't even think the weapons needed to be replaced with better ones, seems what wasn't broken got fixed anyway. There are new Enemy NPC's too, and they fit very well into the Half Life Universe, such as a bigger zombie, Alien Shock Troopers and since the Military are on your side now, the enemy soldiers have been replaced with different Human enemies, I won't spoil who they are but they are a worthy replacement, seeing that they were also enemies of a different sort in the original game, now taking over another role. And the Level design is just as superb as the original, but with the inclusion of new weapons and NPCs, we get to see a load of new puzzles and situations that couldn't be done in the original game. Oh! and you can climb and swing on ropes now! Which adds to some cool things! So, as far as Gameplay goes, everything is better.\n\nGraphically, yeah I guess it is just as blocky and wooden as the original, but there are some really varied looking levels again, even the training level looks great! The new aliens look fearsome and formiddable. Again Half Life uses real time cutscenes, which is always a treat, not to mention they are well written.\n\nWhen it comes to audio again, the game sounds just as good as the original, the aliens sound angry, the guns are loud, the soundtrack is excellent and the voiceacting is superb. Soldiers now have different voice lines as well as a different voice actor  since they are now on your side, but they are a joy to hear... in a cheesy Star Fox sorta way. \"MAN MY DOGS ARE BARKIN'!\"\n\nBut is there anything wrong with Half Life: Opposing Force? Sadly, there are a few issues. First off, the glitch that can get you stuck in the level terrain is still present, but again it doesn't happen very often. And... as much as I hate saying it, due to the fact you can get more teammates with more aggresive firepower, the remarkable AI from the original starts to show some of it's issues. For example, Sometimes, soldiers will not realise to stop shooting when the player is in their way of the enemy target, they'll even shoot if the player hasn't walked in the way and was already standing there, if I recall. Another little nitpick I have is that friendly Medics don't heal their own wounded teammates. However, the AI is still great, especially the enemy AI, as it's still relentless as it was in the original game. My last major gripe is the end boss, although was a bit challenging, I thought it was a bit too straight forward compared to the original.\n\nTl;dr, Half Life: Opposing Force does justice to it's predecessor and is possibly one of the best Expansion packs I have ever had the joy of playing, and for an Expansion pack to add so much to an already perfect game is mesmarising. I may as well consider it a separate game from it's predecessor. Not only that, this was technically Gearbox Sofware's first ever project, and  considering how well made Opposing Force was, it was one hell of a way to start them off into the gaming industry. If you enjoyed Half Life, buy it. If you never played Half Life, buy it anyway!","timestamp_created":1398249090,"timestamp_updated":1398277004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532467544078826904","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9898777","author":{"steamid":"76561198118654436","num_games_owned":663,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":3924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2169,"last_played":1629639099},"language":"english","review":"this is one of the best add on games made with awesome level design and shows gearboxes very early love for big guns cause theres alot of guns to use...","timestamp_created":1398163427,"timestamp_updated":1408970869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9882045","author":{"steamid":"76561197980875210","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1159,"last_played":1524309019},"language":"english","review":"In my view better than HL2 ,","timestamp_created":1398006414,"timestamp_updated":1398006414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9875173","author":{"steamid":"76561198053862076","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":6740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6257,"last_played":1573588682},"language":"english","review":"Thsi gam sis the shhitt","timestamp_created":1397945224,"timestamp_updated":1397945249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498978674411773682","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9867409","author":{"steamid":"76561198039735138","num_games_owned":1368,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":361,"last_played":1597632351},"language":"english","review":"nostalgia at its finest","timestamp_created":1397884163,"timestamp_updated":1397884163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9858536","author":{"steamid":"76561198064780036","num_games_owned":300,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":94,"last_played":1454410795},"language":"english","review":"god DANG IT, TIS iz best game!","timestamp_created":1397809269,"timestamp_updated":1397809269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9823536","author":{"steamid":"76561197972906201","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1397551110},"language":"english","review":"It's a bit buggy and I have to do the annoying \"-nofbo\" command or whatever at the beginning to get it to actually start up, but other than that it's been great playing this game again!!
