Why? Because currently it is priced around the same level and the sequel has all the campaigns from the previous game included! This means more than a dozen levels with continuous zombie shooting!\n\nIn any case, this, just like its sequel, is an excellent game. Although it was released more than 5 years ago I believe it aged well - the game still looks good thanks to the well-developed Source Engine. Years later Valve released many updated including DLCs that expand upon the campaigns - the latest, The Sacrifice, came out in 2010.\n\nLeft 4 Dead is a great game! It is a coop-based, action-oriented survival horror game. It is pure fun to get rid of the continuous hordes of zombies with friends game after game! A highly recommended game and not just for the fans of the genre!\n","timestamp_created":1404690270,"timestamp_updated":1404690270,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":74,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.771081507205963135","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11108291","author":{"steamid":"76561198051885655","num_games_owned":363,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":298,"last_played":1440049821},"language":"english","review":"The first zombie game from valve that started the apocalypse!

There are no melee weapons, which I've come to find annoying because of the people who tend to use them (weaving in and out of my line of fire), and the most annoying special infected are gone - jockeys, spitters and chargers. Shotguns are also a lot better in this version. They seem to have a tad more kick and have way more ammo. That said, it was maybe a good thing they were nerfed; I don't know.\n\nAnother thing I like is the graphical style. It's moodier, darker and more atmospheric than in the sequel.\n\nThere are no bile jars or defibs/chest paddles. Make of that what you will. I'm not entirely too fussed they aren't here - especially not the bile jars. Pipe bombs are good enough for me.\n\nHowever, there are some definite downsides to this version of the game. There are fewer campaigns availible (L4D2 has all the campaigns included in this game as well as its own original ones) - there's basically half as many iirc - and there are fewer game modes.\n\nSo this is a great game on its own, but both this and Left 4 Dead 2 cost the same and the latter is pretty much superior. But if you like Left 4 Dead 2 a lot and can get this version cheap I'd say go for it.","timestamp_created":1404608724,"timestamp_updated":1404608724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11092514","author":{"steamid":"76561198007978762","num_games_owned":740,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":472,"last_played":1403392502},"language":"polish","review":"Warto zacząć od jedynki, gdyż dwójka jest zdecydowanie lepsza.

Русскоязычных игроков настолько много, что они попадаются почти в каждой игре, так что для нашего отечественного игрока нет поводов для беспокойств.

Personally, I feel L4D1 is more of a true horror zombie game than L4D2 will ever be. In my opinion, the zombie models are scarier here (you won't see these better models in the L4D2 version of these maps), the atmosphere is amazing, and the characters just go more in to detail. \n\nEven today, I sometimes find myself playing L4D1 while I see my friends play L4D2 and that just brings me to conclude that L4D1 is the better game and is the horror that I would recommend to anybody who takes an interest in this franchise. To me, Valve completely messed up their new L4D2 maps as the characters weren't fitting at all for a zombie apoloclpyse nor did they take it seriously. The new special infected in L4D2 were a complete joke (I mean, seriously.....a man humping monkey...) and the atmosphere made the game seem terrible in terms of horror. I swear....when I first got L4D1, I pissed my pants (Literally) in 2008 when I played No Mercy as I got pounced by a guy in a hoodie for the first time.

I'm reviewing this game in 2014 and I haven't played it competitively for a few years now. To me, this game excels best at the competitive level, much like CS:GO, in which teamwork is mandatory as well as individual skill. The L4D Versus mode was the mode I loved most. Just being able to coordinate with my fellow infected members via voice chat to pounce onto the survivors in a timely manner was such an exciting event. Sadly, the community is quite scarce in this game in 2014 so there is no real going back without playing the same people over and over. Single player, on the other hand, is still very much viable. I remember single player being fun at first, but once you master the mechanics of the game single player becomes quite easy on the hardest difficulty. Still, I've dished over 1000+ hours into this game so I can't help but say, this is a great game!
