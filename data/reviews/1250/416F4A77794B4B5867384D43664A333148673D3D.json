It does however do well at making the players work together. Two people working as a team can wreak havoc in hard mode whereas six people that don't will only end up failing in normal.

And the objective mode that makes you go and do tasks for different people in order to survive. The game has long and intense gun fights that are always fun to play and challenge yourself with different kinds of weapons. the game is very big but has little change of gameplay its basicly run , shoot , buy , and boss fight although even if the gameplay is not that original or different its still a lot of fun to play.\n\nThe game is very challenging and is a lot like Payday 2 in the fact that you pretty much need some people to help you out in the missions or else its almost impossible to make it.

When you start a match, you can choose a Perk, making you suited for a role (ex. Medic, Support Specialist, and Commando), you can change the perk at any time though, and you level up the perks gradually, helping you face harder difficulties (which you can select at any time). As a team, or alone, you face waves of genetically modified clones, that each have unique traits (for example, one type can cloak, another can walk on walls and leap far distances). At the end wave, you fight a \"Boss\" of sorts, that has a rocket launcher on its shoulder, and a chaingun for an arm. Yeah, it can be as hard as it sounds. \n\nThat's how a standard match goes, but as of late, objective based maps have also been introduced, and the Developers make special events for holidays and seasons, and also update things just for the sake of supporting the game, and adding new stuff. You can also shake things up a bit with mods, which you can easily get on the Steam Workshop. Mods include maps (which can have objectives or special things like acid floors, for instance), weapons, character models, and even unique gamemodes, like one that is directly based on the Aliens franchise. \n\nOverall, I would say that it is a very addicting game with extensive support from the developers and the community. It is also fairly cheap, and honestly, it is not much of a risky buy, because it is honestly just so addicting (coming from a FPS lover).","timestamp_created":1387416568,"timestamp_updated":1387416568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5461578369140625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8110678","author":{"steamid":"76561198080802626","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":303,"last_played":1590138602},"language":"english","review":"Its the best shit ever if you like zombies now go get fucked by zombies or go fuck them!\n","timestamp_created":1387415198,"timestamp_updated":1387415198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8110670","author":{"steamid":"76561198041465516","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":7376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6468,"last_played":1640318237},"language":"english","review":"The combination of the variety of weapons and the difficulty of the creatures makes this wave-based game a delight.
