Al parecer no le tenían mucha fé, y por eso lo lanzaron junto a otros juegos para justificar el precio. Sin embargo, para mí, la joya de The Orange Box fue justamente Portal. Me quedé fascinado con la mecánica del juego desde que la ví en un trailer. No dudé en jugarlo casi apenas salió y no me desilusionó. La mecánica funcionaba muy bien y los desarrolladores supieron hacer puzzles interesantes con ella. Además de eso, había un personaje que unía toda la experencia: GLaDOS. Esa voz computarizada que al principio parece normal y en mal funcionamiento se convierte lentamente en un personaje completo con motivaciones propias y un odio inexplicable al jugador.\n\nDicho todo esto, cuando terminé el juego quería más. Quería saber más del mundo que vagamente te contaban en el juego. Y obviamente quería una secuela. Pero un miedo rondaba mi cabeza... [i]\"las segundas partes nunca fueron buenas\"[/i] dice el refrán. ¿Podría que ninguna secuela consiga el mismo efecto en mí que el original? \n\nBueno, estoy contento en afirmar que estuve equivocado. El juego logra salir de la (gran) sombra del juego anterior y forma una identidad propia, expandiendo la mecánica original de los portales con otros elementos que añaden un nivel de complejitud a los puzzles. Totalmente recomendable.","timestamp_created":1403732044,"timestamp_updated":1403732044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10811229","author":{"steamid":"76561198078995391","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":682,"last_played":1546212096},"language":"portuguese","review":"otimo jogo","timestamp_created":1403731893,"timestamp_updated":1403731893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10810644","author":{"steamid":"76561198031703464","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1518,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1349,"last_played":1504761180},"language":"english","review":"10/10/10/10/10.

I have never been so wrong.\n\nPortal 2 has become one of my favorite games of all time. It's levels are neither too easy as to be boring nor too difficult to become extremely frustrating, making for a challenging and entertaining game. Each level is also very unique, which allows for the campaign to be easily replayable, as you will probably forget how to solve almost every puzzle. CO-OP is also a pleasure, as two people can share in the fun as they work together to solve a puzzle, and it is complete with high-fives and rock-paper-scissor matches.\n\nWhat really caught me off guard, however, was the story, which drew me in and motivated me to complete the levels. Valve also adds humor to a futuristic lab environment in ways that are absolutely hilarious (and sometimes very cold).\n\nAll in all, I give Portal 2 a 9/10 and would reccomend it to anyone who likes somewhat of a challenge.","timestamp_created":1403708563,"timestamp_updated":1403708563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10796147","author":{"steamid":"76561198076171826","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":972,"last_played":1593715708},"language":"russian","review":"Ну что ж, вот и подошёл мой портальный марафон к концу.
