The graphics are quite archaic, but remain serviceable nonetheless. The gameplay was the most interesting part for me personally, because it was far more strategic than what I'm used to. While this game is still viewed as one of the defining titles of the FPS genre, I think Its affect on the industry has lessened over time. Not many games uphold this tactical type of gameplay, which does suck, but helps prolong the seldom seen uniqueness of it. I struggled with this game and its many quirks a multitude of times over my entire playthrough because not only does it utilize such a rare form of gameplay (as I mentioned before), I also have not gotten used to keyboard and mouse controls. So this game slowly became a learning experience for me, and that is quite endearing. I'm absolutely more in touch with this control scheme than I was beforehand, and I will always have this game to thank for that.\n\nHonestly, the story is told rather cryptically and any plot elements are either vague, or non-existent. exposition is also rather sparse, which I did appreciate . . . for the most part. I went into this game knowing nothing except Gordon Freeman, G-man, Headcrab, and weird baby I didn't have any context for. I left knowing pretty much the same stuff as before, along with a few smaller details such as Xen, and Black Mesa. I do hope the sequel has a better knack for storytelling than this one (from what I've heard, it does), because this just didn't do it for me.\n\nThe design and atmosphere was VERY well done. I was blindsided  by the sudden alien race quickly consuming everything, and I had not anticipated how horror focused some of the chapters are. the earlier chapters were more centered on the grotesque question of \"What is happening?\", with the latter half forming into disturbing wonder at the answer. but it manages to uphold the sci-fi horror tone the whole way through, and I was a big fan of it.\n\nOverall, the game has without a doubt been hampered by the sands of time and the marching forward of its industry, but it still is very much worth playing, and I for one am glad I chose to do so.","timestamp_created":1630727636,"timestamp_updated":1630727636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98748546","author":{"steamid":"76561198796546978","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":955,"last_played":1630755077},"language":"english","review":"very
