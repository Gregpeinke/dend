Extremely funny dialogue, great fluid gameplay, unique fresh game design, some of the latter puzzles will make you stop and actually use your brain to solve them... it's just amazing, truly amazing. The only complaint I ever had with, Portal, was it's fairly short, beatable in around 4-5 hours, but Portal 2 is much longer with extra mechanics to keep it fresh and addictive.\n\nOf course, it's getting old now but it still holds up fantastically. Anyone worried about the graphics/textures being outdated and distracting, just downsample or use Nvidia DSR from 2160p and it looks fine, not Crysis 3 amazing, but not bad and doesn't distract you from the gameplay.\n\nPortal is from back when, Valve made awesome, amazing, industry changing games. I played, Portal first back then and it blew my mind. Then 2 weeks ago I saw it in the summer sale and released I no longer owned it, as I gave my old Steam account to my nephew a few years ago when he first became a PC gamer so he had things to play. So I bought, Portal and Portal 2 for less than €2 for both...

Man this game was so worth the long wait, im damn late to the party but damn it feels good...the cake really was a lie...\n\nIf you are still part of the group who never played portal and would like to give it a chance like i was, by all means please do yourself a favor and pick it up.\n\nNext up on my list of games to get...Portal 2...i can't wait","timestamp_created":1499914009,"timestamp_updated":1499915928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33493743","author":{"steamid":"76561198115705703","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":146,"last_played":1499904927},"language":"brazilian","review":"Uma pena ter uma campanha tão curta, mas muito recomendado","timestamp_created":1499913599,"timestamp_updated":1499913599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33492373","author":{"steamid":"76561198400185935","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":516,"last_played":1572151774},"language":"spanish","review":"¿Qué se puede decir de Portal a estas alturas, que no se haya dicho ya?\nLo resumiría en: corto y bueno.

It's cleverly made, so that the player will feel Chell's feelings and step inside her shoes, without replying on extreme violence and blood to convey the fear and distress that she experiences.\nThe puzzles are of medium difficulty, I'd say a 7/10 and they have more than just one way to be solved. The player is allowed to express their creativity and they aren't made to follow the same path as everyone else.\n\nThe only thing that I disliked about the game, where the first 10 or so, chapters.

Нам предстоит пораскинуть мозгами и пройти множество головоломок, так или иначе связанных с порталами. Управление очень даже простое, нам понадобится от силы 8 кнопок.  В этом заключпется особенность игры, в Portal важен не скил, а логическое мышление.\nТеперь расскажу немного о сюжете, возможны спойлеры, поэтому текст скрыт (чтобы его увидеть, просто наведите на него курсор мыши). [spoiler] В самом начале игры мы оказываемся в некоем научно-исследовательском центре и наша задача - помочь им в изучении \"природы порталов\". Об этом нам сообщает механический женский голос ГЛэДОС, который (до поры до времени) помогает нам проходить задание, давая подсказки, снабжая нас полезной информацией или просто мотивируя (хотя бывали и исключения). Когды мы пройдём основные испытнания, вдруг окажется, что после того, как мы помогли нашему любимому центру, нам предстоит умереть. Смерти мы избегаем и теперь нам предстоит использовать все полученные навыки чтобы выжить. А чтобы выжить, нам прийдётся уничтожить нашего былого спутника. И теперь советы нам даёт не забавнй механический женскиий голос, а рисунки, оставленные предыдущими испытателями, сделанные кровью. Всё это приведёт нас к последнему, весьма лёгкому боссфайту, где мы должны по частям уничтожить ГЛэДОС. Когда мы это сделаем, мы спасёмся и увидим достаточно оригинальные субтитры. [/spoiler]\nПодытожим. Portal это очень интересная и оригинальная головоломка с немного странноватым сюжетом, но увлекательным геймплеем.
