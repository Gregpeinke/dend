It all started to blend didn't it? And then that fateful day, Half-Life hit the scene; VALVe's very first game.\n\nThe world of video games would never be the same after that.[/b]\n\n--\n\nI think it's fair to assume that everyone and their mother have played or at least seen Half-Life before, as its legacy show. However, if you happen to be one of 7 people who haven't played it yet, let me indulge you for a moment as to why this one of the greatest games ever made.\n\n[u]The Story[/u]\nMost of us are familiar with the \"experiment gone wrong\" story. It's a classic archtype to set up; however, Half-Life did it in a way that was different from most other stories. In fact, HL's storytelling was much different to just about every first-person shooter up to that point. Most FPS's at the time required that the character go from point A to point B, while the story, if any, was backseat to the gameplay. Half-Life said \"Fuck that nonsense.\", and went the understated route, putting the story firsthand by actually pushing characters with dialouge, and putting you firsthand in Freeman's eye's to the whole time; no cutscenes are in the game whatsoever. And that's a good thing.\n\n[u]The Gameplay[/u]\nNow HL never reinvented the wheel when it came to gunplay. In fact, some would say it's downgraded in terms of other FPS's at the time, by not relying on arena-style combat with massive body explosions and having dozens of weapons. What HL did do was make the weapons feel fun. All the guns have a strong feel to them, like they would knock you back real hard, and all the enemies in the game give satistfying death squeel that makes you feel like a badass. Speaking of enemies, the A.I. is some of the best seen in any game, even today. Enemies will react to you appropiately as you feel they would, but no one enemy will feel cheaply hard or too easy relative to who they are, if that makes any sense. \n\nThe game itself is very fast paced, with you moving from one area to the next at a breakneck pace. Nothing feel like it's dragging on, and sometimes you can get lost in the moment as one minute you are fighting soldiers, and the next it's aliens; this is a textbook example of pacing at it's finest.\n\n[u]The Graphics[/u]\nI won't lie, the graphics of HL have not aged the best. The game has clearly shown its age at this point, and even with the HD texture pack that comes with the Blue Shift expansion, that game still looks rather dated. However, none of this is to say that the game looks terrible by any means; in fact at the time of release, it was one of the best looking games on the market. The GoldSrc Engine was increadibly advanced for the time and pulled off some pretty advance textures and modeling at the time. And with the HD pack, the game still looks decent, even now.\n\nNow Black Mesa: Source, well, that's a topic for a different day...\n\n[u]Overall[/u]\nIt's clear that I love this games. It's clear that millions of other people love this game as well, as the score and sales proves that. The game has left a legacy that few other games have touched, and the sequals would continue to improve the series and be considered legends in themselves.\n\nNo game is perfect though, and even with Half-Life I must come to terms with this fact. Like I said ealier, its age is clearly shown, and as a side effect of this, it's a difficult game. Hard as hell even; it may just turn you off to it because of this. Keep in mind though, that this is just a factor of it being from the 90's, when all games were a kick-to-the-balls difficult. If you can push through it, then a great game awaits you beyond.\n\nTo me, this game is near perfect; so good in so many ways that any negatives are mearly nitpicking. You owe it to yourself, as a gamer or not, to at least try HL, and seen why it has left such an impact on the game industry.\n\n[b]Score: 9.8 out of 10[/b]","timestamp_created":1393136081,"timestamp_updated":1394719769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9227363","author":{"steamid":"76561198041299798","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1496,"last_played":1467059684},"language":"english","review":"in my opinion you can't call yourself a gamer untill you've played and beaten this GEM of a game!","timestamp_created":1393124421,"timestamp_updated":1393124421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9224724","author":{"steamid":"76561197997036187","num_games_owned":1294,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1713,"last_played":1399065475},"language":"english","review":"the first thing I noticed is cpu taking control of the game while you see yourself moving - you can control seeing the environment. for those who want to get right on to a game especially the first this is not for you. on the first game you have minor control as I said and that's different from just watching an intro video. the story is excellent and develops to a complete fps game of quality for the time created.

Я начал играть в неё еще с 5 лет и до сих пор мне эта игра нравится. Half-Life поражает не графикой (что оставляет желать лучшего), не эффектами, а тем на сколько погружаешься в игру. Со временем уже не замечаешь: расплытые текстурки, NPC с \"угловатыми\" моделями и плохой анимацией. Вся постановка сюжета завораживающа. На протяжении игры меня не оставляло чувство загадочности. Возраст этого шутера впечатляет, не каждая игра может похвастаться таким возрастом. В то время как Half-Life вышел, он произвел тогда самую настоящую, не побоюсь сказать такое слово, революцию в мире игр. Разработчики Valve всем показали как надо делать игры.\n   Главное дейсвующее лицо в Half-Life - Гордон Фримен, физик-ядерщик. Все начинается с того, что Гордона направляют в тестовую камеру для проведения стандартного анализа кристалла. Последствия эксперимента, однако, оказываются катастрофическими. Гордона посылают на верх для вызова подмоги. Позже он обнаруживает, что эта \"подмога\" истребляет все живое в Черной Мезе, как монстров (есле так можно назвать их), так и людей, находящихся там. Позже он узнаёт от ученых из группы \"Лямбда\", что портал, между земным пространством и параллельным миром, удерживает огромный пришелец под названием Nihilant (Нихилант). Ученые отправляют его в параллельный мир, для того чтобы он уничтожил Нихиланта. Вот краткое описание сюжета.\n   Сегодняшние современные дети, посмотрев на эту игру, скажут: \"Фууууу, тут же графа отстой\"- наигравшись в какие-то там GTA4, Warface, Call of duty. Так вот, главное в игре далеко не графика, а сам сюжет игры, чем Half-Life и поражает.

Ahh, the flaws of scoring and the sorry state of game journalism. GameSpot reports that it was revolutionary for its time but the improvements are very technical in nature, and because of that now obsolete. The game doesn’t stand the test of time, at least for me.\n\nMaps in Half-Life make sense and it’s actually quite fun to come across a closed door that you later open from the other side. Of course after going through several tunnels, ladders, stairs, vents, cold room and some rubble. Unfortunately save for some crates here and there, there isn’t much interactivity in the environment. NPCs are scarce and don’t do much, usually just deliver a line of monologue or two. In the end it’s just the player character that can save the world, because nobody else is competent enough. And how our hero saves the world? By killing everything that moves, jumping on pipes and pressing occasional buttons.\n\nLater is just more of the same: shooting things in the face, crawling through vents, destroying crates with a crowbar and jumping through obstacles. I don’t really understand how all those reviewers could list story or varied gameplay as the strong points of Half-Life.\n\nI like the sound effects. It seems like some areas where specifically made to showcase some of them.\n\nI played it a lot in multiplayer in high school and it was super fun then. On the other hand, even mediocre games are fun when played with a bunch of friends.

The story line is great in the fact that it is... the best adjective for this would be transparent. I do not mean that it is easy to see what comes next, and in fact it throws you several curveballs which mix up the gameplay even more. What I mean by transparent is that if all you care about is blasting aliens, the story will fade into the background and the dialouge will bother you no more than a blast from your shotgun straight into a zombie's face. Conversly, however, if you enjoy deep narratives with mysteries and solutions around every turn, Half-Life will delight you as well as you catch sight of some graffiti on a wall, overhear your enemies talking about your activities or even catch a rare glimpse of an odd man in a dark suit.

BUY IT !!\nPS : EVITEZ néanmoins de préférer sa version Source, pleine de bogues de script, et plutôt vide de nouveautés, vu son prix.","timestamp_created":1391877577,"timestamp_updated":1391877765,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9014098","author":{"steamid":"76561198042186384","num_games_owned":470,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1437687602},"language":"english","review":"Its Half Life, why the hell are you looking at its reviews?\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1391839445,"timestamp_updated":1391839445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478468894958496094","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9010117","author":{"steamid":"76561198011354635","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":316,"last_played":1632345802},"language":"english","review":"This game is fucking awesome.
