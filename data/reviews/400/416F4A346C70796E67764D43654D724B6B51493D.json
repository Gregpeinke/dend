At first your surroundings seem pristine and untouched, but things quickly reveal themselves to be quite a bit more complicated than that. I do mean quickly too, this game only takes about two hours to beat. The music is really cool and helps pick up some of the slack that the visuals should've been carrying. The puzzles themselves are neat but once you beat them they will never present a challenge again meaning this game isn't very replayable. There's a few bonus puzzles after the main game  though and they're actually really hard and took me a little while to beat.","timestamp_created":1593566274,"timestamp_updated":1593566274,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71772331","author":{"steamid":"76561198826121685","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1652745922},"language":"english","review":"Its the portal gun from gmod but with prebuilt levels.","timestamp_created":1593566251,"timestamp_updated":1593566251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71772254","author":{"steamid":"76561198881313124","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":420,"last_played":1593565802},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom, mas não é demorado","timestamp_created":1593566165,"timestamp_updated":1593566165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71771863","author":{"steamid":"76561197971907370","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1612078540},"language":"english","review":"10+ years later and this is still a classic - enjoyable and hugely amusing wrt the writing.","timestamp_created":1593565569,"timestamp_updated":1593565569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71770657","author":{"steamid":"76561198439279960","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3928,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3617,"last_played":1658337283},"language":"english","review":"Awesome Game!","timestamp_created":1593563951,"timestamp_updated":1593563951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71770322","author":{"steamid":"76561198349571533","num_games_owned":308,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1593563429},"language":"english","review":"Its fun and really good for such an old game but considering its length and age it should be a lot cheaper.","timestamp_created":1593563535,"timestamp_updated":1593563535,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.452785253524780273","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71770067","author":{"steamid":"76561198379418266","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1635198048},"language":"english","review":"Great game but the second one was even better","timestamp_created":1593563204,"timestamp_updated":1593563204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71770018","author":{"steamid":"76561198921466803","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":383,"last_played":1631411271},"language":"english","review":"pretty good","timestamp_created":1593563145,"timestamp_updated":1593563145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71769825","author":{"steamid":"76561198068200415","num_games_owned":299,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":97,"last_played":1603776343},"language":"english","review":"im too dumb for this shhitt","timestamp_created":1593562876,"timestamp_updated":1593562891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71767487","author":{"steamid":"76561198204228251","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":324,"last_played":1558795600},"language":"brazilian","review":"Pare de ler e JOGUE!!

If you haven't played the game yet, go do that.\n\nPortal, stylized P0RTAL, is a game that was, and still is, groundbreaking for its time. At least, in the industry of polished video games.\n\nConcepts for the game had already been developed and released, with Portal itself being based off of an independent developer's work, entitled \"Narbacular Drop\". The work had less similarities with Portal, but had a core concept in it. Place portal one place, place another portal somewhere else, and walk through them to complete puzzles/challenges. I don't know much about the game, so I won't go too in depth.\n\nOne of the things that makes Portal so immersive is its story. Erik Wolpaw was a writer for the game, working with Chet Faliszek, to make a story that tells itself through drips and not flows. This kind of story-telling makes the universe that Portal is in seem mysterious. It's subtly hinted at that Portal takes place in the universe of Half-Life 2, a detail which most other people playing this game wouldn't spot on their first playthrough. You can spot Black Mesa's logo as one of the many images GLADos displays at the end of the game. Speaking of which.\n\nThere are barely any characters in the original Portal. The most we get is a protagonist and an antagonist. The protagonist is Chell, the silent protagonist of Portal. What makes her slightly different from most other protagonists in Valve's games is that she usually doesn't wield a gun, but a portal gun. Also, she's a woman. The antagonist is GLADos, that is a robot. The protagonist usually doesn't interact with GLADos until the very end of the story, when an \"epic\" boss battle occurs. GLADos can filter the entire facility with neurotoxins, but is basically stopped doing so by the \"cores\" GLADos has. Or, I guess had. \n\nThere are many things that many other reviews have covered, but I'm trying to cover some things. If you want a full review, go on YouTube or read the most helpful reviews here. My review is probably gonna be buried under the hundreds of better ones.","timestamp_created":1593530166,"timestamp_updated":1593530166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71737755","author":{"steamid":"76561198999234060","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":320,"last_played":1594385602},"language":"ukrainian","review":"так то найс","timestamp_created":1593529878,"timestamp_updated":1593529878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71737714","author":{"steamid":"76561198182690439","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":150,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":150,"last_played":1593524922},"language":"english","review":"After all these years this is still a great game.
