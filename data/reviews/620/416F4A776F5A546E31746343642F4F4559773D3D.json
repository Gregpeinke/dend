It's the only game I've ever played that I can play 2 or 3 times a year and enjoy each playthrough. Where do I even get started on this? The puzzles are amazing, and a few will leave you stumped. New mechanics are given to you constantly so puzzles feel unique and don't get repetitive, and all of the new mechanics are spread out well with the old ones. The writing is amazing and I've never laughed so much with a game before. The characters are all great, and slowly getting to know them through testing was great too. For a 2011 game, the graphics still looks really great. There's so much detail in every nook and cranny of this game that I still discover new little things every time I play it. On top of the amazing story mode, there's also an incredible multiplayer. If you have a friend who has Portal 2, PLAY THIS WITH THEM. It's an entirely new story mode in this game, and only playing the singleplayer campaign is basically only playing half of this game. The puzzles in multiplayer get even more difficult than the main story as well. And on top of all of that stuff already in the game, there's the workshop with great custom chambers and even stories that still holds a very active community. Some of my favorite puzzles from this game come from the workshop, and most puzzles on the workshop give quite the challenge. \n\nIn the end, this game still holds up as one of the greatest video games of all time, even if you ignore all of the amazing workshop content. Please, play this fucking game. It gets down to like $2 during sales so there's NO excuse to not play this game.","timestamp_created":1476321927,"timestamp_updated":1578559263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26003535","author":{"steamid":"76561198169608892","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1194,"last_played":1588186014},"language":"french","review":"Un chef-d'oeuvre, tout simplement","timestamp_created":1476304249,"timestamp_updated":1476304249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26002882","author":{"steamid":"76561198273192272","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":9138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":950,"last_played":1635618427},"language":"english","review":"Alright, lets get started.

El juego es excelente y pretende ser mejor en todos los aspectos al primer Portal. El problema seguramente es que simplemente se queda en que es más Portal y no puede brillar por sí mismo tanto como el primero. Tiene más puzzles, más historia, más mecánicas... Pero la fórmula sigue siendo esencialmente la misma. Y se puede hacer un poco repetitivo el hacer cámaras una tras otra tras otra. El primero al ser corto duraba lo que tenía que durar y nada sobraba. Aquí, por quitar alguna que otra cámara no creo que hubiera cambiado nada. Y el nuevo lore aunque me gusta y es algo interesante, tampoco puedo decir que no pueda vivir sin él. Aún así, tengo que decir que me ha encantado revisitarlo. Y me estoy refiriendo a la campaña principal, tanto el cooperativo como el editor de cámaras son añadidos de 10 sin duda alguna. Por lo que aunque el tono de esta reseña sea más negativo que otra cosa, eso no quita que estemos ante un juegazo que debería jugar cualquiera.\n\nHan pasado 10 años y sigue compitiendo sin despeinarse con juegos de hoy en día.
