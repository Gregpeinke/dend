Portal, and especially Portal 2, is written, designed, and scored with such excellence and ingenuity. Storytelling, drama, humor, and fantastic music, as well as true playability for gamers of all types, are the strengths i see here. i played through Portal 1 twice, and will soon play through Portal 2 a second time, just for the fun of it (and the commentary). i highly recommend this game. Even if you're not a hard core gamer (i'm not), you should play the Portal series. i experienced only moderate frustration on a couple levels/puzzles, but never once had to look for hints or cheats. i also experienced virtually zero bugs or crashes (i can't remember any crashes, though i might have forgotten something due to just totally loving this game).

Am Anfang war man wohl eins der Testobjekte von Aperture und dann kam Wheatly, der lustige Roboter, schon am Anfang war es lustig mit Wheatly als man \"Apfel\" sagen sollte. Das Spiel ist mit diesen ganzen Einstürzen usw super gemacht. Irgendwann ist man dann bei GlaDos die auch witzig ist. Und dann gibts noch die Dialoge zwischen GlaDos und Wheatly die einfach der Hammer sind. Man erfüllt also ganz \"inruhe\" Tests aber irgendwann... hat das testen ein Ende und GlaDos will ein töten, zum Glück ist Wheatly da und hilft einem GlaDos zubesiegen... was passiert dann als man GlaDos besiegt? Will ich jetzt ungern verraten für Leute die es noch nicht gespielt haben, das bringt aufjedenfall eine Wendung in das Spiel. Mit den \"Gels\", dem Kraftfeld oder dem \"Licht\" werden die Tests noch schöner gestaltet. Das Ende war auch richtig geil von Portal 2. \n\nDer Koopmodus\nBezieht sich ganz leicht auf den Einzelspieler, es gibt zwei Roboter, einer heißt P-Body und einer Atlas. Die Koopstory besteht aus 4. Teilen. Nach Abschluss des 4. Teils kommt noch ganz überraschend der 5. Teil, wo alles älter ist. Und wenn man den auch noch durch gespielt hat, kommt noch das Finale und dann kann man wenn man Lust hat noch den Zusatz spielen.\n\nWenn man den Koopmodus und den Einzelspieler durch gezockt hat, kann man mal die Community Testkammern ausprobieren oder sich eigene erstellen.\n\nFazit:\nPortal 2 ist einer der besten Spiele die ich je gespielt hab und ein echtes MUST HAVE.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1396456069,"timestamp_updated":1396456069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":58,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.666044950485229492","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9705352","author":{"steamid":"76561198047747644","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3,"last_played":1419736207},"language":"english","review":"Bought on sale, like 5$ or so, but the game keeps crashing at loading screen.

I remember my mind being blown the first time I was dumped into \"Old Aperture Science\". My one complaint is that in some areas, the huge world of Aperture seems visually bland, and not in the way that would be intended. Often, you'll find yourself looking through cracks in the wall or staring down into an abyss that contains nothing of visual interest. I felt this was a missed oppurtunity for making the setting seem even grander than it was.\n\nThe music in this game is amazing and does just as much as the visuals to create an atmosphere. It should be noted that you can download the whole of the soundtrack for free online right now. Just Google \"Music to Test By\".\n\nAll in all, a wonderful experience in storytelling. The multiplayer, though not quite as rich in the story aspect, is still marvelous. The recently added ability to create your own test chambers is also a lot of fun, and is a well-designed experience.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1396428286,"timestamp_updated":1396428286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50027763843536377","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9701854","author":{"steamid":"76561197981796554","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":7294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3176,"last_played":1605315567},"language":"english","review":"Game is amazing, and some of the rooms made by users really make you think","timestamp_created":1396418532,"timestamp_updated":1396418532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9701123","author":{"steamid":"76561198018020806","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":2038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1792,"last_played":1538339682},"language":"english","review":"Such portal, much puzzle, wow.","timestamp_created":1396409530,"timestamp_updated":1396409530,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9700089","author":{"steamid":"76561198105226198","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1688,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":678,"last_played":1612117702},"language":"english","review":"I Love most games that VALVe puts out, but this is my all time favorite.

The tests got harder because 2 heads are better than one. The humor got funnier, and smarter. Can I say, the 2-player story wasn't on par with the single player story, but the gameplay makes up for it. \n\nAnd finally, the replay value. Its excellent. With player made tests coming in play after play, you have a seemingly endless ammount of Portal to play till valve counts to three. \n\nI rate this game 9/10.","timestamp_created":1396212997,"timestamp_updated":1396212997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9678644","author":{"steamid":"76561197968437940","num_games_owned":1971,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":1375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1145,"last_played":1490559341},"language":"english","review":"The World's #1 Scientific Method-themed Test Simulator.","timestamp_created":1396205085,"timestamp_updated":1396205085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508484482765197754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9677981","author":{"steamid":"76561198089757524","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":3637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1273,"last_played":1642108674},"language":"czech","review":"Tato hra je skvělá jak pro jednoho hráče tak pro kooperaci s kamaradem :) !
