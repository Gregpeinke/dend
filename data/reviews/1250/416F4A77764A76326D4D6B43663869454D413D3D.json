Instead of trying to progress through a level, you and up to 5 other friends (or strangers) are thrust into a map that is literally just a death arena sprinkled with eye candy. Your goal is to survive a certain amount of rounds, depending on the length you set the game on. The difficulty ranges from fighting mutated grannies to fighting immortal killing machines that will stop at nothing to feast on your juicy organs. 6 classes with different strengths and bonuses provide some gameplay variation.  Each class gets special buffs to help his team. After you defeat all the zeds, you fight the Patriarch, an ugly, ruthless boss hell-bent on destroying your squad. While he can be simple on easy difficulties, it's like finding a piece of straw in a needle stack on harder difficulties.\n\nThis game has cons as it does pros, so here's a list.\n\nPROS:\nNice variation of characters/weapons/enemies\nDecent graphics for its age\nNice maps\nWorkshop support\nHoliday updates that allow you to snag elusive weapons, such as the Zed Eradication Device\nHoliday updates also allow you to get special characters like The Reaper\nSatisfying weapons\nSatisfying gore\nVERY satisfying slow-mo \"ZED Time\"\nMusic that makes you feel like Master Chief (or any other cool person)\nGood amount of comedy, for the game genre\n------------\nCONS:\nDLCs are WAY TOO EXPENSIVE\nFinal boss has no real variations, just the same boss every time\nEnemy AI can get glitchy\nSome annoying bugs like getting stuck in the ground on some multiplayer games\nInterface can be confusing for new players\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game, especially if you have friends to play it with. While it can be frustrating, the game is very well made and provides fun for everyone.\nBut try to get the DLC on sale, unless you like having to get bank loans to play as a terminator-chicken.","timestamp_created":1414100232,"timestamp_updated":1414100266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12601774","author":{"steamid":"76561198062167294","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":766,"last_played":1429731379},"language":"french","review":"Très fun je conseil","timestamp_created":1414098562,"timestamp_updated":1414098562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470041334629058838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12601758","author":{"steamid":"76561198129161634","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":7161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":565,"last_played":1530166974},"language":"spanish","review":"en mi opinion es muy divertido muy buen juego \ngraficos 9/10 jugabilidad 8/10\nme encantan los survival terror :D","timestamp_created":1414098517,"timestamp_updated":1414098517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12601621","author":{"steamid":"76561198078323199","num_games_owned":520,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1327,"last_played":1617149180},"language":"english","review":"Fun zombie killing action with british accents.

First off lets take a look at the class system: *At the start or midway of a round/game you can chose a class wich makes you better at certain things like fire damage or damage resistance, choosing a class will benefit certain playstyles like a berserker with melee. Also to level up specific classes you must do specific things like deal x amount of fire damage or heal x health. Leveling up a class will boost the stuff it already gives you and most likely give it a new passive ability to add to your selection.* Now lets go into enemy design: *Every enemy has its own behavior and stradegy like jumping at you or attacking in group. The Clot is a basic enemy who attacks anyone it can mostly found in groups while the Stalker mostly tries to sneak in on you and the Crawler uses high points to assault from the air. Overall most if not all enemeis have great creepy design and awesome attack methods.* Now lets go over level and weapon design: *I find many of the weapons to be very interresting going from swords and knifes to grenade launchers and rocket launcers. Every class has specific weapons they are good with and all weapons recomended for a specific class will have said class emblem on it. There is not much i can say about the weapons so lets go to the level design. The levels in Killing Floor are great at making good atmosphere for the game by making creepy sounds, looking creepy or overall having creepy music. Some levels are even more scary to play than the enemies in it.* Now the final aspect i will cover is characters: *Characters are not anything else than skins but still thay are amazing. You can choose skins that you think suits your style like having a metal plated man being berserker or gasmask weilding people with fire weapons.* Now i shall go over the stuff i dont like so lets begin with some core basics like moment: 'The movement speed is pretty slow (wich im okay with but it my slow down the action and stuff) and the jump seem pretty useless mostly.' Also the difficulty: 'It has its thing with being very noob friendly on the easiest but no pro no go at anything higher than that, the huge leap of difficulty from the first to the next is to high.' Other than that i cant think of much more other than tat i find it hard to play with friends (due to my inabillity to understand how to do much technical stuff on pc) so ill say this game is a 4-4,5/5 GOOD GAME RECOMMENDED","timestamp_created":1413880536,"timestamp_updated":1416217382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvJv2mMkCf8iEMA=="}
