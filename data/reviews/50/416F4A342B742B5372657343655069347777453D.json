Opposing Force был выпущен 1 ноября 1999 года. \n\n[list]\n\n\n[*] В Half-Life: Opposing Force мы играем за Капрала Адриана Шепарда, одного из морпехов из отряда спецподразделения HECU. Он был отправлен в Аризону для того, чтобы найти Моргана Фримэна и арестовать его. Но не долетев до базы мы падаем на округ Мезы и начинаем отсюда свой путь. Сначала игра познакомит нас с хэдкрабами и оружием ближнего боя, а потом, постепенно, мы будем получать оружие с самого обычного Half-Life. Сюжет будет плавно развиваться, но полной понятности в сюжете нету, потому что все солдаты говорят что нам нужно бежать, а в итоге мы идём и делаем совсем другое. Возможно, это была проблема локализации, я надеюсь что это так.\n\nЯ думаю все играли в первую часть легендарной игры от Valve и все понимают какой там геймплей. Если вы даже не играли, то смотрели видео спидрана так точно. Так вот, распрыжку делать и летать по карте так же легко, как и стрелять. А стрельба на своё то время реально крутое, в некоторых шутерах 2019-го года нету такой же физики стрельбы. Впрочем, игра очень весёлая и навевает лишь положительные эмоции.\n\nА вот что не хорошо, но это не хорошо вообще в первой части Half-Life, это твои союзники. Они настолько тупые, что ими можно кидаться как камнями. То они застревают в дверях, то они прут на турель и умирают. Помощи от них нету, потому что они могут вас подорвать на гранате, а потом ещё начнут по вам стрельбу. По истине один из глупейших ИИ в играх. Но это можно спереть на возраст игры.\n\nЕщё что не то что взбесило, а скорее не понравилось, так это не очень то и нарастающая сложность. Она сначала нарастает постепенно, а потом в один момент становится так сложно, что игра бросает игроку реальный челленж и чтобы пройти её дальше придётся попотеть. \n\n[/list]\n\nВердикт:[i] это просто сногсшибательная игра, не смотря на её недостатки. Наверное, это одна из крутейших игр о военных и о пришельцах, которая когда либо выходила. Настолько динамичного геймплея никогда не ожидаешь в игре 1999-го года. Я бы назвал её вообще лучшей из серии Half-Life. Это что-то неземное. [/i]\n\nОценка:[b] 9.8/10.[/b] Лучшая из серии Half-Life и одна из лучших в своём роде.\n\nОбзор был составлен Ci8, эксклюзивно для[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigbadwhl] BigBadWhale Games[/url],  в сотрудничестве с [url=http://welovebundles.ru/]WeLoveBundles[/url] \n\nОценка редакции:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1276824468","timestamp_created":1561801611,"timestamp_updated":1561932666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535603761672973633","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51795336","author":{"steamid":"76561198862170134","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1561997138},"language":"english","review":"Good game.","timestamp_created":1561800378,"timestamp_updated":1561800378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51765047","author":{"steamid":"76561198063897601","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1561830372},"language":"russian","review":"*-*","timestamp_created":1561797212,"timestamp_updated":1561797212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51756484","author":{"steamid":"76561198185004834","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":130,"playtime_forever":503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":503,"last_played":1561746331},"language":"russian","review":"Классика детка).","timestamp_created":1561796246,"timestamp_updated":1561796246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51748731","author":{"steamid":"76561197965776691","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":10794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10750,"last_played":1561807934},"language":"russian","review":"Что в результате?

And like the first half life, this game succeed as well.\n\nThis game set in the area of time after Gordon freeman opened the portals to the aliens the enter to earth, and lets you see the story from a different point of view, as for the point of view of the US marines who came to destroy every sign of black mesa’s existence after the big incident.\n\nIn the game you play as admiral Shepard, a soldier which is part of the US marine, who came to destroy black mesa after the big incident, but his squad’s helicopter crashed, and he was left alone to try and get out of black mesa, with the goal of killing Gordon freeman in the way, but also to keep himself alive as much as he can.\n\nThe story of the new game is great and shows the reasons why the first half life was a great success, featuring great new levels with enemies and bosses to fight, and with new puzzle to think through like the first half life did.\n  \nThrough the story you will encounter some new types of enemies and bosses that weren’t present in the first game, and get to use new sets of weapons, which a lot of them are fun to use. With that, because in this game you play as part of the US marines and not against them, like in the first half life, you get to regroup with soldier teammates that will help you to fight the aliens, and unlike the guards in the first half life, those US marines hold with them heavy and more damaging weapons like the SMG from the first half life, shotguns and even machine guns, while the guards in the first half life used only pistols, and could insist less amount of damage with that. Another new mechanic that wasn’t in the first half life and got added to this game is the ability to climb up ropes. Even know it fresh the mechanic of the game, I found it being more annoying then helpful in most situations, because of how similar it is to an enemy alien that will grab you up to kill you.\n\nWhile the game was very fun, and keeps itself as quality as the first game in the series, the game still lacks consistency with the main character’s morals and goals. Because in the game I play as admiral Shepard, and his goals is to destroy black mesa, I should not help scientists and guards lives in my journey to escape black mesa, and instead arrest them or kill them instead of helping them so they would help me escape by opening locked doors like in the first half life. Another flaw in the game for me is that throughout the game you get to use more and more experimental and alien weapons, instead of more weapons that used in the US army. While those flaws minor, and doesn’t destroy the experience the first half life was known for, those still effect my thoughts about the story’s main character, Shepard, to see him less as a soldier that came to destroy the place, and more like another Gordon freeman. \n\nAnother problem I faced is with the game’s mouse movement, which unlike the small story flaws I wrote before, this mouse movement problem is a big issue. the problem is that sometimes the crosshairs gets bugged when you move it, making it horrible to aim, and would make you sometimes get stuck for a long period of time on the same part of the level just because the crosshair gets bugged all the time and you can’t aim at the enemy because of it. This problem is even harder in multiplayer, in which the enemy players always jumping and moving, and those buggy crosshair movements are adding to the difficulty of aiming at them. \nOther than that, the game is a great game, and can live as a good expansion to the legacy of the first half life and of the half-life series as a whole, with great levels as the original gives, new complex puzzle levels to solve, great new weapons to experience with, and a masterpiece of a story.\n\nGame pros and cons:\nPros:\n-\tGreat level design.\n-\tA big diverse amount of fun weapons to use.\n-\tNew and old enemies which are hard and worthwhile.\n-\tGreat story.\n-\tVery good AI, to the enemies and to the allies.\n-\tComplex new and old mechanics.\n-\tNew bosses to counter.\n\nCons:\n-\tInconsistent character morals and motives.\n-\t Some weapons don’t feet the character role in the game, and remind Gordon freeman more than the main character.\n-\tNot the freshest graphics (as a game that was made between 1999-2001)\n-\tBuggy mouse and crosshair control.\n-\tShort story (can be finished in about a day or so)\n-\tThe multiplayer lacks even more from the buggy mouse and crosshair control.\n\nGame’s settings:\n-\tFirst person shooter.\n-\tScience fiction.\n-\tStory focused game.\n-\tCost 10$ (9.99$).\n-\tViolent game (contains blood).\n-\tHalf horror half adventure type game.\n-\tContains Puzzle levels.\n-\tStory length is about 9 hours.\n-\tContains multiplayer.\n\n*I give this game 7.9/10","timestamp_created":1561278673,"timestamp_updated":1561278901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51385260","author":{"steamid":"76561198068404631","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":336,"last_played":1561223272},"language":"french","review":"allez ça m'a saoulé","timestamp_created":1561223316,"timestamp_updated":1561223316,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.405405402183532715","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51380343","author":{"steamid":"76561198842318591","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":890,"last_played":1657448030},"language":"english","review":"Pretty good game, lore is also interesting, black ops are really cool","timestamp_created":1561208480,"timestamp_updated":1644155407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51362578","author":{"steamid":"76561198401489027","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":138,"playtime_forever":894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":388,"last_played":1592317625},"language":"english","review":"This games story answeres alot of questions about Black Mesa and the Black ops there are also many new weapons.","timestamp_created":1561138216,"timestamp_updated":1561138216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51309386","author":{"steamid":"76561198112565594","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":1148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1101,"last_played":1594339624},"language":"english","review":"Much better than Blue shift.","timestamp_created":1560959043,"timestamp_updated":1560959043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519841313362121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51309210","author":{"steamid":"76561198261487610","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":726,"last_played":1564519274},"language":"english","review":"10/10 i beat it without using a walkthrough\n\n\nIn all seriousness, this game is really fun.
