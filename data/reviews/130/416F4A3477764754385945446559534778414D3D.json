Calhoun, a security officer in Black Mesa. Compared to Half-Life and Half-Life opposition force this game is quite shorter and much more easier mainly due to how much resources you can get after getting into a battle, unlike the Half-Life and Opposition Forces which were quite unforgiving with their resources. More than 3/4th's of my fight in HL and HL:OF forced me to fight with less than 10 hp left, while in HL:BS I almost always had 100 hp and even a bit of armor when getting into fight, hell I only ever died in my playthrough due to the environment such as falling to my death, never died during combat.

I just don't think it deserves the same rating as the original or Opposing Force given the horrible amount of bugs and rather bland gameplay.\n\nThis game has about 3 hours of gameplay. It took both me and my boyfriend 3 and half hours to finish it, and if we both didn't get stuck searching for a ladder in the underground, I think it would be almost exactly 3 hours.\n\nI experienced this really annoying bug where every time I reloaded the game, the guy started shooting. No matter what save it was, if I reloaded it myself or I died. There were like ten different places I got stuck ‚Äì jumping or crouching didn't help, and I had to reload the game.\n\nGameplay-wise, I really struggled at the beginning because of the lack of ammo. There was a segment where I had to rush a corridor full of aliens because I simply didn't have any ammo. But once you met the soldiers, you earned a ton of it and the game became super easy.\n\nStory wise, I enjoyed the beginning because I really like seeing one situation from different angles. But then it got kinda boring. Let's just say I expected a bit more, because it looked very promising at first. There was a point where the scientist said \"you gotta retrieve a power cell\", and I thought \"this feels like there will be another chapter, but I doubt they would make a chapter based on retrieving a power cell\", and then the title \"Power Struggle'' appears. So yeah, the story is so-so.\n\nOh and I hated the part in the already mentioned Power Struggle where you have to connect a cut detonator by a barrel. I thought about it but then didn't say it out loud because I thought my bf would think I am an idiot for even thinking that it could work. Well that's exactly what you are supposed to do and it just doesn't make much sense to me.","timestamp_created":1658075164,"timestamp_updated":1658075164,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534461915493011475","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118961977","author":{"steamid":"76561198125017030","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":322,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":248,"last_played":1658147536},"language":"russian","review":"+","timestamp_created":1658070673,"timestamp_updated":1658070673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118959470","author":{"steamid":"76561198195164329","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1657766219},"language":"brazilian","review":"

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.
