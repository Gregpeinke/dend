AHORA\n\ngameplay: es un fps asique no hay mucho que decir en cuanto la jugabilidad que no se alla dicho antes, son controles simples y faciles de aprender y maniobrar, incluso yo que los fps no son lo mio logre adecuarme perfectamente a los controles, lo unico que me incomodo un poco es el hecho de tener que hagacharme con la letra c y no con ctrl o tirar granadas con la letra g pero todas estas funciones se pueden cambiar en el menu de ajustes asique se podria decir que estamos bien en cuanto a gameplay\n\nmusica: lo he dicho antes y lo digo ahora, para mi la musica de un videojuego es uno de los puntos en los que mas estricto hay que ser pues una banda sonora acompañando un momento especifico del juego puede convertirse en uno de los momentos mas memorables que el juego tiene para ofrecer, como es el caso de undertale (por poner un ejemplo reciente) en el caso de killing floor el metal que suena de fondo es mas que suficiente para mostrar lo epico que puede llegar a ser el estar enfrentandote a un peloton de crawlers, goefasts, sirens, etc con solo una pistola o ya de plano algo mas pesado como un lanzallamas, una escopeta o el arma definitiva, la motosierra, simplemente una obra maestra\n\nsoporte multijugador: killing floor precenta el multijugador como su punto fuerte, muy pocas partidas me han salido con un ping mas alto que 250, que para tratarse de gente estadounidense no esta nada mal, las partidas son muy estables en cuanto a lag, llegando a ser algo con lo que te toparas una vez en todo el juego, ademas este juego cuenta con servidores dedicados, lo cual si lo juntamos con el pack de 6 copias del juego se convierte en la opcion mas viable para jugar con tus amigos en una tarde de tiempo libre siendo que el juego corre en una patata (como la mia) pero si no tienes nadie con quien jugarlo siempre tendras los servidores publicos que tampoco estan nada mal pues muchos de ellos implementan mods, dlc, enemigos con texturas personalizadas, mapas creados por la comunidad, y hasta servidores masivos capases de albergar hasta 20 o 30 jugadores, la unica razon para dejar de jugar esta maravilla es el haber jugado demasiado y por ende tener sueño ya que has estado jugando todo el dia y a ti se te han hecho 20 minutos\n\ncomunidad: la comunidad de killing floor es completamente lo contrario a la de lol, es paciente con los nuevos o los que no se han acostumbrado muy bien a los controles o que ya de plano no tienen una vision de lo que hacer, tanto asi que el multijugador parese tutorial, algo que jamas pero JAMAS habia visto en un juego multijugador, es desir, estamos hablando de un juego en el que el multijugador es tu tutorial pues los jugadores te enseñan desde los controles hasta algunas tacticas esenciales o a usar algunos perks de manera adecuada, simplemente increible\n\nperks: los perks (o priviliegios en español) son algo asi como la clase, hay una variedad no muy grande pero satisfactoria de perks para elegir, el medico, el sniper, el soporte, el piromano, y algunos otros, cada uno con \"misiones\" que al completarlas añaden XP al perk al que pertenesen, de esta manera aumentando las caracteristicas de este, por ejemplo velocidad de movimiento extra, menor tiempo de espera para la jeringuilla medica, soldar puertas mas rapido, mayor daño al disparar a la cabeza, etc etc y mas etc, pero eso no es todo, diferentes perks tienen diferentes armas para comprar, por ejemplo si elegiste el perk de sniper, no puedes comprar armas cuerpo a cuerpo (machetes, hachas, espadas y otras tantas mas) de la misma forma si tienes el perk de medico no puedes comprar una escopeta o un rifle, esto en realidad no es un estorbo, es algo util y logico pues es algo similar a lo que hemos visto en team fortress 2 (por poner un ejemplo) el scout no puede poner sentinelas como el ingeniero, el heavy no puede llevar un rifle como el sniper, y la lista sigue y sigue, en resumen, estan cabrones y le dan personalidad al juego\n\nconclusion: killing floor es un fps exepcional que se resume en una palabra, epico, ideal para jugar con amigos, desconocidos o incluso tu solo, ademas contando con mas de 250 logros por desbloquear, se combierte en un reto interesante para esos usuarios a los que les gusta completar los juegos al 100%\n\nnota final: este juego se merece un 10/10, es perfecto, lo tiene todo, accion, metal, mapas varios cada uno con una ambientacion diferente, adrenalina, cientos de logros y horas y horas de diversion sin limites, un juegazo de bajos requisitos que no puedes darte el lujo de no probar","timestamp_created":1454113794,"timestamp_updated":1454477510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494809657335281372","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20835656","author":{"steamid":"76561198056023431","num_games_owned":310,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":890,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":805,"last_played":1579795743},"language":"czech","review":"bullshit

Некоторые - с режимом заданий, что вносит разнообразие в игровой процесс\n+ Много видов зедов с уникальными перками, каких не встретить больше ни в одной игре.

This game takes a lot strategy and time to master believe it or not, since map control will basically dictate your sucess. This is good if you have a squad of 3 dedicated players together, not so good if you're just randomly joining servers and expecting to win every game. Even some higher level players don't understand the concepts of sticking together and holding down an area or strategies as simple as pipe-bombing the Patriarch at the end to make for a speedy win. I can't tell you how many times I've sunk in 45 minutes into a round only for the squad to be wiped out the end because they thought they could take the Patriarch with pistols and MP7's. Reading the new players guide should be a pre-requisite for joining online matches.\n\nAt the end of the day, the amount of fun you will have with this game is going to be directly proportionl with two things: How much money you're willing to sink into it and the people you play it with.","timestamp_created":1453142898,"timestamp_updated":1453142898,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479173958301544189","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20600570","author":{"steamid":"76561198130134803","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13242,"last_played":1515297379},"language":"russian","review":"Одним словом - КРУТО!!!","timestamp_created":1453100095,"timestamp_updated":1453100095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456953644752502441","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20573817","author":{"steamid":"76561198154215236","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1047,"last_played":1556226649},"language":"dutch","review":"Its k.","timestamp_created":1452991451,"timestamp_updated":1452991451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497287511825561523","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20573743","author":{"steamid":"76561198032102977","num_games_owned":564,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":54772,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32779,"last_played":1489162229},"language":"russian","review":"ООООООООООООчень рекомендую, куча проведенного времени не в пустую ...","timestamp_created":1452991135,"timestamp_updated":1452991135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.461691468954086304","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20573508","author":{"steamid":"76561198123707632","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":3017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":834,"last_played":1502587740},"language":"english","review":"Great Game!","timestamp_created":1452990133,"timestamp_updated":1452990133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20571357","author":{"steamid":"76561198068138674","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":579,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":579,"last_played":1386982938},"language":"english","review":"This game is really fucking good.
