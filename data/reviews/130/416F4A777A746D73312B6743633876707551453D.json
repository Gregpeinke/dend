This time around you've only got your basic guns, a flashlight, your security gear and the same old Xen creatures to battle, which is completely fine of course, but seeing as this came a whole 2 years after Opposing Force, some people were understandably disappointed by this expansion.\n\nThere is a reason for this, however. This expansion was originally developed as an exclusive for the Dreamcast port of the game, which was later cancelled. This console exclusive expansion idea would however be brought back later that year for the release of the PlayStation 2 port with the co-op expansion Half-Life: Decay.\n\nWhat Blue Shift did bring to the table (other than the solid Half-Life gameplay and storyline) was a brand-new \"High-Definition Pack\", which replaced old character and weapon models with newer, higher-poly ones. For the most part, this was a welcome addition, with some minor controversy from the community about some of the guns being replaced with completely different ones.\n\nAll in all, I think Blue Shift is a solid expansion, but could've done with a little variety in its presentation.","timestamp_created":1553788468,"timestamp_updated":1590682825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49806141","author":{"steamid":"76561198282847523","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":71,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71,"last_played":1553696055},"language":"schinese","review":"WIN10玩视角都挪不动","timestamp_created":1553780412,"timestamp_updated":1553780412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49794891","author":{"steamid":"76561198172580210","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1553718718},"language":"brazilian","review":"Sabe

It allows to experience Black Mesa events from a less heroic point of view of Barney Calhoun, a security guard. This role works really well in the beginning: Black Mesa falls apart, monsters are the main enemies, ammo is scarce, and there is struggle to survive. However, the role of a confused security guard is neglected as soon as army men come into sight. Defeating battalions of highly trained killing machines creates a sudden shift in tone. Now Barney is a victorious conquerer armed from toes to teeth and is able to overcome any obstacle with ease. Previous sense of danger evaporates. Monsters are exchanged with hitscan enemies and their dead bodies provide enough ammo to supply an army base. Original Half-Life had a good mix where it used soldiers scarcely and positioned them strategically. Blue Shift doesn't have such subtlety. It throws packs of enemies on the player. It would be better if there were few soldiers which presented great danger, with monsters and environmental hazards being the most prominent threats. \n\nImmersion issues aside, this add-on has solid gameplay, engaging level design and interesting enough story to rationalize shooting an interdimensional alien with a magnum revolver.\nIt's enjoyable experience for the ones who miss the original Half-Life, but crave for something new. I'd recommend to play it on normal difficulty.","timestamp_created":1552827274,"timestamp_updated":1612039358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49593722","author":{"steamid":"76561198072129817","num_games_owned":860,"num_reviews":290,"playtime_forever":458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1552774594},"language":"english","review":"The shortest game in the series.

Я понимаю, что игру нельзя создать без \"катсцен\", но перебарщивать с этим тоже нельзя. В Half-life главным был игровой процесс, \"катсцены\" были, но они были сделаны так, что ты их мог просто пробежать и ничего не слушать. Нет нового оружия и игровых механик, которые появились в Half-life: Opposing Force. Очень маленькие карты, которые постоянно меняются. В оригинале карты были больше. \n\nЯ бы мог поставить оценку - не рекомендую, но не буду.
