Maybe the biggest spoiler in the game was a turret.\n\nFor the music; almost perfect, but sometimes a bit too electric. I liked the fact that the music changed with your actions, your location and plot. I don't see that often in games (if they already have music that fits). I.E; it intensifies when you're defeating the boss and it changes when you use the blue gel or if you kill a turret.\n\nThe gels are an amazing addition that really adds a new element to the game. Now you don't have only need to think with portals, but also with speed, fysics and bouncyness.\nAnd when you're in co-op modus, you have to think with portals twice as much as in singleplayer.\nDon't forget about the perpetual testing initiative! Since Portal have got an end, and after palying the game more times, you know how to solve the puzzles. But in Portal 2, you can use the maps of the community. And if you want to, you can make your own (like I did).\n\nThe detaillness of the maps where amazing. You can spilt Portal 2 in 6 parts and every part has got its own properties. For instance, when you're playing in the underground, you see that everything is falling apart due to a lack of maintenance. You also hear that. The soundscape fits amazingly well!\n\nShortly;\nIf you're hesistating, buy it. Portal 2 is worth it.

Well, a friend of mine, of whom is a big fan of this game, suggested it to me. Not being a big videogamer, I was hesitant and opted to watch a 2 hour playthrough of it on YouTube, just to see if it was my kind of thing. This game is AMAZING. It's very easy to see why it has so many positive reviews. Admittedly, buying this game was the sole reason I joined Steam in the first place. Though I promise not to spoil any of the plot for anyone reading this before having played the game.\n\nThe one thing I tend to look for it any videogame is a good plot. For me, it's what keeps me playing. And heck does this game deliver in that sense. I admit, I've never played the first Portal, as I did some research and found that there wasn't much plot other than 'do the tests, kill GLaDOS'. However, its' sequel has a really interesting ongoing plot. Even when you're doing GLaDOS' tests, Wheatley will often pop out of the panels with an encouraging \"Just hold on for a few more tests, then we'll break out of here!\" Though I have to admit, I've never had a videogame plot give me so many feels before. When it gets to the point when you feel sympathy for the antagonist before you're about to destroy them, you know it's a quality game. \n\nHowever, every plot needs good characters, and Portal 2 had a surplus of those. As is the same for the first game, Ellen McLain voices GLaDOS, the cynical, sarcastic and very sadistic AI that is obsessed with testing. I know they obviously used a lot of autotuning to make GLaDOS sound like a machine, but I still think Ellen McLain's monotonous voice carries the character very well. Now that GLaDOS has some history with Chell (mainly of Chell 'killing' her), it is absolutely hilarious hearing that AI hold a grudge. Some of those lines are just brilliant. \n\"Oh, it's YOU. How have you been? I've been a bit busy being dead. You know, after you MURDERED ME.\"\nThe AI's attempt to insult Chell during testing also has me cracking up.\n\nThe second main character in this game is, of course, Wheatley. Steven Merchant does Wheatley's character such justice. Wheatley is your lovable, kind of moronic, sidekick in the game. It's worth it during gameplay to just stop what you are doing to listen to his quality lines. He isn't completely useless, though. Often, Wheatley will help you navigate through the Aperature Science facility. After all, the place is massive, so getting lost could be quite easy without him as your guide. The fact that he also has a built-in torch inside of his optic is also very useful.\n\"Aaah! Oh. Oh, they told me, that if I ever turned this thing on, I would DIE. They told me that about everything! I don't know why they bothered giving me these things if they didn't want me to use them!\"\n\nThe last of the main characters in this game, is of course, Chell. She is the character you play in the game. I really like her because, despite the fact that she is in fact female (which I've seen is pretty rare in videogames nowadays, especially females that aren't sexualised in someway, which Chell is NOT, thankfully), she is also totally mute. She can't-or won't-speak at all in the game, but still manages to totally kick robot butt.\n\nThere are other characters in this game, but they are only present through various voice recordings throughout the old Aperture Science Testing Facility. These characters are Cave Johnson, the (rather arrogant) creator of Aperature Science, and Caroline, his (overly enthusiastic) assisant. Both characters, though they don't play very big roles as they are, help the player get an insight to what Aperature Science used to be like before everything went downhill and GLaDOS went rogue.\n\nAnother thing that I find useful in a good videogame is a quality soundtrack. I have to admit, during gameplay, there really isn't that much of it, other than to create ambience during the 'epic' parts of plot or during the boss battle. Otherwise, I find the testing areas pretty quiet and found myself popping in my headphones during those parts. The credits song was amazing, though. Just like the first game's credit song, it was sung by Ellen McLain as GLaDOS and is sung (rather sarcastically in parts) to, presumably, Chell. It's called 'Want You Gone' and I tend to listen to it a lot due to it's greatness. XD\nThere is also another ending song, sung by the Turrets at the very end. It is an Opera-style song sung in what I assume to be Italian. It does sound great, though.\n\nAnd finally, we get to the gameplay itself. I don't really have any complaints when playing it, myself. (Just as a side note, I'm not referring to the Co-op part of the game, as I've only ever played the single player game.) Sure, the tests can get a bit repetitive, but the plot usually furthers before you can get fed up with it. The tests, thankfully, are never too mind numbingly difficult. Sure, they are really challenging and it may take you a while to figure them out, but all of them are do-able, even for a gaming newbie like me. And, let's be honest, ripping holes into reality was never going to be boring.\n\nOverall, I 100% reccommend this to anybody, veteran gamer or otherwise. It was highly enjoyable and is guarenteed to be replayed again and again. I know I'm going to be replaying as soon as I finish writing this review. :)","timestamp_created":1419872554,"timestamp_updated":1419873332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13691250","author":{"steamid":"76561198136646381","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":476,"last_played":1420395374},"language":"english","review":"Noy only does it have a awesome campain but makes you more intelegent!","timestamp_created":1419870347,"timestamp_updated":1419870347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13691111","author":{"steamid":"76561198069694621","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1937,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":582,"last_played":1552939576},"language":"english","review":"A puzzling puzzle game with extra-ordinary phisics and graphics, loads of replay value and a simple to use level editor, a game I'll recomend to my freinds over and over again.

Lo primero, la historia. La historia en Portal es interesante pero en Portal 2 es mucho más profunda, no quiero hacer spoilers. La historia es algo indescriptible. Lo segundo son los nuevos objetos que te da Aperture Science cómo los cubos de desviación del láser, los puentes de luz etc. Lo tercero es la libertad dónde puedes poner portales. Tienes más libertad para ponerlos. Ya por último, es un detallito. Hay una parte de Aperture Science que me recuerda mucho a Rapture ciudad de Bioshock y Bioshock 2. Ahí lo dejo. La única cosa mala del juego son los tiempos de carga es horrrible, pero merece la pena. Eso sí, no vayáis a por el 2 directamente. Comprad el 1 y disfrutad, pero el 2 os va a dejar con la boca abierta.
