Lutece, 1889\n\nI just want to precede this by saying that I went into this game completely blind, knowing nothing aside the \"city in the clouds\" bit, and I suggest you do too. Don't read this review. Go play it. I'm not going to directly compare it to either of the previous games because it's so different, but if I had to make a bold statement, I think it's the best of the series, I have almost as many hours in it as in the first two combined, and the fact that I replayed it at all, when I had little inclination to replay either of the first two, should speak volumes. Bioshock Infinite is fucking awesome. \n\n\n\nNote: I beat the game once on Hard, went through and played through the DLCs on Hard, then went back and beat the main story again in 1999 Mode -- the only major achievement I didn't do was to revisit Burial at Sea: Episode 2 in 1998 Mode.\n\nThe beginning is probably the best opening sequence I've ever played. The first few minutes are weird and mysterious, with a very similar style to the first game, as you arrive at a lighthouse with ominous religious phrases inside. You land in what seems to be a church, and soon enough, from there you enter the city of Columbia.\n\nAt this point I saw that this is the most visually impressive game I've ever played. The graphics and art style fit perfectly together, and your entrance into Columbia is magical. There's a fair bustling around you, full of exhibits to see and minigames to play. Since Infinite starts as a walking simulator, I was practically spamming Alt so that I could walk through it as slowly as possible. (Though, \"spamming\" partly because Walk doesn't like to stick for some reason.) I easily spent an hour just taking it all in. The citizens are having all their side conversations, and there are references to things that seem important ⁠— \"Vox Populi\", and \"False Shepherd\", for example ⁠— but they're just mentioned, not exposited upon, leaving you to wonder. These are just subtle hints that there is something more than meets the eye to this place. Once the sinister underbelly truly reveals itself, the real game begins hitting the ground running: you are the prophesized False Shepherd, and the (racist) society of Columbia wants you dead. (Well, the police do. Most of the civilians just poof into thin air, which is a bit odd.)\n\nBefore I continue talking about the story, let's talk gameplay. Infinite takes quite a turn from the previous games in that it's mostly linear. You could argue that this is a downgrade from the more sprawling, exploratory gameplay of the first games, but let's be real, the main difference is whether the linearity is hidden or not. Personally, I didn't mind Infinite's approach, and it's refreshing in a way — this game dares to stray from the \"BioShock formula.\"\n\nInstead of plasmids, you're now equipped with vigors, and the weapon control scheme is much like BioShock 2, with the one caveat that you can only hold two guns at a time now. Personally, I actually think this an improvement. When you have seven weapons available at once, it feels like bad game design if you're using one almost exclusively. Infinite accepts that weapons are not created equal, and if you don't want a weapon, you don't have to ever use it, allowing you to tune your loadout to your playstyle. Yet, at the same time, when ammo is scarce, it forces you to take risks, to switch weapons mid-battle and adapt on the fly. (Also, I do think gunplay overall is better than the first two games.) On the other hand, you still have access to all vigors all the time (though I didn't notice this for a few hours). I didn't end up using Devil's Kiss or Murder of Crows frequently, but most everything else I found distinct uses for. Although fundamentally some of them are reskins of familiar plasmids, things like Undertow and Return to Sender add new, fairly deep mechanics. When I played through in 1999 Mode, I gained a real appreciation for Bucking Bronco, Undertow, and Return to Sender, and figuring out how to use these vigors properly gave me a huge edge in combat. \n\nZooming out a bit, I would say combat is overall the most polished of the series. Yes, I do miss Big Daddy and Big Sister fights in a way, there's no longer any element of a terrifying, roaming mini-boss, and no, Motorized Patriots and Handymen are nowhere near as interesting, neither as enemies nor lore-wise. Yes, most of the human enemies are kind of same-y, though Infinite's enemies are generally an improvement over splicers in that they use the full spectrum of weapons. What makes Infinite unique is that it has frantic, high-octane combat, which it leans into mechanically, and to that end it has Tears and the Sky-Hook. Elizabeth's Tears make the battlefield dynamic, and require on-the-fly thinking to harness to their full potential. You can have a freight hook, [b]or[/b] you can have a turret to help, [b]or[/b] you can have health and ammo supplies: pick one. But then a few seconds later, you can pick another, and so on. It forces you to constantly assess your position and the positions of the enemies. With the Sky-Hook you can use freight hooks and the Sky-Line, which really add to the verticality and mobility to combat, respectively. But, you're vulnerable when using them, so there's added strategy there.\n\nSome miscellaneous criticisms:\n- There's not many civilian player models, and sometimes you can see a whole group of people with the same model in one place. It's uncanny.\n- When you grab onto a hook or Skyline, the camera has to settle in a certain direction before you're allowed to move it again. It's kind of annoying.\n- Enemy visibility can be a bit tricky sometimes, soldiers' colors don't always stand out.\n- Some dialogue is bugged and two characters will talk at once during important scenes.\n- [spoiler]The Boys of Silence are just cameras and have nothing to do with silence. I realize this is due to development hell, but still, silence-based stealth would have made more sense.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's about time that I mention that [b]Elizabeth is absolutely the pinnacle achievement of this game. This is how to do a companion[/b]. With a Disney princess-like \"girl in the tower\" backstory, she has exactly the personality to fit. Her voice acting and mo-cap are fantastic; she walks around the environment looking at things like newspapers; she makes small talk; she points out items for you; she opens Tears; she picks locks; she throws you ammo, salts, and health kits during combat, apologizing if she can't find anything... I could go on, but she actually seems like [b]a person[/b]. Most importantly, [i]Elizabeth will actually copy your movement speed[/i]! Hallelujah. Also, the [spoiler]\"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\" scene in Shantytown[/spoiler] is a highlight for me.\n\nMy second favorite character(s) would have to be the Luteces. With sarcastic, absurdist dialogue straight out of \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\" accompanied by their distinct accordion tune, they're both comic relief, yet genuinely important characters, [spoiler]seeing as how they're the masterminds behind basically the entire game[/spoiler].\n\nI'm almost out of space and there's many things I haven't talked about, but the last thing I really want to mention is the ending. I think it's awesome and it actually works. Major spoilers. [spoiler]The first time I beat it, seeing everything fall into place, I was basically frozen in my seat with my mouth hanging open. That final piano note gave me chills. It's a ton to process, but it ties up nearly all of the plot holes. I defer to this video that I think explains it mostly well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhjKW1S1xvk.[/spoiler]\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1657870876,"timestamp_updated":1658106891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118838205","author":{"steamid":"76561198080766861","num_games_owned":520,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":857,"last_played":1579996225},"language":"english","review":"Super fun!

[/quote]\n\n\n\n\n[h1] Einfach wow  [/h1]\n\nWenn genug Zeit vergeht, vergisst man größtenteils den Inhalt eines Spiels, es bleibt meist nur ein positiver oder negativer Gedanke. \nMit BioShock: Infinite verband ich damals nach dem ersten Durchspielen stets den positiven „Genial“-Gedanken. \nUnd so nach langer Zeit habe ich beschlossen, es nochmal zu versuchen und ich muss sagen, ich habe keine Minute bereut. \nDieses Mal ist etwas anders als in den beiden Vorgängern, es geht nämlich hoch hinaus statt tief hinunter. Als Booker DeWitt, Privatemittler,   werden wir beauftragt „Bringen sie uns die Kleine und tilgen Sie die Schuld“. Was das bedeutet? Die Tragweite dieses Satzes ist ähnlich der des Satzes aus Teil 1: „Wärst Du so freundlich…“ und zieht sich auch hier durch das ganze Spiel. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2834702721\n\nEs beginnt eine wunderbare Reise durch ein Utopia namens Columbia, eine Stadt die über den Wolken gebaut wurde, welche mit Klischees gefüllt ist. Rassismus, Ausbeutung der Menschen und Fanatismus sind an der Tagesordnung. Wer nicht mitmacht, wird entsorgt. So ziemlich der Höhepunkt des Ganzen war irgendwie die Werbung für Kinderzigaretten, auch wenn die zuvor genannten Sachen eigentlich viel schwerwiegender sind. \nIm Mittelpunkt des Ganzen steht Vater Comstock, ein „Prophet“, der Colombia, die fliegende Stadt in der wir uns befinden, erbauen ließ. Er lässt sich wie ein Gott verehren und ist der absolute Herrscher von Columbia. \nDas Mädchen, welches wir „zurückbringen“ sollen, heißt Elizabeth und war jahrelang eingesperrt. Sie wird von einem riesigen vogelartigen Roboter bewacht, der es uns nicht leicht macht, mit Elisabeth zu entkommen. \nSo beginnen wir eine Reise, die uns viele Wendungen bietet  und verknotete Hirnwindungen verursacht, das ist einfach genial. Es werden viele Fragen beantwortet, nur um gleichzeitig wieder neue aufzuwerfen. \nDas Spiel stellt uns teils auch seltsame Fragen: „Ist ein Revolutionär nur ein neuer Tyrann, sobald er Macht hat?“ ist nur eine davon. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2834702787\n\nSpieltechnisch ist BioShock: Infinite ein FPS. Die Kämpfe gegen die verschiedenen Gegner machen Spaß, von denen gibt es einige unterschiedliche. \nUm mit der Gegnerschar zurechtzukommen, gibt es in diesem Spiel viele verschiedene Waffen, von denen wir nur zwei gleichzeitig tragen können. Das war für mich der größte Kritikpunkt in diesem Spiel, wie gerne hätte ich eine grössere Menge davon mit mir geschleppt, weil die Waffen alle interessant waren und man nichts verpassen wollte. Die Waffen an sich sind gut, fühlen sich gut an und können mit der Zeit auch aufgewertet werden. Aber das Geld wird nicht für alle Aufwertungen reichen, da muss man sich rechtzeitig für bestimmte Waffen entscheiden. \nNeben den Waffen besitzen wir natürlich für BioShock üblich, coole Plasmid Kräfte, mit denen wir unsere Gegner verbrennen, einfrieren, wegstoßen, ergreifen oder sogar beherrschen können. Die Nutzung der Plasmide macht einen Heidenspaß, leider ist die Nutzung begrenzt und muss immer wieder aufgefüllt werden. Auch die Plasmide können mit Geld aufgewertet werden und auch hier ist gutes Haushalten mit dem Geld erforderlich. \nEs gibt auch viele Dietriche zu finden, die wenn aufgesammelt, von Elizabeth genutzt werden können um Schlösser zu versteckten Bereichen zu knacken, von denen es einige im Spiel gibt. \nIn diesen befinden sich allerlei Schätze und vor allem auch Verbesserungen, mit denen wir unser Schild, die Lebensenergie, oder die Salzmenge (das Mana für Plasmide) steigern können, was mit der Zeit im Kampf sehr nützlich und auch nötig sein wird. \nTechnisch ist das Spiel, wenn man bedenkt, dass es bald 10 Jahre alt wird, in einem einwandfreien Zustand und sieht für das Alter noch verdammt gut aus. Columbia ist sehr schön aufgebaut und versprüht den Charme einer Stadt aus dem Anfang des 20.Jahrhunderts, ergänzt durch steampunkartige technische Erweiterungen. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2834706006\n\nIch kann dieses Spiel jedem wärmsten empfehlen, der es noch nicht gespielt hat. Und wer es schon kennt: Spielt es nochmal!! Allerdings würde ich Bioshock-Neulingen empfehlen (aber nicht unbedingt Pflicht) zuerst die beiden Vorgänger durchzuspielen. \nAm Ende wird man auch verstehen, warum das Spiel den Beinamen \"Infinite\" trägt\nWer noch nicht genug hat, der holt sich den Season Pass. Dieser enthält nämlich unter anderem den hervorragenden „Seebestattung“ DLC, der aus zwei Teilen besteht und sowohl viele neue Fragen aufwirft, als auch erstaunliche Antworten liefert, die teils die Geschehnisse aus dem Hauptspiel in einem ganz anderen Licht erscheinen lassen. Hier wird auch die Verbindung zu den Vorgängern verstärkt. Ich empfehle diesen DLC daher sehr, da man ansonsten einen Teil der Geschichte verpasst. \n\nPS: Das Spiel scheint auch relativ gut auf dem Steam Deck zu laufen. Aber es gibt einen entscheidenden Nachteil: Die Cloud wird nicht zwischen PC und Steam Deck synchronisiert, stattdessen werden zwei verschiedene Spielstände in der Cloud abgelegt. Somit das Fortsetzen des Spieles auf dem anderen Gerät noch nicht möglich. Das wird hoffentlich noch nachgepatcht. Im Moment muss man sich für eines der beiden entscheiden.","timestamp_created":1657727250,"timestamp_updated":1657732850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.734934806823730469","comment_count":21,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118749592","author":{"steamid":"76561198967976317","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":670,"last_played":1657637210},"language":"schinese","review":"4.8/5 one of the best game i played","timestamp_created":1657722273,"timestamp_updated":1657722273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118747780","author":{"steamid":"76561198215802927","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":113,"playtime_forever":555,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":555,"last_played":1657718310},"language":"german","review":"Auch wenn dies Spiel extrem rassistisch ist und eigentlich verboten sein sollte, macht es verdammt gut Laune.\nWas ist an dem Spiel so rassistisch?

Bringing a proposal to change the setting of the series and evolution of the gaming experience, Infinite features a complex and intelligent plot, incredible graphics and renewed gameplay.\n\n[h1]From the bottom of the sea to the top of the clouds[/h1]\nBioShock Infinite's first scene pretty much sums up the game's stance towards its two predecessors. The new protagonist, agent [b]Booker DeWitt[/b], appears in a small boat in the middle of the sea and heads towards a kind of launch capsule, which projects him to the heights, taking him to Columbia, a floating city. The metaphor of leaving the ocean and heading for the sky is quite clear and shows both a willingness to change and respect for what has already been done in [b]BioShock[/b] and [b]BioShock 2[/b].\n\nThroughout the game it is possible to notice that the heavy atmosphere of the claustrophobic corridors of Rapture has been left behind, giving way to the bright and bright Columbia. Gradually the curious city reveals its secrets to us through the eyes of the character DeWitt, who represented another change in the series. Booker breaks the silence of the former protagonists and actively participates in the game's dialogue, showing his strong personality.\n\n[h1]Exciting and refined gameplay[/h1]\nInitially the impression is that the gameplay is practically unchanged in [b]BioShock Infinite[/b]. The firearms, the powers, the items scattered all over the place, the radio messages, the health and energy bars, everything is present. However, with the arrival of Elizabeth in the plot, the real changes present themselves, and please.\n\nJust before finding [b]Elizabeth[/b], [b]DeWitt[/b] gets into a mess and soon we realize he can only carry two guns at a time. The change may seem punitive, but it actually ends up contributing to the dynamics of the game. It will no longer be possible to choose your three or four favorite weapons and play from start to finish with them. You'll have to adapt to the game's various challenges and make smart choices about which weapons to carry with you. For example, in a part of the story with distance shooting, it doesn't make sense to have a shotgun, but a grenade launcher or a rifle for long distances. The novelty forces the player to 'make do' with weapons that he doesn't master so well, needing to improvise to keep Booker alive.\n\nThe great innovations are presented with the arrival of [b]Elizabeth[/b] in the plot. Fortunately, the character doesn't do the 'helpless damsel in distress' type and doesn't need to be saved every fight. In fact, it's Elizabeth who helps us in times of need, whether it's looking for extra ammo, warning of the arrival of enemies or using her special ability. Elizabeth is able to open portals that warp time and space and can bring entire objects from other realities into the battlefield, like an automated balloon that shoots her enemies.\n\n[h1]Improved death/rebirth system.[/h1]\nUnlike the other BioShocks, in which the player was respawned with what was left of ammo and energy (Eve), in Infinite you return (again with the help of Elizabeth) with the resources you had before the last fight started. In this way, it is possible to rethink your strategy and start practically from scratch, instead of simply fighting with what's left of the last beating you took in the game.\n\nA factor that also deserves to be mentioned is the rail system. Using a hand hook (which also serves as a weapon) it is possible to travel at high speed along the Columbia rails, reaching higher places and surprising enemies from above. The mechanism adds a lot of agility to the game's combat and serves as a different way to explore the scenario, avoiding the long walks of [b]BioShock[/b] and [b]BioShock 2[/b].\n\n[b]The skills are very interesting, such as the powerful crows and the fun power of levitating enemies, and the equipment works automatically, you just have to choose the effects that you like the most. In addition, the Big Daddy and Big Sister leave the scene, and the Handymen, the Patriots, the Incendiaries, the gigantic Songbird and others enter. To make it a little more difficult, most of them are immune to some ability (Igniters are not affected by Devil's Kiss bombs, for example).[/b]\n\nThe increase in the variety of mini-bosses forces you to prioritize your targets better during combat, taking down the ones that pose the most danger first, since throughout the game they tend to appear in packs.\n\n[h1]Parallel worlds and many questions to be answered[/h1]\nThe story of BioShock Infinite takes place before the events of the first BioShock. The plot brings some well-known elements of the franchise, such as the protagonist initially without a past and the theme of dystopia, represented by the decay of a society full of fanatical followers led by a tyrant. In Infinite the story revolves around three axes, the pasts of DeWitt and Elizabeth and the history of the mysterious city, Columbia. Add to that the maiden's power to alter reality and the result is a complex web that links parallel universes that converge on a main plot.\n\n[b]Patriarch Comstock represents the authoritarian leader of Columbia and fights the rebel group Vox Populi, led by activist Fitzroy. Both sides have their share of followers who fight each other, turning Columbia into a floating battleground. However, when traveling between the different realities through Elizabeth's power, it is possible to see different versions of the story, in which the roles are reversed. Therefore, there is not a villain and a good guy, but there is meaning in the plot, which is gradually revealed with the twists and discoveries of the characters.[/b]\n\nBeing one of BioShock Infinite's strongest points, the story is dense and well-crafted, with revelations well distributed throughout the campaign, which keeps the\n our high interest during game hours. In this way, Infinite will appeal to you who are looking for more than just shooting in a game.\n\n[h1]Columbia delights in every detail[/h1]\nBioShock Infinite's graphics and sound are simply impeccable. The city of Columbia is stunning in every detail, be it the lighting, the richness of objects in the scene or the fluid movement of the characters. It all demonstrates great dedication and care from the game's development team. In addition, the city seems to have a life of its own. In a square, for example, people walk and talk aloud, and not just when you approach and click on characters. DeWitt and Elizabeth are also communicative and initiate conversations with others spontaneously, without our intervention. All this helps in the immersion experience provided by the game.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[b]BioShock Infinite[/b] brings the innovations we wanted to see in [b]BioShock 2[/b] and surprises us by taking the franchise to a new and higher level of quality. The presence of the character Elizabeth is one of the great successes of the game, allowing a fluid interaction with the protagonist both in the complex and intelligent story, as in the frantic combats. The graphics are another asset of Infinite, with impeccable lighting, detail levels and movement.","timestamp_created":1657426857,"timestamp_updated":1658986432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.694968521595001221","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118542612","author":{"steamid":"76561198827039094","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":535,"last_played":1658935778},"language":"english","review":"It's a good game.
