With the release of 1998's Half-Life, Valve's debut title, these developers found themselves thrust into the public eye of the gaming industry. Having literally popularised P.C gaming, the first Half-Life game was met with huge critical success, and it was fairly obvious that people were eager for a sequel. But Half-Life was already one of the greatest gaming titles of all time, and simply making a second one would not be easy. For Half-Life 2 to be a success, it would need to go above and beyond in terms of gaming evolution. And, amazingly, it did just that. Painstakingly crafted alongside the Source engine for several years, Half-Life 2 was delayed again and again, and at one point, was even leaked to the general public prematurely. The leaked game was heavily criticised by fans, and this should come as no surprise considering Valve's primary goal was to (oddly) make Half-Life 2 as different as possible from its predecessor. But even so, this was far from a bad thing for Valve. The game was redesigned from the ground up and, while not 100% flawless, became the amazing milestone that we know and love today. Anyone who gives this game negative feedback has simply not experienced it properly. Some people have said the first game is superior, maybe so. Some have even told me that the Black Mesa mod is better than Half-Life 2. These may be fair opinions, but one cannot deny that this game right here is nothing short of spectacular. \nThe year is 2004: Doom 3 launches to acclaim, Halo 2 for Xbox is released and becomes (perhaps) the best in the series. Both these games are great examples of solid entertainment, and look pretty good for their time. Then Half-Life 2 kicks in the door and really gives us a taste of just how incredible gaming can be. Source engine is amazing, and even in its most dated form here it is just as great as ever hurling empty bottles at walls and hearing them tinkle, or stacking random objects in a pile to see how high you can get it. This groundbreaking game engine where everyone and everything interacts with you is merely the icing on the cake here. Nothing in the world is as satisfying as shooting an enemy and watching them tumble over like a sack of potatoes, or shotgunning someone in the face and bearing witness to their graceful and gory back-flip. And furthermore, Valve knew exactly what they had here, and that's why they gifted the player one of gaming's greatest toys: the zero point energy field manipulator, or simply, the gravity gun. The ability to throw tables, barrels, tyres and practically anything with physics is something that I don't think will ever not be fun. When I play Half-Life 2, it doesn't feel like a mere six years since the last game, it somehow feels new or at the very least, like it came out only a few years back from now. Half-Life 2 is not just Valve's best game, it's their best achievement. And as someone who prefers the first game's much more elaborate weapon arsenal, story and setting, I STILL find it difficult to pick a favourite -  and I don't think I ever will. \nLike every game in existence, Half-Life 2 does of course have some issues. According to some sources, Half-Life 2 is praised for its excellent pacing. I disagree, and find that this is actually one of the game's biggest problems. If I were a developer on this game, I'd have omitted a huge chunk from chapters like Water Hazard, Highway 17, Sandtraps and Nova Prospekt/Entanglement. Either way, too much is always better than too little, and in a game this good, it isn't quite so much a big problem. Secondly, the game's enemies consist of gun-toting humanoids, headcrabs, zombies and antlions. Compare that to the previous game, where we fought little dog creatures that emit sonic blasts, or flying aliens that hurtle laser balls at you, or beefy bullsquid monsters. And on top of that, the game even had mini-boss enemies such as the tentacle creature, the gargantua and the headcrab-spewing Gonarch. Half-Life 2 has bland gunship fights and battles with brainless antlion guards. Not even a final boss is present! But these differences are forgivable. This game boasts epic vehicle sequences on an airboat or the buggy car and gives you an empowering army of arachnids to storm a prison with, and even gives directive control over your own human 'squads'. It's nothing special, but the game knows when to shine and knows when to keep it from outdoing itself. Valve are truly master developers, and are up there with the greatest of their time. \nThe story of the game is praised by many, yet to me it's a little less original than the first game. Trapped in an Orwellian dystopian future, you find yourself amidst a formerly familiar world overrun and enslaved by an evil intergalactic empire. In a game where you are supposed to envision Gordon Freeman as a relatable and personal vessel, it kind of defeats that purpose when everyone you meet treats you like literal Jesus. \nThese problems I have mentioned are easily made up for with how brilliant the game is, however, and this is only something you can understand if you strap yourself in and take a ride through yourself. \nIt's very hard to overstate just how important this game is in general gaming evolution, from the way that you are never taken out of Gordon's perspective, all the way down to how characters look and respond to your presence. It is frighteningly realistic at times, and a lot of feats are achieved here that countless modern games can't keep up with. If it's worth noting, Half-Life 2 was also the first proper release on Steam, and it's crazy to see just how big this platform has gotten today all because it (pretty much) stemmed from this game. \nThe general difficulty feels a little too easy at times, and you are constantly showered with health and ammo,  even on hard difficulty. Some might argue that the little supply boxes that tailor their contents based on what you are needing at that current moment is a good thing, but I think this makes the game a little too generous and means you rarely suffer any big dips in your health or ammo. Regardless, this doesn't pose much of a problem.  \nIf you're a gamer who's never played a Half-Life game, this is obviously a series that won't disappoint. Nevertheless I'll always advise playing them in order to witness the entire story. \nFor fans of action-packed first-person-shooter games, what are you DOING with your life if you haven't played this? The price is more than fair. It's entirely up to you, so... wake up. Wake up and smell the ashes.","timestamp_created":1621301592,"timestamp_updated":1658862174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537037014961242676","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92182305","author":{"steamid":"76561198899868822","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1659160660},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1621297922,"timestamp_updated":1621297922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92182132","author":{"steamid":"76561198871632884","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":1535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1234,"last_played":1640051363},"language":"english","review":"This is, by far, my favorite single-player game ever!

No decaimento, o átomo ao emitir radiação alfa e beta, transforma-se automaticamente em um novo elemento químico, o que ocorre incessantemente até que o átomo deixe de ser radioativo (átomo estável).\n\nJá o jogo não tem o que dizer, é bom.","timestamp_created":1621258624,"timestamp_updated":1621260565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92153083","author":{"steamid":"76561198409815009","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":186,"last_played":1622663816},"language":"turkish","review":"bu oyun denizden çıksa yine yerim","timestamp_created":1621255761,"timestamp_updated":1621255761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92152197","author":{"steamid":"76561199128345276","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":461,"last_played":1658302727},"language":"russian","review":"советую","timestamp_created":1621254346,"timestamp_updated":1646746183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92149956","author":{"steamid":"76561198987727972","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1430,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1310,"last_played":1652570300},"language":"schinese","review":"6666666666666666666666666666666666666666","timestamp_created":1621250817,"timestamp_updated":1621250817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4voeFvfkCdIzD3wI="}
