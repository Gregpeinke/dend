Blindly ignoring its lack of levels or removal from the main character's perspective, both of which are now par for the course, it is best known for revolutionizing the scripted event, non-playable characters and enemy tactics. Every game we play today is either a shoot-fest, descended from Doom, or a thinking man's shooter that traces its lineage to Half Life. Its multiplayer and mod scene also gave birth to the class shooter, due to the proliferation of Team Fortress via the updated \"Classic\" version as well as the realistic shooter and multiplayer-only shooter, courtesy Counterstrike. \n\nHalf Life 2 offered physics as a gameplay mechanic, which is why we have Portal and any other FPS title that has weaponry suited to interact rather than merely destroy. It doesn't get enough credit for its structure, however, though I suspect many developers know what I am talking about. From hopping into a car for a long drive, hitting the waves for a chase or setting up turrets for the oncoming storm, the reason games now have segments that break from the monotony of their formal genre is because HL2 proved how perfectly you can blend them. \n\nThe worst game in the series, HL2 Episode 1, is merely one of the best titles in the genre. It is also one of the most groundbreaking, forcing the player to rely on an A.I. controlled partner for the firepower on enemies lit up with a flashlight OR to invent a weapon for every encounter with the gravity gun. These mechanics still have yet to be equaled by any other title featuring computer-controlled allies. \n\nDo you want some more action? HL Ep. 2 has your action. Jump in your car and ram those fucking Hunters while you race to get a magnusson device onto the Strider's back in time to save White Forest. Simply the most intense action sequences in the history of the FPS medium, no matter how many times we revisit Normandy in the next Call of Battlefield. All done without sacrificing a hint of nuance or story for which the series is so well remembered.\n\nSo yes--yes I nominate to award this, the last entry in the series, as the GAME THAT DESERVES A SEQUEL. Rise and shine, Mister Freeman. Rise and... shine. Not that I... wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest, and all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until... well, let's just say your hour has... come again.","timestamp_created":1480170746,"timestamp_updated":1480170811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27670370","author":{"steamid":"76561198237279804","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":357,"last_played":1505846236},"language":"english","review":"\"GAME

Aunque usa unas mecánicas parecidas a las ya vistas, hace un bueno número de avances y mejoras respecto a sus predecesores. \n\nEn primer lugar es destacable la caracterización de cada uno de los personajes que nos habíamos encontrado con anterioridad. La naturalidad de las expresiones y de las animaciones consigue que parezcan muchísimo más humanos.\n\nOtro aspecto destacable son los escenarios (los más vastos y realistas que encontrarás en un Half-Life).\n\nPor supuesto, aunque esto ya ha sido un hándicap de la serie, la atmósfera es sublime y los tiroteos en sí son endiabladamente divertidos y satisfactorios (ya sea con cada una de las armas que se nos proporciona o con la genial pistola antigravedad).\n\nConclusión: Merece la pena siempre y cuando se haya jugado a las anteriores entregas (por lo menos de Half-Life 2 en adelante), y si todavía no habéis disfrutado de esta saga, haceros un favor y compradla.

Gameplay is great, characters are excellent, and the story, OH BABY THE STORY.  Anyway, they moved from big releases to episodic releases as a strategy for bringing content out more frequently.  \n\nThey then released episodes 1 & 2 within a year of each other.  Episode 2 ended on a huge cliffhanger that left people salivating for more.  They then proceeded to do absolutely nothing for over 9 years (at the time of writing this), and at this point will probably never finish Half-Life 2's story.\n\nI still hold hope to this day that they will release something, but the longer they take, the less likely it will ever happen, and consider it has been 9 years, there is almost no chance they will ever release something.  We can take solace, however, in the fact they didn't release something that fell short.  I think I'd rather they release nothing than something that blows goats.","timestamp_created":1480138298,"timestamp_updated":1480138298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27600315","author":{"steamid":"76561198083396638","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1535601359},"language":"russian","review":"Потрясающая игра, которая достойна продолжения!\n\nNominate this for \"GAME THAT DESERVES A SEQUEL\" !!!","timestamp_created":1480138151,"timestamp_updated":1480138215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503722071647644043","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27600282","author":{"steamid":"76561198032319323","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":298,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1482805922},"language":"english","review":"Should make a sequel","timestamp_created":1480138130,"timestamp_updated":1480138130,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.444237202405929565","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27600005","author":{"steamid":"76561198161859491","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":261,"last_played":1620303155},"language":"english","review":"GAME THAT DESERVES A SEQUEL","timestamp_created":1480137933,"timestamp_updated":1480137933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27599916","author":{"steamid":"76561198068412652","num_games_owned":375,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":145,"last_played":1452323582},"language":"english","review":"\"GAME THAT DESERVES A SEQUEL\" !!!","timestamp_created":1480137872,"timestamp_updated":1480137872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27599574","author":{"steamid":"76561197989600099","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Nominate this for \"GAME THAT DESERVES A SEQUEL\"","timestamp_created":1480137627,"timestamp_updated":1480137627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27598154","author":{"steamid":"76561198307544261","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":529,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50,"last_played":1635890791},"language":"spanish","review":"El mejor juego de todos","timestamp_created":1480136625,"timestamp_updated":1480136625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504175364971160889","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27597909","author":{"steamid":"76561197972225725","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":403,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"this game needs a sequel","timestamp_created":1480136454,"timestamp_updated":1480136454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27597689","author":{"steamid":"76561197992680857","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":11628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1029,"last_played":1596593528},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic game, does not disappoint as the most recent to the Half-Life series (after how long?)\nI ep2 more for mods and maps rather than the actual game though.
