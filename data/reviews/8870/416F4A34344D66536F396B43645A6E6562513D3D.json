at Seaまでプレイすると今作がバイオショックシリーズのストーリーとしては総まとめであり最後の作品になるのではないかと思えてしまってとても寂しい気持ちになりました。前作・前々作に比べるとマップを歩き回る探索要素は減り、リニアな作りで目の前に沸いた敵をひたすら倒しながら進んでいくという要素が大部分を占めるようになりました。しかし特殊能力とマップギミックと武器を駆使した戦闘は今まで通りのバイオショックであり、プレイヤーが受ける衝撃度は1よりだいぶ落ちるものの1度のプレイではまず完全に理解しきれない難解なストーリーは遊べば遊ぶほど理解が深まりとても楽しませてくれます。2K Marinによって作られたバイオショック2が1の世界をそのまま広げたよくできた二次創作ならば、バイオショックインフィニットは原作者Irrational Games、Ken Revineからの最後のファンサービスであり、ちょっと余計な後付け設定に感じる人も多いかもしれませんが1を含めてこれでバイオショックという物語が一つにつながったと思います。シリーズ全作を通して様々な形の親子を描いたバイオショックはインフィニットでまた美しくも悲しい親子の物語が紡がれ、そしてそれは永遠にプレイヤーの記憶に残り続ける最高の体験になるのです。","timestamp_created":1483096292,"timestamp_updated":1509908915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28824140","author":{"steamid":"76561198262879890","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":281,"last_played":1464858122},"language":"english","review":"All

Steampunk, città che galleggiano nel cielo, scienza che si mischia con la fantascienza e con la quantistica. La caratterizzazione dei personaggi, poi, è assurda.\nNon è un gioco in cui l'espolarzione è fondamentale: il percorso è già prestabilito e facilmente intuibile, ma la vera differenza tra una partita e l'altra, sono gli scontri con i nemici. Con difficoltà basse l'IA non è molto competitiva, mentre a livelli difficili diventa una vera e propria sfida. La nota positiva è che, verso la fine del gioco incontrerete 2 o 3 nemici veramente notevoli.\nBioschock Infinite va vissuto come un \"film interattivo\" e non come vero e proprio gioco. La trama è coinvolgente e toccante e piena di colpi di scena.\n","timestamp_created":1483047732,"timestamp_updated":1483047732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28804929","author":{"steamid":"76561198101351691","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":835,"last_played":1575470821},"language":"english","review":"A truly amazing game, it has suprised me throughout the game with new weapons, storylines, and gameplay.\nA must-buy.\n\nStoryline: 10/10\n\nWeapons: 8/10\n\nGameplay: 10/10","timestamp_created":1483045806,"timestamp_updated":1483045806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578811347484588623","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28803850","author":{"steamid":"76561198021275320","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":833,"last_played":1514554979},"language":"french","review":"Un troisième épisode excellent pour une serie dont je rafolle","timestamp_created":1483043773,"timestamp_updated":1483043773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28803603","author":{"steamid":"76561198096557587","num_games_owned":509,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1260,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":313,"last_played":1654797288},"language":"english","review":"Honestly, I didn't care much for this game, the animations and graphics weren't all that good for a game that came out in 2013.

Je vais essayer de résumer ma pensée en clair. \n+ Le gameplay est bon. Très agréable et fluide, et Elisabeth est bien utile. Par contre je ne comprends pas pourquoi on ne peut plus transporter que deux armes, mais soit, ça passe et ça complique un peu les choses, puisqu'il faut choisir les bonnes armes. Donc c'est pas plus mal. \n+ L'univers est superbe. Vraiment. Joli, bien foutu et tout. Je préférais l'ambiance de Rapture mais ça c'est très personnel et au final Columbia a son charme aussi. \n- Le voice acting français est... Heu... J'ai eu l'impression de me retrouver devant un téléfilm M6 sur les ados tant il semblait forcé par moments. Par ailleurs je le soupçonne d'avoir détruit la force évocatrice de plusieurs scènes. \n- Booker parle. Attendez, je la refait : le personnage principal d'un Bioshock parle. Pourquoi c'est mal ? La force des deux premiers (mais surtout le tout premier), c'était justement que le personnage principal était une coquille vide. Il ne sait  rien de lui-même, comme nous, et ne parle jamais. On avance en même temps, ce qui permet une meilleure projection du joueur à l'intérieur de cette coquille. Ca permet une meilleure immersion (et en plus ça sert complètement le propos du jeu). Là, comme Booker parle, la projection est plus difficile, tout au plus peut on ressentir de l'empathie... Enfin, si le voice acting était bon. Et j'ai souvent prié pour qu'il finisse par se la fermer. \n- [spoiler]La cinématique de fin interactive de quinze minutes. Que tout soit clair : soit on fait une vraie cinématique de fin, soit on laisse jouer pour de vrai et on finit par un boss. Là, j'ai juste été frustrée parce que je voulais encore jouer et que la dernière action du jeu est un choix qui n'est même pas un vrai choix. Quel est le putain d'intérêt de demander au joueur d'appuyer sur F pour finir le jeu ? Surtout vu le niveau général du gameplay, qui est plutôt bon, et là pouf, la dernière action du jeu c'est appuyer sur F, même pas un vrai choix. [/spoiler]\n- L'intrigue et la manière de la traiter. J'ai l'impression que le jeu essaye de m'enfoncer dans le crâne à quel point il est subtil et bien écrit et novateur, sauf que les maximes pseudo philosophiques (surtout à la fin) ont la subtilité du bulldozer dans un magasin de porcelaine, et l'intrigue n'est absolument pas novatrice. Enfin, j'ai pas trouvé. Ca me rappelait pas mal de bouquins que j'avais lus. Du coup, j'ai juste eu l'impression que c'était prétentieux. C'est dommage, parce qu'il y avait quelques twists bien traités et bien amenés. Mais j'ai peut-être lu trop de bouquins subtils ?\n- [spoiler]Les multivers. Quand Elizabeth dit qu'on va aller dans le passé tuer Comstock avant qu'il devienne Comstock, ma réaction a été \"mais c'est complètement con ! Si elle le tue dans un univers, même dans plusieurs, il restera forcément des univers où elle n'est pas intervenue vu que c'est le principe des univers multiples !\" Du coup à la fin j'étais pas concentrée et j'étais juste en train de me dire que la fin était débile.[/spoiler]\n- Le fan service. [spoiler] Tout commence dans un phare ? Mais qu'est-ce qui commence dans un phare dans ce jeu, le vrai début de l'histoire est dans l'appartement de Booker ! Par contre oui, les deux premiers Bioshock commencent dans un phare, bien vu. Et puis qu'est-ce qu'on fout à Rapture? Ca sert à rien de mettre Rapture ici à part dire \"t'as vu ? les deux premiers Bioshock hein t'as vu t'as vu !\" et on passe trente secondes à Rapture et voilà, ça sert à rien...[/spoiler]\n\nEn bref : le jeu est bon, agréable à jouer, mais l'intrigue n'est pas au niveau de sa réputation, et la fin est très décevante. Je trouve le premier Bioshock infiniment plus subtil. Infinite est sympa mais la fin est très décevante. On ne peut pas rédiger une évaluation sans mettre un pouce, donc je mets un pouce rouge pour contrebalancer l'enthousiasme ambiant, mais si je pouvais rendre cette évaluation neutre ou mettre un pouce mitigé, je le ferais.","timestamp_created":1483011899,"timestamp_updated":1483012435,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.421724587678909302","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28786701","author":{"steamid":"76561198171675053","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1562178483},"language":"english","review":"Runs smooth on mac mini late 2012","timestamp_created":1483010639,"timestamp_updated":1483010639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28786595","author":{"steamid":"76561198120154392","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":929,"last_played":1474837575},"language":"brazilian","review":"É um jogo bem diferenciado, com boa história e gráficos bonitos.","timestamp_created":1483010418,"timestamp_updated":1483010418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28784848","author":{"steamid":"76561198099519902","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1482934495},"language":"schinese","review":"画面美轮美奂，战斗系统也不错，音乐声音也恰到好处。剧情不算太复杂，二周目完全理清楚了。\nElizabeth人物塑造的好成功，让人发自内心的喜爱。\n喜欢《羞辱》系列的不要错过。\n","timestamp_created":1483006259,"timestamp_updated":1483006259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54098355770111084","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28781617","author":{"steamid":"76561197991834915","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":55,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":55,"last_played":1448794753},"language":"english","review":"Great Story but mechanically a mediocre game.","timestamp_created":1482997564,"timestamp_updated":1482997564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28781378","author":{"steamid":"76561198022007688","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":912,"last_played":1560098771},"language":"english","review":"Very good game with lots of action, graphics are amazing and a very fun game to play and just the fact that you are high above in the clouds on a floating city just makes it even better.","timestamp_created":1482996805,"timestamp_updated":1482996805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28781302","author":{"steamid":"76561198261859509","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1514777381},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un increible juego que quizas al principio no te paresera tan interesante, pero a medida que avanzas en la historia te apegaras más a los personajes","timestamp_created":1482996628,"timestamp_updated":1482996628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28780239","author":{"steamid":"76561198092454451","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":728,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1388721083},"language":"english","review":"Great game, except for the fact that you can complete the whole title in about 10ish hours.....so I heavily regret paying as much as I did.
