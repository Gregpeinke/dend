Di breve durata e sicuramente meno entusiasmante di Opposing Force, va a riproporre ambienti di gioco, armi, nemici e gameplay del titolo principale senza nessuna novità degna di nota. Unica eccezione, la narrazione dal punto di vista del buon Barney Calhoun, che ritroveremo poi all'inizio del secondo capitolo. Unica vera pecca a mio avviso, l'assenza del doppiaggio italiano. Ma nonostante ciò tornare a Black Mesa fa sempre piacere, quindi mi sento di consigliare Blue Shift a tutti gli amanti della serie.","timestamp_created":1626768038,"timestamp_updated":1626772966,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96060822","author":{"steamid":"76561199014110086","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3985,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3985,"last_played":1625488473},"language":"english","review":"It's basically just more Half-Life, which is great, but it's also a bit overpriced.","timestamp_created":1626765420,"timestamp_updated":1626765420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96034542","author":{"steamid":"76561199098038323","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":349,"last_played":1626722803},"language":"english","review":"An ok game but needs more Otis","timestamp_created":1626722836,"timestamp_updated":1626722836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49844062328338623","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96008929","author":{"steamid":"76561198249830266","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":355,"last_played":1626705643},"language":"english","review":"scarier than fnaf","timestamp_created":1626687675,"timestamp_updated":1626687675,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95979024","author":{"steamid":"76561198447713950","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":78,"last_played":1633377592},"language":"english","review":"barneyyyyyy\n\n1000/10","timestamp_created":1626636545,"timestamp_updated":1626636545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95965807","author":{"steamid":"76561197983962408","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":503,"last_played":1626619712},"language":"tchinese","review":"和戰慄時空同一個世界觀的另一個角色視點\n\n遊戲時數較短，關卡也比較簡單，給個好評\n\n另外，重製版正在製作中，可以期待一下","timestamp_created":1626619844,"timestamp_updated":1626619844,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95958840","author":{"steamid":"76561198893165632","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1632068658},"language":"german","review":"Better than HL1 and HLOF","timestamp_created":1626611242,"timestamp_updated":1626611242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95957720","author":{"steamid":"76561198871007229","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1626610124},"language":"english","review":"game is very god ı am love the game half lfie game king","timestamp_created":1626609739,"timestamp_updated":1626609739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474634885787963867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95953149","author":{"steamid":"76561199086627308","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":257,"last_played":1626603169},"language":"russian","review":"Получилось интересно, но серьёзно как-то мало. 4 часа в Half-Life Blue Shift, не сравнятся с 8 часами в Half-life Opossing Force, тем более с 20 часами в оригинальном Half-Life.

Also for a 4€ price tag you can't really complain about it other than the lenght so for most people i'd say just buy the bundle.\n\nRating:\n7.8/10","timestamp_created":1625952346,"timestamp_updated":1625952346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95495818","author":{"steamid":"76561199085730168","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":166,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":166,"last_played":1625943970},"language":"english","review":"Good half life 1 expansion but it should have released before opposing force did.","timestamp_created":1625950755,"timestamp_updated":1625950755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488372087478637695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95484768","author":{"steamid":"76561199117164052","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1628992689},"language":"english","review":"You should play this expansion, you play as Barney Calhoun, a security guard of mid-level which has to save himself as well as help other scientists, the expansion is pretty short and can take up to 3-4 hours.\nHowever, i really recommend you playing this expansion, you dont get some of the weapons from the main game's arsenal, but it is still really good. 10/10","timestamp_created":1625937817,"timestamp_updated":1625937817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95477297","author":{"steamid":"76561198276176753","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":637,"last_played":1625992882},"language":"english","review":"i left it running for 2 years and never realized","timestamp_created":1625929901,"timestamp_updated":1625929901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95460691","author":{"steamid":"76561199085669476","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":101,"last_played":1625911629},"language":"russian","review":"для тех кому интересна биография Барни самое то","timestamp_created":1625911716,"timestamp_updated":1625911716,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiv34x/oCc9WT7AI="}
