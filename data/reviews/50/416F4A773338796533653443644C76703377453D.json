I loved the lack of lighting in a lot of spots, making you resort to night vision to see in pitch black darkness, it reminded me a lot of the Outlast games in that regard. I think the game I'd compare it most to would be F.E.A.R., which is an absolute master in the ways of horror and first-person shooting. \n\nOverall this is a solid expansion to Half-Life, and if you
