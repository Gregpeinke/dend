Portal наравне с Half-life стали самыми узнаваемыми и любимыми играми у нескольких поколений, а образы главных героев постоянно мелькают в короткометражках, косплеях и прочих художественных проявлениях. Здесь не будет тонны шуток о том, что Valve не умеют считать до трех или о том, что главные герои их игр брутально немы как акулы. Просто небольшое описание для тех, кто все еще сомневается – играть или нет (если такие еще остались).\n\nНа ваше усмотрение вверяются молчаливая и абсолютно невозмутимая девушка Челл и болтливый харизматичный робот (опять-таки женского полу) ГЛЭдОС. И вашим нехитрым делом будет создание дыр в пространстве с помощью портальной пушки и, собственно, изучение сего феномена на физику нашего грешного мира. И была бы это обычная головоломка, если бы не сюжет. Ненавязчиво и постепенно вам дадут понять, что здесь что-то не так. Найдется место и для драмы, и для предательства, и для сочувствия. Все идеально и нет претензий. Хотя многие сетуют, что игра коротковата, но как по мне, так это плюс – она не успевает надоесть и это при абсолютной однообразности действий и окружения. А кому все же мало, то усложненные камеры и дополнительные головоломки вам в помощь. От некоторых голова дымится только так (и не только голова).\n\nПроходите тесты, остерегайтесь турелей с милыми голосочками, а также не забывайте, что … вы … торт.","timestamp_created":1457174562,"timestamp_updated":1457174562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.643596887588500977","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21637842","author":{"steamid":"76561198078135187","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1606025882},"language":"english","review":"Great GREAT game.","timestamp_created":1457172152,"timestamp_updated":1457172152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21634037","author":{"steamid":"76561198179556215","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":490,"last_played":1511418999},"language":"spanish","review":"increible historia, un poco corta pero sigue siendo  uno de los mejores juegos hechos por Valve.\nPortal 2 sigue sus pasos al pie de la letra","timestamp_created":1457154273,"timestamp_updated":1511418614,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21632716","author":{"steamid":"76561198204605621","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":92,"last_played":1491999875},"language":"schinese","review":"非常有趣的解密游戏，神作的第一代作品，反正就是好玩","timestamp_created":1457147738,"timestamp_updated":1457147738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21632208","author":{"steamid":"76561198255485583","num_games_owned":334,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":151,"last_played":1457144692},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic game, that almost a decade down the track, still doesn't show it's age.

Although not mutch of a replay value here unless you want to find all the secrets and complete all the achievments which there are not many of.\nAdvanced puzzles are fun and something more to do in the game.\nYou can see by my playtime that i havent played much of it and completed only the storyline which is not long. It took me only 2-2.5h to complete the whole storyline.\nReading other reviews the average time to complete the story is about 2-3h and about another hour to complete the advanced maps.\nOverall a very great game, worth the money and time.","timestamp_created":1456839667,"timestamp_updated":1456839667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21558557","author":{"steamid":"76561198060632715","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":4938,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3505,"last_played":1572473775},"language":"english","review":" abh so its good","timestamp_created":1456809914,"timestamp_updated":1456809914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6eWomNMCfdGeUg=="}
