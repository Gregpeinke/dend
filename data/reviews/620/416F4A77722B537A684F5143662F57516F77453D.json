My brother's friend came over with the 360 disc and I stayed up all night playing. Then, of course, he took the game when he left. I immediately wanted to continue playing,  I was hooked from that point forward. Played through the entirety of it on some awful computer and getting 20 FPS average. It was worth every second of it, honestly. \n\nThe campaign is, of course, one of the standout singleplayer modes of gaming. The difficulty curve is well-done, the humor is always well-executed and there's tons of places to listen to additional dialogue if you feel like waiting to see what happens.\nThen, of course, the co-op is a solid continuation of said singleplayer but continues the curve with the addition of a second set of portals and, of course, another person to cooperate with. I have tons of good memories with friends and randoms alike, especially the moments where you have to decide if you REALLY want to solve right then and there or if you want to move the bridge your partner's relying on.\nAnd, to top it all off, there's a leaderboard system that allows you to go for least time/portals with your friends. To this day I occasionally check on my scores to make sure nobody's beaten them, and it's always a pleasant surprise when someone has.\n\nAll in all, the game's simply amazing. If the fact that it's the #1 rated game on Steam with 121,015 Positive reviews to 1,586 Negative doesn't indicate its sheer quality, I don't know what will.

That's brilliant!\n\nThe in-game commentary is also an appreciated feature and was an interesting insight of the game.\nAlong with the possibility to play multiplayer over the network, and also creating a separate multiplayer campaign, plus the ability to easily play community-made maps from inside the game itself, giving you a perfect experience, especially for the puzzle-solving loverrs, which is yet to be matched by any other game.","timestamp_created":1529163203,"timestamp_updated":1529163203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42765360","author":{"steamid":"76561198432917400","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":93,"last_played":1655925469},"language":"russian","review":"По мойму это лучшее после Half-Life от Valve","timestamp_created":1529159906,"timestamp_updated":1529159906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42764127","author":{"steamid":"76561198113036510","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":307,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":235,"last_played":1534767328},"language":"english","review":"one of the best games ever","timestamp_created":1529156150,"timestamp_updated":1529156150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491192400455474854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr+SzhOQCf/WQowE="}
