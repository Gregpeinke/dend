You think she's sad because the mall's closed??[/h1]\n\nAfter Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Team Fortress 2 and Portal, we’ve come to expect nothing less from Valve. Left 4 Dead explores the same basic premise as most classic zombie movies from Dawn of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead, 28 Days Later and so on and the coolest thing about is the fact that Valve doesn’t even try to hide it. It’s got all the crazy and wild cliche you’ve come to expect from a zombie movie or a TV Show. You play as one of the four survivors immune from the deadly virus. The survivor consists of Bill - Bill, the grizzled veteran, Zoey – the spoiled princess, Francis aka The Biker and finally Louis, the middle-class office worker that happens to be have importance in every movie or TV show. This game was released back in 2008 might I add, way before Zombies became a part of pop-culture like the time when The Walking Dead became a phenomenon.   \n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+Aged like a wine. Couple thousands of people still playing in 2020 despite being over a decade old. \n+Playing with friends is awesome, really puts you in the shoes of classic zombie movie with hard R-Rated violence and gore.\n+Killing and torching zombies couldn’t be more fun! You’ll be killing hordes of undead Nazis. \n+The atmosphere is tense, with creepy soundtrack. Perfect for co-op.\n+Large arsenal of crazy weapons you’d expect in a zombie apocalyptic world. Besides guns medkits, pain pills, flashlights, molotovs, pipe bombs, gasoline, propane tanks are equally helpful to keep you and your team survive. \n+Advanced enemy A.I that acts like a dynamic difficulty setting. It will throw more hordes if you’ve got a skilled/experienced team. If you’re having a hard time the A.I automatically eases you with health kits and ammo. The developers call this system ‘the Director.’ \n+Combat is similar to pretty much the similar to like other games using Source engine like Counter Strike Global Offensive, No Room in Hell, Insurgency, and Team Fortress 2. Just point, aim and shoot. \n+Gameplay holds up quite well if you’ve played other Valve shooters you know what to expect.  \n+Excellent port. Windows and Mac support. Flawless performance, supports high refresh rates and resolution. \n+Creative presentation. They are four scenarios and each of it starts with a movie like poster and ends with movie style credits. Adds it little flavor to the mix y’know.\n+Group conversations are really fun and engaging. The amount of dialogue each character should please you considering the fact that most Valve games don’t have a protagonist with voice acting. Eh, can’t imagine a fun zombie shooter with no funny one liners.  \n+Perfectly captures the tension and the action of Hollywood zombie movies.\n+So many enemy types. There’s are Hunters that pin you down from a long distance, then there’s Tanker with lots of hitpoints, Boomers that vomits toxic gas on you making you blind for a few seconds, the smoker, which has a frog-like tongue that can grab a survivor by the throat and finally the good ol’ horde zombies typically seen everyone most notably in Killing Floor, Dying Light and Call of Duty Zombies. \n+Developer commentary, remote play, LAN play Steam cloud, achievements, trading card, VAC and workshop support. \n+Extremely good replayability.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n-Although this might be subjective to some, I felt playing this solo is extremely boooooringgg. Please don’t buy this if you’re looking for a good single player experience because you’re most likely going to be disappointed customer.\n-Please don’t play this with bots but if you’re still up for single player keep in mind that the bots have not really improved, they cannot pick up explosives and have slow reaction times.\n-Lacks a proper narrative. Anyone expecting a good story please step aside; Thank You 😊 \n-Random matchmaking is filled with toxic people and campers. They won’t mind you from dying.\n-Level design is a bit linear. \n-Graphics haven’t aged well enough to please everyone\n-No PS3/PS4 edition. Crossplay would have been really fun with left4dead. Xbox one supports x360 version through backwards compatibility. \n-Campaign might be too short for some players who don’t like replaying the same levels over and over.\n\n[h1]The Bottom Line[/h1]\nLeft4Dead is a fun co-op first-person shooter so good that it inspired a lot of developers, big and small to create tons of zombie shooters and fun co-op adventure games. If you’re new to multiplayer games this is a great place to start but if you’ve already played tons of modern zombie shooters then you might not like this as much since its dated and offer linear maps. Definitely recommend getting at sale price. Also I suggest playing with friends.\n\n[h1]My Rating: 8.5/10[/h1] \nWhat do you think about Left4Dead.

свое время этот Survival-шутер стал образцом и отправной точкой для многих игровых проектов в этом жанре дальнейших этапов игровой индустрии. Сразу отмечу, что расцениваю эту категорию не так придирчиво, как тактические шутеры. Требования тут явно другие должны быть. Сюжет понятно обсуждать нет смысла, ибо это туфта, сказка про квартет музыкантов на хоккее. Касательно игрового процесса, здесь просто стоит ожидать респаун полчищ тварей и не расслабляться. И это кстати неплохо для моделирования выживания в играх. Производитель не заморачивался над баллистикой и реализмом, сделал ставку на сумятицу. Нет сильного отличия, проскочить спринтом от начала до финальной точки или высматривать каждого зомби. То есть прохождение отрезка колеблется может от 2 до 20 минут. Кроме чисел статистики, там разницы не увидеть. Есть несуразные моменты, типа когда противник может выбить персонажа за пределы локации. Возможно большего лоска игре добавила возможность улучшения навыков и так распределения их по одиночной игре. Достаточно прилично выполнен кооператив. Графика не предельно приближенна к реализму, но она отчетливая очень в целом по разным атрибутам. Фирменная марка Valve замечается сразу. Звуковому сопровождению лишь только не хватает возможно драйвового музыкального фона под стать обстановке. В остальном по звуку все безупречно. Начиная от диалогов и заканчивая отчетливыми внешними звуками.\nИтог. Геймплей - 7,5. Графика - 8,5. Звук - 9.
