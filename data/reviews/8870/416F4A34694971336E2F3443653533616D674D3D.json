Старенький на данный момент шутерок с примитивной историей и никчемной подачей. Игры такого рода приводят к стагнации интересов и потере вкуса у человека.Такие игры закладывают в игроке страсть к бездумному экшену , убивая тягу к искусству.\nА вторая игра - про подводный городок.\n\nBioshock Infinite - очень красивое произведение и просто отвратительнейшая игрушка.\n\nНесмотря на то, что к сюжету у меня несколько вопросов , остановиться хочется на геймплее - к нему главная претензия.\nПочему столь любимые многими РАБОЧИЕ механики из первой части, реализованы в новой так паршиво, так несбалансированно, как будто бы сломано.\nПочему противники чуть ли не неуязвимы к пулям, выпущенным в них,даже при условии прокачки пушек?\nПочему соли расходуются столь активно, не принося особого отклика при использовании? Ведь теперь при атаке, условным, шоковым эффектом, противник не зажаривается заживо, а лишь на время \"выходит\" из схватки.Почему отняли возможность переносить с собой необходимые к частому употреблению бутыли с маной или аптечки?Почему вообще все что связано с магией - фактически балласт, которым я пользовался исключительно для того, чтобы нарочно и самолично разнообразить игровой процесс?\nПочему игрок вынужден таскать с собой не более чем пару видов оружия и несколько патронов к ним, при условии, что противников много, они живучие, а игра даже по своей планировке , потворствует играть в открытую и динамично скакать от одного урода к другому.НО НЕТ! так не получится. Ведь мои полномочия - все...И это в игре,которая себя даже по трейлерам зарекомендовала ,как горячий боевик.\nА я знаю, почему так сделано.Знаю! Для того чтобы оправдать наличие компаньонки, чтобы дать ей роль чуть полезнее мебели.Чтобы ОНА выполняла функцию \"принеси-подай\".Спасибо,блят.ь, я бы сам не справился.И лишь факт существования Элизабет в качестве геймплейно \"полезного\" персонажа уже рушит процесс игры.\n\nА сюжет? Вот эта вот нарочно запутанная неразбериха кажется кому-то сильной и глубокой историей, которая, используя запрещенный прием, оправдывает любые бредни, пресловутой мультивселенной и порталами?\nДаже если так. Даже если это элемент научной фантастики.\nКак вообще этот еб\"№;%чий город держится в облаках? Как вы там дышите? Ушки не закладывает?А давление в норме?\nПочему Букер просто не застрелил нахер коллекторов, которые отправили его и так на самоубийственное и невыполнимое задание ?\nПочему Лизе в голову не пришло просто ,открыв в портал, отправиться в Париж.Такие возможности, баба, такой ,мля , потенциал .Любая эпоха на выбор, любая местность...\nБезыдейная , абсурдная и скучная игрушка.Да еще и растянутая и разбавленная ерундой.","timestamp_created":1642098705,"timestamp_updated":1642098705,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496587485074996948","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107931632","author":{"steamid":"76561198301959063","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":735,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":699,"last_played":1658633747},"language":"brazilian","review":"⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠿⠛⠛⠛⠋⠉⠈⠉⠉⠉⠉⠛⠻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠛⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⡏⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⢏⣴⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣟⣾⣿⡟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⢢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⠀⡴⠄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⠟⠻⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠶⢴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿\n⣿⣁⡀⠀⠀⢰⢠⣦⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣼⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠀⣴⣶⣿⡄⣿\n⣿⡋⠀⠀⠀⠎⢸⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠗⢘⣿⣟⠛⠿⣼\n⣿⣿⠋⢀⡌⢰⣿⡿⢿⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⢸⣿⣿⣧⢀⣼\n⣿⣿⣷⢻⠄⠘⠛⠋⠛⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣧⠈⠉⠙⠛⠋⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣧⠀⠈⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠟⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⢃⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⡿⠀⠴⢗⣠⣤⣴⡶⠶⠖⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⡸⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⡀⢠⣾⣿⠏⠀⠠⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠛⠉⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣧⠈⢹⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠈⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣴⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⣄⣀⣀⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⡄⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿
