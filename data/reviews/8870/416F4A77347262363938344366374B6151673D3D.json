I am  Metis. Playing a guy who commited genocide at Wounded Knee is like expecting a Jewish person to roleplay  as a repentent Nazi death camp operator or asking a African American player to play as a repentent plantation owner. Are you kidding me? The entire intertubes would be screaming in a game with such an opening premise yet this has been completely glossed over by every single critic. In this game it's a redeeming quality to want to be The Great White Proddy Saviour of the Irish Catholic, Black and Asian populaces while doing nothing of value to make amends to the actual minority people Booker committed the atrocities against? But then I guess all us  minorities are interchangeable, right?  Calling it a 'redemption story' in this context is meaningless at best, terminally egregious towards people of colour, at worst. I wanted to get past this, I truly did--but nothing in game happened to make me want to know Booker, never mind, wanna BE him enough to keep running around shooting complete strangers in the face for some illogical theological fairytale that this would redeem him for his past transgressions. So, for anyone out there that felt discomfited from the start of this game, there's psychological validity to that gut-clenching dissonance you experienced.\n\nBooker has no agency as a character, at all. Everything is \"yes\", he cannot say \"no\" or else the game cannot progress. He is being led around by the nose in this game. While in Bioshock lack of real choice was cleverly built into the entire plot line--here it just served to pull me right out of the story. What good is his \"repentence\" if he actually has no choice as a character, to choose humanism or stay a self-centred bad azz? What if he actually wants to help Elizabeth live her own life? He can't. So much for player agency.  Somehow, the writers forgot that games are not films and without agency, such a protagonist is just not that interesting in the video game medium. How is shooting the sheeyit out of everyone in sight cohesive with any of that world-building?\n\nI leave it to more experienced game critics to answer the questions on why this is destroyed by being an FPS in the first place.\n\nAll I could think of as Booker fifteen minutes into it was, \"Why the he11 am I mass murdering all these people? What has changed since Wounded Knee?  I am slaughtering townspeople of all colours by the thousands for what? ONE GIRL and some unnamed debt?\" There's nothing likeable about the guy, which might be entertaining if he was a complex 'magnificient baztard' trope but he's not amusing enough to qualify for that. Every time he used missed tenses or slang, it was cringeworthy. He spoke clean English except the oddly jarring occassions where he suddenly developed amnesia about past/present tenses that he knew five minutes ago. He's educated enough to fill out reports as a top Pinkerton's man yet he can't manage to string together a proper sentence?\n\nElizabeth is every street john's wet dream. You rescue this sheltered teenaged damsel in distress then she spends the rest of the game gratefully throwing you useful articles and money while dodging bullet spray. Duh, Whut? You can't actually have a conversation with her. She's like a rubber blow-up doll with pre-programmed responses as robotic as Booker's. Her reaction to all this mass slaughter after a quiet life is to run away from you [smart girl]then stops [eejit alert, you're a mass-murdering psycho with a chainsaw in your hand and btw where are you getting batteries for that thing?] Never once does she have a gigantic melt-down even when she commits her first murder. She devotes an entire thirty seconds decrying her decisions that caused the devestation of an entire city full of human beings. Yet she does a 180 shift from that personality to forgiving her cruel adoptive mother's ghost for hating her in a scene so saccarine my controller got diabetes. The game writers don't seem to know the difference between momentary sentimental dosh and a gamer being deeply moved by psychological depth displayed by in-game characters. The psychologically unsound character inconsistancies threw me completely out of the game. At that point, I stopped caring a whit what these two mass murdering fiends did and just wanted to finish the game off as quickly as possible. So much for \"deep emotional content\". \n\nEvery single character in this game is a cliche. There's no complexity or cohesion to their actions or beliefs.\n\nI kept on playing hoping the character's actions would display some pragmatic justification. Dimension-hopping as an excuse for taking no responsibility for mass slaughter just doesn't cut it. I kept hoping the story would converge in a way that would make sense.\n\nIt didn't.\n\nA good storyline in a game can leave a player elated, grieving, ecstatic, panicked or with various complex emotions that can take time to sort through. A satisfying story can cause a player to ponder for days and ask questions about the depth of the experience and the meaning behind their personal responses to that game. This one can't. It's all washed away in a tide of convoluted, Whovian time-jumping paradoxes and Farscapian alternative dimensional mind-boggery--without any of the fun.\n\nThis game is video cotton candy. It is pretty to look at, gives the illusion of being more substantial than it is. Like cotton candy it only consists of surface fluff and consuming too much of it will make you throw up.\n\nIf you're looking for a cohesive plot or character/sociopolitcal depth in this game people, move along. It's a shoot-em-up with pretensions of quantum mechanics grandeur.","timestamp_created":1438663167,"timestamp_updated":1438663167,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17377688","author":{"steamid":"76561198129530919","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":168,"last_played":1467119064},"language":"french","review":"Franchement ce jeu est un des meilleurs single player ...\nDes graphismes géniaux , une aventure \"prenante\" et un gameplay très rythmé , tout cela fait de ce jeu une merveille ...\n","timestamp_created":1438663159,"timestamp_updated":1438663159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17377267","author":{"steamid":"76561198089750425","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":728,"last_played":1615062623},"language":"english","review":"This game i just absolutely amazing!

And I don't want to make the game mad, this is just my opinion about it. \n\n[b]SHORT:[/b] It could have been a really cool adventure game if there would be more interaction with the people and the city, or it could have been a cool shooter if there would be more enemies instead of the townfolks.\n\n[b]LONG: (bonus: more bad english)[/b] \n+ Really nice visual style\n+ A good story with interesting characters\n+ All the shooter relevant stuff (controls, response, etc)\n\n- You never get the feeling that this city is alive. It's huge, it's flying, has lots of intersting places and is filled with 3 or 4 people. To be honest, there are some more, but it all feels pretty empty after the introduction levels. You can't really interact with the townfolks unless they are relevant for the current event and a lot of them look alike.\n\n- Enemies mostly come in short waves after triggering a certain point or do something offensive (what the game counts as offensive is sometimes a bit weird). The townfolk is simply vanished, no one is running around, hiding in fear (at least I never saw that)\n\n- Until now there is no good use for vending machines because most of the times you can't efford the stuff you really want. You run through the levels search in every corner to find a few bucks just to find out that you can efford:\n[list]\n    [*] Ammo - which you don't need because there arent that much enemies..and the few drop ammo.\n    [*] Medkits - which you don't need because there was a lot of healthy stuff in that corners you've searched before.\n    [*] NO UPGRADES - they are there, you just can't efford them, go...search more bucks in more corners.\n[/list]\n\n- There are more things that all together often break the immersion and the flow of the game which is kind of sad because the scenario is more than awesome.
