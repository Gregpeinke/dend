Chaque perks contient 6 niveau qui vous permettront d'accroître vos dégâts et diminué le coût des armes de la spécialité. Le leveling, très long, de toutes les perks au niveau max vous prendra un peu plus de 200 heures de jeu (mais si vous aimer le jeu, ça monte relativement assez rapidement), sauf si vous décidez de passer par une map de leveling (chose que je déconseille car vous aurez peut être le niveau max sur vos perks, mais vous resterez un boulet pour votre équipe par manque d'heure de jeu).\n\nEnfin, 5 niveau de difficulté existent allant de \"Facile\" (difficile de mourir dans ce mode) à \"Enfer sur Terre\" (très difficile à finir, même pour un joueur expérimenté) où la moindre erreur peu être fatale.\n\nLe jeu met en avant l'aspect coop et est très agréable lorsqu'on joue avec des gens qu'on connaît. Le mode solo reste moins amusant (bien que plus stressant) et plus dur à mon goût surtout dans les modes difficultés les plus élevés (personne ne peut rattraper vos boulettes ^^\").\n\nLa bande son reste sympas et bien adapté au jeu.\n\nLes chasseurs de succès en auront pour leur compte (actuellement 285 succès) avec des succès accessible que pendant certaines périodes de l'année, d'autres restant très difficile à réaliser (attention à la traduction française qui, parfois, ne veut pas du tout dire ce qui est prévu sur le succès en anglais).\n\nBien qu'il existe un grand nombre de DLC, ils n'influent pas sur le jeu (not pay to win) et restent pour la plupart des skins d'armes ou des nouveaux skins de perso.\n\nEnfin, de nouvelles cartes officielles sortent régulièrement ce qui permet de ne pas tomber dans la routine des maps.\n\nLe seul bémol du jeu viendra sans doute de son aspect graphique qui reste très simpliste et pas assez finalisé.\n\nVivement le 2 !\n\nÉdit : KF >

Каждый раз как заканчивается волна у вас есть время чтобы добежать до него и закупиться, если же вы не успели, то игра поможет вам. По карте разбросаны стволы и коробки с аммуницией, что повысит ваши шансы на выживание. (Колличество аммуниции зависит от режима сложности игры)\n Есть несколько режимов сложности. От \"Для детишек\" до \"В ваших штанах Афганистан\". Сложность действительно чувствуется и её видно. Взять простых например \"зомби\" на легком уровне сложности они Медленно ходят, наносят меньше урона, от них легко уйти. А вот на \"ад на земле\" они вполне быстро ходят и жизней у них побольше и вообще лучше не давать им групироваться и окружать себя. \n Вообщем игра хорошая, она сама о себе говорит в трейлерах. Советую брать тем, кому нравится замедление времени (которое действует иногда не вовремя), отбивание толп врагов (а в конце вас ждет босс Патриарх который...), зарабатывание ачивок (их очень много), прокачка (в игре 6 перков, есть чем заняться) и кооперативный режим, потому что играть одному не
