The story so far is ok, the art and setting is beautiful. Such a great contrast to the secular city and ideology of Rapture. The gameplay, though. While it feels good, it feels like an extended tutorial mode. The game is constantly holding your hands. Low on health, Elizabeth can pull a health kit out of her -wherever and give it to you. Need salts? \"Here, catch!\" said Elizabeth for the 100th time in under 15mins. No Elizabeth, I actually didn't need salts, since every 2 steps I take in this game, I'm stumbling on one or two glowing blue salt vials. Same for ammo, same for health kits, she even finds money for you. Am I escorting Elizabeth or is she or rather the game escorting me? Also, on top of everything, the AI in this game is absolute trash. When the enemy soliders aren't stumbling out of cover, for no reason, they are standing around doing nothing. Sometimes with Elizabeth right next to them, doing the same thing. When you first rescue her, the game gives a message saying something along the lines of \"You don't have to worry about her, she can take care of herself in a fight\". It now makes sense, I don't have to worry about her because the AI doesn't even go after her apparently, unless it's scripted. I'll never understand why developers do this. Well, I do, it's so they can make more money, lol. Which as a company you can't really blame them, but damn, what a fall from grace.

Simply put, I didn't enjoy the \"enclosed\" feeling of Bioshock 1 & 2 Call it whatever you want, I wouldn't say phobia because I'm fine with small spaces. It's really just the whole underwater \"There's a whole sunken metropolis\" thing. I also find Atlantis to be a pretty dull subject, sue me. I tried so many times to enjoy them and I've almost beaten both at this point but it has taken years to get to that point, and now, I just don't really care enough to finish them. \n\nIn rolls Bioshock Infinite where instead you are on a floating city. Yeah, you're still stranded but at least you can breathe in the fresh air (whatever oxygen may exist that high up). I can't really say much about the little details of the game itself from memory at this point, because it has been a few years since I've played and beaten this game. But I remember starting it up for the first time and not sleeping that night. Everything about it amazed me compared to the previous games, which are still great in terms of story and content. It may have been the parallels and connections with American History (history major) in conjunction with the pseudo-fascist culture of Columbia, or it could be the semi-industrious half-baked concept of floating cities carried by zeppelins, or it could be the absolutely insane style of animation that Irrational Games used. The whole \"Save the girl, save the world\" cliche may be a bit played out but it's done so in such a way that only Irrational could do. They managed to harness a metric fuck tonne of creativity simply in the connection between Booker and Elizabeth. The ending, every bittersweet second of it, left me staring at my wall for a while as the credits rolled. \n\nTruly a 10/10 from me.
