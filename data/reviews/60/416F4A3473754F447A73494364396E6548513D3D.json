I recently held a LAN party with 2 of my friends and we didn't really have any multi-player games to play, so jokingly I said \"Hey guys, let's play Ricochet!\" As luck would have it, they had the game too, so we installed and played it. My first impression of this small, 3-map game was \"This is gonna suck\" but as time went on, we all had a blast laughing at the low-quality screams of falling into a huge pink spinning vortex after being hit in the face by a high-speed disk.

It brings you into its world and immerses you in its culture from the very title screen, urging you to play more, to investigate, explore, and really see your environment from the viewpoint of your character. It does this not by throwing you into lengthy, drawn-out cinematics, but with control and movement unparalleled in any game to date, graphics unrivaled by even the largest of studios, and combat so immersive, so unmatched, that no other game can quite compare.
