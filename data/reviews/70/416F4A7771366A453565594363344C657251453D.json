It's just a fu cking awesome game that's still fun to this day. This was the first video game that I played when I was a kid, and it possibly shaped me of who I am today. What Valve created here was a masterpiece and should be played by everyone. \n\nPROS:\n- The weapons are fun as hell to use. My favorite weapons pack is the default one. In my opinion, I'm not that big of a fan for the HD pack, though I like the shotgun model. My favorite weapon in this game is the Gauss Gun, what a great weapon.\n- The enemies are amazing and iconic. There's variety between the enemies like the marines, headcrabs, bullsquid, alien grunts, alien slaves etc. Some of the enemies have armor that reflexes your bullets; there's a specific spot where you have to hit them in sometimes.\n- The story is interesting and fun, the dialogue is also iconic and entertaining. \n- The gameplay is fun as hell and I still find myself wanting to play it today. \n- The protagonist is also iconic. But the best part is that you are Gordon Freeman, you can kill people in this game and you get no consequences for it. You get to imagine who Gordon Freeman is, is he crazy, a hero, a villain, an assshole, a kind person, all the above perhaps? You can imagine who he is and go wild.\n- The setting is also interesting. Black Mesa has so many mysteries behind it, it made me want to know more about this company. I just want explore more and learn more about the fu cked up company known as \"Black Mesa.\" I really think Black Mesa is the main character in this game because you are there for most of the game. When you keep going down or exploring the facility the place gets more unwelcoming as you continue; the place keeps getting rustier and you learn information that wasn't meant to be seen by the human eye.\n- The G-man is the most mysterious character in gaming of all time. I love this guy because of that.\n- The detail in this game is amazing. There’s still a ton of stuff in this game that I’m not aware of, the roaches have their own A.I., the houndeye investigate machinery, when enemies are injured they run away etc. There’s just so much detail in this game, sometimes I’ll find out something I didn’t know before like a item in a specific spot or something else\n\nCONS:\n- Xen, an alien planet that's a borderworld beyond our reality, was probably the weakest part of the game for me. The concept though is amazing, it’s so unhuman and different. But that’s also the problem, different from the other parts of the game; people have trouble with the jumps, ammo becomes scarce, zero gravity effects the combat, and those god damn alien controllers (the alien controller is the worst enemy ever made in a game)\n- uuummmmmmmmmmmm…………………………………….. IDK what else to say that’s bad about the game. I love everything about Half-life, I don’t have too many problems with it (That I can think of off the top of my head)\n\nBasically, this game is incredible and should be played by everyone. This is my favorite FPS game of all time; if it wasn’t for this game, then I could have not gotten into gaming when I was young (obviously I would have gotten into gaming, but not as soon)  But wait!!!!! There’s even a modding community out there for this game, and it’s still going strong. A lot of those mods are also incredible and should be played. I really love this game, really I do. It’s hard to think that Valve once cared.\n\n\n\nEdit: \n\nI forgot to say how it's Half-life's 20th Anniversary.\nUUMM..Happy bIrthday Half-life, I love you deeply!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1542579803,"timestamp_updated":1593270333,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56081080436706543","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45889278","author":{"steamid":"76561198173177883","num_games_owned":227,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":623,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":615,"last_played":1558746822},"language":"english","review":"Pyrocynical wasn’t in it\n","timestamp_created":1542577960,"timestamp_updated":1542577960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489703655242919922","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45889126","author":{"steamid":"76561198164589089","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":1134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1134,"last_played":1464317877},"language":"brazilian","review":".","timestamp_created":1542577312,"timestamp_updated":1542577312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45887543","author":{"steamid":"76561198316170267","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":103,"last_played":1530027281},"language":"english","review":"some old school sssssshit","timestamp_created":1542570965,"timestamp_updated":1542570965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45886343","author":{"steamid":"76561198105349350","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3015,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1058,"last_played":1650409620},"language":"english","review":"PROS:\n\n+A good and unique story.\n+Immersive story telling.\n+Gameplay that still holds up.\n+Amazing AI.\n+Great pacing.\n+An iconic soundtrack.\n+Spawned one of the best fanbases around.\n+Still being modded to this day.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Valve can't count to three.\n\nPersonal Thoughts:\n\n How do I even start, everyone knows its one of the best PC games ever made. It put Valve on the map as a game studio, which went on to make titles just as good or better than their predecessors. The story begins as you as playing as mit graduate called Gordon Freeman who arrives one mourning to do some testing. Unfortunately, you happen to cause a renaissance cascade, and must fight your way to the surface to survive! While playing, control is never takin away from the player, so everything you experince is from your point of view. Not only is the heart pumping gameplay good, it still holds up and even better than some shooters today. The enemy AI is intelligent and will constally force you out of cover if you don't keep moving as well as lob gernades at you. Its pacing is excellent and knows when to put in gameplay and puzzles along with story. The soundtrack is amazing and fits well with the atmosphere aswell as get your heart pumping, it only plays in specific parts of the game which makes it unqiue. Half-Life has created one of the most devoted and unique fanbases ever which created mods that are just as good as the main game. Overall, you can not call yourself a PC gamer if you haven't played this.\n\nFinal Score: 11/10","timestamp_created":1542566108,"timestamp_updated":1561775034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45883757","author":{"steamid":"76561198244422326","num_games_owned":310,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1628772557},"language":"schinese","review":"win10闪退为什么……","timestamp_created":1542556337,"timestamp_updated":1542556337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45880551","author":{"steamid":"76561198131117489","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1159,"last_played":1612111839},"language":"russian","review":"Эххх....\nЧто сказать о этой игре?\nДа скажу)\nИстория ознакомления:\nСижу я такой короче в компе.\nСмотрю и есть такая игра Халф-Лайф 1\nЗахожу в неё\nМой брат показывает как играть в неё\nДошел до гаргантюа на рельсах\nПросто не захотел дальше играть)\nПотом видел мод блэк меза и засел в ней.\nЗахожу через несколько лет в неё.

Шутер и первая игра всеми известной Valve , вышедшая в 1998 . К ней можно относиться по разному , но именно она дала толчок для шутеров , отголоски которого видно до сих пор . \n\nИменно после сабжа в шутерах начали удивлять внимание сюжету и его подаче . Да - были и до Халвы попытки : багованный на момент выхода SiN , 1 System Shock ( который не был чистым шутером ) , но по большей части сюжет в шутерах обычно подавался в текстовом файле в папке с игрой , либо через ролики/экраны текста между эпизодами . \nТут же все сделано правильно и сюжет развивается прямо в процессе игры и до самого ее конца - посредством всяких скриптовых сценок , информации отсоюзных нпс ( которые ещё могут помочь в некоторых стычках ! ) и даже вражеских . \n\nНачинает игра удивлять уже с 1 уровня , где мы просто едем на монорельсе через весь комплекс . А по прибытию можем ,,поболтать’’ с мирными учёными/ охранниками , побаловаться с микроволновкой и изучить небольшой участок лабы . \nСейчас такое конечно не удивляет , но в момент выхода для многих это стало открытием . Ведь обычно в шутерах тех лет , игрока сразу бросали в действо , без пояснения происходящему . Без каких-либо мирных/нейтральных персонажей - были только толпы врагов и вы :) \n\nНо сюжет не был бы хорош без подобающего окружения/уровней . А он тут есть и хорош . Все локации , будь то лабораториями , складами , обьектами на поверхности , смотрятся атмосферно и построены так , что у тебя не возникает вопросов к их дизайну и т.д . \n\nНе отстаёт и геймплей , который вполне стандартен . Впрочем , и тут он выделился на момент выхода - да , как и в любом шутере мы отстреливаем врагов ( с их разнообразием тут порядок + противники ведут себя по разному , что неплохо разнообразит их убиение ) , но тут это разбавлено простенькими загадками , стрельбой из турелей и т.д \nК слову , арсенал в игре вполне разнообразный и убивать им приятно . От обычных пистолетов , автомата с дробовиком и энергетического/органического оружия до ..монтировки ) \n\nТакже хочу отметить два адонна от Gearbox : \n\n1. Хороший Opposing Front , в котором события показаны от лица военного Адриана Шепарда . Геймплей за него гораздо больше акцентирован на экшене и это неплохо , ибо авторы не обделили нас арсеналом ( тут и 2 вида холодного оружия , и органическое оружие ( ручной барнакл - топ ) и аналог БФГ ) , новыми врагами и мелочами, типа ПНВ вместо фонарика , напарников-военных . \n2. Неплохой Blue Shift , где нам в лице Барни Калхауна предстоит спастись из Блек Мезы .

I started the series at Half-Life 2 so it was great to go back and play the original to learn more about the universe and where some of the characters came from. Thought it is good to note, the graphics are fairly dated by today's standard, but still looked good for the time and handles very well.\n\n[b] Story\t[/b]\nThe story of Half-Life follows Gordon Freeman as he fights his way through the Black Mesa facility after a failure within the facility. The story is told by characters you run into and through the environment as you travel through the game. There are a lot of little details, and if you have played Half-Life 2 prior, it's cool to see some of the characters, items and creatures along with where they came from. Though as a warning, you may be fighting more humans than you would expect.\n\n[b] Game Play [/b]\nThe game overall has very interesting environments, and a lot of the items within the game can be interacted with. The maps encourage exploring for items, ammo, or health so there are many different ways to approach situations. The game can still present quite a challenge because you require health items to heal, so there are times a quick save may get you killed. Just take your time, make many saves and you should be able to get through the game no problem. \n\nThe graphics at times can make it tricky to see how some of the jumps work, or the exact damage range of enemies. This is just due to how long ago the game was made and the technology available at the time. The game still handles incredibly smoothly and the shooting mechanics are very smooth.\n\n[b] Last Thoughts [/b]\nIf you have played Half-Life 2, I highly recommend a playthrough of the original Half-Life to see where the series got its roots. If you are new to the series, I recommend trying out Half-Life 2 first and see if you like the style of the game. The reason for this is due to the age of Half-Life at this point. It's still a fantastic game, but the older graphics may deter you if you aren't used to them. If you are a fan of old school shooters though, this is your game.","timestamp_created":1541305249,"timestamp_updated":1542241241,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45612155","author":{"steamid":"76561198337886956","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":379,"last_played":1657074935},"language":"english","review":"Best FPS ever!!!","timestamp_created":1541291180,"timestamp_updated":1541291180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45611324","author":{"steamid":"76561198868948166","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":803,"last_played":1592683121},"language":"english","review":"Half life is one of those games everyone should play at least once and its really recommended on hard difficulty as its an overall better experience to play Half life in. You need to be more tactic and always consider what weapons you use and when you need to. Half life honestly feels great to this day and I can't say much bad about Half life if you can look past the outdated graphics and only focus on the game you are not gonna be dissapointed some of the visuals and lighting effects look great so you can imagine how good this was back in 1998. \n\nHonestly if you haven't played Half life play it right now and check out the remake Black Mesa its gonna be worth it.","timestamp_created":1541286562,"timestamp_updated":1542956430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45598167","author":{"steamid":"76561198434395023","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":466,"last_played":1659366870},"language":"turkish","review":"Bok
