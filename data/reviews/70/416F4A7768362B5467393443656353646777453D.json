Aujourd'hui bien que dépassé sur le plan technique, il reste un \"must-have\" dans sa catégorie.\n\n[b]Graphismes :[/b] Adeptes du réalisme et de la 4K passez votre chemin. Il est indéniable qu'un jeu vieux de 18 ans déjàs ne vous offrira pas les mêmes performances graphiques qu'un tout nouveaux jeu ayant bénéficié des toutes dernière avancés technoilogiques. Votre oeil toutefois saura s'abituer à ces images, malgré tout colorées et d'un style particulié se mariant bien au rete du jeux. Un bon point est que la configuration la plus simple vous permettra de jouer sans soucis, alors pas d'excuses ! :)\n[h1]2/5[/h1]\n\n[b]Ambiance sonore :[/b] Les effets sonores, forts et brutaux, correspondent parfaitement à l'ambiance du jeux et vous rapellent constament dans quel monde hostile vous évoluez. Les voix sont travaillées de manière à paraitre très proche, ce qui renforce votre immersion (je recommande le port d'un casque). Chaque sons de ce jeu va vous agresser et vous rapeller d'être toujour en alerte quoi qu'il arrive. Seul bémol, et pas des moindre, tout ces effets sonnores ont bien vieillis et celas peut en gêner plus d'un.\n[h1]3/5[/h1]\n\n[b]Scénario :[/b] L'un des scénario les plus étrange que j'ai eu l'ocassion de suivre ! C'est justement ce qui fait qu'il est égallement l'un des meilleurs. Le jeu va faire naître en vous une multitudes d'interrogations, qui n'aurons d'ailleurs asser souvent même pas de réponses, laissant ainsi votre immagination faire le reste. Half Life va vous intriguer, vous faire réflechir et une fois plonger dans l'histoire, vous ne vous rendrez vite plus compte que le jeu auquel vous jouez date de 1998.\n[h1]4/5[/h1]\n\n[b]Jouabilité :[/b] Et voicis le gros point fort de ce jeu, ce qui le rend si appréciable ! Des commandes intuitives couplées à des hitbox parfaitement calibrées et laissent une grande liberté de mouvement au joueur. Vous n'aurez jamais autant aprécier vous déplacer à pied dans un jeu vidéo. En plus d'une gamme d'ennemis variée, vous aurez a faire face à de nombreux obstacles et mécaniques différentes vous obligeant à réfléchir et à vous servir de votre environement. De nombreux raccourcis sont égallement empruntables pour les plus téméraires d'entre vous !\n[h1]5/5[/h1]\n\n[b]En Bref[/b], achetez ce jeux et vous aurez le droit à l'un des \"basics\" des FPS.

Aside from his extraordinary job at an underground facility, and his Ph.D is some field of physics, he does not stand out among the many other scientists scattered around the fateful location of Black Mesa, except for of course, representing the player and their shenanigans further down the road.\n\nSoon or later, Black Mesa is in shambles. The deceptively clear assignment issued to Freeman ended in vain, and while the present problem is not the teleporter failing to perform its purpose, but rather it performing its job a little [i]too[/i] well for the good of Black Mesa. Aliens appear literally out of nowhere, and they make easy picking off the defenseless scientists that are in hiding or in panic.\n\nMeanwhile, Gordon decides to leave behind the teleporter and escape the facility. Only problem is, he cannot go back the way he came in, as the trams have shut down in a subsequent power surge. He will have to take the paths less taken, and bear arms against the many alien abominations that begin to make their claim against humanity. Later, the HECU marines join in, and they too are helpless against the alien army, and the man storming the place in an orange power suit.\n\nEarly on, the weapons on offer are humble, yet versatile. The crowbar guarantees a freedom in destroying boxes, glass doors, and anything that dares get in the way of Dr. Freeman. The pistol appears at the time when the threat extends to adversaries not suited for a head-on melee scruffle, and is decently accurate up until the end of the game.\n\nLater, Gordon's arsenal gets more varied to compete with the enemy. A shotgun makes paste out of zombies, and powerful enough to take on the HECU in close quarters. A SMG grants the element of \"spray and pray\", grenades give Freeman the edge in flanking corners, and some experimental weapons have been known to be laying around in the far ends of Black Mesa, ready for the taking. By the time Gordon snatches every available individual weapon, the aliens will already have their strongest warriors at their disposal, all bent on taking this one man down.\n\nThe game has a strong emphasis on overall map size. From the tram in Black Mesa, to the strange border-dimensions of Xen, Half-Life is one long power walk. Freeman storms though office hallways, disused missile silos, scorching deserts, and more in his seemingly linear mission to survive, and undo the apocalypse that he has helped set. He makes many friends on the way, but he will have to leave them all behind at the end, as he departs the world as he knows it to complete his final mission, or so he thinks.\n\nOverall, Half-Life is a solid title, despite its age. It excels in presenting a synergy of FPS action and horror, and one that was unmatched for ages until the definitive [i]Half-Life 2[/i] emerged to take center stage. Many have lamented for the third installment to finally arrive, but for now, we have all the Half-Life we will ever need until it does.","timestamp_created":1503784454,"timestamp_updated":1503784454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34513569","author":{"steamid":"76561198160002269","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":582,"last_played":1502932574},"language":"english","review":"Well, thanks for caring valve, thanks for the wait.\nThe long, pointless, wait.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncheck this game out though","timestamp_created":1503779129,"timestamp_updated":1511392556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540069699287414551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34513211","author":{"steamid":"76561198257954217","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1244,"last_played":1485023014},"language":"polish","review":"[h1] Half-Life... [/h1]\n\nHalf-Life, debiutancka produkcja amerykańskiego studia Valve Corporation. Główny gatunek to gra akcji, do tego dochodzi FPS (First Person Shooter) oraz jest przygodówką. Sama gierka ujrzała światło dzienne 19.11.1998r. oraz 2 lata później na PS2 (PlayStation2). W styczniu 2013r. Half Life doczekał się kompatybilności z Mac'iem OS i Linuxem.\n\nRozgrywka rozpoczyna się bardzo niewinnie, jako dr Gordon Freeman (doktor fizyki teoretycznej), przybywamy do  rządowego ośrodka  badawczego Black Mesa Research Facility. Wsiadamy do nowoczesnej ,,kolejki'' i przybywamy do centrali. Następnie dołączamy do eksperymentu, Gordon otrzymuje do analizy próbkę tajemniczej substancji. W czasie badań dochodzi to niebezpiecznego wypadku. Nagle po wkładaniu preparatu w promień dochodzi do niezwykłej eksplozji. Niespodziewanie otwiera się portal do Xen, wydostają z niego tajemnicze kreatury i obcy, siejący spustoszenie w Black Mesa. Do ośrodka zostali wysłali komandosi HECU oraz żołnierze, aby ZABIĆ wszystkich ocalałych!\n\nPrzemierzając pozostałości Black Mesa napotkamy na dużo zagadek i łamigówek. Sama produkcja należy do tych z wysokim poziomem trudności, może nie jest zbytnio skomplikowana, ale nowym graczom będzie sprawiać kłopoty.\nWiększość gry spędzamy na zwiedzaniu ośrodka, jednak przez jakiś czas będziemy przebywać w innym wymiarze Xen.\nPodczas podróży spotykamy ocalałych doktorów lub strażników, jest to jednak w miarę rzadki widok. Są neutralnie nastawieni do nas. Mogą chodzić z nami i pomagać w walce z przeciwnikami.\n\nSilnik gry to GoldSrc (GoldSource), całkiem przerobiony silnik pierwszego oraz drugiego Quake'a, dodano wiele nowych funkcji, np. renderowania obrazu dwóch trybach – OpenGL i Direct3D. Na potrzeby stworzenia programu został użyty język C++. Half-Life to nie jedyna świetna gra wyprodukowana na GoldSrc, inne to: Counter Strike, Team Fortress Classic, Day Of Defeat oraz inne świetne produkcje. Silnik ten został ostatecznie zastępniony nowszym Source'em\n\nDo pierwszego Half-Life'a zostały wydane trzy dodatki jako osobne gry. Dwa na PC i jeden na PS2\nHalf Life Opposing Force (PC, 1999r.), Half-Life Blue Shift (PC, 2001r.) oraz Half-Life Decay (PS2, 2001r.)\n(Dwie pierwsze gry zamierzam zrecenzować w najbliższym czasie)\n\nPojawiły się jeszcze Half-Life Source (2004r.) i Half-Life DeathMatch (2004r.)\n(Wszystkie te gry zamierzam zrecenzować w najbliższym czasie)\n\nGra doczekała się bardzo szybko wielu świetnych modyfikacji typu Counter Strike i Day Of Defeat. Oba te ,,mody'' doczekały się wsparcia ze strony Valve i dziś cieszą się dużą popularnością.\n\nTryb wieloosobowy nadal tętni życiem! MultiPlayer jest klasycznym deathmatch'em, wybieramy swoją drużynę i naszym zadaniem jest zabijanie przeciwników. Jedynym minusem jest fakt, że na serwerach mogą znajdywać się ,,cheaterzy'', którzy strasznie niszczą przyjemność z gry :'(\n\n[h1] Plusy + [/h1]\n+ Świetny klimat\n+ Soundtrack\n+ Fabuła\n+ Duża ilość broni\n+ Łom <3\n+ Imponująca ilość modyfikacji\n+ Dobre dodatki\n+ Grafika :D\n+ Niska cena\n+ Gra pójdzie nawet na każdym sprzęcie\n\n[h1] Minusy [/h1]\n- Brak polskiego spolszczenia :(\n- Cheaterzy w trybie wieloosobowym\n- Główny bohater nie odzywa się \n\n[b] CIEKAWOSTKI [/b]\n\n- Z początku Half-Life miał nosić nazwę Quiver\n- Valve tworząc grę inspirował się opowiadaniem Stephena Kinga pt. ,,Mgła''.\n- Half Life miał  być dostępny na konsoli Dreamcast, jednak twórcy ostatecznie nie wydali go.\n- Do 2008r. gra została sprzedana w 9.3 milionach kopii.\n\n[b] PODSUMOWANIE [/b]\n\nMimo że gra ma prawie 20 lat, wciąż cieszy się ogromną popularnością i jest naprawdę godną uwagi produkcją. Nie patrz na Half-Life'a pod względem grafiki, nadrabia świetną fabułą, klimatem oraz ogólną grywalnością.\n\nOcena końcowa 8.5/10\n\nPozdrawiam,\nLawliet","timestamp_created":1503777858,"timestamp_updated":1503778181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581749081611633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34513106","author":{"steamid":"76561198156738108","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":15,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15,"last_played":1503777435},"language":"english","review":"I dont understand why people like this game It´s shiit with shiit gameplay, lame graphics,lame story,unrealistic game i hope half life 3 will never be released.","timestamp_created":1503777526,"timestamp_updated":1503851193,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.298632115125656128","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34509765","author":{"steamid":"76561198363792590","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":3102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2709,"last_played":1648676630},"language":"brazilian","review":"vale apena","timestamp_created":1503767345,"timestamp_updated":1503767345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34508729","author":{"steamid":"76561197991540488","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":4538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2644,"last_played":1607545144},"language":"english","review":"this game is so bad lol the graphics suck and this game copied call of duty 0/10","timestamp_created":1503764560,"timestamp_updated":1503764560,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":"0.333759397268295288","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34508144","author":{"steamid":"76561198035085893","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":560,"last_played":1605817668},"language":"polish","review":"Nostalgiczna +9/10","timestamp_created":1503762829,"timestamp_updated":1503762829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34507674","author":{"steamid":"76561198359351114","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1527680391},"language":"turkish","review":"NİCE\n","timestamp_created":1503761626,"timestamp_updated":1503761626,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34503336","author":{"steamid":"76561198048515309","num_games_owned":540,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":244,"last_played":1590227670},"language":"koreana","review":"벌써 질려욧!!! 옛날 게임은 옛날 게임인 것 같다","timestamp_created":1503749467,"timestamp_updated":1503749467,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34502771","author":{"steamid":"76561198149525641","num_games_owned":497,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":65,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65,"last_played":1498576583},"language":"schinese","review":"不敢玩不敢玩【太怂了qwq","timestamp_created":1503747632,"timestamp_updated":1503747632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34502338","author":{"steamid":"76561197987756292","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":778,"last_played":1454434674},"language":"english","review":"I just bought the Rainbow Six Siege complete eddition on uplay (were boycotting ubi for years) because these days ubisoft somewhat less greedy and intitled than valve corportation!

Half-Life ise sadece Valve'i Valve yapan oyun değil, aynı zamanda günümüz birinci şahıs nişancı oyunlarının atalarından. Wolfenstein, Doom ve türevi oyunlar bir zamanlar bu türü dünyaya başarıyla duyurmuşlardı. Daha sonra Quake ve Half-Life, türünde ilk gerçek üç boyutlu grafikleri bizlere sundu. Kim bilebilirdi Half-Life'ın gelmiş geçmiş en iyi oyun serilerinden biri olarak anılacağını ve geniş bir hayran kitlesine sahip olacağını?\n\nHikaye aslında çok da karmaşık bir olay örgüsüne sahip değil. Eski Doom oyunlarını oynadıysanız boyutlar arası geçiş gibi pek çok hikaye ögesine aşina olmalısınız. Oyunda altyazı olmadığından hikayeyi takip etmek biraz da olsa yabancı dil gerektiriyor. Ara sahneler olmadığından bölümlerde karşılaştığınız karakterlerin diyaloglarını dinlemeniz gerekiyor. Aksi takdirde oyun boyunca neyi neden yaptığınızı anlamayabilirsiniz. Ancak hikaye oyunda çok da öne çıkan bir unsur değil, zaten ana konsept belli. Yaratıklar var, biz de onlara karşı savaşıyoruz.\n\nGrafikler bugün oynadığınızda göze batıyor olabilir. Normaldir, oyun 1998'de çıktı. Ama unutmayın ki zamanında Quake hariç bu tarz grafiklere sahip birinci şahıs nişancı oyunları çok azdı. Olanlar da bu iki oyun kadar tanınmadı. Zamanına göre değerlendirdiğimizde bu grafiklere devrimsel bile diyebiliriz.\n\nSeslendirme namına bir şeyler söylemek zor. Zaten her Valve oyununda ana karakterimizin sessiz kalması tabiri caizse farz oldu. Yine de bu Valve'in yaptığı en eski oyunlardan. Ona rağmen oyunda sesler ve müzikler genel anlamda başarılı. Kahrolası Headcrab'ler kulaklarınıza işkence çektirecek, haberiniz ola.\n\nOynanış konusunda pek bir şey söylemeye lüzum yok. Mekanikler taş gibi. Ancak bilgisayarda hedef alma yardımcısı normalde açık. İsterseniz kapatabilirsiniz. Ben şahsen oyunu bu yardımcıyı kapalı tutarak oynadım. Öncelikle oyun zor. Sağlık ve zırh her yerde bulunmuyor, kendinizi öyle kolay iyileştiremiyorsunuz. Öleyazdıysanız dahi oyunun umrunda değil, bir sonraki sağlık istasyonuna veyahut çantasına kadar ilerleyecek, gram canınızla önünüze gelene bir levye vuracak, bin tekme atacaksınız. Bölüm dizaynı olarak oyun döneminin çok ilerisinde. Çok uzun bölümlerde kestirme yollar açarak Black Mesa'daki maceranızı daha çekilebilir kılabilirsiniz. Yalnız havalandırma borularına dikkat edin. O borularda yaşayacağınız gerilimi çoğu korku oyununda bulamazsınız. Burası Black Mesa, nereden ne çıkacağı belli olmaz. Ayrıca oyun size ne yapacağınızı tam olarak söylemiyor, bulmacalarla ve vanalarla (Çünkü Valve.) uğraşmak zorunda kalıyorsunuz. Bu da zorluğu pekiştiren etmenlerden.\n\nOyunda çok oyunculu mod da bulunmakta. Bu moda pek bulaştığım söylenemez, ama günümüzde halen oynayan insanların olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Günümüz modlarına öncülük eden harita tasarımları ve rekabetçi modlar var. Bu modda ustalaşmak da cidden zaman alan bir iş, benden söylemesi.\n\nHalf-Life ile Valve'in oyun dünyasında bir çağ açıp bir çağ kapattığını görüyoruz. Aynısı Half-Life 2'de de yaşandı, bu da bize Valve'in bir zamanlar ne kadar efsane bir oyun geliştiricisi olduğu gerçeğini gösteriyor. Bu aralar Valve pek bu çapta oyunlar yapmıyor, doğrudur. Ama 1998'de çıkmış Half-Life'ı günümüzde Call of Duty ve türevleri olmasına rağmen oynuyorsak bu başarının bir tesadüf olduğundan söz edemeyiz. Aferin size. Artık belki de hiç gelmeyecek Half-Life 3 ya da Half-Life 2 Episode 3'ü bir on yıl daha bekleyebilir, bu esnada Half-Life ile Half-Life 2 ve bölümlerini oynayarak güzel günler görmeyi ümit edebiliriz. Bir düşünün, Gaben amcamız hiç olmadık bir yerden bomba duyuruyu yapıyor. Her ne kadar bu saatten sonra buna ihtimal vermesek de şimdilik acımızı bu seriyi tekrar tekrar bitirerek azaltıyoruz.\n\nNot: 9.5/10","timestamp_created":1503709209,"timestamp_updated":1503709209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34492865","author":{"steamid":"76561198304880726","num_games_owned":5206,"num_reviews":671,"playtime_forever":1184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1002,"last_played":1503706437},"language":"english","review":"An interesting experience for me.\n\nAlmost 20 years later after originally playing Half-Life on a family computer and not knowing what the hell I was doing, I've come back to actually play.\n\nI had never gotten past the first chapter back in the day, and now I can say I've beaten one of the first PC games I ever had the chance to play.\n\nAll this time later and the game still holds up.

Despite all this, I had never played Half-Life since I was mainly put off the by the monster/zombie beings in it, since monster games aren’t really my style of game. Recently though, I decided to finally wipe the virtual dust of a game that I’ve had in my steam collection for ages and see what all the fuss was about. Boy, was it worth it.\n\nHaving finished the first game in the series after 11 hours, I can confidently say that Half-Life definitely earns its mark in gaming history and I would recommend it to anyone – especially those who might also be put off by the monster beings in the HL universe or the outdated graphics. This game is an instant classic and thrives on something we don’t see too much of these days – great story and level design. This is a game that really makes you think and doesn’t hold your hand. Often, you’ll be standing in place scratching your head, pondering on how exactly you’re supposed to get to the next “level”. You’ll find that the answer will sometimes be something obvious that you might have overlooked and other times you’ll accidently stumble on it by exploring every corner of the map. \n\nHalf-Life also takes you out of your comfort zone by not having what most games these days have – auto health regeneration. Your health doesn’t magically regenerate after an intense fight. Rather, the game has strategically placed health and shield regeneration stations, which you use to fill up portions, not all, of your health bar. A clever and unique game design decision. \n\nThere’s many more positive things about this game, but I feel I’d just be repeating what has been said over the last 20 years, so I’ll move onto the negative. In the 11 hours I played, I only really encountered one major, semi-game breaking bug in which my character would get stuck between loading screens. This would force me to reload the last checkpoint or savepoint, so make sure you’re saving often! Apart from that, I can’t really think of any other negatives. \n\n[b]TL;DR[/b] – A great game, good level-design, good story, although one major bug. Overall, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED – go buy it!\n\n[b]Other Worthwhile Mentions[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Listen to the scientists and guards. That’s where most of the monologue and story development comes from!\n[*]I was surprised to see wide screen monitor support! Game looked good on my 3440x1440 screen and I was so relieved I didn’t have to play with those ugly black bars on the sides.\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1503578734,"timestamp_updated":1503579612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56081080436706543","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34457886","author":{"steamid":"76561198128381260","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":4515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":945,"last_played":1630282605},"language":"english","review":"6th playthrough:\nMe: *runs down stairs*\nScientist: *goes down faster*\nHECU marine: *shoots the everliving crap out of the scientist*\nScientist: *calmly walks back up the stairs through the trail of his blood and/or guts*\nScientist: I seem to be seriously wounded.\n\nThese dudes are hardcore AF","timestamp_created":1503574345,"timestamp_updated":1503574345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528346836566925049","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34456306","author":{"steamid":"76561198346136708","num_games_owned":655,"num_reviews":101,"playtime_forever":641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":613,"last_played":1602695812},"language":"russian","review":"Игра \"история\", все ждали вторую часть она вышла, все ждали третью часть, а получили уй.

Not attacking enemies in a situation can change how you approach the level later.\nIs it a perfect game? no in this modern day the mechanics don’t hold up.  Shooting at enemies can often be frustrating and the lack of diversity in characters.  The same band of scientist appear throughout the game.
