Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: Truth be told, I probably shouldn't even bother writing a review for this game. If you're here and you're reading this, then you most likely already have an opinion on the game. Nevertheless, I've been told quite often that just writing for writing's sakes isn't harmful; rather, the opposite. So here I am, talking about a remarkably popular series and giving my two cents amidst the stream of million dollar bills or something i dunno thought i'd try a metaphor\n\nLeft 4 Dead is a game about zombies. Many zombies. Specifically the 28 Days Later kind of zombies that can tear it through areas. There's also quite a few of them; roughly the amount you'd expect from a Serious Sam game or another game in its ilk. I love me some Serious Sam, so this is definitely a perk. I didn't have the fortune of playing with friends, and since I'd prefer not to potentially deal with the most cretin-like of online players, I kept to single player for all six campaigns. Your partners have pretty good AI, although they do seem to get a bit confused whenever you're making your escape. \n\nOne thing that I wasn't too much of a fan of as far as the gameplay feel - although I do recognize it as a function of the game's design - is that all of the campaigns feel pretty much the same. They all have a few sections of shooting many zombies followed by holding out for \"ten minutes\" while some sort of rescue arrives. I put ten minutes in quotes because there have been many a time where ten minutes most certainly had not passed, but rescue still arrives. Don't get me wrong, though; the stages are still quite good and often have multiple paths that you can take through the level to get to the end, but it can get a bit repetitive at times.\n\nOne of the things that this game does in order to keep things interesting is to have certain points throughout the level where a random \"special infected\" can spawn; there are five special infected that can show up, with each having their own unique strategy to dealing with them. This does keep the tension at a good level, although an unfortunate spawning of a tank can kinda take you back out of it. Nevertheless, these enemies don't feel cheap, as there's always some way of dealing with them.\n\nAgain, you probably already know this, but this is certainly a game that would be a lot of fun to play with friends. The option to play as the special infected in a certain mode of multiplayer is one that again I would have liked to try, but I didn't have enough friends that owned the game for Steam. Nevertheless, even as a single player experience, I still had a lot of fun with this game. 9/10.\n\nStory: Much like how the levels themselves are organized, the story for each individual campaign comes down to Enter Area (most commonly through breaking down of a vehicle) - Fight Zambies - Escape in New Vehicle to Soon Break Down. Obviously, the origin of the zombies and all that isn't of concern to the story. Then again, it doesn't need to be. The focus of the writing is more on the characters. It's always fun to listen in on each character's banter with the others (and about how Francis hates everything). One thing I wish they would have done for the sake of the story would be to do... something after the final campaign. It just seems weird that it just ends and puts you back at the main menu. Nevertheless, the banter is still  quite enjoyable. I still wish they had provided that closure, though. 7/10.\n\nGraphics: Given that this is a Valve-published game, one thing that you can expect is a very well optimized game that looks quite good. This game looks quite good, even if the graphics aren't artistically timeless. I really dug the art design of the special infected; specifically the Smoker portraying the \"long, shady\" look that smokers are stereotyped with. The environments look quite good, even if it is a bit hard to make out what you're looking at due to how dark it can be. Also, the technical things work just fine and as well optimized as one would expect from a Valve game. It's no surprise that it runs well on my relatively high-powered graphics card at 1080p Ultra settings, but admittedly it not running on those settings on my computer would be surprising. You don't need too much stronghth (yes, that was intentional) to run this game, and I'd imagine an integrated graphics chip could run this game. Even though it may not be the nicest thing to look at in ten or so years, it still looks and works perfectly fine today. 4/5.\n\nSound: Most of the music in this game is very ambient, but there are a couple of actual songs in there. The ambient pieces are very good at adding to what's going on; the ghostly wailing signaling the presence of a Witch adds the right amount of tension  to make you careful, the cacophonous wails of violins signal the onslaught of common infected, and it all works quite well. Each special infected makes their own sounds, and they're all quite distinctive and useful for identifying what special infected is just around the corner. The four survivor's voice actors do a quite good job at making the characters believable. All in all the audio portion of the game is quite well put together and adds just that much more to the game. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are 9/7/4/5; cumulative score of 8.3/10. This will hopefully not be the last time I end up playing this game, as again, this game needs to be played with friends. It's just made for it. It can be done single player, but it's just not the same.","timestamp_created":1403300600,"timestamp_updated":1403300600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10576419","author":{"steamid":"76561198007518579","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":194083,"playtime_last_two_weeks":509,"playtime_at_review":177957,"last_played":1660531855},"language":"english","review":"DO NOT play this game during/after any STEAM sale.
