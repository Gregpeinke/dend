It just happens to be terrible at actually telling it. The game falls victim to one great big gaping crevasse that paradoxically produces intense friction and massive separation between the gameplay and the story.\n\nEssentially, the writer said, \"Alright, so this girl is actually this! And this happened to her! And all this happened because he did this, which could have been prevented through this!\" There are connections between characters and events, but they are laid out clumsily, using a medium that they don't feel designed for. Bioshock Infinite is a story first, and a game second. The game does not support the story effectively; the story rarely justifies the game.\n\nThe gameplay isn't particularly good. All the enjoyable combat sections happen in the last hour of the game. Enemies are either low level grunts, or big mean bullet sponges. There are a lot of elements at play: the management of health, shields, salts, and ammo; the use of weapons; the use of Vigors; the use of \"tears\" for creating battlefield augments; Elizabeth's constant sharing of ammo and salts; upgrades for your equipment; and gear that gives you passive boosts. There are a lot of balls being juggled, but little balance in the quality of these tools or the necessity of these systems. Half the Vigors pale in comparison to the rest. You're constantly being supplied with ammo and salts between battles and even during, so managing these resources is moot. Your shield regenerates in just a few seconds, and so long as it remains your health isn't touched; there is therefore little reason to upgrade your health until your shield capacity is maxed. A certain Vigor upgrade makes many encounters as simple as right clicking in the general direction of several enemies to win the entire fight. Entire boss fights can be bypassed with traps in the right place. Some tears allow you to take health kits from another reality to heal yourself; a cool concept, but in practice I press a button to get health. The devs could have benefited from a creative writing course, where they might have been taught to kill their darlings and remove some systems that aren't engaging.\n\nThis gameplay falls short, but also fails to prop up the story. Many moments remind you that things are as they are because it's a game. Why do many set dressing NPCs simply shout and cringe when their partner is attacked and killed? Why is Elizabeth immune to damage when Booker's need to learn to care for and protect her kind of the point? Why did a religious zealot hand me the power of demonic possession? At the exact moment I need it to possess a nearby machine? Why are these powers produced en masse and sold? Why do vending machines also sell the ability to upgrade this power so I can possess humans who will literally kill themselves when this power is used? Why can I possess these vending machines to drop money but not their items? Why is there a sandwich in this mailbox? Why is there carbine ammo in that trash can? Why do locks that Elizabeth must unlock to progress the story use a hairpin, and other locks use anywhere from 1 to 5 lockpicks? The answer to all of these questions is simply because this is a game, not because there is any justification for them.\n\nAs far as the story goes, I do not doubt that the writer understand the basics of plot. I do however wonder if even writer Ken Levine has taken a creative writing course, where he would have learned to \"show, don't tell.\" Bioshock Infinite tells. It rarely shows. Optional collectibles literally tell players bits of information. Plot developments are discussed as the characters come to understand them, until the ending where there is a massive infodump of \"the whole point.\" I once wandered off and found tombstones with names I recognized. I took a moment to think of the implications of these characters' deaths. This was the most meaningful time the game ever used the level itself to tell me a story. However, as I returned to the main path and completed my task, I was routed to this exact place, where characters acknowledged the graves. It became a major plot point. They decided to tell. At another point, a character notes a physical deformity of theirs I had wondered about hours prior; the game acknowledges this question with another tell, despite already having several hours to show, then drops it all the way until the big end-game infodump where it tells all.\n\nI cannot stress enough that there's little to this story that hasn't been done better elsewhere. The dark religious themes are reminiscent of comic writer Jason Aaron's Southern Bastards, or his takes on Marvel's Thor. Quite recently, Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Half Life: Alyx have done interesting things with branching realities. That’s not to say that these themes and concepts aren’t interesting, or even done first by Bioshock Infinite, as it does predate most of the other media I’ve mentioned. Great writers steal, after all.\n\nBioshock Infinite also loves to talk about racism. It doesn’t have anything in particular to [i]say[/i] about racism (or at least nothing profound), but it does go so far as to acknowledge it exists and then drop it immediately, only to tell you an hour later it hasn’t forgotten, just before it does in fact forget. The game then turns Booker into an enemy of an overwhelmingly minority-driven resistance movement, but abandons any sort of coherent stance needed to challenge or wow the player in regards to the implications of this position. It does, however, explicitly claim that Comstock’s bourgeois is right for Fitzroy’s proletariat; they are two sides of the same coin, and both sides are bad. It's a lazy, spineless, even ignorant take.\n\nThe game’s first racial non-statement is made early in the game, before the combat even starts. Booker is given an opportunity to throw a baseball at an interracial couple or an announcer. Most players would probably choose to hit the man; Booker the character might be inclined to hit the couple, as an observant player might have learned by this point that Booker participated in mass Native American extermination at the Battle of Wounded Knee (another \"show\" that eventually becomes a \"tell\"). Nonetheless, your choice in this instance seemingly means nothing, as you are prevented from taking action. If you chose the “right” answer, you are rewarded hours later. \n\nThe game rewards the player for being the player (choosing the announcer), breaking not-yet-established character. It contrasts the specific lack of agency that players have in dozens, or even hundreds, of Booker’s words or actions. Booker chooses “tails” when asked to flip a coin; Booker chooses to accept the job of fetching Elizabeth; we have no say. Booker himself doesn’t always have agency (he certainly doesn’t choose to be shackled to a rocket and launched into heaven), but he often does. Despite Booker’s recurring feelings of guilt over the terrible things he’s done and rejection of baptism (metaphorical cleansing of one’s sins, an interesting ironic thread that the narrative does wield), we the player do not once feel guilty about gunning down waves of cops who are trying to kill us because they’ve decided we’re the antichrist. There are established canon events that are going to play out a specific way no matter what vigors you use, what tears you open, or what paths you take. In this absence of consequence, the game encourages you to act as Booker, except for the baseball scene or the numerous instances when it does nothing at all when you use violence against non-consequential set piece NPCs to either conform to or break free of this marriage.\n\nThat last statement is a great metaphor for the problem with this product: Bioshock Infinite intends to tell a story whether you like it or not, and the gameplay will either mutilate the immersion that story needs to succeed or detach itself from the narrative entirely.","timestamp_created":1590714704,"timestamp_updated":1590947907,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559548556804656982","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69968608","author":{"steamid":"76561197998431701","num_games_owned":343,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":3819,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2953,"last_played":1592744531},"language":"english","review":"Wish they didn't scrap the original version of this game","timestamp_created":1590713751,"timestamp_updated":1590713751,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69957345","author":{"steamid":"76561198112828861","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":945,"last_played":1631843804},"language":"english","review":"Amazing ending, and I am a wreck now","timestamp_created":1590694318,"timestamp_updated":1590694318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69951956","author":{"steamid":"76561198967743673","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":895,"last_played":1621365180},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun,Bana göre oyun değil...

muito bonitos inclusive para os dias de hoje, mesmo se tratando de um o jogo de 2013 e apesar de ser um jogo linear, os cenários são grandes e há bastante espaço pra exploração e segredos. \n\nBioshock Infinite é um jogo que certamente encanta e vale a pena jogá-lo.","timestamp_created":1590580804,"timestamp_updated":1610931282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48991355299949646","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69885839","author":{"steamid":"76561198157345928","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":3334,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3258,"last_played":1596075857},"language":"russian","review":"Шедевр","timestamp_created":1590579854,"timestamp_updated":1590579854,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69881109","author":{"steamid":"76561198867904920","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":488,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":488,"last_played":1585115390},"language":"english","review":"Dishonored

In this game, unlike the two last games, the suspenseful ambient and worn down aspect of the general game are replaced for a bright and lively city in the sky. It is easy to notice that this game is a really different concept right from the start, in this game (which acts as a prequel for the other two) the city is not destroyed right off the bat, but things do get grim in other ways. I will not explain anything more about this topic, as I would be giving up too much information and ruining your playthrough if you haven't already played the game.\n\n[h1]Setting and Graphics[/h1]\nFor a game released in 2013, the game looks stunning. I suspect that, even though the textures are visibly low resolution, the good use of visual effects like God Rays, Lens Flare, Bloom, and the color pallet are what give the game such a nice look. This also matches perfectly with the setting of the game, Columbia, a flying city ruled by a religious figure known as Father Comstock (Zachary Hale Comstock), and supposed to be a new Eden. Another thing that is worth noting is that the game looks really nice while also running smoothly (I have a R3 2200g and a RX 570, and the game would hit a stable 120 fps on Ultra).\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nHaving mentioned in the intro and the last section how the game turned from survival horror to a new bright look, it is also worth mentioning that the approach to combat and general aesthetics has changed too. This is no longer a survival horror experience, but rather an action game. Does this mean Bioshock has lost it's essence? No, they took everything that had already been done and enhanced it. The plasmids (which are now called vigours due to lore reasons) have been overhauled adding new uses like setting traps. The gunplay in this game feels way better than previous installments (something that was needed for the change of focus this saga had), being more consistent. There's also more enemy variety now, with new mini bosses like the Firemen or the Crows, that make the experience more dynamic. Something I noticed is that every singleplayer game has a section of it where you feel like \"Ugh, I hate this part\" and you really don't enjoy the whole thing, but in Bioshock Infinite that didn't happen at all, at least not in my case.\n\nNow, not everything is perfect here, I have a few complaints that are related mainly to how the controls work while you are playing. 1- The FOV is way too tight even when you set it to max (and yes, I know that this can be changed with mods or cheat engine but still). 2- Running limits your sensitivity for some reason. These two things together make the game feel clumsy, I mean, to have full control of your movement you have to start running and spin like crazy to check your surroundings.\n\n[h1]Storyline[/h1]\nFor what I've read and heard, this is kind of a sensible topic. Some people consider this game to be written like a masterpiece while others call it overrated. I personally believe that this game has a really good story, like seriously good level of good. This game's story is better told if you collect the voxophones and listen to them while you get through the game so when you get to the end, everything is clear or at least makes sense when paired with the ending of the game. But, this game is not one of those games that try to pull off some plothole mystery bullsh!t, but rather it has everything make sense at the end if you dig deep enough into the lore just with the information you collect inside of it (aka no conspiracy theory nonsense). Also this game is a prequel and doesn't really require you to play the previous games to understand what's going on.\n\n[h1]DLC's[/h1]\nThe Burial at Sea DLC's are seriously worth it, if you get them, play them after ending the game as they make for a good closing of it and only make sense when played after the main story. This DLC's add new Vigours and show a remastered Rapture before its fall and Jack's arrival in Bioshock 1. I won't say much about what this two are about because that could spoil the whole thing.\n\nClash in the Clouds is a wave survival gamemode featuring the enemies from the main storyline, so if you are into that stuff, do play this DLC's maps as well.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nShould you buy Bioshock Infinite? Sure, you won't regret it, also consider getting the DLC's. This game is a MUST play in my opinion. I personally got the entire Bioshock saga from the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/sub/127633/] Bioshock The Collection pack[/url], so  consider that as an option as well, as it is pretty cheap and gets you 3 nice games (just have in mind that the Bioshock games are the best rated singleplayer fps games of all time).","timestamp_created":1590534002,"timestamp_updated":1590557797,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69851946","author":{"steamid":"76561198158588049","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1244,"last_played":1593143652},"language":"spanish","review":"Epico","timestamp_created":1590518858,"timestamp_updated":1590518858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69849051","author":{"steamid":"76561198256400868","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":573,"last_played":1583701373},"language":"english","review":"All the dimension traveling sure gave me a headache.","timestamp_created":1590514888,"timestamp_updated":1612548853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69840639","author":{"steamid":"76561198029050345","num_games_owned":308,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1522,"last_played":1451036458},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite games.","timestamp_created":1590504099,"timestamp_updated":1590504099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69828536","author":{"steamid":"76561198368150860","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1124,"last_played":1588559767},"language":"schinese","review":"steampunk爱好者的圣经","timestamp_created":1590486611,"timestamp_updated":1590486611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69828325","author":{"steamid":"76561198299114318","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1030,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1030,"last_played":1590480385},"language":"schinese","review":"好游戏！（有一说一 大是真的大）","timestamp_created":1590486241,"timestamp_updated":1590486241,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69826755","author":{"steamid":"76561198015157618","num_games_owned":330,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":2043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1895,"last_played":1646732353},"language":"russian","review":"очень эмоционально, очень интересно и гейплейн разнообразный!","timestamp_created":1590483498,"timestamp_updated":1590483498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515488505363464355","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69826612","author":{"steamid":"76561198152454392","num_games_owned":378,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":2022,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":946,"last_played":1656308551},"language":"latam","review":"Historia 10/10\nGameplay 10/10","timestamp_created":1590483240,"timestamp_updated":1590483240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69826271","author":{"steamid":"76561198182796825","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":893,"last_played":1590482682},"language":"english","review":"do it","timestamp_created":1590482689,"timestamp_updated":1590482689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69825517","author":{"steamid":"76561198070905848","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":670,"last_played":1590485576},"language":"german","review":"Gute storry, packende Kämpfe und fetzige Fähigkeiten :D Rundum ein gelungenes Spiel!

Разработчики создали атмосферный, красивый мир и великолепную разворачивающуюся в нём историю. В этой игре атмосфера на высшем уровне. Атмосфера Америки начала века передана в BioShock Infinite ничуть не хуже, чем начало 1960-х в прошлых частях. Соответствует все: плакаты, архитектура, интерьеры, музыка, оформление элементов меню и даже дизайн игрушек в магазинах. В Infinite особую роль играет музыка (разумеется, чертовски красивая) — она сближает Элизабет с главным героем, помогает прочувствовать моменты духовного подъема Девитта. Когда звучит музыка, оба героя ведут себя немножечко иначе и все вокруг будто бы становится добрее. Геймплей тут очень разнообразный, ты можешь просто бегать стрелять, а можешь взять например силовой поток и поднять противника в воздух и начать по нему стрелять и после этого он улетит вниз (это действует почти на всех противников) ну и тд. В Infinite на каждом уровне ставится простая задача добежать до конца, но разработчики нередко разрешают вернуться назад, скажем, поискать секретные места. Ни взломов, ни аркадных элементов в игре нет. Даже головоломок сложнее «поверни рычаг» — и тех не завезли. Только чистый боевик. Иногда можно попробовать проскользнуть незамеченным — игра это допускает, но никак не поощряет. Сложно поверить, но все, что в других шутерах кажется недостатком, здесь превращается в достоинство. Например, ограничение на две пушки в Infinite не раздражает, а добавляет динамики. Закрытые помещения быстро сменяются обширными локациями — только что дробовик был твоим лучшим другом, а теперь ты вынужден петлять зайцем, чтобы подобраться к снайперской винтовке. Не раздражает и необходимость время от времени прятаться в укрытия, потому что здоровье само по себе не восстанавливается. Перевести дух можно, но рассиживаться за выступами рельефа особого смысла нет: как только энергетический щит подзарядится, нужно бежать дальше. За аптечкой, например. Кроме того, ограничение в оружии подталкивает к экспериментам со сверхспособностями. Персонажи очень хорошо проработаны в особенности  Букер и Элизабет. Кстати о Элизабет, она получилась не просто полезной — в ней чувствуется характер, чувствуется жизнь. Предположим, началась перестрелка. Элизабет чтобы не путаться под ногами, тут же ищет укрытие. А как только патроны, здоровье или соль начнут подходить к концу, она с готовностью подкинет необходимое. Не обошлось и без уникальных способностей — Элизабет может разрывать ткань пространственно-временного континуума, чтобы перемещать полезные предметы. Например, повесить лишний кран, за который можно зацепиться крюком, или камин с мощным ружьем в качестве украшения. В мирное время Элизабет занята исследованием окружающего пространства — для человека, долго просидевшего в заточении, это вполне естественно. Элизабет любопытна — она заглядывает в витрины магазинов, тщательно осматривает интерьеры домов и вообще ведет себя как самый настоящий, живой, подросток, радующийся свободной жизни. Ну а если напарнице посчастливится обнаружить что-то интересное, вроде набора отмычек, она обязательно скажет Девитту о находке. А если не понимаешь куда идти Элизабет может подсказать куда идти.\nОтдельная победа сценаристов — грандиозный финал. После непростой последней битвы, когда ожидаешь увидеть коротенький итоговый ролик с намеком на продолжение, разработчики выкладывают свой главный козырь — 20 минут таскают по разным местам и, подобно Морфеусу из «Матрицы», прямым текстом сообщают все, на что раньше лишь намекали. Когда на экране начинают мелькать титры, я остался сидеть с трещащей головой и вывихнутой от удивления челюстью. Концовка срежиссирована очень здорово. Дойдя до финала я не хотел что бы игра заканчивалась на этом, ведь она не должна была закончится так, но к сожалению это была финальная точка в истории этой игры. \n10/10","timestamp_created":1590347323,"timestamp_updated":1590358083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69733853","author":{"steamid":"76561198055908316","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1570604630},"language":"koreana","review":"평가가 엄청나게 좋은 게임이죠. 글쎄요, 저는 별로였어요. 바이오쇼크를 이 작품으로 입문했습니다만, 이도저도 아닌 어정쩡함에 괜히 화가 나네요. 차라리 원작 바이오쇼크를 먼저 접했다면 괜찮았을거예요.\n\n우선 이 게임은 기존의 모든 무기를 다 들고 다니는 방식을 버리고 요즘 유행하는 무기 2개 체제를 선택했어요. 하지만 말이 이렇지 실상은 선택만 제때 못할 뿐이지 무기를 전부 동시에 들고다니는 것과 차이가 없어요. 무기를 업그레이드 할 수 있고, 내가 지금 그 무기를 들고있지 않아도 탄약은 잔뜩 주워놓습니다. 그래서 탄약이 다 떨어져서 기관단총을 버렸는데, 잠시후 적에게서 기관단총을 주워보니 탄약이 꽉 차있거나 그런 경우가 종종 있어요. 뭐 이것도 이것 나름의 재미가 있을 수 있겠지만.....글쎄요, 저는 그냥 서로 맞지 않는 시스템 둘이 불협화음을 내는 느낌밖에 안들었어요.\n\n플라스미드....아니, 활력이 있는데요. 이게 바이오쇼크의 묘미겠죠? 하지만 저는 활력을 제대로 활용해보지 못했어요. 맵을 이잡듯이 뒤져 돈을 모아도 활력을 업그레이드할 비용이 모자랐고, 업그레이드 되지 않은 활력을 그다지 쓸만하지 않아요. 그냥 총만 쏴도 얼추 다 해결되다보니 활력에 집착할 필요도 없고요\n\n스토리를 극찬하시던데....글쎄요, 제가 엉망진창인 자막으로 플레이해서 그런건지, 스토리가 잘 이해되지 않았어요. 갑자기 쟤는 왜 잡으러 가는거지? 갑자기 얘는 왜 화났지? 이 게임을 하기전에 어느정도 스토리를 알고서 시작했는데도 이모양이예요. 어쩌면 제가 레코드를 빠듯하게 줍지 않아서 그런걸지도 모르죠. \n\n글쎄요. 물론 사람들은 이게 명작이라고 하던데, 저는 별로였어요. 바이오쇼크 이전작을 플레이한 뒤에 그게 마음에 들면 해보는게 좋지 않을까요?","timestamp_created":1590337233,"timestamp_updated":1590337233,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69729258","author":{"steamid":"76561198053298404","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":484,"last_played":1590331477},"language":"french","review":"excellente fin","timestamp_created":1590331500,"timestamp_updated":1590331500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69726789","author":{"steamid":"76561198048775743","num_games_owned":371,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1172,"last_played":1590328243},"language":"english","review":"One of the best shooters out there, even better on PC as my second playthrough of the game, my first being back in 2013 when the game came out.","timestamp_created":1590328302,"timestamp_updated":1590328302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526216030120849609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69726286","author":{"steamid":"76561198106814722","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1020,"last_played":1590327650},"language":"spanish","review":"Cambiaron un poco el estilo en comparacion los anteriores juegos pero igual es entretenido","timestamp_created":1590327725,"timestamp_updated":1590327725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69720966","author":{"steamid":"76561198368919916","num_games_owned":1132,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":895,"last_played":1590320294},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情真的好，不知和前面的大老哥有何关系，以及伊丽莎白咋变成那样的","timestamp_created":1590320498,"timestamp_updated":1590320498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69720486","author":{"steamid":"76561198814685156","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1713,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1168,"last_played":1618672210},"language":"schinese","review":"梦幻的乌托邦.第九艺术之名当之无愧.生死界限的模糊 平行世界的交叉 在我见识了那么多优秀作品以后 无限的剧情仍有一席之地 剧情深度让我印象深刻 违和的话要出现了 天道有轮回，苍天饶过谁 万般皆是命，半点不由人","timestamp_created":1590319797,"timestamp_updated":1590319797,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570146441459655762","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69706222","author":{"steamid":"76561198331934376","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1059,"last_played":1589699797},"language":"english","review":"timeless. some mechanics may seem clunky at first but could adapt soon enough.
