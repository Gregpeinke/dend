I should have played it when it came out, but better late than never!  The ending song was stuck in my head for days after I finished it.  \n\nIt combines two of my favorite genres - puzzles and FPS - in a wonderful way.  Instead of shooting bullets, you use your gun to create portals that you must use in creative ways to traverse to the next level.  There are a few secrets, too, that can net you some achievments, and one of them makes the game more challenging since you have to find an object and bring it to a specific location before completing the level. \n\nThe best part about the game, however,  is GLaDOS, who is by far one of the best video game characters ever made. Considering that you mostly hear her voice, that's pretty impressive.  She has more of a personality and background in the sequel but I like the first one a little better since you aren't aware of what she's really like at first. \n\nLike Half-Life 2, the game tells its story during the action instead of using cutscenes, which gives it more subtlety.  I'm not against cutscenes unless they are too long, but they do tend to make the game less immersive.  \n\nI can't really say anything bad about this game, but if it weren't so short (it was originally part of The Orange Box package, so that's understandable) it would have been my #1 game on Steam.  I like System Shock 2 a little more, so I guess that means I have a thing for evil A.I.s.","timestamp_created":1380676992,"timestamp_updated":1446713139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528301894664764404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6463382","author":{"steamid":"76561198066884256","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":417,"last_played":1372871946},"language":"russian","review":"Маленькое чудо, ставшее предвестником большого восторга.","timestamp_created":1380633677,"timestamp_updated":1380633677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568965613842010498","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"342022","author":{"steamid":"76561197969143381","num_games_owned":312,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":434,"last_played":1424306583},"language":"english","review":"When this game finished, so did my capacity for love.","timestamp_created":1380589627,"timestamp_updated":1380589627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533634781837463379","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5995632","author":{"steamid":"76561198056863768","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":525,"last_played":1395470708},"language":"english","review":"decent meme\n\ni rate 8/8 m8","timestamp_created":1380581549,"timestamp_updated":1443515830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6560827","author":{"steamid":"76561198069062845","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1374588809},"language":"english","review":"A bit creepy but kinda good","timestamp_created":1380548404,"timestamp_updated":1380548404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3878606","author":{"steamid":"76561198028472373","num_games_owned":316,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1291,"last_played":1619355517},"language":"english","review":"Fantastico","timestamp_created":1380458918,"timestamp_updated":1380458918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1737890","author":{"steamid":"76561197997207454","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":8243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7872,"last_played":1599080619},"language":"english","review":"The begining of an amazing game.","timestamp_created":1380346607,"timestamp_updated":1380346607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1566918","author":{"steamid":"76561197994844194","num_games_owned":1312,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":287,"last_played":1590089796},"language":"english","review":"[B][U]The Good[/U][/B]\nPretty much everything.\n\nFor serious.  The music is catchy as hell, and I found myself singing \"Still Alive\" . . . well, actually, I'm not certain I've ever stopped.  The setting is a wonderful mixture of sterile and creepy before breaking apart and becoming grungy industrial and creepy, which works very well.  The story, while fairly basic, is handled expertly through the amazing characterization of GLaDOS.  The puzzles are amazingly fun to figure out as they tend to involve flinging stuff (including yourself) here and there and everywhere else.  And even if there weren't puzzles to figure out, the portal gun itself is insanely fun to fiddle around with.  You could spend hours in the game doing nothing but trying out all the cool stuff you can do with it.\n\n[B][U]The Bad[/U][/B]\nUm.  Hmm.  I would say it's too short, but honestly I felt I got more out of three hours of gameplay from Portal than I've gotten out of a lot longer times spent on some other games.  And there's always more Portal to be had in the form of Portal 2.\n\nAbout the only downside I can really think of has nothing to do with the game, in fact.  It's really just that so much of it had been spoiled for me before I ever even got to play it.  For at least a few weeks after it came out, it seemed like it was the only thing anyone was talking about.  But even then, when those moments that had been spoiled popped up while I was playing, they not only didn't feel any worse off for my having known about them beforehand, they simply shone all the more for now having all the proper context to enjoy them in.\n\n[B][U]Overall[/U][/B]\nNot the best game I've ever played ever, but by gum, it's way up there.","timestamp_created":1380345984,"timestamp_updated":1389390303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514767944812774658","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6954244","author":{"steamid":"76561198080470252","num_games_owned":249,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1463238423},"language":"english","review":"best game EVER!
