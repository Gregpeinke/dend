When a game features selectable classes, a ranking system, DLC and buying weapons, most people think they have the gameplay all figured out - and they are completely wrong.\n\nUnlike most class-based shooters, Killing Floor does not offer unique weapons for each class (called \"Perks\"). Instead, each perk offers an advantage with certain weapon types and certain overall abilities (such as accuracy/reload speed bonuses, headshot damage multipliers, speed boosts etc.), while allowing every perk to use every weapon and item in the game (for the correct price, of course). This affects the game in many ways. Firstly, players are able to make hybrid loadouts, and new perk/weapon combinations which were originally not intended but are very effective can be used. For example, the Lever Action Rifle is a sharpshooter perk weapon, however this weapon is great in the hands of a medic because of his speed bonus while moving. By not enforcing specific player models on a perk by perk basis, the game manages to allow player customisability and yet allow easy perk identification through icons above players heads and in the scoreboard.\n\nThe game is also quite punishing, although it seems completely fair when a player dies. If you don't plan ahead with the rest of the team, you are likely to lose, especially on the harder difficulties. It is even possible to die on the first wave (which is usually a free money easymode wave) by allowing yourself to be surrounded.\n\nThe enemies are also very well thought out. Each enemy type has its own unique ability, such as the clots ability to grab and hold a player (preventing them from moving), which makes them extremely deadly in large groups or when up close.\n\nKilling Floor also features an amazing ranking system, which manages to avoid many of the problems inherent in traditional ranking systems. Each perk is ranked up individually, which means the player will never achieve a new rank only to unlock a higher level for a perk they never use. It also gives every player, from the day 1 noob to the hardcore veteran, access to all of the game content immediately. Instead of unlocking new weapons or abilities, ranking up simply makes the perks more effective, which keeps the game balanced, and doesn't enforce an artificial divide between skilled players and newer players based on unlocks\n\nAnd now, the mandatory L4D comparison paragraph. The game has some similarities to L4D cause creators were inspired by Left 4 Dead, but is definitely a different game. Many reviewers compare the 2, which is impossible because of their differing natures. While L4D is about completing goals and making it to the end of the map, Killing Floor is all about surviving, planning ahead, getting a good class balance within the squad, and making sure everyone has access to the limited resources available.\n\nTo make a great game truly legendary, Tripwire have been constantly updating Killing Floor and releasing free content and weapon packs, including community maps, and have a system in place to whitelist custom maps and mutators (small server-side mods) to allow people to use and level up their perks.\n\nIf you're a skilled player you can survive on your own in most situations, instead of getting pinned down by a hunter/smoker the second your other team mates die. Just buy it and play it for a few days and judge for yourself.","timestamp_created":1348689463,"timestamp_updated":1574879179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3999777","author":{"steamid":"76561198030486835","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":12351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11216,"last_played":1431893950},"language":"english","review":"РААААШ","timestamp_created":1348657083,"timestamp_updated":1348657083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4931572","author":{"steamid":"76561198043456357","num_games_owned":1045,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":542,"last_played":1585447160},"language":"english","review":"its a good game to play","timestamp_created":1348652698,"timestamp_updated":1348652698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5391886","author":{"steamid":"76561198049015087","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2798,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":532,"last_played":1594110258},"language":"english","review":"it cool its a co-op horror game it cool buy it and play it and tell me what you think","timestamp_created":1348621451,"timestamp_updated":1348621451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4478451","author":{"steamid":"76561198037799231","num_games_owned":638,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5060,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3029,"last_played":1422151821},"language":"english","review":"Intense multiplayer, similar to a combination of CoD zombies and L4D, but fine for singleplayer with progressive difficulty based on player count, customizeable gameplay with sandbox mode and dozens of weapons.

When you learn how to play after a few games, it becomes some of the most fun zombie-killing moments you will have on your PC. There are a stunning amount of guns to buy and choose from in-game. Each one is different and varies in utility. There are 7 classes to choose from, each is better with a different kind of weapon, and you can lvl each class up to 6.\n\nThis game is the most fun to play on servers with your friends. I would reccommend starting out on West  London and make your way into Biotics Lab, Mansion, and then other levels at your discretion. =) Make sure you are using the right weapons for your class to ensure the most damage against the enemy. You're gonna get hounded from the minute you enter the game....so either keep moving and stick together, or find a place to hole up with your friends and stick out the storm. If you try and play alone early on, you're going to lose. It's difficult, but it's the kind of difficulty that makes you want to keep playing and get better.\n\nMy advice is once you've played enough, find a server with some fun mods that will switch up your gameplay experience. Modders make the Killing Floor community what it still is today! There is a WIDE variety of downloadables from the Steam Workshop, so be sure to check them out! =)\n\nI personally reccommend the \"Guardian Knight\" modded servers. Keep a good lookout for them. They boast a LARGE amount of Perk mods (Terminator, Sentry, Swordmaster, Sniper, Stormtrooper, Mage, Juggernaut, Doom/Quake Marine, just to name a few) ...and you'll end up fighting some of the worst nightmares you've ever fought in an FPS. The modded-out zeds are thirsty for your blood and they're GOING to get you. Get good and get them back. ;D\n\nAll in all, this game is a ton of fun, and it will keep you coming back to kill zombies for hours upon hours....take it from me, I've played the game for 4 years now and have about 1000 hours put into this monstrosity.
