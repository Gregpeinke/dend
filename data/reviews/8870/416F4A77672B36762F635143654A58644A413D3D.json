Sometimes film directors achieve similar effect – we may happen to unaware of the barrier, – blue screen, that separates us and heroes of the film we watch. That’s the first time in my game life (that’s the majority of my common life) I sensed same feelings towards the video game.\nI thought that all the DLC produced by guys of Irrational games – is just an attempt to suck out a few more bucks out of my pocket. I was wrong.\nI thought that all the shooters ever produced are games, where role-play and plot are just flat decorations behind gameplay and action that make shooters to be loved for. I was wrong.\nI was also wrong assuming that industry dried out, ran out of itself – it was flooded by bigwigs – “parasites”, that are unaware of everything but profit; that in the world of world-wide conflicts, intense globalization and life-digitalization there is no place for something fresh, unique, original, describing another realty, realty so close to us and at the same time – so distant, separated apart from us with thousands meters of water column or kilometers of air space. All of that are mistakes and delusion, that I have to admit. And now I’m aware of the following: The Bioshock Trilogy, as well as Bioshock: Infinity with both of its plot DLCs is a multivolume masterpiece, worthy of its honorable place in my library of best films, best books and best computer games.\n\nRuss. Translation:\nЧастенько мы вживаемся в персонажей книг. Иногда режиссерам и сценаристам удается добиться подобного эффекта – мы не разумеем барьера – голубого экрана, что разделяет нас и героев обворожительного фильма. Впервые в моей игровой жизни (которая составляет бОльшую часть моей жизни в целом) я ощутил такие же чувства, играя в компьютерную игру.\nЯ думал, что все те DLC, которые создавались ребятами из Irrational games – попытка высосать чуть больше денег сверх того, что мы готовы заплатить. Я ошибался.\nЯ думал, шутеры от первого лица – это игры, где ролевая составляющая, сюжетная составляющая – лишь плоские декорации геймплею и экшену, за которые мы шутеры-то и любим. Я ошибался.\nВсё также я ошибался, полагая, что индустрия игр высохла, изжила себя – в неё ворвались воротилы – \"паразиты\", что не чают ничего, кроме прибыли; что в мире международных междоусобиц, стремительной глобализации и дигитализации нашего мира нет место чему-то самобытному, оригинальному, описывающему иной мир, столь нам близкий, но столь же и чуждый – разграниченный тысячами метров толщи морской воды или же километрами воздушного пространства. Все это ошибки и заблуждения, которые я признал, и от которых я избавился. И в одном я уверен – Трилогия Bioshock – в том числе и Bioshock: Infinity со всеми её сюжетными дополнениями – это шедевральный многотомник, заслуживший почетное место в моей библиотеке лучших фильмов, лучших книг и лучших компьютерных игр.","timestamp_created":1395838571,"timestamp_updated":1395838571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9633619","author":{"steamid":"76561198048890598","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1820,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1501,"last_played":1506526819},"language":"english","review":"worth","timestamp_created":1395838059,"timestamp_updated":1395838059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9633540","author":{"steamid":"76561197997934018","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":480,"last_played":1431022439},"language":"english","review":"Elizabeth/10","timestamp_created":1395837345,"timestamp_updated":1395837345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9633498","author":{"steamid":"76561198025861226","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1525,"last_played":1396978193},"language":"german","review":"geiles spiel, ich habs genossen, obwohl es linear verläuft.","timestamp_created":1395837073,"timestamp_updated":1395837073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9633480","author":{"steamid":"76561198121343131","num_games_owned":910,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":7492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2681,"last_played":1480080476},"language":"russian","review":"Совершенная игра, новое слово, составленное из знакомых букв.

That's being said, if you have only played through once or twice or thrice, you will see it as a great story. But for lads like me? It always feels like the Alternative Universe theory is a convenient way to \"plug\" a plot hole. Sure, you may said the story itself is built upon this theory, but it still don't get pass me. You see, the most fascinating thing about BioShock's story is about the interation between humans without the constriction of dignity and ethics, Infinite totally killed the whole idea for me. Perhaps, it's a good story, but not a good BioShock story.\n\nI have been waiting for the release Burial at Sea Episode 2 to clean up the mess.\nIndeed, BaS EP2 is great, to the point it is even more polished that the original BioShock. But talk among ourselves, what does that means if it takes a DLC to make it a good game?\n\nBioShock Infinite will never beat BioShock and BioShock 2 in my heart, not even with those TF2 items they have been throwing at me.

Yeah, you got skyhooks and things around you, which are very handy, but the amount of enemies I had to face was annoying and at times, boring. You also can only have 2 weapons at a time.

So why is this game so good? \n\nThis game really shines, and is utterly unbeaten, with its engaging storyline. What a story, I never thought a game could engage me and make me care about the characters like this. I kept pushing on the average shooter because of this story. Also, there is a lot of freedom for the play, or as it seems. The graphics is more than good and the city is really awesome to, which you get to explore bits and pieces of the downtown dark alley ways to the wealth and good looking streets, parks, houses and more. \n\nSo overall, this game is a masterpiece in its own right, and has defiantly set a new started in terms of storytelling games.
