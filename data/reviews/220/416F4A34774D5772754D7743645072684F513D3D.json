Also the puzzles in Half-Life 2 are kinda underwhelming, there are less then the original, and are easy to solve.

[/b][/u]\n\nHalf-Life 2 follows the story of Gordon Freeman after the catastrophic events that took place in Half-Life.

The one thing I would really have wanted more out of the game at times was a compass or some map marker, but it didn't need it. IT DID NOT NEED IT. Half the fun in this game is going one direction and finding out what lies in store. Is it some ammo? The actual path? Multitudes of things wanting to eat your pretty face? I don't know, and neither do you. \n\n","timestamp_created":1427871344,"timestamp_updated":1427871344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15150488","author":{"steamid":"76561198110585522","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1033,"last_played":1457766215},"language":"english","review":"OMG that was the best game ive ever played i played destiny and it dissapponited meh and then i go play a game form 2004 2 years after i was born and it leaves my jaw gaping on the floor that tell u somthing on how the worls changed in the vidoe game buisnees and i know i cant spell","timestamp_created":1427863150,"timestamp_updated":1427863150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15150189","author":{"steamid":"76561198112290715","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":2599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":587,"last_played":1643850257},"language":"english","review":"gun game ft barcow and magnettite gun","timestamp_created":1427860480,"timestamp_updated":1518820281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493819624185562134","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15149400","author":{"steamid":"76561198173156990","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1385,"last_played":1521313043},"language":"english","review":"yes a must have","timestamp_created":1427854281,"timestamp_updated":1427854281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54703831672668457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15148954","author":{"steamid":"76561198095515091","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":2006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1699,"last_played":1425095465},"language":"english","review":"I recommend this as an essential game in any gamers library.","timestamp_created":1427851181,"timestamp_updated":1427851181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15148773","author":{"steamid":"76561198131929494","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1016,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":250,"last_played":1561091056},"language":"english","review":"best game of 19993.","timestamp_created":1427849883,"timestamp_updated":1427849883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15148436","author":{"steamid":"76561198049686941","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1793,"last_played":1627008636},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 2, in my opinion, is the greatest PC game of all-time.  Every single aspect of this game is amazing, and Valve's efforts in crafting it still stand the test of time 10 years later.  I've never played a game with this much atmosphere, amount of amazing characters, well-engineered gameplay, and amount of unique levels that I will never forget.  Some of the scenes in this game blow me away with their simplistic yet beautiful accents (Highway 17 comes to mind).  And even if HL2 looks a little dated, the community's new update flawlessly remasters the graphics (without changing the looks of things that matter 'characters, structures, etc.').  So get the update, and play through one of Steam's best titles.","timestamp_created":1427847732,"timestamp_updated":1427847732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15148302","author":{"steamid":"76561198014446223","num_games_owned":1288,"num_reviews":298,"playtime_forever":885,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":875,"last_played":1408207365},"language":"english","review":"Perhaps one of the best FPS games ever released.
