Let us begin!\n\nFor my Half Life 2: Episode 1  review click this link:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronMinotaur/recommended/380\n\n\nEpisode 2 made a lot of changes that the previous episode didn't have. For instance, like in my Episode 1 review. I mentioned how everything was crammed in and not a whole lot of \"spacing\" out was put in between genres. For more explanation check the comment section of this review. Anyways in Episode 2 the \"rush feeling\" that was in Episode 1 is thankfully NOT in episode 2. It gives you time with Alyx and really experience what is (for now) the final Half Life game. You get to feel that semi-open world that you witness in Half Life 2 (The main game).\n\nAnd just like in Episode 1. Plot questions have been further explored in this episode. And like what I mentioned in Episode 1. Once again, you won't be given a full explanation until Half Life 3. Sure you got the basic idea of what Half Life 3 is going to be about but realistically not a whole lot of things were answered. \n\nIt's still a great game to play. Like all Half Life games.

Второй эпизод вышел несколько длиннее первого: в нём 7 глав (уровней), рассчитанных приблизительно на 8 часов игры. Действие игры развивается сразу после Episode One, в лесной местности близ уничтоженного Сити 17. По сюжету Гордон Фримен и Аликс Вэнс должны добраться до Белой Рощи — базы Сопротивления и передать повстанцам захваченные в первом эпизоде секретные данные Альянса.\nПеред выходом Episode Two стал доступен для предварительной загрузки через Steam шестью днями раньше, 4 октября.\n\nГлавная особенность второго эпизода — большие открытые пространства; лесная местность даёт игроку свободно путешествовать на новом автомобиле, а геймплей становится менее линейным: согласно задумке, с разнообразной тактикой ведения боя каждая битва будет непохожа на предыдущую. Кроме лесных территорий, игрок пройдёт заброшенные шахты, гнездо муравьиных львов и ракетную базу — все эти локации так же будут отличаться своей масштабностью.\n\nВо втором эпизоде нет такого сосредоточения на кооперативной игре, как в первом: хотя сюжетно игрок проходит всю игру вместе со своей напарницей Аликс Вэнс, во многих игровых событиях она по тем или иным причинам не принимает участия. Кроме Аликс, игроку предстоит сражаться бок о бок с дружественными вортигонтами.\n\nВ Episode Two был немного изменён инвентарь игрока: фонарик теперь работает на независимой от HEV-костюма Фримена батарее. Разработчики расширили круг использования гравипушки: помимо применения её вместе с бомбами для страйдеров, было добавлено множество новых объектов, которые можно запускать во врага.\n\nЕсли вы начали играть в серию игр, Half-Life, то вы определённо должны дойти до конца!","timestamp_created":1473768656,"timestamp_updated":1473768656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523467600345611572","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25491806","author":{"steamid":"76561198117061413","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":506,"last_played":1475265599},"language":"russian","review":"УЛЕЕЕЕЕТТТТТТТТ, жаль что последний эпизод","timestamp_created":1473762362,"timestamp_updated":1473762362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqaDFkdcCfpWfYQ=="}
