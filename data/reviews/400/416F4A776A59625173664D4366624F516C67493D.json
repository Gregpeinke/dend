В игре все ЖЕНСКИЕ персонажи представлены положительными геройшами, в то время как МУЖСКИЕ - плохими!\n\nГлавная героиня Челл ЖЕНСКОГО пола, она обладает смекалкой и проворством, и несмотря на голодную диету сумела сохранить хорошу физическую форму. Также вопреки заранее заполненному МУЖЧИНАМИ бланку про неё с клеймом \"ужасный человек\" она проявляла себя только с лучшей стороны. Именно этих МУЖЧИН навешивающих ярлыки можно наблюдать за стёклами испытательных комплексов в 1й части.\n\nСамый большой РАЗДОЛБАЙ Уитли представлен МУЖСКИМ полом. Он также был назван \"маленьким глупышом\", и он НЕНАВИДИТ ЛЮДЕЙ.\nНапротив ЖЕНЩИНА ГЛэДОС изображена ценной научной сотрудницей, полностью отдающая себя науке.\n\nВсе НЕИСПРАВНЫЕ и изуродованные турели имеют МУЖСКОЙ голос.

А еще есть плакаты призывающие заменять работников МУЖСКОГО пола на роботов.\nНапротив все работающие турели, как поющие так и стреляющие - имеют ЖЕНСКИЙ облик. Также стоит отметить право женского самоопределения, когда игра предоставляет возможность помочь миролюбивой турели ЖЕНСКОГО пола.\n\nСамый главный ЗЛОДЕЙ Кейв Джонсон также МУЖСКОГО пола! Он постоянно врёт, и обещая испытуемым по $60 отправляет обездоленных людей на верную смерть самыми изощрёнными путями, а до 1970 года было принято свыше 450 испытуемых! Также он нарушил закон федерации о трудоустройстве инвалидов. Еще он УКРАЛ у Чёрной Мезы корабль и присвоил все заслуги исследования порталов себе. В одной из записей он предложил с помощью ракетного двигателя снизить количество воды в МУЖСКОМ организме с 60% до 30%!\n\nСМЕРТЕЛЬНЫЙ нейротоксин имеет МУЖСКОЙ род!\nНапротив ПОЛЕЗНАЯ штука кубша-компаньйонша имеет розовый окрас и изображение сердца, что также указывает на ей ЖЕНСКИЙ пол.\n\nДолой матриархат!
