piece of art does cost some money, but i can assure you: this is definitely worth the cost. i won't spoil any of the story (and you can be sure that the story is very immersive), but i will explain the basic core gameplay.\nThe game is a non-euclidean physics game. which, in simpler words means: in a euclidean world the shortest way to travel between point A and B is a strait line, like in 2D worlds and in the real world (sometimes), ans a non-euclidean world defies that. which means... you can travel, for example: from one end of your room the fastest by walking right instead of straight. the way this game implements it is portals (as the name suggests). the portals connect the 2 locations they are placed in, and makes a window which you can see through and watch what your camera would see if it was in that location. is you want to understand how the portals work then read the rest, if else than start downloading now instead of later! \n\n\n\na portal is nothing but a class which contain several variables: position, orientation, color,  the other camera data*, player position data (I think it is stored there) and some other optimization stuff. the position is used to determine collisions, and rendering. the orientation is used to render and to help make the collisions more precise.\n\n*both portals have cameras storing the live visuals of the visible portion of the portal output (using the player position data they received from the other portal they can determine the visibility) which they send to the other portal to project, which makes an illusion of a window that opens to a spot that isn't behind the wall, a portal. but that's just the projection, right now with these processes you can only look through it and not walk into it. the teleportation is a lot simpler, its in the name. the game doesn't generate infinite rooms when you fall through the floor and exit through the ceiling, that will kill your computer in no-time. instead, the portals take your current coordinates during the collision, compares them to the portal orientation and position, sends them as offset to the second portal, and the second portal compares them to the world, which means, you go in a corner of a portal, you come out in the same corner of the portal, but in the other portal's coordinates.\n\nall of this comment seems very complicated and chunky. but trust me, its just teleportation engineering!\n\nthanks a lot to you if you enjoyed reading my comment and hope you purchased the game, if you want a simpler and more compact explanation in voice, ill recommend
